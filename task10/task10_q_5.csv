We used the CDC Public Health Preparedness Capabilities (PHEP Capabilities) framework and definitions as the basis for characterizing the public health activities carried out in response to the hazard [22] . The response activities are the first of our two primary outcome variables. The Capabilities framework identifies and defines 15 types of services that public health systems might be expected to deliver during emergencies. We deviated from this framework for the purpose of data collection in three key ways. First, we added four categories that emerged as important public health response activities through previous related work and pilot-testing but that are not emphasized in the PHEP Capabilities document. These categories included: environmental investigations, evacuation, consulting subject matter experts, and assessing medical and public health response capacity. Second, we eliminated the ''preparedness'' category from the list of public health response activities included in the interview since pilot-testing proved it was a confusing concept in the context of a specific response effort. Finally, we collected ''other'' activities that participants felt were important aspects of the response that had not otherwise been captured in the interview. Interviewers described each of the 19 response activity categories (14 original PHEP Capabilities, four additional categories, and an ''other public health response activity'' category) and asked participants to indicate whether any related activities were initiated during the response to their selected event. Additionally, participants were asked to identify which of the response activities were ''absolutely necessary to the overall response.'' A summary score was calculated by summing the total number of public health response activities initiated during an event (between 0 and 19 activities).",42.326038097647995,19.886290195939797

The second outcome of interest is the public health response system, which we define as all entities who contributed to public health response activities for a given event. For each of the public health activities initiated during a response, participants were asked to identify the organizations and agencies that contributed to that activity, including their own organization. A list of 41 organization types was developed once all interviews were completed based on participants' qualitative responses. The categorization of organizations was based on the descriptions of the public health system in the literature and expert opinion, using organizational function as the basis for classification [16, [23] [24] [25] . Three measures were developed from these data. The first measure, ''any involvement'', is a dichotomous variable that indicates whether entities from each of the 41 organizational categories contributed to any of the 19 public health response activities. The second measure, ''relative contribution'', is a weighted measure that summarizes, for each event, the number of response activities for which an organization type contributed, compared to the total number of response activities performed during that event. Therefore, for each event in which a specific organization type had any involvement, the ''Relative Involvement'' for an organization type was calculated as:",33.37781991218059,18.85306211689199

This study serves as a starting point for the development of evidencebased forecasts of public health system response behavior that will help shape researchers' and practitioners' expectations for public health activity during urgent events and identify situations in which a governmental public health response has deviated from these expectations. Such deviations or ''surprises'' can provide opportunities to improve and update our understanding of response performance by pointing either to a lack of sophistication in our predictive models, adaptive response behaviors or promising practices that could be applied in other situations to beneficial effect, or unnecessary variation associated with inefficiencies that may affect the health of a community or the reputation of public health agencies.",32.30958321262407,14.602337834230589

First, our results demonstrate that public health response systems are adaptive to the nature of the threat. Our study response profiles reveal differential activationin both number and type -of functions and partners based on the type of incident. For example, we found that the public health response to severe weather events involved a much larger and more diverse set of organization systems when compared to infectious disease events. Within the field of public organization theory, these non-infectious disease systems would be expected to elicit a number of predictable challenges to effective communication and coordination [30, 31] . With a more explicit recognition of these complex systems, researchers and practitioners may be able to better able to predict associated challenges, their consequences, and strategies for avoiding critical failure points during urgent events. Second, our study system profiles also provide an indication of the frequency and circumstances with which particular organizations might become involved in public health response activities -information that is of the greatest importance when developing and fostering relationships with potential partners in the community. We found that some entities are likely to take part in a public health response of any nature, including public health agencies, healthcare providers, and members of the general public, whereas many other organizations are either infrequently involved in public health responses or typically have a role only under specific event circumstances. The American Red infectious disease events (top box), 100% of events involved epidemiology and surveillance (Activity A), and in 82% of events this activity was felt to be essential. The activities are ordered by five functional domains: investigation, disease control and prevention, information and incident management, surge management, and community resilience. Technological emergencies, complex events, and anticipated events are excluded from this figure due to small sample size. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0079457.g003 Figure 4 . Public health response system profiles, by event type. Figure 4a shows the public health response system profile for each of six different types of events, displayed as separate bar charts, key provided in Figure 4b . For a given event type, the green vertical bars show the proportion of events that involved each of the 41 defined response partners. For example, within infectious disease events (top box), 98% of events involved local public health agencies (Organization Type A). The types of organizations are ordered based on the overall frequency with which they were mentioned, most frequent to least frequent, from left to right. A gray dotted line, at the 50% marker, is included in each bar chart to highlight those organizations involved in more than half of events of that type. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0079457.g004 Cross provides a good example of an organization that was almost universally active in our severe weather and mass casualty events, but rarely took part in infectious disease or bioterrorism events. Furthermore, the partner agencies described in our study, with few exceptions, lent their expertise or resources to a very limited proportion to the overall public health response activities. One interpretation of this finding is that only a fraction of response efforts will be salient to those organizations. Alternatively, this could suggest opportunities for expanded roles of organizations in response efforts. Lastly, we found that the role of public health varied tremendously by type of event. Public health departments were ten times more likely to serve in a lead role for infectious disease events compared to events involving severe weather. Recognizing these response patterns can have an impact on planning and exercising with partner agencies, particularly with respect to setting expectations and developing a mutual understanding about the roles and responsibilities of public health agencies in various situations, an issue that has repeatedly been recognized as an area needing improvement [3, 32] .",31.9595790117912,14.399844427255427

However, the evidence base for how to achieve this priority has lagged behind. There is still little agreement on how to measure, let alone improve, public health response performance [3, 4] . A number of challenges have been cited as barriers to research advancement in this field, including: the infrequent nature of large-scale public health emergencies [3, [5] [6] [7] , the heterogeneity of emergency events and of public health delivery structures [3, 6] , the challenges with access to incident leadership during real-world emergencies [7] , the limited ability for standardized surveys to measure complex agency and system processes [6] , and the difficulty of identifying a comparison group or constructing a counterfactual of what might have occurred if particular public health interventions had not taken place [8, 9] . As a result, outside of statistical modeling, researchers have often been limited in their use of statistical methods to test hypotheses, reach generalizable conclusions, and isolate factors that are likely to have the greatest impact on response capacity [8, 10] . Additionally, because catastrophic events are infrequent, the majority of the measurement literature in this field has focused on preparedness rather than on response --on identifying and measuring the inputs to preparedness rather than the variations in response performance. What is known about public health emergency response is largely derived from simulated emergencies (e.g. exercises or drills), with a primary focus on bioterrorism or pandemic influenza [3] . By relying on an evidence base that draws from a narrow set of threats, we run the risk of overemphasizing the capabilities and resources required for those incidents while neglecting those that may be essential in other scenarios [11] .

In this study, we interviewed representatives from more than 120 local health departments regarding their recent experiences with real-world acute public health incidents, such as infectious disease outbreaks, severe weather events, chemical spills, and bioterrorism threats. We collected highly structured data on key aspects of the incident and the public health response, particularly focusing on the public health activities initiated and community partners engaged in the response efforts.

Genomic data about individuals (their genomic 'fingerprint') might be consulted when decisions about prevention and treatment are considered; for example, which vaccine formulation is appropriate, which drugs are likely to be most effective, and what dosage over what period of time. Genomic data about individuals and groups might be consulted during disease outbreaks, in planning for public health programs, or in developing new or assessing existing public health policies; for instance, where are the hotspots for infection (and are these associated with specific pathogen or host genomics), where should vaccines be deployed most urgently, which therapies should be offered to which genomic populations, and where should treatment programs, isolation policies or public health control programs be implemented to halt the spread of infections? Genetic markers of infectivity or likelihood of being a super-spreader could be used to justify quarantine and isolation policies, with the concomitant implications for individual liberty.

The Chinese Health Inspection Authority (HIA), a relatively independent organization functioning at each administrative level (provincial, municipal, and county), was mandated to conduct 11 health inspection functions to maintain efficient public health and medical services. These functions include issuing health permit, conducting health supervision and inspection, health testing and evaluation, case investigation, complaint handling, managing public health crisis, monitoring and safeguarding public health at major public events, enforcing supervision and inspection compliance, public health education, information management, and team training and management. Since the reform of the health inspection system by the Ministry of Health in 2000, the HIA underwent a series of changes and transitions. This study aimed to describe and assess the five factors that were considered to be important for meeting service delivery objectives of the HIA in the People's Republic of China. Methods: A total of 604 HIAs, sampled across three geographical regions of China at three administrative levels, participated in a cross-sectional survey conducted in 2013. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the status of mandated operations, manpower, revenue and expenditures, and institutional infrastructure. Differences in these characteristics across the geographical regions and administrative levels were compared. Results: On average, the HIAs had not fully implemented the 11 mandated functions at any administrative levels. Governmental financial allocations were the main sources of revenue. Three primary personnel employment models coexisted and most employed the quasi-civil service employment model. The institutional infrastructure did not meet governmental mandated standards with respect to building area or the number and types of equipment available to conduct key functions. Conclusions: In 2012, the majority of the HIAs in China at the provincial, municipal, and county levels did not meet the mandated requirements, although positive indications toward meeting these requirements were observed. It is necessary for the government to pay more attention to institutional resources (buildings, equipment, and the level of the staff's educational attainment) and ensure that the HIAs can meet their service delivery objectives.",22.80570440505457,9.436823603064608

If these outbreaks had been prevented, the avoided losses would have averaged US $6.7 billion per year [14] . The wide-rangingand often substantial -economic impacts of epidemics are increasingly recognized far beyond the health sector. Yet few studies apply a One Health or multi-sectoral lens to consider costs and benefits of prevention versus response effort during planning exercises to ensure optimization of resources. With recent zoonotic disease prioritization exercises being conducted under the Global Health Security Agenda, countries have an opportunity to consider the focus and scope of their investments. Where possible, investments should seek to strengthen overall human, animal and environmental health systems for multi-hazard preparedness and broad societal benefits. Availability of quantitative impact data has been noted as limited for important livestock diseases, and differing methodologies result in estimates that are not comparable across and even within countries [12, 48, 50] ; the findings of our review are consistent with this and also suggest that impacts of human health emergencies from infectious disease are significant but reporting is ad hoc and likely incomplete. Public and private stakeholders at local, national and international levels must work together more systematically to ensure informed systems and risk and impact analysis, and encourage costsharing strategies for prevention and preparedness where possible and assess optimal intervention strategies when necessary.

Exercises provide an opportunity for multiple sectors to practice, test and evaluate their response to all types of public health emergencies. The information from these exercises can be used to refine and improve preparedness plans. There is a growing body of literature about the use of exercises among local, state and federal public health agencies in the United States. There is much less information about the use of exercises among public health agencies in other countries and the use of exercises that involve multiple countries. Results: We developed and conducted 12 exercises (four sub-national, five national, three sub-regional) from August 2006 through December 2008. These 12 exercises included 558 participants (average 47) and 137 observers (average 11) from 14 countries. Participants consistently rated the overall quality of the exercises as very good or excellent. They rated the exercises lowest on their ability to identifying key gaps in performance. The vast majority of participants noted that they would use the information they gained at the exercise to improve their organization's preparedness to respond to an influenza pandemic. Participants felt the exercises were particularly good at raising awareness and understanding about public health threats, assisting in evaluating plans and identifying priorities for improvement, and building relationships that strengthen preparedness and response across sectors and across countries.

What are the hospital infection control issues associated with a SARS outbreak, and what are the most effective approaches to address these issues? What type State and local health departments continue to face unprecedented challenges in preparing for, recognizing, and responding to threats to the public's health. The attacks of 11 September 2001 and the ensuing anthrax mailings of 2001 highlighted the public health readiness and response hurdles posed by intentionally caused injury and illness. At the same time, recent natural disasters have highlighted the need for comparable public health readiness and response capabilities. Public health readiness and response activities can be conceptualized similarly for intentional attacks, natural disasters, and human-caused accidents. Consistent with this view, the federal government has adopted the all-hazards response model as its fundamental paradigm. Adoption of this paradigm provides powerful improvements in efficiency and efficacy, because it reduces the need to create a complex family of situation-specific preparedness and response activities. However, in practice, public health preparedness requires additional models and tools to provide a framework to better understand and prioritize emergency readiness and response needs, as well as to facilitate solutions; this is particularly true at the local health department level.

While successful implementation of these elements of the IHR will require substantial resource expenditures by high-resource countries, it is a legal and moral duty to which wealthy countries bound themselves when joining the IHR. The EVD epidemic has brought broad realization that health systems strengthening will be crucial to realize the benefits of a global community protected against international infectious disease threats.

The current epidemic has supported, if not confirmed, this observation. Previous EVD epidemics, almost all of which occurred in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs) and predominantly in rural areas, have been controlled within 18 weeks, with the largest prior outbreak claiming less than 300 lives. In contrast, the current West African outbreak has now killed more people than all previous EVD outbreaks combined. Whereas WHO generally considers the health infrastructure of involved countries when assessing the risk of a potential public health emergency, this outbreak has revealed that a more granular consideration of risk will be of value. Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia are all recovering from prolonged periods of civic unrest and suffering from decimated health systems with limited human resource capacity and thus demonstrate that all LMICs should not be considered the same. For example, Nigeria, another country broadly characterized as a LMIC, provides a clear illustration of how a functional, albeit limited, public health infrastructure can successfully bring an EVD outbreak under control [6] . The country responded rapidly through efforts in public education, isolation, quarantine, contact tracing, and case identification to control an epidemic after only 20 cases and 8 deaths in a little over a month.",28.138701936231264,14.544938964862798

Although our study design did not permit significant investigations into local-level variations in preparedness [40] , budgetary challenges have been reported before in other contexts at both national and local levels [41] [42] [43] , so it is likely that this challenge is also reflected at local level in at least some of the participating countries.

As outlined in the examples above, EU laboratory networks coordinated by ECDC as well as the European Commission over the last years have brought public health added value through fitforpurpose harmonization and validation of laboratory methods, quality assurance and training activities as well as contribution to preparedness and response for biological threats. The EULabCap surveys concluded that the EU/ EEA as a whole has a strong and improving public health micro biology system (7) . Its key assets include harmonized methods for AST, extensive reference laboratory services, and laboratory inputs within national and EU surveillance networks. The use of molecular typing for surveillance and laboratory participation in outbreak response showed significant progress. In an era of rapid progress in electronic recording and transmission of health data, it is noticeable that half of the EU/EEA countries have implemented automated electronic reporting of microbiology laboratory data to their national communicable disease or antimicrobial resistance surveillance systems (7) . To track the transmission of resistance genes needed for targeted control measures, ECDC has developed a protocol for genomicbased surveillance of carbapenemresistant and/or colistinresistant Enterobacteriaceae at the EU level (56) . To deliver their full potential, these encouraging developments require sustained innovation in molecular diagnostic and typing methods and the collaborative engineering of wider connectivity between laboratory and public health information systems from the local to the global level.

The burden of morbidity and mortality from emergencies and disasters can be severe, resulting in public health systems investing substantial time and resources toward preparedness [1] . The public health system is the lead in responding to outbreaks and in minimizing the impact of diverse emergencies on health [2, 3] . Public health sector activities in infectious disease emergencies include leading other emergency management organizations during outbreaks, conducting surveillance and investigation, implementing control measures, developing guidance for health-care practitioners, and communicating risks [3] . In addition, public health is the lead sector in preparing for the population health effects of non-infectious events incited by natural or anthropogenic hazards. Emergency preparedness levels have been a concern globally in past emergencies; for example, Canada's response to the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak raised a number of issues: lack of surge capacity in the clinical and public health systems, difficulties with timely access to laboratory testing and results, and weak links between public health and the health care system were clear gaps in preparedness [3] . Recognizing complex and system-level challenges that affect emergency preparedness efforts globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) has called for all countries to create resilient integrated systems that can be responsive and proactive to any future threat, although this remains a knowledge gap [4, 5] . While risks vary for different communities, disaster and emergency preparedness is recognized as essential for all nation-states [4, 6] . Local and regional public health agencies aim to mitigate risks and protect population health; however, they face challenges to ensure readiness for potential emergencies ranging widely in likelihood and impact. Further, investments change over time with economic and policy priorities, which can influence the resources available for this purpose.

The all-hazards approach is viewed as essential for public health systemlevel readiness, enabling effective and efficient preparedness that accounts for the difficulty in predicting the type and severity of events [14, 22, 23] . The conventional cycle of emergency management includes four phases which are (1) prevention/mitigation, (2) preparedness, (3) response and (4) recovery; public health agency activities relate to all four phases [24] . In this study, we focus on preparedness as upstream activities and actions that promote enhanced public health system capacity and resilience throughout all four phases. It is important to note that in Canada, PHEP addresses population-level preparedness, distinct from clinical care and health care facility preparedness.

As the 'front door' of the health system, primary care professionals should be involved in planning and action for health emergency risk management. WONCA (the global professional body for family medicine) has actively championed the ways in which primary care can be supported to deliver care during population emergencies. National primary care bodies can coordinate with public health leads to cascade information to practitioners, communicate with the public, and collate health intelligence from the frontline primary care. 8 The Ebola crisis taught us a valuable lesson about what happens when an outbreak takes health workers away from core functions to focus on crisis response; the number of people who died from reduced access to usual care probably exceeded the number killed by the virus. 9 Strong health systems built on comprehensive primary care are able to integrate both functions, disseminating the emergency response resources and information required to community-level staff who have the breadth of training required to manage new suspected cases alongside routine family medicine.

(5, 6) . The GDD Operations Center has a team of six staff and a Director with professionally diverse backgrounds, e.g., human and veterinary medicine, microbiology, and epidemiology, and is situated within dedicated space located within CDC's Emergency Operations Center (EOC), with which we liaise both during GDD Operations Center supported international deployments of CDC teams and also when the EOC is activated to respond to an international disease event. Both official information sources, e.g., ministries of health or agriculture and WHO, as well as unofficial and unverified reports from media sources are reviewed. The latter are verified through a global network of public health professionals. Information sharing is built on trust and an understanding of how to appropriately handle information, particularly when it is not in the public domain and disclosure could harm relationships with partners. Information about disease events also comes from CDC subject matter experts in both the United States and those assigned to programs abroad. We also utilize disease-specific sources, which are particularly useful with regard to pathogens that typically are laboratoryconfirmed prior to reporting (e.g., influenza, polio), and although laboratory confirmation may result in delays, such etiology-specific sources typically are rapid in reporting verified cases. We monitor outbreaks from infectious and non-infectious causes including those attributable to disasters, intoxications, and chemical, radiological, or nuclear releases. We also monitor outbreaks of unknown etiology, many of which are later determined to have an infectious cause. Outbreaks among animals may also come under surveillance for known zoonotic diseases and to assess signals that may herald emerging or re-emerging outbreaks of human disease. Regardless of the type of outbreak or public health event, increased awareness of such an occurrence is critical for rapid public health response.

WHO therefore supports advocacy and awareness and pathogenesis studies and development and deployment of diagnostic tools and therapeutic drugs and vaccines as the pillars of public health response [72] [73] [74] .",35.70077649034875,17.444364851189018

Two quantities that are often used to describe transmission are the basic reproductive number and the distribution of the serial interval (SI). The basic reproductive number (R 0 ) is the average number of secondary cases a primary case will infect, assuming a completely susceptible population [1] . The reproductive number is always nonnegative; values less than one are indicative of an outbreak that will not continue to grow in the absence of imported cases. When R 0 is larger than one, the magnitude of the value guides the types of control measures that are necessary to restrict transmission and control the outbreak. It is also essential to understand the timing between primary and secondary cases. For a given R 0 , if secondary cases occur shortly after the primary cases, a rapidly growing outbreak will result, which can be more difficult to control than an outbreak with a longer time interval between cases. The timing of the secondary cases is most easily measured by the SI distribution, an observable quantity. The SI is defined as the time between symptom onset in successive cases in a chain of backward transmission. The SI is used as a surrogate measure for the generation interval, which is unobservable, and is defined as the time between consecutive infections in the chain of transmission [2] . R 0 and the SI distribution provide important information that is used to initiate an appropriate public health response to an infectious disease outbreak.",23.981335081173114,14.674526138235723

Research clearly indicates that there are a multitude of assessments in China. First, assessments are divided according to purpose, i.e., formative and summative assessments. For example, the evaluation of Yunnan Province's emergency health response capability and core competence assessment index system at district-level control institutions was performed to guide and advance the progress of assessment targets as well as to provide a formative evaluation of management decisions. On the other hand, in Fujian Province, the study is concerned with the state of performance appraisals regarding public health emergencies and other issues, including formulating (such as plan completion rate, emergency material reserve rate, simulation exercises) overall judgments on the purposes of evaluation institutions, including accountability and summative assessment. Second, health emergency management assessment is divided into several stages, including the preparation stage (i.e., pre-emergency evaluation), the disposal stage, the in-process evaluation, and the recovery stage (i.e., post-emergency evaluation). Thus, a preliminary discussion on the early warning index system for influenza outbreaks, the construction of an evaluation index system for hospital nurses' public health emergency response capacity, a weighted analysis of emergency public health emergency response evaluation factors, and the evaluation of emergency drill activities in county-level disease control institutions in Nanchang City are all examples of pre-assessment. In contrast, social vulnerability assessments and analyses of significant factors associated with major infectious diseases are concerned with the assessment of the nature, the type, the extent, and the determining factors of public health emergencies, while epidemiological characteristics studies and normative disposal third-party assessments are all considered post-event assessments that focus on recovery, summarizing, and long-term impact. Third, emergency management work assessment can be divided according to health status, i.e., normal and abnormal assessment. For example, the analysis and the evaluation of the present state of affairs of health emergency work in Qinghai Province was a normal assessment of the state of daily management construction, whereas the comprehensive evaluation of public health emergency implementation in the Fujian Province in 2014 was an assessment of the process and the impact of the emergency response. Fourth, assessment is divided according to the evaluation implementation body, i.e., internal and external evaluation. For example, the evaluation of the public health emergency response capacity of F hospital in Qiqihar City was an internal investigation conducted by an investigation team composed of health emergency management agencies and workers. On the other hand, investigating the epidemiological characteristics of public health emergencies and standard treatment third-party assessments are surveys that involve external evaluation from experts outside the health emergency management and work organization.",26.45524315160942,10.827080616159748

Consequently, the lack of funding in public health has resulted in limitations in technical capacity and insufficient human resources in disease control and prevention to meet the challenge of potential emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases outbreaks [23] . Whilst China's comprehensive county-to-national level network CDC surveillance and reporting system has been reported as being one of the best in the world [7] , greater effort is required to improve the infectious disease surveillance infrastructure. In urban areas infectious disease surveillance infrastructure has received, and continues to receive, financial support from local governments. However, maintenance and update of disease surveillance in county-level rural areas has relatively been neglected, leading to a regional imbalance between urban and rural areas [7] . Furthermore, despite the relative supremacy of urban disease surveillance infrastructure over its rural counterpart, it still has some limitations. In urban areas, for instance, most public health resources are concentrated in tertiary hospitals and central public health departments, while disease surveillance infrastructure in community-level health service centers needs to be strengthened. Better pathogen-based surveillance infrastructure for disease detection in urban areas and a more rapid response to infectious disease outbreaks is needed to ensure the risks of transmission are minimized in areas of high population density [16] . It is imperative, therefore, that initiatives and actions to maintain and update rural disease surveillance infrastructure be taken, whilst concomitantly reinforcing and optimizing urban disease surveillance infrastructure.",25.81930184694162,12.812084485254793

At the outset, mass-gathering events provide challenging settings to plan a suitable emergency public health response. Published studies basically talk about retrospective reviews, case studies of the public health preparedness, or health care provided at individual events. Developing an understanding of the variables associated with MGs is the first step for public health managers. Risk assessment (RA) is a crucial part of pre-event planning as it helps foresee potential risks. Based on RA, one can develop preventive measures and ensure that the infrastructure to control the potential problems is in place. This study is an attempt to systemize RA process during MG events in a country that is culturally rich but with poor resources to handle such events. A RA tool will be developed for planning and management of religious MG events of India. Methods/design: Various strategies will be used to develop the risk assessment tool (RA tool). Extensive review of literature clubbed with key informant interviews will be done in order to identify the risk variables and decide the domains and items of the tool. Further, this tool will be developed as a mobile-based application. The feasibility of the mobile-based RA tool will be tested in real-time MG event in one part of the country.

A well-focused and calibrated public health response to an epidemic can save lives and money. The West Africa Ebola epidemic is set to become a notorious case study of the consequences of under-reaction, whereas the early response to the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic is widely considered to have been an over-reaction [13] . Many aspects of an appropriate public health response are dependent on high-quality data and samples from patients. For example, reliable illness severity data are required to predict the number of infected and ill people and then scale the response appropriately; groups at high risk for infection or poor prognosis need to be identified for targeted preventative and treatment interventions; genetic sequencing of pathogens from biological samples can provide critical information on transmission pathways, evolutionary pressures and drug resistance; and the characterisation of immunological responses is a prerequisite for developing the laboratory tools for critical sero-epidemiologic and vaccine immunogenicity studies.

Third, planning and implementing changes for pandemic influenza across the health system is complex.

Substantial autochthonous circulation in Italy, Iran and South Korea has been reported by now, while there is increasing evidence that subclinical infections occur and people may be infectious before symptoms appear [8] [9] [10] . These developments indicate that the window of opportunity to contain and eradicate is rapidly narrowing. [11] . Therefore, it is needless to state that for each phase in the control and mitigation of a novel emerging pathogen, adequate laboratory preparedness and response are crucial. The readiness survey that we performed served the important purpose of mapping the initial response capacities in Europe and identifying barriers to diagnostic implementation. Therefore, we maintain that the urgent implementation and monitoring of diagnostic capacities and capabilities for SARS-CoV-2 in Europe is proportional to the containment and expected mitigation phase of the global public health response and is critical for care of local patients. The implementation of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics does not replace nor exclude diagnostic capacity for other respiratory viruses. Moreover, it explicitly does not disregard the importance of other seasonal respiratory pathogens for public and patient health. This is clearly illustrated by the authors themselves, who indicate that they have tested thousands of samples of patients suspected of respiratory viral disease not only for common respiratory pathogens but also for SARS-CoV-2. The fact that Colson et al. found a wide range of seasonal respiratory viruses indeed underlines the impact of such pathogens. Furthermore, it clearly shows that diagnosis of respiratory viruses cannot be done syndrome-based and supports the need for the availability of diagnostics for a panel of pathogens including SARS-CoV-2.",23.414557369752693,13.060719733706502

Example structures may include coalitions, public-private partnerships, integrated data systems, multi-sector planning bodies, and community advisory boards. A clear need for such structures was demonstrated in the response to the 11 September terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, where problems arose when organizations, designed to carry out stand-alone programs, exhibited a reluctance to share confidential information [22] . This resulted in multiple organizations requesting information from grieving families who had already supplied it to another organization as well as lost time figuring out whether federal agencies or other levels of government had the best data for various purposes. On the contrary, some of the most successful activities during that recovery rested on years of relationship and trust building, including an unusual alliance between the media and emergency operations center which allowed for clear and quick communication on recovery to be coalesced and released through several media outlets [22] .

We estimated Ebola cases in three scenarios: a delayed response, a Liberia-like response, and a fast response scenario.

Our results underscore the importance of rapid detection and initiation of an effective, organized response, and the challenges faced by countries with limited public health systems. Actionable lessons for strengthening local public health systems in countries at high risk of disease transmission include increasing health personnel, bolstering primary and critical healthcare facilities, developing public health infrastructure (e.g. laboratory capacity), and improving disease surveillance. With stronger local public health systems infectious disease outbreaks would still occur, but their rapid escalation would be considerably less likely, minimizing the impact of public health threats such as Ebola.

Objective: This paper examines recent trends regarding public health legal preparedness for emergencies and discusses its role in the recent Ebola outbreak. Design: A rigorous literature review was conducted using eight electronic databases as well as Google Scholar. The results encompassed peer-reviewed English articles, reports, theses, and position papers dating from 2011 to 2014. Earlier articles concerning regulatory actions were also examined. Results: The importance of PHLP has grown during the past decade and focuses mainly on infectionÁdisease scenarios. Amid LMICs, it mostly refers to application of international regulations, whereas in developed states, it focuses on independent legislation and creation of conditions optimal to promoting an effective emergency management. Among developed countries, the United States' utilisation of health legal preparedness is the most advanced, including the creation of a model comprising four elements: law, competencies, information, and coordination. Only limited research has been conducted in this field to date. Nevertheless, in both developed and developing states, studies that focused on regulations and laws activated in health systems during emergencies, identified inconsistency and incoherence. The Ebola outbreak plaguing West Africa since 2014 has global implications, challenges and paralleling results, that were identified in this review.

Methods: We used a stratified randomized sample survey to examine HII workers' knowledge of their own duties concerning PHE response in 17 facilities in Heilongjiang, a province in northeastern China. Data were collected from May to July 2010 using a 9-item combined question inquiring about the workers' statutory duties. Results: Of 348 administered surveys, 309 were returned for an overall response rate of 88.8 %. Overall, the correct recognition rate of PHE responsibilities was low. Some HII workers were confused about their responsibilities required by law, regulations, and emergency response plans. A quarter of all the respondents had the lowest knowledge for PHE responsibilities. Factors influencing their perceptions of responsibilities were department, work experience in a CDC, and PHE response experience. Conclusions: To improve preparedness for a PHE, efforts are needed to train, support, and monitor the workers' knowledge and competencies in PHEs as part of an organizational change; the worker's knowledge of their responsibilities should be measured and used as an indicator of preparedness for a PHE, and training should be undertaken where there are deficiencies.

The results of this survey provide some insight into the current state of perceived pandemic preparedness among a cohort of GPs in one part of the United Kingdom. Internationally, support for our results is provided by studies examining GPs' views regarding their role and practice preparedness in responding to public health emergencies in general including SARS and other biothreats such as pandemic influenza [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] .

As a consequence of the problems of coordination and communication associated with the public health response by the city of Toronto and the governments of Ontario and Canada, Health Canada established a National Advisory Committee on SARS and Public Health chaired by Dr. David Naylor of the University of Toronto. The mandate of the Naylor Committee went beyond recommendations on how to organize responses to infectious diseases crises in the future to providing directional recommendations on the future of public health in Canada. Influenced by the coordinating function of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States, the Naylor Committee recommended the establishment of a national public health agency in Canada (Health Canada, 2003) .

Many experts noted that this uncertainty requires the modification of many existing disaster response plans. These concerns also were supported by our literature review, which found high rates of emotional distress and behavioral changes stemming from those events that included uncertainty about exposure. Furthermore, in a bioterrorist event, the lag between exposure and the development of symptoms may exacerbate this uncertainty. Inaccurate knowledge about the organism involved may also hamper response plans and should be addressed by public health education programs. For example, for months after the anthrax attacks, many Americans were still not sure whether anthrax was contagious, despite media announcements that it was not (Blendon et al. 2002; Lisa Meredith, personal communication, February 13, 2003) . The public and the health care community should be given basic knowledge of the organisms likely to be used in a bioterrorist event and the planned public health response (Ferguson et al. 2003) . Such efforts would remove some of the uncertainty among the public and first responders and would begin to define some of the risk/benefit issues with regard to a response. One component of response plans about which we know very little is how the behavior of those responsible for coordinating and conducting an effective public health response would be affected by uncertainty about exposure. Not only could these persons be at risk as a result of their professional activities, but in a number of scenarios their families also might be at risk. The actions of the first responders and health care professionals cannot be taken for granted. One survey of physicians reported that more than half would not be willing to put themselves at risk of contracting a deadly illness in order to save the lives of others in the event of a bioterrorist attack (Alexander and Wynla 2003) , and fewer than half of emergency department physicians surveyed were willing to get the smallpox vaccine (Kwon et al. 2003) .

Global viral diversity is substantial, but viruses that have a low public health burden or cause negligible agricultural damage tend to receive little to no attention. However, viral evolution, spillover events, or changes in hosts can turn seemingly unimportant viruses into biosecurity threats or public health emergencies. Case in point, the scientific community had limited information or awareness of ZIKV when the World Health Organization (WHO) identified it as a public health emergency in February 2016. We know that the emergence of a new pathogen can be caused by changes in human population distributions and behaviors, land use and biodiversity shifts, climate change, international trade, and changes in vector or reservoir host ecology (Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria 2005; Morse et al. 2012; Woolhouse et al. 2014) .

The statute itself contains no suggestion that its obligations would vary in the face of a community-wide emergency; nevertheless, when such events began to seem more likely, concerns and questions arose. 62 Although it reiterated to some extent the continued application of EMTALA's obligations, the 2001 CMS letter suggested that there was an exception to the stabilization requirement if a community response plan is in place. 63 Moreover, the letter indicated that a hospital's initial screening obligation might be limited if a community-response plan designated certain facilities to handle particular categories of patients in a bioterrorism situation, and if the hospital in question is not such a designated facility. 64 The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 65 articulated a more formal policy regarding EMTALA obligations in an emergency situation.

In contrast, the revised IHR reflected a blended approach with reporting to WHO required for certain diseases of known risk (including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and new sub-types of human influenza); and assessment of risk using a decision instrument contained in the IHR required for some other diseases of known risk, (including pneumonic plague, cholera, yellow fever, and Ebola), 'that have demonstrated the ability to cause serious public health impact and to spread rapidly internationally'. It should be noted that Ebola, a 'known' disease with which there is some previous experience, and which is listed in the IHR, nevertheless caught the international community by surprise with the scale of the recent outbreak in West Africa, highlighting the fact that even with the revised IHR in place, the international community still struggles to respond effectively to global public health emergencies caused by known infectious diseases. The third approach encompasses, to borrow from Lakoff, the vigilance approach required of an unknowable future event by requiring reporting to WHO of 'any event of potential international public health concern'. 20 16 Although the revised IHR require countries to report certain public health events within their territory in accordance with the IHR, 21 the 2005 revisions also allow WHO to take account of reports from other sources of events that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern. 22 In doing so however, WHO must request verification of any such reports from the affected country, and offer to collaborate with the affected country in assessing the event and the adequacy of the control measures. 23 This potential for WHO to take account of other sources of information about disease outbreaks or other possible public health emergencies allows information from NGOs, media reports, and social media to inform decision-making about possible global public health emergencies. 24 Importantly, this development moves the revised IHR beyond a binary WHO-country relationship, thus reflecting the multiplicity of actors inherent in the crowded landscape of contemporary global health. 25 As Davies and Youde argue, the changes in the revised IHR 'introduce a host of new eyes and ears to keep watch and hold governments accountable for their response to public health emergencies'. 26 Informal reports of disease outbreaks and analysis of social media not only potentially provide some early warning of unusual events, but also make it more difficult for states to hide disease outbreaks, 27 adding new dimensions to risk for states experiencing emerging public health crises from infectious diseases, given the potential for other countries to impose trade or travel restrictions in response to perceived risk. 28 In this context, there are complex relationships between informal and state-based reporting, and engagement by the state with the public. 29 In addition, widespread use of the internet and social media also opens new possibilities for what has been termed 'digital participatory surveillance' in which citizens and volunteers report on disease, thus supplementing traditional disease surveillance mechanisms. 30 Finally, of course the traditional media may influence perceptions of risk by the general public through the media's coverage of public health emergencies. 31 The need for flexibility and an approach premised on unknowable risk has been evident in the evaluations of preparedness for and responses to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. Although there was considerable work globally and nationally in the 21 ibid art 6. 22 ibid art 9. 23 ibid art 10. See also Ottersen, Hoffman and Groux (n 8) at 363. 24 early-mid 2000s to plan and prepare for an influenza pandemic, much of the preparation was for a pandemic caused by the more lethal H5N1 avian influenza virus. 32 Thus, although a pandemic was declared by WHO in 2009 in response to the H1N1 influenza virus, the relative mildness of the disease when compared to the H5N1 virus presented challenges for WHO and for individual countries in adapting their responses during the pandemic in light of evolving information about risk. 33 In response to this, WHO's revised pandemic guidance adopted a more flexible, all hazards approach 34 which has been reflected in updated preparedness plans at the national level. 35 Recognition of the gradations of risk is also evident in the recent recommendation by the Interim Ebola Panel Report for an 'intermediate level' in the declaration of a public health emergency of international concern. As the Report noted, under the current IHR 'there is either a PHEIC or there is not', 36 with the recommendation for consideration to be given to 'the possibility of an intermediate level that would alert and engage the wider international community at an earlier stage in a health crisis'. 37 Because only PHEICs (along with the IHRs) have any real normative status under international law, 38 this may also promote public understanding of the array of other functions and responsibilities of WHO in coordinating international management of potential pandemic episodes. 39 Furthermore, expert committees appointed to consider the global response to the Ebola outbreak have recommended considerable strengthening of WHO's capacity to respond to global public health emergencies. 40 This evolution in the conceptualisation of risk recognises the considerable uncertainty that exists in relation to new and emerging infectious diseases and the need for preparedness and response capacity to be flexible and adaptable. designed to empower international leadership (from the WHO) to facilitate coordinated international preparedness for and response to pandemic events. However, commentators have been unflattering of WHO's record of achievement in managing recent international health emergencies, including delays in responding to Ebola in West Africa in 2014, and a perceived over-reaction to H1N1 (swine flu) in 2009-10, 41 leading to suggestions for reform of WHO and global health governance more generally. 42 While the speedy communication and collaboration fostered by the IHRs is credited with enabling a very rapid response to fellow passengers exposed to a MERS carrier on a flight, 43 others are critical of their current adequacy, 44 while common responses such as airport border screening have been panned as ineffective, 45 at least on any scientific basis (what it does for public confidence is another matter). Interestingly, the WHO response to Zika reflects a more proactive response to emerging risk, particularly in the wake of criticisms of its slow response to Ebola, 46 with WHO declaring the cluster of cases of microcephaly to be a PHEIC even before the causal link between Zika and microcephaly was established. 47 As conceptualisations of risk and infectious diseases have broadened to encompass currently unknown risks, so too has there been a broader approach to the sources of risk. The increasing contributions to emerging disease threats stemming from rising population, urbanisation, de-forestation and other environmental pressures, 48 has put the spotlight on diseases such as Ebola, or swine and bird flu, where the pathogen originated in non-human populations. One consequence has been a broadening of the planning horizon to incorporate paying attention to the ecological context of such diseases. Indeed some commentators argue that current pandemic preparedness plans are too narrow, calling for a more holistic ecological 'one-health' response embracing anthropological, ecological, and veterinary dimensions, 49 When the Ebola outbreak in West Africa erupted in the spring of 2014, the global health community was ill prepared to cope. There were no vaccines, no treatments, few diagnostics, and insufficient medical teams and trained responders. 51",25.730177059741536,12.029079579552114

Despite an early belated response by governmental officials, aggressive quarantine and other public health measures demonstrated the effectiveness of classic methods of tracking cases and their contacts as an effective means of curtailing disease spread. The Chinese research community rapidly demonstrated that SARS-CoV originated from animals and that the open markets were likely sources of future disease outbreaks (Guan et al., 2003) . The closing of the animal markets has played a key role in tempering the scope and duration of SARS and will likely serve to temper the severity and scope of future outbreaks. Using epidemiology, molecular genetics and genome sequencing strategies, a detailed catalogue of the key genomic changes that contributed to disease emergence and spread have been identified and cataloged for future research (Consortium, 2004) .

Under standing these trade-offs is important for planning the public health response to COVID-19, because if the survival of patients who are infected is sufficiently sensitive to declines in the health-care labour force, then school closures might increase deaths.

If we are to assess the adequacy of our legal frameworks for pandemic preparedness, we also need to assess the adequacy of our laws in terms of their suitability for meeting our international obligations. While developed countries of the world already have sophisticated public health systems, the capacity to meet their obligations under the IHR (2005), and the financial resources to develop national vaccine stockpiles, the developing countries of the world face a very different outlook. 57 As we consider the intersections of law and public health in the context of the shared global risks of an influenza pandemic, it is important to realize that pandemic preparedness must necessarily involve improved international cooperation and the sharing of expertise to assist in capacity building for public health and the regulatory frameworks surrounding it, as well as a renewed dialogue around international obligations to help the world's poorest and least healthy people. 58 Legal analysis must be a key part of our planning for pandemic influenza. It is essential that federal and state laws are harmonized so as to ensure their smooth functioning and to eliminate crossjurisdictional differences and uncertainties. Public health laws also play a key role in setting out the rights and responsibilities of individuals, communities and governments, providing transparency and accountability to the frameworks for decision-making.

But Capt. Chmiel said local health authorities have 'certain powers to quarantine people.'"" 46 Political, economic, social, and ethical issues are always being raised by these strategic measures. Individual rights have often been trampled in the name of public good. The liberty of outwardly healthy persons from lower classes has frequently been violated by isolating or segregating persons suspected of being infected. Marginalized groups of different ethnicities and races have been stigmatized and discriminated against. Quarantine has a line of continuity from the time of plague to the influenza A pandemic in 2009. 46 During plague and cholera outbreaks, the fear of discrimination and mandatory quarantine pushed the lowest social class and minorities to flee from affected areas. This contributed to a more rapid and wider spread of the disease as this regularly occurred in towns affected by deadly disease outbreak. In this global world, the fear caused by mass media can spread the disease farther and faster, playing a larger role than in the past. Entire populations or segments of populations are at the risk of being stigmatized. In the light of new challenges posed by twenty-first century that can lead to the spread of infectious diseases, quarantine, along with other public health tools, retains importance for public health preparedness.

The language of human rights is increasingly part of the landscape for health law in Australia and a See, for example, Public Health Act 1991 (NSW) s 23. internationally. [43] [44] [45] Given the potential for public health laws to impact upon the freedom of individuals, and the need for public health laws to balance the interests of individuals and society, public health laws will ideally have a transparent ethical framework, articulating the principles upon which state intervention will be premised. 46 The World Health Organization has acknowledged the importance of legal and ethical considerations to pandemic preparedness, noting that public health measures such as quarantine, compulsory vaccination and off-licence use of medicines 'need a legal framework to ensure transparent assessment and justification of the measures that are being considered, and to ensure coherence with international legislation (International Health Regulations)'. 47 Consideration of ethical issues is also essential for, as the World Health Organization has noted, ethical issues 'are part of the normative framework that is needed to assess the cultural acceptability of measures such as quarantine or selective vaccination of predefined risk groups'. 48 The exercise of state powers in terms of quarantine, isolation and detention during a public health emergency is likely to be particularly controversial in Western liberal democracies such as Australia. The extent to which the state can and should exercise its powers in this area has become increasingly relevant in public health, as is clear from debates over detention of tuberculosis patients, 49, 50 and from the use of quarantine during the SARS crisis. 51 Although comparable countries to Australia in Europe, the USA and Canada all have human rights charters or equivalents, which could provide procedural protections and safeguards for citizens in relation to quarantine and detention, Australia has yet to develop a Bill of Rights at the federal level. While Australian state and territory governments have begun enacting human rights legislation, 52 there is no comprehensive inclusion of human rights safeguards in the federal Quarantine Act, which raises issues about the mechanisms for ensuring procedural safeguards in the event of a pandemic. 53 Public health measures directed at implementing social distancing, quarantine or travel restrictions will not only infringe on individual liberties that are often taken for granted in Western societies, but are also likely to have a profound economic impact. As outlined above, estimates indicate that pandemic influenza will have a significant impact on the global economy. At local level, businesses may be closed or experience a reduction in their cash flow as public health measures are introduced or people stay home voluntarily. In such an environment, the economic cost to individuals and businesses may be significant, which in turn demands consideration of development of support systems and compensation systems for those affected. 54 In the USA, a great deal of work has been done on strengthening the public health laws, both generally and specifically for public health emergencies. The Turning Point Public Health Statute Modernization National Collaborative developed the Turning Point Model State Public Health Act. 55 In 2001, the Centre for Law and the Public's Health at Georgetown and Johns Hopkins Universities prepared a Model State Emergency Health Powers Act, setting out the powers for a state of public health emergency. The provisions of the earlier Model State Emergency Health Powers Act were adapted and included in the Turning Point Model Act. 56 Article V of the Turning Point Model Act deals with the powers of public health authorities, including the powers of quarantine and isolation. The Model Act provides that the principles to be applied in relation to quarantine and isolation include that they should be by the least restrictive means necessary to prevent the spread of disease (s 5-108[b](1)).

A major drawback for Canadian modelers is the lack of appropriate infrastructure, and this calls for investments from healthcare departments and government organizations that could provide modelers with the impetus to continue development of more realistic models. With regard to models used for pandemic planning, we need to critically evaluate their implications for policy implementation. There are two major reasons underlying this evaluation: first, data are limited and prior to the emergence of a novel pandemic strain, it is not possible to study the epidemiological impact of disease or interventions in a real world environment; second, public health authorities would need to be prepared for all the likely scenarios that could influence the outcome of preparedness strategies. Models, by definition, are not supposed to be perfect; approximations are necessary and predictions are made on this understanding. However, a more important question is how much of the knowledge of Canadian modelers has been employed to support policy decision-making? Is it all based upon experience of other countries? Perhaps in Canada, there has not been much communication between modelers and policymakers and therefore modeling results have not been translated into the context of public health.

One element of this shift has been an increasing recognition of the need to closely integrate public health, acute care and emergency management systems. In the US, this shift has lead to greater collaboration of public health agencies with military, emergency management and law enforcement agencies, 1 and paralleled what has been described as the US' first episode of biopreparedness during the early years of the Cold War. 2 In Canada, the federal response following severe acute respiratory syndrome has been centred around the creation of a national Public Health Agency and its integration into a broader national security plan. 3 Internationally, the World Health Organization has increased efforts at strengthening global public health preparedness and response. 4 This glossary focuses on one of the key concepts in this current shift-that is, preparedness. The core functions of national public health systems have historically included regulatory, surveillance, health protection, health promotion and disaster response activities. 5 Yet, the new global environment in which national public health systems operate has led to a higher profile for preparedness and the capacity of public health systems to be ready for or respond to various types of public health threats, including pandemic influenza, West Nile Virus or bioterrorism. Although fears have been expressed in the US that current preparedness policies will lead to the militarisation of public health and to a public health in reverse, 1 6 it is important to recognise that preparedness policies in other national contexts do not necessarily imply similar implications.

This is achieved through the use of both formal and informal surveillance systems. 5 The threat of bioterrorism has led to the further development of real-time surveillance systems, which is achieved through integrated databases and the immediate or rapid recording of patients' presenting complaints. 37 Monitoring involves the use of enhanced surveillance techniques to investigate the effectiveness of response following an outbreak. 5 (5) Laboratory services are essential for the identification of organisms and environmental agents which affect community health. Since not all local public health agencies have laboratories, it is critical for local agencies to develop formal relationships with public and private laboratories in the community or outside the local jurisdiction, to assure that such services are available if needed. 38 (6) Policy and evaluation activities include the work of public health agencies to develop policy and public health laws.",29.563195424372342,12.387931880338028

An integrated disease surveillance framework has been proposed for rapidly detecting, tracking, and managing public health threats [22] , which contains six functions: data collection, detection, alert and early warning, resource planning, response assessment and evaluation, and investigation and modeling. Another public health emergency response system was proposed as a decentralized model which gives states responsibility for collecting and disseminating all necessary information and co-ordinating surveillance and response [23] . According to this model, systems in different states must be compatible on the basis of common data standards so that the federal government can oversee a national network, and each state should cope with emergencies at a micro-level. In addition, some researchers contended that state and local health departments should build dual-or multiple-use public health information infrastructure [24] , suggesting that the public health information system should be able to respond and detect not only bioterrorism, but also other infectious disease outbreaks, chemical spills or leakages, food and water contamination scenarios, and animal disease outbreaks.",27.748681984770194,11.866366355468594

Investing in this capacity in developing countries is thus increasingly seen as a shared concern within the global community. As a result multilateral and bilateral donors committed a total of US$582 million in loans and grants to buttress the response capacity of developing and middle-income countries. 1 While there is broad agreement on the need for additional funding, there is less clarity on how the funds should be spent. Although the developed world has invested its bioterror-and pandemic-preparedness dollars and euros into building highly specialized emergencyresponse capacity, it is not clear whether this could or should be replicated in the developing world, where public health infrastructure is weak due to years of underinvestment and where there are urgent, competing public health priorities that by necessity take center stage. 2 This article examines the value of a multiple-use approach to emergency preparedness in the develop-ing world-one that aims to build capacity for both emergency preparedness and current core public health activities. Such an approach could offer developing countries an opportunity to strengthen their public health system platforms, allowing them to respond to multiple priority diseases rather than creating specialized programs that will likely be difficult to sustain in the longer term. First, it reviews evidence from developed countries on the impacts of emergency preparedness for bioterrorism and pandemic influenzawhich require similar public health system responseson public health departments and the overall public health system, focusing on investments proven to have substantial collateral impacts on other public health activities. It then explores how similar multiple-use investments could be made in the developing world.",46.26575552790997,20.68300289292507

Yet public health systems in developing countries are underfunded, understaffed, and in many cases struggling to deal with the existing burden of disease. As a result, developed countries are beginning to expand assistance for emergency preparedness to the developing world. Given developing countries' weak infrastructure and many competing public health priorities, it is not clear how to best direct these resources. Evidence from the U.S. and other developed countries suggests that some investments in bioterror and pandemic emergency preparedness, although initially implemented as vertical programs, have the potential to strengthen the general public health infrastructure. This experience may hold some lessons for how global funds for emergency preparedness could be invested in developing countries to support struggling public health systems in responding to current health priorities as well as potential future public health threats.

Significant additional funding to strengthen this capacity followed. In the U.S., the biodefense preparedness budget increased from $294 million in 2001 to $3 billion in the next year and to $5.2 billion in 2004. Of the funds committed since 2001, $3.6 billion was spent on state, local, and hospital preparedness, representing a substantial infusion of new money into public health systems that had seen little new funding in the preceding decade. 16 At the same time, the European Union (EU) established the Health Security Committee to develop a health information system, EU-wide surveillance, a database of the medicines stock, a facility to disseminate medicines and specialists, and health-specific protocols for a coordinated EU response to an attack. 17 By 2006 a growing concern about the possibility of pandemic influenza of avian origin in the U.S. led to an infusion of another $3.8 billion into preparedness activities. 18 The bulk of preparedness budgets in the U.S. was allocated to a range of related health activities intended to respond to acts of bioterror, emerging infectious diseases, and later pandemic influenza. Bioterror and pandemic preparedness investments included the upgrading of disease surveillance, hospital capacity to handle mass casualties, patient isolation systems, laboratory diagnostics for new biologic agents, and the enhancement of command and control structures as well as communication among health and emergency services agencies. 19 Public health officials became concerned that the singular focus on new threats might overshadow the traditional activities of public health departments and hospitals and weaken their ability to tackle existing challenges. 20 -23 Among the negative effects observed was the diversion of staff in hospitals and public health departments from routine activities to meetings and training sessions on preparedness, and reduced attention to nonbioterror-related concerns. Implementing new preparedness activities while maintaining ongoing activities proved to be a challenge. 20, 24 For example, the program to vaccinate health workers against smallpox-one of the most prominent bioterror-preparedness activitiescaused many health departments to defer or cancel other core public health activities, because of the burden of program work and the required monitoring for adverse effects. 17, 25 While infectious disease response may have received a boost from preparedness funding, chronic disease programs lost ground because of the diversion of managers' attention. 20 -22 However, not all preparedness funding was earmarked restrictively, and health managers were able to direct some of the preparedness funding to investments such as infrastructure-human resources and communication-which proved to have multiple uses. 19, 21 As described below, these investments were found to improve both the general functioning of public health departments and hospitals and their ability to handle traditional health threats (Table 1) .",42.86344322293115,18.778744608712092

Thus, the unique geospatial characteristics of specific originating locations and regions need to be identified to accurately assess risk and develop effective response plans for point of entry interventions. For example, if a rapidly unfolding outbreak were taking place in Central America, it would make sense to anticipate higher need for public health resources focused on direct flights coming to the U.S. from high-volume contributors such as Managua and Guatemala City. Although other passengers from Central America may come to the U.S. via connecting flights, these travelers would be so low in number as to present minimal risk, and to expend resources to address them initially may divert from more effective efforts with the bulk of travelers arriving on direct flights at a few U.S. locations. Our analysis of 2009 flight data revealed that, by volume, the airports most affected by flights from Central This approach seems intuitive, but others have observed that this risk-based, targeted approach to bolstering surveillance and response capacities at key airports has been the exception rather than the norm, and that careful planning for public health response at key points of entry can be more effective than the usual first response of implementing travel restrictions. 13, 41, 47 In light of current global economic uncertainties and the overall decline of resources for public health in the U.S. and other countries, current planning and future point of entry interventions for global disease outbreaks must optimize the resources that are available, quickly and accurately assess risks and prioritize efforts to maximize impact of intervention efforts. 48 The ""node-to-node"" approach embodied in our model will allow public health officials to preserve resources for longer-term, community-based mitigation and prevention activities by targeting response to those points of entry likely to be affected earliest.",29.75598548097562,12.466459846348592

Following this event, additional resources in IPAC and public health were instituted in Canada to improve preparedness for managing highconsequence pathogens (9, 10) . The key differences in preparedness and capacities at our hospital between SARS and COVID-19 epidemics are summarized in Table 1 . 7 Additional lessons learned were applied in the management of this patient with COVID-19. First, we did not rely on a specific dedicated team, but instead built on IPAC capacities already in place among our usual staffing model that includes baseline preparedness of management of novel high-consequence pathogens. This approach differed from SARS as well as Ebola in 2014, where many hospitals developed dedicated teams to care for these patients, which required significant investments in human resources and training (11) . In the aftermath of those epidemics, this approach was difficult to sustain for hospitals resulting in loss of preparedness. Second, what allows our hospital to maintain baseline preparedness for novel high-consequence pathogens is that our standard PPE for managing these patients only includes components that are already familiar to our HCWs. This decision was made based on evidence demonstrating that additional PPE complexity is associated with risks of self-contamination during doffing (12) . This approach is also consistent with prior evidence from SARS-CoV-1 suggesting that transmission occurs by the droplet or contact route (13) . Finally, we instituted administrative controls for preventing super-spreading events around AGMP (3, 8) . While our patient did not end up requiring any AGMP, coordinated communication and planning was in place to ensure these would be performed in a controlled fashion to minimize HCW risk.",28.521296389669878,12.639371105750149

In a disease outbreak, all are at risk. We have learned that the global surveillance and response system is only as strong as its weakest links, and in an increasingly globalized world, a disease threat in one country is a threat to us all. Shared vulnerability means shared responsibility and therefore requires sharing of resources, and sharing of information' (Theme 5) (World Health Organization, 2015a). Those familiar with the public health ethics literature will recognize the centrality of solidarity as a central value in public health and to pandemic preparedness and response in particular (Kenny et al., 2010; Prainsack and Buyx, 2011; Dawson and Jennings, 2012; National Collaborating Centre for Public Health Policy, 2015; Thompson et al., 2015) . After SARS (and surely before as well), it was recognized that pandemics can challenge conventional ideas of national sovereignty, and that traditional values of selfinterest must be suppressed in order to protect global health (Kotalik, 2005; The Lancet, 2007; World Health Organization, 2007a; Có rdova-Villalobos et al., 2009; Kenny et al., 2010; Buse and Martin, 2012) . Indeed, very similar language to that found in the Ebola 'lessons learned' documents has been used to advocate for a shift in the global health paradigm in response to the HIV/ AIDS pandemic ('the movement must continue to innovate and press for a more clearly defined and deeper commitment to shared responsibility and global solidarity among countries and development partners' (Buse and Martin, 2012 : 2)), the SARS crisis ('Protecting global health requires governments around the world to show solidarity and to be open and transparent in the way they carry out health protection responsibilities' (University of Toronto Joint Centre for Bioethics, 2005: 19)) and the 2009-2010 H1N1 influenza pandemic ('An influenza pandemic is an extreme expression of the need for solidarity before a shared threat' (Chan, 2009b) ). The emphasis on the common and collective good that is at risk in pandemics is in fact at the very center of the relational public health ethics perspective (Kenny et al., 2010) . The importance of solidarity has even been translated into guidance for how to actually realize ethical requirements in outbreak preparedness and response, such as for data and tissue sharing during a global infectious disease outbreak (Langat et al., 2011; Crowcroft et al., 2014 ). Yet, regressions on these ethical lessons appear to have occurred with little controversy during the EVD outbreak; travel bans and restrictions, trade restrictions, limited data and resource sharing and other practices geared toward protecting national selfinterest were again adopted rather than accepting shared responsibility (World Health Organization, 2015a). This calls into question whether lessons of solidarity have been, or will be, learned, simply based upon a revived recognition of our shared vulnerability. Rather, the incorporation and realization of solidarity in global public health emergency preparedness and response requires the embodiment of solidarity in the global health paradigm itself. This requires explicit reflection on the ethical parameters and obligations of different global health actors, which must be institutionalized by robust structures and processes for governance and accountability.",25.915799500670786,13.39773514940775

The emergency response has to take into account two different healthcare scenarios. The first relates to managing the disease caused directly by the attack. The second involves dealing with fear, panic, health concerns and other psychological reactions that normally arise in disasters. Because many people will feel at risk before the extent of exposure can be determined, these indirect consequences may pose the greater challenge to authority, acute healthcare and public confidence. After the emergency response, many of these initial health problems may have prolonged consequences. 21 The infrastructure required to respond to an outbreak of infectious diseases is dilapidated in many industrialized countries, having suffered from decades of lack of investment. After the events of September 11th 2001, politicians have devoted enormous amounts of money to the strengthening of public health infrastructure. Thus, the US President has requested billions of dollars for bioterrorism-specific items, such as the manufacture of vaccines and drugs to provide a stockpile of doses sufficient to immunize and cure all US citizens. 22 Other funds have been invested in the general infrastructure, in order to raise the essential public health services to a level of performance that matches the constantly evolving threats. Critical components of that infrastructure include a well-trained workforce, electronic information and communications systems, rapid disease diagnosis and reporting, laboratory capacity, and emergency capability. 17 The law must provide authority, with fair safeguards, to manage property needed to contain a serious health threat. Stocks of medicines, hospital beds and facilities for disposal of corpses, vaccination, testing, physical examination, treatment, isolation, and quarantine may prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Although the vast majority of people probably will comply willingly (because it is in their interests and/or desirable for the common welfare), some compulsory powers are necessary for those who refuse to comply. 17 Although these measures seem necessary, there are those of the opinion that these bioterrorism preparedness programmes have only contributed to a waste of public health resources without evidence of benefit. 23 Of great concern in the halting of the epidemic of fear and panic is the variety of spoofing, hacking and malevolent cyberwar/infowar/psyop Ã activities. 18 Bioterrorism and disaster-related information are likely to come to lay individuals from a variety of sources, from the mass media, public health, and government sources to informal workplace exchanges. The way people understand, remember and integrate the information from all these sources is of great importance, because it will serve as a basis for further decisions and actions. 24 Information should be disseminated according to principles of risk communication, e.g., information should be timely (to avoid damaging rumours and magical thinking about microbes and viruses), uncomplicated (understandable to local 12-year-olds) and empathic (showing understanding of the situation of survivors). 8 Therefore, accurate and transparent information is vital in order to diminish anxiety-provoking speculation and unrealistic fears.

Greater surge capacity in terms of both human workforce and resources at the regional, national and international levels ultimately contributes to a flexible, rapid and effective response. As such, outbreak prevention, preparedness and response must be kept at the top of national and global agendas, and must not slip as it has in recent years. The International Health Regulations, and in particular the capacity to assess, plan and implement preparedness and surveillance measures, internationally and locally, must also be strengthened. Establishing robust health systems and implementing improved surveillance and response systems were identified within these documents as necessary conditions to better protect global health, but it was widely recognized that these steps alone are not sufficient. Fear, panic, denial and mistrust/distrust led to the rejection of public health interventions in many instances during this EVD outbreak. It should not be surprising, then, that the third theme emerging among the lessons is that community engagement and building trust are essential for successful global public health emergency preparedness and response. It was demonstrated that communities were capable of changing their approach to the disease (e.g., burial practices) when involved in planning. The needs of individuals and communities must be placed at the core of outbreak response, and this can only be accomplished by engaging with affected communities at every turn: in prevention, preparedness, response and recovery.",26.984134008705205,11.404274844702933

There is still much work to be done in order to imbue the approach to global public health emergencies with morally justifiable values and ethical directives. This can only occur, though, if we first acknowledge that our failings in the Ebola response were moral failings as a global health community, and that improvements in future outbreaks are predicated on a sea change in the values that undergird our attitude to global public health emergency preparedness and response.

As the name suggests, all-hazards planning seeks to prepare for many different types of hazards, including infectious disease pandemics, hurricanes, bioterrorist attacks, and myriad other threats to public health and safety. This shift from hazard-specific planning reflects a recognition that public health emergency preparedness and response can, at least to some extent, be installed and implemented in a uniform, yet adaptable, manner by establishing baseline capabilities (e.g., sheltering, evacuation) that must exist to effectively prepare for and respond to a multitude of hazards (United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2013). Thus, it seems that the focus on pandemic (influenza) planning has in some respects been expanded in scope through all-hazards planning. While this is a praiseworthy innovation for public health emergency preparedness and response, the all-hazards approach may prove too broad to adequately anticipate and critically evaluate the nuanced ethical considerations that will be required for robust ethical preparedness for pandemics beyond influenza. That is, while some baseline capabilities, like the capability of communities to shelter populations from all kinds of hazards, can plausibly be established due to the isomorphic relationship between the mitigation strategy (i.e., sheltering) and the common threat posed by many different hazards (i.e., the risk of harm if not sheltered), it seems less plausible that ethical considerations will function in the same manner. For instance, ethical justifications for setting priorities for the allocation of health care resources during a surge in health care need following an earthquake could differ dramatically from a surge stemming from an infectious disease pandemic due to the imperative to curb the spread of disease that exists in the latter but not the former. This necessitates careful analysis and deliberation about the appropriate ethical values and principles, in addition to the ethical reasons, justifications, and context for permissible application that should guide different preparedness and response activities. Some have argued that 'different types of hazards-epidemic, weather related, environmental, radiologic-present special circumstances for ethical decision making and reflection, but they do not require tailor-made ethical principles or goals' (Jennings and Arras 2008, pp. 8-9) ; however, as will be demonstrated in the next section, it is precisely the neglect of special circumstances for ethical decision-making and reflection that renders current pandemic plans, and also all-hazards approaches, illequipped to anticipate and facilitate the navigation of ethical issues in non-influenza pandemics.",30.508980658099397,13.091014273718864

Depending on the agent and its mode of transmission, the population density, and the population's access to health care, it can be days or even weeks before anyone can recognize the problem. As the early response may be crucial in containing the problem and minimizing resultant morbidity and mortality, efforts have been made to develop biosurveillance systems to detect outbreaks and attacks. [7] [8] [9] These systems collect pertinent data (e.g., pharmacy drug sales, emergency department visit chief complaints, and air samples) and search for irregularities that suggest a problem is occurring. However, these systems are by no means foolproof because they only look for a finite set of clues, do not cover every part of the United States, and may provide equivocal information. Moreover, there could be delays between the point that biosurveillance systems detect suspicious patterns and when the public health system responds. Therefore, Internists might be the first to become aware of a problem and pivotal in initiating the public health response. Internists see large numbers of patients with various health problems and may be the patients' only interaction with the medical community for symptoms resulting from infectious diseases and injuries from radiation, chemicals, and/or burns. So they could be the first to report attacks or outbreaks and initiate public health response. Indeed, there are examples of ""astute"" clinicians being the first to recognize epidemic or bioterrorist attacks (e.g., the 1999 New York City West Nile outbreak, 5 the 2001 anthrax attack cases, 10, 11 and the 2003 SARS epidemic in Vietnam 12 ).",28.94527116886786,12.404311537893651

Unsurprisingly, much of the contemporary literature focuses on the multifarious threats posed by human and, increasingly, non-human mobility. Prompted by current geopolitical concerns surrounding the public health implications of regular international air travel, this paper extends such research by exploring the ways in which the technology of the aeroplane stimulated the production of new international sanitary initiatives aimed at safeguarding global public health in an era of mass aeromobility. By tracing the development of sanitary regulations for aerial navigation, from their origins in the 1920s through the twentieth century in particular, we document the emergence of a series of public health interventions that were designed to limit the public health threat associated with increased international air travel and the concomitant rise in the mobility of infectious diseases. From inoculation certificates to quarantine and the routine 'disinsection' of passenger aircraft with powerful insecticides, modern air travel is replete with a complex set of procedures designed to lessen the risks associated with flying between different climatic and ecological zones. Our detailed examination of the historical context in which these procedures were devised and implemented leads us to consider the importance of time and space, power and efficacy, to the development of a more nuanced understanding of the shifting public health response to an increasingly fluid, mobile, and inter-connected society.",23.9696540882303,11.687198974444449

Coalitions have existed prior to the development of the HPP. Coalitions developed with the CSEPP program, Metropolitan Medical Response System (MMRS), Metropolitan Strike Teams, and now with the hospital preparedness program. Coalitions are locally or regionally based. Membership within coalitions is defined at the local level (city, county, state, or region). Coalitions have established leaders who have specific roles and responsibilities as well as an organizational framework. Individual organizational support is identified through the development of an MOU or memorandum of agreement. Such agreements articulate roles and responsibilities, identify the process for distribution of funding sources, and facilitate the integration of the preparedness community. For example, some coalitions have used HPP grant dollars to purchase equipment, creating communications networks between facilities and first responder partners. They have purchased caches of supplies and established community-based emergency preparedness exercises. Coalitions exist as a result of established day-to-day relationships within a hospital and between hospitals and public health partners. Relationships develop that include levels of trust, familiarity, and dependability. Coalitions have expanded outside the hospital/public health boundaries to include skilled nursing facilities and long term care facilities, all of which are part of the fabric of health care providers in the community. Many coalitions share training schedules, offer joint educational or preparedness conferences, and act as mentors to other health care partners as they develop emergency preparedness plans for their organizations. In times of emergency, knowing one's coalition partners and how to reach them quickly can help keep health care services intact. The ability to bounce back in the face of disaster is the hallmark of resilience. 14 As of 2016, funding levels for both the HPP and PHEP program have been cut, forcing hospitals to determine whether participation in regional coalitions, planning efforts, and exercises is still worth their financial support.",23.93191374016949,9.803598911420524

Shifting a portion of global health investments from reactionary approaches to preventive capacity could support development of needed renewable technologies such as solar microgrids; building local capacity for installation and maintenance could reduce cost and technological barriers for uptake and use.

For example, outbreaks of Marburg virus in Eastern Africa, associated with human encroachment into wildlife habitat for natural resource extraction, prompted mine closures. 69 Adding health to routine environmental and social impact assessment processes for development projects can help identify and mitigate public health risks. There are many opportunities for engagement among those organizations already conscientious of the range of effects (positive and negative) that their investments may have.

Whereas overt outbreaks would warrant immediate notification of public health officials and LRN reference laboratories, potential covert events might be initially evaluated internally by clinicians, infection control personnel, and the sentinel laboratory. Although hospital and public health authorities should be notified as soon as a select agent is considered, an LRN-confirmed result would be needed to initiate a formal public health response. Key epidemiological clues to suspicious emergency events include sharp rises in the frequency or severity of communicable diseases (including those in animals), an unusual cluster or age distribution, occurrence of novel or rare diseases, presence or lack of an appropriate exposure history, travel to a location that has high-consequence disease transmission, unexplained deaths, or pathogens with unusual antimicrobial resistance.",24.600507207365364,12.550946956553096

The Chinese social networking sites' timeliness of reporting are significantly better compared to international mainstream media in English, official websites of the central Chinese government and WHO. Information was released by the local news agencies on the social networking site in the local language before any reports in the conventional news websites or government websites. The information was subsequently amplified by the social networking sites through re-posting of the original report. This allowed the international community greater access to more detailed and timely information compared to that released at the central government level to the international media. The central Chinese government may have allowed the provincial/municipal health authorities to release information on new cases when available to ensure transparency and timeliness of public communications.

First, under Article 43.2, countries cannot implement additional health measures exclusively as a precaution but must rather ground their decision making in ""scientific principles"", ""scientific evidence"", and ""advice from WHO"". 1 Many of the travel restrictions being implemented during the COVID-19 outbreak are not supported by science or WHO. Travel restrictions for these kinds of viruses have been challenged by public health researchers, [4] [5] [6] and WHO has advised against travel restrictions, arguing they cause more harm than good. 7, 8 Second, under Article 43.1 any additional health measures implemented by countries ""shall not be more restrictive of international traffic and not more invasive or intrusive to persons than reasonably available alternatives"". 1 In this case, even if travel restrictions did work, there are so many other more effective measures that countries can take to protect their citizens. WHO has issued COVID-19 technical guidance on several such measures, including risk communication, surveillance, patient management, and screening at ports of entry and exit. 9 Third, and most importantly, Article 3.1 strictly requires all additional health measures to be implemented ""with full respect for the dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms of persons"", 1 which in turn must reflect the international law principles of necessity, legitimacy, and proportionality that govern limitations to and derogations from rights and freedoms. 10 Under no circumstances should public health or foreign policy decisions be based on the racism and xenophobia that are now being directed at Chinese people and those of Asian descent. 11 Many of the travel restrictions implemented by dozens of countries during the COVID-19 outbreak are therefore violations of the IHR. 12 Yet, perhaps even more troubling, is that at least two-thirds of these countries have not reported their additional health measures to WHO, 12 response to public health emergencies and prevents countries from holding each other accountable for their obligations under the IHR. Some countries argue that they would rather be safe than sorry. But evidence belies the claim that illegal travel restrictions make countries safer. [4] [5] [6] In the short term, travel restrictions prevent supplies from getting into affected areas, slow down the international public health response, stigmatise entire populations, and disproportionately harm the most vulnerable among us. In the longer term, countries selecting which international laws to follow encourages other countries to do the same, which in turn undermines the broader rules-based world order. Effective global governance is not possible when countries cannot depend on each other to comply with international agreements. 13 Of course, the IHR is far from perfect. For example, the IHR only governs countries, not corporations and other non-governmental actors. Thus, some countries are finding themselves with de-facto travel restrictions when airlines stop flying to places affected by COVID-19.",20.011443126707313,9.303007944403253

The current value may already have exceeded the target value, and in this case the result would exceed 100%. Absolute and relative measures of differences may lead to different conclusions about changes over time. That is, equal relative progress for different groups does not correspond to equal absolute progress for them. The absolute difference between two groups in some health measure may decline while the relative difference may increase, depending on how the denominator is selected (as in the example below). In the calculation of the relative measure, the base chosen for calculating the percent difference at some date is usually the value for the group taken as the standard but this does not have to be the case.

Both Twining 27 and Bradney 28 have emphasized the need for the modern teaching of legal subjects to move beyond a professional/ vocational model to embrace a pluralistic, liberal idea of education. On this analysis, subjects should be taught not solely for their vocational utility, but for their capacity to 'allow [students] to understand the structures and values that permeate and underpin law. to introduce students to the wide variety of conversations that is going on within law at any one moment, so that they can explore law from a range of different stances'. 28 A liberal curriculum is thus characterized by pluralism and variety such that those who have benefited from study upon it may be capable of providing 'explicit or implicit personal and individual answers to questions about how the world is ordered and connected and how we value and evaluate these connections'. 28 It is submitted that a strong case can be made for the pedagogical value of public health law on such liberal academic grounds. One such argument has already been outlined: the opportunity which the teaching of this subject presents to familiarize students, whether of public health or of law, with the facilitative capabilities of law; that is, its capacity to 'provide an opportunity to explore the ways that law can be used to advance public health goals'. 26 In so far as this represents a departure from the more familiar reading of law's function as a negative control mechanism, this embodies a liberal pedagogical objective, since such teaching thereby allows students to comprehend law from a different stance than the norm or, to use Bradney's terminology, to be introduced to an alternative 'conversation' regarding the societal roles which law may perform. 28 A related liberal pedagogical goal which can be pursued through the teaching of public health law arises from its population perspective. As a contrast to the traditionally individualistic orientation of law, including medical law, study of public health law can therefore offer 'valuable lessons about the complexity of the relationship between individuals and populations' and law's role in mediating this relationship. 26 This, in turn, can assist in building greater understanding amongst all students of the variety of functions fulfilled by law.

In particular, the use of disease scenarios and incident responses affords the opportunity to stretch student understanding of a range of relevant issues. For example, students could be required to draft a document providing legal and ethical guidance to public health practitioners tasked with managing an outbreak of an infectious disease. Here, inspiration might be drawn from the assessments designed for membership of the Faculty of Public Health, whose Part B examinations, while carrying no direct legal content themselves, are scenario based, and include examples such as 'contact investigations for tuberculosis'. 8, 62 Assessment might also take the form of a piece of legislative drafting, for example of a new model Public Health Act designed to address the public health problems of contemporary society. 63 More conventional options are offered by the critical evaluation of existing or proposed public health measures from a legal perspective; for example, the UK and European Union pandemic influenza preparedness plans or the International Health Regulations.

Students will then recognise public health issues when they arise, placing them in a fuller and familiar context of similar issues they have studied. They will appreciate more fully the reasons for and implications of the particular doctrines they are mastering'. 26 To cite an obvious example, the leading English case on the tort of negligence, Donoghue v Stevenson, emerged in a public health context (that would now be categorized as food safety). Lord Atkin described the issue of whether the manufacturer owed a duty of care to the consumer as 'important. because of its bearing on public health'. 30 Similarly, the common law of nuisance is also interwoven with public health concerns, 5 and the doctrine of nuisance was employed as the legal mechanism for control of disease in public health legislation, much of which, in turn, has been largely subsumed within modern environmental law. Familiarity with public health thus provides a valuable basis for building comprehension of foundational legal tenets, although it may be stretching the point to claim that there exists 'no less a role for public health law than as a unifying, syncretic theme for law school education'. 29 In sum, the benefits of a module in public health law extend well beyond the vocational. While the growing salience of law to public health policy requires that students of public health develop an understanding of legal processes and rules which can be applied to practical situations, the teaching of legal principle also serves a broader pedagogical purpose by exposing such students to a particular mode of analytical reasoning and fostering a deeper understanding of societal ordering. Similarly, the educational experience of students of law will be enhanced by the interdisciplinarity and social context which public health brings, offering 'a vantage point and a set of methodologies that can enrich a lawyer's ability to comprehend the world and practice law effectively'. 9",21.95357175546932,9.30514997747855

Second, Taiwan has a public health system that provides high quality care to all its citizens. As a result, traditional public health initiatives can be relatively easily implemented. Third, Taiwan is a medium-sized, contained, wealthy island democracy with an advanced economy. This ensures that Taiwan possesses the resources necessary for pandemic response while also being attentive to and constrained by public interests and concerns.

Purpose: To explore whether enhanced cooperation with local government and community institutions can effectively supplement traditional state-centric public health epidemic responses. Methods: Drawing on Taiwan as a case study, we assess the role of the whole-of-society approach to epidemic response as arises from the collaborative governance literature. The approach calls for enhanced cooperation, trust building, resource sharing and consensus-oriented decision making among multiple levels of government, business, non-profits, and the public in general. Results: The Taiwan case illustrates the benefits of the whole-of-society approach. Enhanced cooperation between state, local government and non-state institutions, particularly neighborhood committees, has resulted in a strengthened, holistic epidemic preparedness and response infrastructure.

From discussions at the workshop, 10 significant problems facing public health education in China were identified: Goals for public health education and training at the national level have not been clearly defined; Public health education is not seen as independent of the traditional medical education system, and the unique characteristics of public health education are not recognized and respected; In schools of public health, there is a lack of expertise in health economics, health management, health policy, and health-related law and regulations; It is difficult to attract high-quality students to public health as compared with clinical medicine; The importance of public health education as part of the public health system has not been well recognized by the Government; Curriculum development has not kept up with the modern developments in public health; Teaching has not kept up with the new technology and teaching contents; Structure of teaching faculty has not kept up with the requirements of education reform; Teaching materials have not kept up with the rapid growth of scientific evidence and with the change in health needs; and Links across universities (e.g. with social science faculties) are poor.",24.68711664469577,11.924880059232692

Both zoonotic (diseases transmitted from animals to people) and nonzoonotic animal diseases need to be considered. Reportable, zoonotic, and production diseases are discussed elsewhere in this encyclopedia. Some of these diseases are of national public health interest or are of international trade importance requiring immediate reporting through specific official public health channels and to the World Organisation for Animal Health, one of the three sisters of the World Trade Organization. Reportable diseases of animals are those with the potential to cause epidemics or pandemics that cause serious disease in people, as is the case of the severe acute respiratory syndrome known as SARS, the H5N1 (pathogenic avian), and H1N1 influenza virus (known as swine influenza) (Gauthier-Clerc et al., 2007; Girad et al., 2010) . Public health resources and market inspections are deployed for some of these diseases, but control is often ineffective in poor countries. Determining the public health penetration of these programs in slums has been highlighted as a need (Unger and Riley, 2007) . Risk communication in a crisis situation involving the livestock population in a slum may require additional resources and targeted programming. The lack of information of the size and location of the avian and swine population may impede the progress of disease control measures. Public awareness programs or the application of rigid standards for disease control without consideration of the sociocultural and economic value of the animals for people may also decrease compliance (Box 2). References to the 1920 flu pandemic are always brought to light in the media as the possible serious consequences of disease spread and death. However, public health crisis response is different today and includes emergency and disaster preparedness, first responders training programs, and damage mitigation and relief. Nonetheless robust economic estimates by the World Bank suggest that the cost of an epidemic originating in animals could be a trillion dollars (World Bank, 2012).",24.351518635131125,11.8580716743688

At the same time, this can strengthen rationale and effectiveness for the wider public health benefits generated from human, animal, and environmental health funds (e.g., forest conservation investments under the UN Collaborative Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation).",29.701012592234534,15.51674187705061

New and innovative strategies have been established for response to health emergencies, such as the establishment of the parallel laboratory confirmation mechanism for newly emerging infectious pathogens to reduce the risk of errors, rapid disclosure of information to the WHO and to the public, international information exchange and collaboration, and the provision of more information on public health and on infectious diseases to the public. Furthermore, the Chinese government has strengthened both the related aspects of the legal system and the disease prevention and control system. For example, the government issued the Law of the People's Republic of China on Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases (Revised Draft) in 2004 and Regulations on Preparedness for and Response to Emergent Public Health Hazards in 2003, created the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, and improved surveillance systems of infectious diseases and preparedness and response capacity for emerging public health events.

In public health practice, when an epidemic outbreak occurs, especially for new and emerging diseases, very often action needs to be taken based on sparse knowledge about the pathogen and disease transmission. The public health response mechanisms such as quarantine are often implemented without a proper understanding of their impact. Some measures were complentmented blindly, which resulted in some serious problems, such as high economic and social price. Nowadays, although a large number of researchers have made tremendous progress, but there remains a long distance to reach successes. SARS has pandemic potential, but an effective public health response can curtail this threat. Using the Beijing 2003 SARS epidemic data, this study demonstrates the impor-tance of analyzing spatial patterns and spatio-temporal evolutionary patterns in the context of infectious disease informatics. Our empirical findings provide useful insights that could help better understand disease transmission mechanisms and prepare for and respond to possible reemergence of the SARS epidemic or other novel epidemics of acute infectious diseases. Over the past two decades, with the development of information technology and its extensive application, mass spatio-temporal data storage, management and dynamic update are no longer a problem. Furthermore, spatial statistical methods have been developed rapidly, which have been used widely in a lot of fields, such as resources, environment, ecology, economic and sociality. Spatial statistical methods have been proved a powerful tool to public health. A new discipline, spatial epidemiology, has formed based on the intersection of epidemiology, spatial statistics and geographic information systems, which is the study of the spatial distribution of disease. At present, researching on spatial epidemiology in China is still in its early stage; this paper can promote its development in public health field and provide a sample of using spatial statistical methods to study the infectious disease epidemics, such as avian flu, hand-foot-mouth disease and Influenza A (H1N1).",23.635002552362508,11.534071388455509

INTRODUCTION: DISCOVERING ISSUES AND CHALLENGES IN LOW-AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES,"Where are the pharmacists when the nations are crippled by these threats? Do the pharmaceutical policies fail to curb these problems? The lack of adequate, resilient public health surveillance systems, infrastructure to effectively deploy resources, and a health workforce to provide accessible, quality care where needed leaves us vulnerable to regional and global spread. Despite the progress that has been made in the last two decades, more needs to be done to create enabling regulatory environments. Understanding the social and cultural contexts that may contribute to these problems, plus effective solutions, is also crucial. Health communication often receives less attention and fewer resources than medical, scientific, or policy areas. There is an urgent need for society to value and invest more in evidence-informed public health strategies. The multifactorial nature of broader global health issues poses an enormous challenge to all stakeholders (WHO, 2016b). Effective public health action depends on understanding the scale and nature of threats to health (WHO, 1986) . According to the Ottawa patient charter, the public health community has a duty to make the invisible visible. They must measure and assess the burden of diseases, health status, and risk factors including the protection factors. The public health community must make the best use of data to promote health. Public health interventions should be evaluated, using rigorous research methods, and the results disseminated. The public health community must ensure that evidence is used to give voice to those who would otherwise be unheard. Research findings must be disseminated effectively to the different stakeholders in the health sectors, including public, policy makers, practitioners, and (social) media. Findings at times are complex and this information should be delivered in ways that are comprehensible and in a timely manner (Lomazzi, 2016) .",25.000232842957235,13.499747053373197

The reasons for this are varied and complex, but they include limited access to resources that can help people to take action during an emergency, culture and language barriers, lower perceived personal risk, distrust of authorities, lack of preparation and protective action, and frequent reliance on informal sources of information. 1, 2 Central to these factors, we argue, is the phenomenon of communi-cation inequalities, which we define as differences among individuals and social groups in accessing and using health information and the resultant impact on knowledge and behaviors. [2] [3] [4] While a solid body of work in social epidemiology has documented a connection between social determinants such as socioeconomic position, race, and ethnicity and health outcomes, the mechanisms linking the 2 have been less clear. Viswanath and colleagues developed an explanatory framework of how inequalities in public health emergency preparedness outcomes attributable to social determinants could potentially be explained by inequalities on various dimensions of public health emergency preparedness. 5 The framework is summarized by the Structural Influence Model (SIM) of preparedness communication depicted in Figure 1 . 5 The model is a heuristic framework developed to link social determinants with preparedness outcomes through public health emergency preparedness communications. The framework was originally developed in the context of health communication 5 and subsequently adopted to public health emergency preparedness communication to the public. 6 Communication to the public is critically important in public health emergency preparedness. It is one of 15 public health emergency preparedness capabilities developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): ''Public Information and Warning.'' 7 During a crisis, federal, state, and local public health agencies are typically engaged in a variety of public information efforts to inform the population, encourage the adoption of preventive behaviors, and limit the adverse impacts of specific events. Yet, individuals and groups may not be able to access and use some of the resources offered to them, including information on health and specific threats, because of existing social inequalities, including socioeconomic position, race, ethnicity, and physical and mental health disabilities, among others. 8 Emergencies, including disasters, also can lead to longterm disparities, even controlling for predisaster socioeconomic status, as a study of Hurricane Katrina showed. 9 These disparities are also found among nations. For ex-ample, a United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) study showed that the adverse consequences of disasters, such as mortality, are greater among countries with low income, low life expectancy, and less education. 10 In contrast, advanced countries with higher income and education and more stable governance suffer fewer losses in disasters. 9 Poorer households tend to have poorer coping strategies and suffer consequences over the longer term. 11 In an analysis, Kim showed that poor people are more likely than nonpoor people to be exposed to disasters and that the poor are much more likely to be concentrated in disasterprone areas, highlighting the importance of public health emergency preparedness communications. 6 During an emergency, a number of psychosocial as well as social factors influence action, even when information about a probable hazard is available and promptly communicated to the public. For example, Mexican Americans often have delayed responses to natural emergencies because of the time they spend in trying to communicate with their extended families. 12 Hearing impairment may leave elderly people more vulnerable to information processing and cause difficulty in understanding evacuation orders, 13 and individuals with low literacy may be challenged in interpreting written messages and are likely to benefit from preparedness resources that are easy to read and visually appropriate. 14 Given the importance of communicating to the public in public health emergency preparedness, it is important to examine the extent to which this issue has received attention from the scientific community. The goal of this project was to conduct a systematic review of the scientific literature to describe current research in public communication in public health emergency preparedness, with a particular focus on communication inequalities and their association with communication and preparedness outcomes.

It is a three-in-one strategy to help countries: (1) strengthen the generic capacities for managing emerging diseases, (2) improve pandemic readiness, and (3) build up to meet the IHR core capacity requirements for surveillance and response. APSED (2005) identified five programme areas as priorities for national capacity-building, namely surveillance and response, laboratory, zoonoses, infection control and risk communication. Through the collective efforts of countries and areas, WHO and partners, considerable progress has been made in all five APSED (2005) capacity areas. For example, most countries have now established event-based surveillance systems to detect public health events including disease outbreaks. Trained rapid response teams (RRTs) are able to conduct field investigations quickly. The capacities of the national influenza centres have been significantly improved. These capacities were tested through a realworld global public health event -Pandemic (H1N1) 2009. The pandemic response clearly demonstrated the value of regional investment in capacity-building. 15 The 2005 Strategy has been recently revised in response to requests from countries and areas following recent developments and evolving needs. The updated Strategy, now called the Asia Pacific Strategy for Emerging Diseases (2010), also known as APSED (2010), was endorsed at the sixty-first Session of the Regional Committee for the Western Pacific in October 2010. 16 It builds on the experiences and accomplishments gained from implementing APSED (2005) and takes into account the key lessons learnt from the pandemic response, the needs expressed by countries and areas and the technical advice provided by experts during the intensive country and regional-level consultations between July 2009 and October 2010.

Outbreak-control efforts were directed at providing technical support for case management, strengthening infection control in hospitals, improving surveillance and contact tracing, and educating residents about the disease and its mode or transmission. As part of a public health response, in addition to posting information for travelers, the CDC sent personnel to join the WHO-coordinated GOARN response team. The CDC representatives assisted with epidemiologic investigation, infection control, and laboratory diagnosis. The CDC also provided laboratory and other scientific and logistical support. 15 In most Western countries, MHF is a reportable or notifiable disease. Cases or outbreaks also should be reported to the WHO. The virus is a hazard category 4 virus and should be handled in a containment level 4 laboratory. Strict isolation and barrier nursing are recommended, and the handling of biological specimens for diagnosis and patient management should be performed according to regulations governing risk assessment and control. Case contacts or individuals with exposure in laboratories should be placed under health surveillance for 21 days after their last exposure to infection. If they should become feverish, they should undergo risk assessment and perhaps be admitted to strict isolation pending the results of diagnostic tests. 5 In conjunction with the WHO, the CDC has developed guidelines entitled ""Infection Control for Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers in the African Health Care Setting.""

Core capacities include the establishment of common laboratory standards, an effective surveillance system (based on disease, syndromic, or rumor reporting), and effective response capabilities (eg, contact tracing and monitoring through field epidemiology). For example, each member state has to ensure that it has the laboratory capacity to rapidly identify outbreaks; 1,6 to do so, provisions for technical support and extra resources for less-developed countries also are written into the revised IHR (2005). 1 The core response capacity requirements apply at all public health response levels-from local to intermediate to national. 9 Strengthening national public health capacities contributes to improving national and international readiness to detect, verify, investigate, and control disease outbreaks that have the potential to spread internationally. 7 Importantly, the revised IHR specify measures to prevent disease spread at designated points of entry. 6, 9 Operational and technologic communications and trust across countries are central tenets of regional surveillance networks. Moreover, each country's particular strengths can be leveraged across regional network partner nations. MECIDS and MBDS have acted as catalysts for the introduction and spread of new communications and laboratory technologies. For example, MBDS members are working with several international funding and technical partners to increase technical capacity for surveillance and disease control through computing; high-speed Internet access recently has been enhanced by the Trans-Eurasia Information Network 2 effort in Vietnam. When Vietnam lacked such Internet capacity in 2006, Thailand facilitated Vietnam's participation in the multinational videoconference on pandemic preparedness (organized by APEC Emerging Infections Network) by hosting the Vietnamese representatives at their videoconference center. As another example, tabletop exercises in individual MBDS countries and a regional MBDS exercise suggest that each country has unique strengths that can be considered for application across the region, such as electronic surveillance reporting in China; epidemiology training in Thailand; laboratory capacity in Thailand, China, and Vietnam; community surveillance in Cambodia; and government organization for national influenza preparedness in Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR) (Dr. Moe Ko Oo, MBDS Coordinator, personal communication, 2008).",23.348733891335957,10.6478332601495

A 2010 case involving a tobacco dispute between Indonesia and the United States is illustrative. To comply with domestic legislation to prevent adolescent smoking, the United States banned imports of flavored cigarettes. Indonesia argued that the domestic legislation, by exempting 'menthol' from the list of flavors, discriminated against its clove cigarettes in favor of US-manufactured menthol cigarettes, which are the favored choice of American teens. This constituted a violation of WTO rules on national treatment (there should be no discrimination against 'like' imported goods). Indonesia further argued that there were 'less-trade-restrictive' ways (another WTO requirement) to meet the public health goal of reducing adolescent smoking than a ban on clove cigarette imports. The WTO dispute panel ruled with Indonesia on the first argument (nondiscrimination) but with the United States on the second (agreeing that a ban was a necessary public health policy). Provided there is no obvious discrimination, public health regulations appear to have growing latitude within (at least some) WTO (McGrady, 2012) . There is also greater public health attention being given to proposed trade and investment treaties, with efforts to ensure that before such treaties are finalized, public health concerns are given due consideration, and that 'policy space' for future public health regulation is assured, e.g., regarding trade or investment in food, alcohol, or other health-damaging commodities. The potential for a healthier governance of trade and investment treaties, however, remains constrained by the secrecy in which the treaties are negotiated, the privileging of business interests over public interests in informing government positions during negotiations, and the stilldominant assumption that liberalization is an inherently positive development for all countries involved.

The modern era of “public health preparedness” had begun as did a “new normal” in public health that required active involvement in homeland security efforts on a basis of 24 hours, 7 days a week. Discussions around how federal dollars for preparedness should be allocated at the state and local levels led to the development of the ASTHO-NACCHO (National Association of County & City Health Officials) Joint Council. Convening health officers to discuss coordinated emergency response efforts to Hurricane Katrina, the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, the H1N1 outbreak, and severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak laid the groundwork for ASTHO's role in supporting state and territorial health agencies and federal partners during public health disasters.

First, while both focus on public health competencies in great depth, they do not fully address the broader range of non-health system factors, including institutional, financial and infrastructural capacities, which are also fundamental building blocks for effective response to infectious disease epidemics. For example, the JEE includes an indicator for ‘Linking Public Health and Security Authorities’, which is important for assessing the coordination between these institutions.

Public health security is … the activities required, both proactive and reactive, to minimize vulnerability to acute public health events that endanger the collective health of national populations. Global public health security widens this definition to include acute public health events that endanger the collective health of populations living across geographical regions and international boundaries … .[G]lobal health security, or lack of it, may also have an impact on economic or political stability, trade, tourism, access to goods and services and, if they occur repeatedly, on demographic stability.3

Public health and life sciences on the one hand and security on the other hand were until a few years ago almost completely separated worlds. “Biologists and other life scientists were—unlike the physicists—not involved in security politics, except for a relatively limited group of biologists and other life scientists who were working in Defence laboratories in order to develop biological weapons or to contribute to biodefense research” (van der Bruggen 2009, p. 69). But most of these life scientists did not take part in public debates on biological weapons or—broader—weapons of mass destruction, like e.g. physicists did on nuclear weapons.5 This has changed in the past decade.

Our analysis revealed that several medium-sized cities, particularly those neighboring Hubei, are highly vulnerable due to the lack of healthcare resources. ",22.808245109504462,12.00662184799224

For southern countries, which have generally experienced fewer COVID-19 cases to date (Fig.  1A) , public health policy must be ramped up in response to rising COVID-19 transmission as temperatures cool. Northern countries face a crucial window of opportunity to eliminate COVID-19 from their populations. In the coming warmer months, rising temperatures are likely to lower overall transmission, making large-scale public health interventions that limit contact amongst individuals, such as shelter-in-place policies and school closings, more effec-tive at achieving and maintaining low overall case rates. However, if such measures are not taken and moderate baseline levels of transmission persist through the summer, cooler fall and winter months could imply a substantial resurgence of new cases ( Fig. 2 and 3) . Getting the most from these policies during this summer period is critical if northern countries want to eliminate COVID-19, rather than experience a second, possibly stronger, second wave of the virus when temperatures fall during the winter of 2021. History hints at the importance of taking advantage of this window of opportunity: the second wave of the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic had much higher mortality rates than the first. 22, 23 Although we know of no completed laboratory studies of the temperature-COVID-19 transmission relationship to date, we view our approach as complementary to such future results. While laboratory studies isolate the biology of virus transmission, our statistical approach using observed COVID-19 cases captures those channels as well as any behavioral adjustments individuals make in response to short-term fluctuations in temperature, such as decisions to go outside, to exercise, to attend social gatherings, and many other possible activities and health investments. As public health officials grapple with the costs and benefits of a range of possible responses to the current pandemic, quantifying the influence of both channels is essential to building appropriate policies.",21.609755858519243,11.74917779034227

As a whole, negative emotions weakened, and positive emotions increased. Finally, we divided the topics of public concern about the COVID-19 epidemic into five categories through social semantic network analysis.
