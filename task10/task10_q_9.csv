Here, and in two other recent studies [20, 21] , effective strategies have been identified for mitigation rather than containment. The key outcome of mitigation studies is the reduction in IAR, rather than the likelihood of complete control. Given that many epidemiological parameters associated with the next influenza pandemic are unknown, comparison of results from different modeling studies is not straightforward. Ferguson et al. [20] assumed that only infections that were severe enough to require medical care (50%) would be reported and could be used to trigger interventions. We assumed that during the next pandemic, 67% (all symptomatic) of infections could be reported and used to trigger interventions. Our more optimistic assumption about the symptomatic rate was balanced by assuming that only 50% of symptomatic cases would comply with our policies and report, whereas Ferguson et al. [20] assumed that 90% of clinical cases would receive anti-viral treatment (with their household receiving anti-viral prophylaxis) and that 50% of households would comply with quarantine. If we had assumed a 50% clinical attack rate rather than 67%, we would have estimated a reduction in symptomatic attack rate from 37% to 22% for the policy of QA. This estimate is consistent with the reduction in attack rate from 34% to 20% in Figure 3 of Ferguson et al. [20] . However, our results are not consistent with Table 2 of Germann et al. [21] , in which a 10-fold reduction in the numbers of ill people is reported for the use of targeted anti-viral prophylaxis (60% case ascertainment, R 0 ¼ 1.9, unlimited supply of anti-virals). This large discrepancy is most likely due to the optimistic nature of their policy: they assume that households, household clusters, schools, and workplaces can be targeted very efficiently for prophylactic anti-viral therapy. We suggest that a highly efficient contact tracing process would be required to achieve high levels of coverage between socially connected households in modern urban populations, and, further, our results suggest that such a process would require unfeasibly large numbers of households to be recruited during short periods of time.",11.241852215434479,8.61694452765274

The surveillance function is therefore to document that a pathogen remains below a defined threshold, and to provide early warning of an increase in incidence or other significant changes in risk (e.g. higher pathogenicity, new subtype). Early warning may trigger a rapid response to contain an increase in incidence of the pathogen (e.g. disease outbreak).

For all other diseases, it is the responsibility of individual countries to select appropriate surveillance strategies to demonstrate that an intervention has been successful. C.

However, after many years of Stage III mitigation activities the programme may become institutionalised and stagnate in Stage III instead of moving to Stage I.

The underlying assumption is that surveillance always informs mitigation. This helps to describe the goal of existing and putative mitigation targets clearly and outlines the need for surveillance to support that target. Hence, the understanding of the technical processes of mitigation may also be useful for algorithms for decision-making processes or comprehensive evaluation tools for government surveillance. Moreover, logical and sustained attention to such processes may facilitate the understanding of mitigation activities in other countries and the coordination of surveillance and intervention efforts at international level.

The scenarios presented here have widely different implications for public health,0.199068514408468,2.266772985458374,2.6865506172180176,379359e5-023c-4e4f-8156-4d82f26875a0,comm_use_subset/Evolution and emergence of novel human infections,"The work presented here underlines the unpredictability of infectious diseases undergoing adaptations for human transmission. Nonetheless, it also illustrates that general patterns of epidemiological behaviour can be associated with different evolutionary pathways. The scenarios presented here have widely different implications for public health, and each presents its unique problem in terms of containment. A pathogen following a punctuated route to adaptation is liable to emergence without any warning. Moreover, under this scenario, large outbreaks tend to be caused only by adapted pathogens, and so such outbreaks will be comparatively difficult to contain. By contrast, the gradual route offers some warning of adaptation in the form of large but self-limiting outbreaks. Both these clusters and the early stages of emergence are composed mainly of cases of a partially adapted pathogen, rendering containment comparatively easier. However, a danger is that repeated false alarms would elicit repeated containment efforts, potentially draining valuable resources. There are many possible refinements to the simple model of transmission presented here. One shortfall in the model is where large numbers of infection are predicted: in reality, large outbreaks will tend to be limited by local depletion of susceptibles, as well as being likely to trigger spontaneous social distancing and public health interventions. Host heterogeneity may also play a role. For example, Lloyd-Smith et al. (2005) point out in the context of a non-adapting pathogen that individual variation in transmissibility, hidden by a population-level value for R 0 , can have a strong effect on the outcomes of introductions, making extinction more likely than in a homogeneous population. Yates et al. (2006) explore different types of heterogeneity, including susceptibility to infection, and make the elegant distinction that, for nonadapted stages, the rate of adaptation has a stronger effect on probability of extinction than heterogeneity, and conversely for adapted stages. Extending this discussion to cluster sizes before emergence, these and other aspects of host population structure would be areas for refinement in models more detailed than those we have presented here. Nonetheless, the general insights offered by our approach are likely to remain valid. While mathematical models can be no replacement for detailed epidemiological investigations in the field, such as contact tracing and laboratory analysis, we hope we have shown here that they can offer valuable, objective insights into potential pre-emergence scenarios. Together with established frameworks for rapid case identification and management, mathematical models can play an important role in our toolkit for preparedness in public health.

These concerns reduced as people became more familiar with swine flu. Most of these focus groups were conducted around the time of the second wave in UK swine flu cases in the autumn of 2009. Consistent with a UK survey [18] and in contrast to public attitude studies conducted in other countries [19, 21] there was evidence that participants in this study perceived that there was an inevitability to contracting swine flu and assessed self-efficacy for protecting oneself as low, based on the belief that swine flu was more contagious than normal seasonal influenza. This may have resulted from some confusion around the phrase 'containment phase'. On the 2 nd of July 2009 the DoH moved from containment (outbreak management) to the treatment phase [30] . The public may have understood this move from containment as a failure to stop it completely as implied by several participants and findings from an independent review of the UK Government handling of swine flu http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/416533/ the2009influenzapandemic-review.pdf. Despite believing there was a high likelihood of contracting swine flu, there was little evidence that participants assessed swine flu as life threatening for healthy people. This finding adds further weight to the notion that even during the period when there were more swine flu cases, the public were not unduly anxious [22] . It is known that risk perceptions about the seriousness of a disease and perceived personal vulnerability are key factors in whether people take action to protect health [31] . Evidence from this study confirms this. Participants who assessed that they were in good health did not perceive swine flu as a threat to their health, while those in contact with more vulnerable groups, or who assessed their own health as compromised deemed themselves at greater risk from harm from swine flu. These findings resonate with large population opinion surveys [22, 21] and with evidence on disease perceptions [32] and factors in vaccine decisionmaking [33] .",8.310633825767972,3.5150210864252136

Substantial autochthonous circulation in Italy, Iran and South Korea has been reported by now, while there is increasing evidence that subclinical infections occur and people may be infectious before symptoms appear [8] [9] [10] . These developments indicate that the window of opportunity to contain and eradicate is rapidly narrowing. [11] . Therefore, it is needless to state that for each phase in the control and mitigation of a novel emerging pathogen, adequate laboratory preparedness and response are crucial. The readiness survey that we performed served the important purpose of mapping the initial response capacities in Europe and identifying barriers to diagnostic implementation. Therefore, we maintain that the urgent implementation and monitoring of diagnostic capacities and capabilities for SARS-CoV-2 in Europe is proportional to the containment and expected mitigation phase of the global public health response and is critical for care of local patients. The implementation of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics does not replace nor exclude diagnostic capacity for other respiratory viruses. Moreover, it explicitly does not disregard the importance of other seasonal respiratory pathogens for public and patient health. This is clearly illustrated by the authors themselves, who indicate that they have tested thousands of samples of patients suspected of respiratory viral disease not only for common respiratory pathogens but also for SARS-CoV-2. The fact that Colson et al. found a wide range of seasonal respiratory viruses indeed underlines the impact of such pathogens. Furthermore, it clearly shows that diagnosis of respiratory viruses cannot be done syndrome-based and supports the need for the availability of diagnostics for a panel of pathogens including SARS-CoV-2.",16.88300615821492,8.169997737765053

Recent outbreaks and spread of exotic or emerging diseases such as avian influenza (AI), Schmallenberg virus (SBV) and bluetongue virus (BTV) in previously unaffected territories of the EU have emphasised the need for well-developed and adequately resourced health systems, including surveillance, to ensure early detection and rapid containment, the complexities of which are highlighted by Braks et al. (2011) [7] . At the same time investment is being constrained due to significant financial budget reductions in many European countries. Livestock disease is important economically with regards to a loss of productivity, its potential impact on human and animal health, and the mitigation activities implemented when disease occurs (for example trade or movement bans, testing and culling). For example, the economic cost of BSE in the UK accrued from the value loss in infected carcasses, disposal costs, and, most importantly, the sharp drop in domestic beef demand due to consumer scares (sales of beef products declined by 40% once the possible link between BSE and new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) was announced, but the costs were partly offset by an increase in consumption of substitute meat), and a complete loss in export markets [8] . Further costs accrued from operating various public schemes, establishment and enforcement of new legislation and the adjustment of the industry to the new structure and markets [8] . Livestock disease can be spread directly for example the introduction of FMD from Irish calves imported to the Netherlands that were also held responsible for the infection of a farm near to the port of introduction to mainland Europe [9] . It can be spread by infected equipment, crates or transporter vehicles which can be contaminated by microbes. For example Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria were detected on the sides and floors of lorries [10] and contaminated transporters were found to be responsible for spreading classical swine fever to different farms in Lithuania [11] . By moving animals with latent or asymptomatic infections this enables disease to spread to wherever the animal travels or where the necessary vectors may be present. Particularly in the case of epidemic diseases where the reduction of time from introduction of a hazard to its detection can enable early response and thereby lead to a reduction in intervention costs to contain an outbreak [12] , effective surveillance is critical. Few surveillance systems however, are designed based on international livestock movement data, even though such data can provide information on the quantity and seasonality of livestock movements, the types of movement (for example flows from production of point of lay birds to laying units), the route the animals take and associated stopover or resting points. Surveillance for many livestock species occurs at the farm where it is the responsibility of the farmer (and veterinarian) to report notifiable diseases or at the abattoir where it is the role of the official veterinarian to inspect livestock according to Council Regulation (EC) 854/2004 [13] and report notifiable diseases to the national authorities, which in the UK is the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), which in turn must inform the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) as stated in Council Regulation (EC) 178/2002 [14] .",7.887789389793172,5.2281249716445135

[22] but some countries attempted containment in Phases 5 and 6. Some countries even instituted a ''containment phase'' using case-finding and various measures such as isolation and antiviral treatment of ill suspected and confirmed cases, and quarantine of exposed persons with or without antiviral chemoprophylaxis, while others never attempted or quickly moved from resource-intensive containment to mitigation [22] . A preliminary evaluation of intensive containment undertaken in parts of the UK during its spring/summer wave of 2009 demonstrates how resource-and labour-intensive community containment could have been and also how even with a lot of resources the measures had to be abandoned [23] . It is now recognised that the phrase ''containment'' was unfortunate and potentially misleading since at best the actions were only mitigating impact [24] .

However, decisions on this intervention were contextually specific, dependent on feasibility and their potential downsides [26] . In Europe and the US the judgement was generally that proactive school closures would not be justified as a community mitigation intervention in the context of a perceived mild-to-moderate pandemic among the general population, and reserve plans for widespread closure have not been activated in most jurisdictions. However, local decisions were made to close schools in some areas as a response to prevent transmission and high attack rates among schoolchildren or simply where there was too much illness and absenteeism to sustain teaching [21, 27] .",18.953048313302663,11.539703279361133

Another type of practice is the voluntary preventive behavior of individuals, such as receiving vaccination, taking antiviral drugs, and wearing face masks. These two types of practices take effects concurrently in influenza containment, but little attention has been paid to their combined effectiveness. This article estimates this combined effectiveness using established simulation models in the urbanized area of Buffalo, NY, USA. Three control strategies are investigated, including: Targeted Antiviral Prophylaxis (TAP), workplace/school closure, community travel restriction, as well as the combination of the three. All control strategies are simulated with and without regard to individual preventive behavior, and the resulting effectiveness are compared. The simulation outcomes suggest that weaker control strategies could suffice to contain influenza epidemics, because individuals voluntarily adopt preventive behavior, rendering these weaker strategies more effective than would otherwise have been expected. The preventive behavior of individuals could save medical resources for control strategies and avoid unnecessary socio-economic interruptions. This research adds a human behavioral dimension into the simulation of control strategies and offers new insights into disease containment. Health policy makers are recommended to review current control strategies and comprehend preventive behavior patterns of local populations before making decisions on influenza containment.",8.469559413167197,8.047497623851225

The other most relevant parameter is T i . Figure S3B clearly shows that delay in the start of intervention drastically increases outbreak probability: in particular starting interventions with a delay of more than 20 days for epidemics having R 0 larger than 1.3 is almost equivalent to not intervening at all. On the other hand, starting interventions with a delay of 1 day only can drastically increase the containment probability even for large values of R 0 . Figure S3C shows that while a delay of 2 days in household quarantine after case detection does not make a large difference, a delay of 4 days can make containment much more difficult, even for low values of R 0 ; on the other hand, household quarantine immediately after case detection, though very difficult to implement, would lead to systematically better results in terms of outbreak containment. Figure S3D shows that the variability in P g has a clear impact on outbreak probability. Figure S3E shows the effect of different initial interventions on the laboratory's contact network. It shows that closure of the laboratory is the only crucial intervention to put in place soon after detection of the accidental escape, especially for large values of R 0 . Additional measures such as quarantine of laboratory workers households and closure of schools and workplaces attended by households members of laboratory workers are of little impact.

The Ghana National Integrated Strategic Plan for Pandemic Influenza for 2009 -2013 (NISPPI) is the government's paper outlining its preparedness strategies [12] . The NISPPI addresses five main themes -planning and coordination; surveillance and situation monitoring; prevention, containment and management; communication; and social mitigation. In the recent past, the plan has been critiqued for deficiencies in epidemiological content and other concerns [13, 14] . Sambala criticizes the vaccine/antiviral strategies of Ghana, Malawi, and Tanzania pandemic plans as unclear and inadequatelacking an epidemiological explanation as to why certain groups are at high risk. Norman et al. do not consider the level of risk used in estimating direct health threat in the event of an outbreak acceptable risk. They do not offer what level of risk is acceptable. Both the 2006 influenza preparedness and response plan [15] and the current NISPPI [12] contain assumptions about the direct health threat in the event of an outbreak. Both project the number of clinical cases and deaths in Ghana in the event of a Phase 5 pandemic a using gross attack rates of between 15% and 40%, and case fatality rates (CFR) between 0.6% and 1.5%. Based on Ghana's present population of approximately 25 million, even these conservative assumptions show a real potential for significant mortality (22,500 deaths) in an influenza pandemic.

Having chosen this collection of 1000 parameter sets, we considered two levels of two different control parameters which were applied to each (so that each of the 1000 parameter sets were simulated under four different control conditions). The first of the two control parameters was the probability of workplace/social group contact finding; we chose values of 0.8 and 0.9 for this parameter (the household contact finding probability was 0.95 in all cases). The second of the control parameters was the rate of diagnosis (and effective removal) from the community of cases developing among previously identified and traced contacts who were initially asymptomatic (we refer to this as the monitored diagnosis rate); we assumed first a low level corresponding to a mean diagnosis time of one day from the onset of symptoms, and a high level corresponding to a mean time of 3 hours from the onset of symptoms (high levels of the monitored diagnosis rate correspond effectively to isolation of contacts). Finally, we assumed a doubling of the diagnosis rate after the beginning of widespread community awareness of smallpox. We then computed the containment fraction at different levels of ring vaccination capacity (contact tracing capacity per day). Thus, for each of 1000 scenarios (parameter set choices), we assigned the workplace/social group contact tracing success probability (υ 2 ), the monitored diagnosis rate φ (Appendix 2 [see additional file 2]), and the contact tracing/ring vaccination capacity per day (K r ). We then performed 100 realizations beginning with 10 index cases, and computed the containment fraction (fraction showing fewer than 500 cases in 250 days, beginning with 10 index cases). Thus, for each of the two choices each of υ 2 and φ, and for each value of K r we examined, we obtained 1000 values of the containment fraction.

Containment could be feasible even for larger values of R 0 in cases of very timely intervention both in recognizing the accidental release and during contact tracing and high probability of detecting secondary cases in the same household, school or workplace as a newly identified case. Overall, these results suggest that success in containing an accidentally released potentially pandemic influenza virus by employing social distancing measures only is uncertain: containment probability for a virus with transmissibility comparable to many of the estimates for the 2009 H1N1 virus (namely R 0 or effective transmissibility in the range 1.2 to 1.6 [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] ) is reassuring, even though containment is not guaranteed. Should the transmissibility of the pathogen be comparable to that of the 1918 Spanish influenza (R 0 = 1.8 or higher [25] ), containment success would be seriously compromised. A further relevant finding is the strong impact of the BSL laboratory location. Rural areas have a fivefold increase in containment probability with respect to densely populated urban areas. Similarly, we observe differences according to the sociodemographic structure of the geographical region.

containment is likely to succeed for values of R 0 below 1.5,0.34743877221744934,2.3740036487579346,2.8301501274108887,d63bfb6c-cf54-4092-b267-476a0e24ef1c,comm_use_subset/Containing the accidental laboratory escape of potential pandemic influenza viruses,"By assuming reference values for the parameters regulating the containment plan, the probability of observing an epidemic outbreak is drastically reduced for all values of R 0 . In particular, containment is likely to succeed for values of R 0 below 1.5 (probability of outbreak less than 10%, see Figure 4A ). The SSO set indicates that for those values of R 0 the probability of outbreak is largely due to the probability of not detecting the outbreak itself; when the accidental release of the PPP agent is detected in a timely manner, outbreaks are contained with probability close to 100%. The resources required to contain epidemic outbreaks with reference intervention may vary considerably. As shown in Figure 4C , most epidemics are contained at the very beginning, when only few cases are present in the population (median: three infections), thus requiring little effort in terms of contact tracing (median: two traced cases) and overall number of quarantined households. However, it is possible, though not very likely, that containment requires the tracing of several cases (up to 58 traced cases for R 0 = 1.5, corresponding to the isolation of about 500 individuals). Even more demanding, especially from the social point of view, is the closure of 90% of schools for 21 days in a radius of 30 km around location of initial cases, as assumed by the reference SSO set. The number of cases observed can be easily related to the fatality associated to the outbreak if the case fatality rate (CFR) of the specific PPP agent is known. Unfortunately, the CFR is often not obviously correlated with the transmissibility of the pathogen. In addition, it is extremely difficult to obtain reliable estimates of the CFR during the early stage of an outbreak. A sensitivity analysis of the fatality of the virus can however be performed by applying plausible CFR to the number of cases observed with our approach. The timeline of simulated epidemics with R 0 = 1.5 is shown in Figure 5 . Autoextinction occurs in very few days (maximum 57 days) after only few cumulative cases (maximum 10 to 20 cases). A similar pattern is observed for contained epidemics, which may be characterized by a slightly longer duration (maximum 100 days) and slightly larger number of cases (maximum 100 to 200). In both cases, incidence is always less than 20 daily cases. Uncontained epidemics result in long-lasting epidemics (more than 1 year) and produce a large number of cases in a short period of time (larger than 10,000 in 5 months; peak incidence between 10,000 and 15,000 daily cases). Undetected epidemics are shorter (less than 1 year) but are characterized by a much larger number of cases (overall attack rate: 49.5% on average) and peak incidence (between 200,000 and 300,000 daily cases). In addition, these results show the mitigation efficacy of the proposed interventions (specifically household quarantine and reactive school closure on the basis of contact tracing procedures). Moreover, as only 2 different patterns may occur (either the disease quickly dies out after a very limited number of cases or it results in an epidemic outbreak, with many cases in the very first days), these results justify our definition of contained epidemic (disease elimination in less than 5 months and less than 1,000 cumulative cases), though many others are of course equivalent.",9.494057214370642,6.70561997953946

Although everyone is potentially at risk of respiratory infection, the public seem to deal with the threat of infection by attributing vulnerability to 'other, less good' groups of people. This process of 'othering' is consistent with previous qualitative research on how the public make sense of emerging infectious diseases [27, 28] . Such denial could be seen literally as public ignorance or erroneous evaluations of risk of infection. However, denial of personal risk also means asserting that one is not in the group of people who are vulnerable or in danger due to either their risky, unhygienic behaviour or being weak (e.g. due to illness or age) -so rather than a misunderstanding of risk this can reflect a means of coping with the threat of infection. This interpretation suggests an important role of emotional and sociocultural factors in shaping individual ways to perceive and react to respiratory infection risk, rather than assuming that people's perceptions of respiratory infection risk are purely an individual, rational, cognitive process [26, 63] .",8.667412769790527,6.6577522319541504

The underlying assumption that the pandemic would start from avian influenza virus mutation within the country led to heavy investment on surveillance and case detection mechanisms in the five developing countries. These mechanisms were designed primarily for AHI with reliance on poultry contact history in the surveillance and case detection operational guidelines and unlikely to be effective for early-detection and containment of pandemic influenza now that human-to-human transmission has been observed without an animal tracer. The pandemic response strategy and the surveillance and case detection protocols in these countries need to be transformed to accommodate this changing circumstance.

Substantial autochthonous circulation in Italy, Iran and South Korea has been reported by now, while there is increasing evidence that subclinical infections occur and people may be infectious before symptoms appear [8] [9] [10] . These developments indicate that the window of opportunity to contain and eradicate is rapidly narrowing. [11] . Therefore, it is needless to state that for each phase in the control and mitigation of a novel emerging pathogen, adequate laboratory preparedness and response are crucial. The readiness survey that we performed served the important purpose of mapping the initial response capacities in Europe and identifying barriers to diagnostic implementation. Therefore, we maintain that the urgent implementation and monitoring of diagnostic capacities and capabilities for SARS-CoV-2 in Europe is proportional to the containment and expected mitigation phase of the global public health response and is critical for care of local patients. The implementation of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics does not replace nor exclude diagnostic capacity for other respiratory viruses. Moreover, it explicitly does not disregard the importance of other seasonal respiratory pathogens for public and patient health. This is clearly illustrated by the authors themselves, who indicate that they have tested thousands of samples of patients suspected of respiratory viral disease not only for common respiratory pathogens but also for SARS-CoV-2. The fact that Colson et al. found a wide range of seasonal respiratory viruses indeed underlines the impact of such pathogens. Furthermore, it clearly shows that diagnosis of respiratory viruses cannot be done syndrome-based and supports the need for the availability of diagnostics for a panel of pathogens including SARS-CoV-2.",16.87165338933177,8.166024268655951

Depending on the CFR value, the government response toward COVID-19 may vary, and estimates of CFR can also influence the strictness of policy judgement and the extent of containment and mitigation measures. For instance, a well-known CFR estimate for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong in 2003 was approximately 17% [3] , roughly indicating that one out of five diagnosed cases would die of the disease. SARS containment measures were implemented as early as possible due to high estimates of CFR.

Containment aims to stop the flow of the gene from the crop and mitigation focuses on preventing the gene from establishing in a significant proportion of the population (Gressel, 2015) . Containment can be physical or biological. Physical containment provides a barrier, such as a greenhouse, filters in the lab or isolation distances in the field. There are also efforts to conduct molecular farming underground, e.g., in unused mines, which provide an even higher degree of physical containment 6 . So far there are no documented cases of physical containment failing in the laboratory or greenhouse (Gressel, 2015) . Whereas, the shortcomings of geographic isolation were shown when transgenes from GM glyphosate-resistant creeping bentgrass, Agrostis stolonifera, were found in nonagronomic bentgrass up to 3.8 km beyond the control area perimeter (Reichman et al., 2006) .

Technologies are therefore needed to reduce the chances of a transgene becoming established after escape. Transgenic mitigation involves linking the transgene to genes that confer a selective disadvantage. Weedy traits such as a propensity toward shattering, bolting, and greater height can be targeted (Gressel, 2015) . Transgenic mitigation reduced the reproductive fitness of transgenic-weed oilseed rape hybrids. A dwarfing mitigator gene was linked to a herbicide resistance transgene, which reduced the reproductive fitness of the transgenic-weed hybrid to 0.9% of the competing weed's reproductive fitness (Al-Ahmad and Gressel, 2006) . However, there is the potential for the linkage of the mitigator gene to the transgene to be broken through meiotic crossing over. Additionally, there can be mutation of the mitigator gene so that it ceases to confer the deleterious phenotype. Both of these issues can in some part be addressed through linking another mitigator gene to the transgene, such that there are mitigating genes either side of the transgene (Gressel, 2015) .",19.413169639501223,11.274821263569233
the transfer of potentially infectious material out of high-containment facilities is very challenging and is sometimes the source of containment breaches,0.1662244065923769,4.674034595489502,4.666406631469727,4576ada7-c7cb-439f-b1a8-afd4e40f3ffe,comm_use_subset/A Universal Next-Generation Sequencing Protocol To Generate Noninfectious Barcoded cDNA Libraries from High- Containment RNA Viruses,"The core objective of a biosafety program is the containment of potentially harmful biological and infectious agents. Standardization of lab practices at all BSLs are defined (7), but the transfer of potentially infectious material out of high-containment facilities is very challenging and is sometimes the source of containment breaches. Likewise, during outbreak situations, the need to handle samples containing potentially infectious viral genomes (or genetic material falling under SA regulations) under high containment may significantly hinder public health responses. In this report, we demonstrate the development of a robust SOP for generating high-quality cDNAs from ssRNAϩ viruses, which can be used in highly parallel processes to quickly and safely remove samples from BSL-3/4 containment for subsequent genomic sequencing or other similar procedures in BSL-2 laboratories. Protocols to generate NGS sequencing libraries for ssRNAϩ viruses do exist. For example, a recent report (20) describes a method for FMDV whole-genome sequencing, but it was not proven to destroy infectious material. In addition to complete genome coverage, our data confirm that full-length RNAs, cDNAs, or dsDNAs from these processes cannot be used to recover/ rescue infectious viruses. We demonstrate that this SOP completely inactivates viruses from diverse virus families classified as SAs or considered high-consequence pathogens. The SOP removes infectious genomic RNAs and simultaneously amplifies barcoded cDNAs that cannot be used to rescue/recover viruses (Table 1 and Fig. 3 ). The SOP also generates high-quality cDNA libraries, and the resulting NGS data covers almost entire ssRNAϩ viral genomes from samples tested ( Fig. 2 and 4) . The SISPA method is unable to fully define viral genomic termini, since the method utilizes random hexamer priming. Therefore, additional protocols, such as rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) are required for this sequence information. The procedure is sequence independent and can be utilized on both known and unknown viruses (new/emerging), regardless of prior genome information. Sequence independence also enables simultaneous identification of multiple pathogens in a sample (e.g., coinfections) or even modified, manufactured pathogens. The described strategy is efficient, scalable, and inexpensive and requires only reagents and equipment that are commonly used in BSL-3/4 laboratories, whereas NGS sequencing equipment is expensive and difficult to maintain, especially within high-containment laboratories. This SOP builds on the established SISPA method (13, 14) to create small overlapping fragments that are barcoded (i.e., uniquely tagged) by the addition of nucleotides to the termini. Our barcoding system has many advantages. (i) The barcoded DNAs cannot be used to recover/rescue viruses, so they can be safely transferred to BSL-2 sequencing centers onsite or shipped to large-scale sequencing centers. (ii) Our system allows for the PCR amplification of the genomic material (thus, limited amounts of sample or low copy number can yield whole genomes). (iii) It can be scaled up for high-throughput sequencing of hundreds of samples simultaneously, which can dramatically reduce the cost and effort required for NGS library construction.",8.901318993450642,9.186748445231224

All of the animal food-contact surfaces and most of the non-animal foodcontact surfaces were qPCR positive when swabbed after the contaminated animal food was manufactured and remained qPCR positive after multiple batches of animal food were mixed and conveyed. Therefore, it seems that the proposed mitigation technique (feed batch sequencing) did not mitigate environmental PEDV contamination. Additionally, detectible PEDV seemed to persist on some animal food-contact surfaces, such as plastic and rubber conveyors, more than others such as metal. Previous studies have investigated the survivability of virus on inanimate surfaces and determined viral persistence in the environment can be affected by several factors including surface type [19] [20] [21] . Additionally, different surface types can have different characteristics such electrostatic, hydrophobic or ionic strength which may impact virus detectability on these surfaces [22, 23] . For example, it has been reported that electrostatic forces impact virus attachment to lettuce [24] . Therefore, it is possible that physical properties contributed to the persistence of PEDV on animal food-contact surfaces sampled in the current study. This is interesting because most animal food manufacturing equipment have been designed for electrical efficiency and physical cleanout, but not sanitization. For example, plastic conveyer buckets are preferred not only because they are light and more energy efficient, but they are also safer for workers due to elimination of sparking that is a concern with sheeted metal buckets [25] .",4.704041848782353,4.833261046381074

However, this is not practical in most current commercial feed production settings. Methods to chemically or thermally mitigate the risk of PEDV transmission in feed and feed ingredients have been investigated . These methods are not universally applicable to all feed manufacturing facilities due to equipment cost or safety concerns. Other research has assessed sequencing batches of PEDV-negative feed following an inoculated batch of feed to assess the effectiveness of reducing the risk of viral transmission (Schumacher et al., 2016a) . Although this may be a practical mitigation technique for feed mills to implement, there remains a significant quantity of viral particles on feed-contact surfaces including dust production and distribution throughout the facility . This dust may pose a risk for contamination of subsequent diets. One potential solution is to use chemical mitigants such as formaldehyde or medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA) as a periodic flush step within the feed manufacturing process. Rice hulls were selected as the carrier for this chemical flush because of the relatively low cost and high degree of abrasiveness, which may help facilitate the removal of viral contamination on equipment surfaces.

The strategy was to combine the killing function with the regulatory system of a degradative pathway in such a way, that the cells survive in the presence of the xenobiotic (repression of the killing gene), but after 1354 BIO/TECHNOLOGY VOL. 12 DECEMBER 1994 completion of degradation of the compound the killing gene is turned on, and the cells die53. This approach has been tested in relation to the 10L pathway responsible for the mineralization of different benzoates. With the detailed knowledge about the genetic control of the genes involved in this degradative path-way54, it was possible to design engineered combinations of the expression system of the 10L genes and a suicide gene. One of the promoters of the 10L genes was fused with the E. coli loci gene whose product represses a promoter, P1.c which in the present context was fused with the killing gene (Fig. 4) . In the presence of m-methylbenzoate the 10L promoter is activated, which implies that the repressor protein is made, and consequently the killing function is not expressed; the cells survive, and degradation of m-methylbenzoate is allowed. After removal of the aromatic inducer the repressor is no longer expressed from the 10L promoter, and therefore no inhibition is exerted on the promoter responsible for expression of the killing function"". After completion of the task of the designed organism (degradation of m-methylbenzoate), it destroys itself through substrate regulated induction of the suicide system.",8.448468162986558,8.239487727513435

Fortunately, escape of infectious material from laboratories is very rare; examples include a small pox outbreak in Birmingham in 1978 and the foot-and mouth disease outbreak associated with faulty drainage at the animal health facility at Pirbright in 2007. The root cause of such accidental releases was a breakdown in containment (the physical control measures put in place to prevent microorganisms escaping to the environment). In fact, containment technology and practices have improved dramatically during the past 50 years, with significant improvements often being identified by analy sis of accidents or near-misses.

However, this also provides opportunities for mitigation and adaptation with a view to better managing food systems to reduce environmental and biodiversity impacts in addition to disease risks in the future. For proximal risk factors associated with specifi c contact events, better safety and biosecurity standards will be a core part of any strategy to reduce disease risks from wild harvest and animal production systems. However, the more distal drivers of disease emergence (e.g., land-use change) or global changes that occur in step with, or that directly facilitate, the expansion of food systems present a much more nebulous and diffuse range of risks. Managing these underlying drivers may ultimately provide solutions for sustainability and public health threats. We propose that direct mitigation of disease transmission is thus only ever going to be a part of what urgently needs to be a much more encompassing, proactive strategy targeting the distal risks of disease emergence ).

Whilst other countries' public health strategies were immediately focused upon mitigating the effects of a potential worldwide pandemic, Hong Kong's authorities initially directed efforts towards disease containment and preventing community-wide spread. This was exemplified by the stringent quarantine of 300 guests at the hotel of the H1N1 influenza index case in the city. 1, 2 Such an action was applauded by the public, who were shown to be adopting enhanced hygiene behaviours, continuously informed by daily press updates. 3 By June 2009, however, it was clear that community spread had occurred, and the Government moved into the mitigation phase of handling the pandemic with the objective of minimizing spread and reducing the potential disruptive effect of H1N1 influenza in the community.",11.879232857219742,6.62753752147886

Prior to arrival on campus, most summer school students reported complying with a number of infection control measures, such as hand washing and temperature checks, but they were less likely to seek additional information about H1N1 or to think of needing emergency coverage, and only one-third had ready access to face masks, mirroring findings from previous studies. 7, 8, 9 At the summer school, the students were generally compliant with and supportive of the measures being taken when the first case occurred, despite the inconvenience of online classes and curtailment of student activities. This finding is reassuring to university authorities with responsibility for student welfare, implying reasonable compliance by all students with the steps that were taken. However, different response patterns were observed dependent on country of study. Singapore, Hong Kong and US students each comprised approximately one-quarter of the summer school students, although nearly half (40.7%) of all students were of Hong Kong origin. Each of these three countries of study had taken a different approach to the threat of the pandemic, which was in its earlier stages at the time of the summer school. Both Hong Kong and Singapore had adopted containment strategies, influenced by factors such as their experiences of SARS, the global nature of their cities, pneumonia being a primary cause of death amongst citizens, and the ever-present threat of avian flu to their relatively small and highly mobile populations. 10, 11 At this stage of the pandemic the Singaporean strategy on pandemic response was more rigorous than that of Hong Kong, but both were more stringent than that of the USA. Since SARS, the Singaporean Government had developed plans to enforce community mitigation measures against emerging infections. A centralized, structured pandemic preparedness regime has been constructed which includes the designation of pandemic preparedness clinics throughout the country, the establishment of contact tracing and quarantining guidelines, and widespread dissemination of health promotion materials related to preventing spread of influenza. 12, 13 Such measures were also planned and implemented within Hong Kong. 14 The different behavioural responses mirrored those of the SARS period to some extent when, despite disruptions to daily life, there was widespread support amongst the population for the policies and contingency measures, although Singapore based students demonstrated a higher frequency of self-administered preventive measures than Hong Kong based students during that period. 15 Prior to the students' arrival in late June, Singapore remained in a late containment phase, focusing on contact tracing, hospital isolation and home quarantine before the transition to mitigation in early July. Thus, the finding that students studying in Singapore were more likely than US students to wear face masks, carry information in case of need of an emergency contact and attend informational sessions is not entirely unexpected. Wearing face masks is more common in Eastern cultures, which may contribute to the greater likelihood of wearing/carrying a face mask and having an emergency contact amongst Hong Kong students. Overall, those students studying in Singapore were the most compliant with infection control advice, as well as being supportive of precautionary measures and taking Tamiflu. Differing levels of compliance may be related to the specific policy responses of the student's home country. For instance, the health system of the USA, where state health departments exist as autonomous entities from federal-level agencies such as the CDC and the Department of Health and Human Services, demonstrated a much less uniform and more decentralized response to H1N1. Community response plans for pandemics varied among states in surveillance techniques, home quarantining and community interventions. 16 Attempts to centralize the response system by appointing a director for pandemic preparedness in the executive office were largely ignored in lieu of an assistant secretary of health and human services providing broad recommendations and appropriations towards state health departments, rather than playing a conglomerate role. 17, 18 In addition, the close proximity between the initial outbreak in Mexico and the USA meant rapid spread, with a large number of US cases in a short period, forcing the Government to proceed immediately to a mitigation policy in late April, aiming to minimize the effects of infection rather than attempting to target and shut down its spread. 19 Thus, students arriving from the USA are likely to have been exposed earlier to mixed messages of the severity of the H1N1 pandemic, which may partially explain their lower compliance with campus measures, deeming them to be less useful. While the Hong Kong Government shares a similar system with Singapore in terms of pandemic response, the study results show that Hong Kong-based students were less likely to practice certain measures and perceive contingency measures as necessary compared with students from the USA. Unlike Singapore, the Hong Kong Government transitioned to mitigation on 11 June 2009 upon the first local cases of H1N1 influenza in the city. 20 Daily press updates and information about the virus were displayed in all forms of the media in the city. At the time of the survey on 23 July 2009, the number of influenza H1N1 cases in Hong Kong stood at 2207 with one death. 21 The low mortality rate and the move to mitigation might have, at that time, alleviated concerns about the pandemic within the local population.

This is where risk research and disaster research meet. Mitigation is not necessarily to ""eliminate risk"", but to reduce loss to an acceptable level. Even in the United States, mitigation is still one of the weakest links in disaster management practices. There are mainly two reasons. First, mitigation measures are generally proposed by academics rather than policymakers, and it is not easy to turn research issues into policy issues; second, mitigation measures need to be implemented down to earth, but general management departments lack the motivation to do so, because it is disaster management departments, not them, that will be responsible for the consequences of inadequate mitigation. Thus mitigation is not merely a technological issue. Only by reflecting on the negative consequences of social action from time to time and internalizing them can individual behavior and habits, organizational social responsibility and government policy preferences be developed, and a risk culture be fostered.

China's disaster management has gone through several stages, from disaster relief, disaster prevention and mitigation, to comprehensive disaster reduction, and is moving towards the stage of emergency management. In the face of disasters, in addition to primitive rituals, the most natural reaction of mankind is disaster relief. Early measures included rescue, tax relief, relocation, transfer of grain, and compensation. Later, measures such as building water conservancy facilities, adjusting plans and storing grain were developed for the purpose of disaster prevention and mitigation. At the stage of comprehensive disaster reduction, man-made disasters, in addition to natural disasters, were also included in the scope of disaster prevention and mitigation. From the 1950s, disaster management in China focused on disaster relief and disaster prevention at the early stage. The government successively set up disaster management agencies such as the Ministry of Water Resources, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Central Disaster Relief Committee and the Ministry of Civil Affairs. After China joined the UN's program of the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR) in 1990, the concept of comprehensive disaster reduction gained popularity. After the close of the program, China International Disaster Reduction Commission established during the decade was renamed China National Commission for Disaster Reduction, and remains the country's top agency for natural disaster reduction. However, limited progress was made in comprehensive disaster reduction. For example, a majority of man-made disasters in China were work-related accidents, and the highest authority dealing with them was the State Administration of Work Safety, instead of the National Commission for Disaster Reduction. This situation did not change until the SARS outbreak in 2003. In response to the threats of new infectious diseases and frequent occurrence of other emergencies, the Chinese government decided to establish an emergency management system, at the core of which is a comprehensive strategy for emergency response that consists of plans, institutions, mechanisms and rules and regulations.

Mitigation is taking action now-before the next disaster-to reduce human and financial consequences later (analyzing risk, reducing risk, insuring against risk). 10 Risk Reduction works to reduce risk to life and property through land use planning, floodplain management, [and] the adoption of sound building practices . . . Mitigation projects that reduce risk include elevating, relocating, or acquiring properties located in floodplains and returning them to open space, and the reinforcing of buildings in earthquake-prone areas. 10a Mitigation begins with local communities assessing their risks from recurring problems and making a plan for creating solutions to these problems and reducing the vulnerability of their citizens and their property to risk. 11 However, since the mid-1990s, mitigation planning has become increasingly more complex. Terrorist attacks, industrial accidents, and new or reemerging infectious diseases are just a few of the threats that have started to consume more planning time and resources. The growing scope of threats that must be addressed in mitigation strategies challenges all aspects of planning and response at all levels of government. [12] [13] [14] The importance of sharing intelligence information, for example, at the earliest possible stage of a terrorist attack, is recognized in national policy as a critical mitigation asset. Fusion centers have been implemented in jurisdictions across the United States. 15, 16 It is imperative that first responders and hospitals receive notification at the earliest indication of a contagious biological attack. Early notification allows state, regional, and local communities to implement appropriate responses that provide isolation, treatment, prophylaxis, and stockpiling and staging of federal resources, which, when rapidly implemented, could contain a potentially widespread event. This intelligence sharing must become a larger part of mitigation efforts aimed at also limiting the impact of natural and human-made disasters. The elevated status of intelligence within the National Incident Management System (NIMS) establishes the importance of early and effective intelligence sharing. The challenge is to establish these sharing relationships before a disaster by incorporating them into an ongoing hazard monitoring process, drills, exercises, and day-to-day activities to ensure that this critical resource is operational when needed to mitigate the consequences of a disaster. 17 A similar analogy can be made with the early warning given to the medical community when a surveillance system detects an unusual cluster of illnesses, which triggers an investigation leading to increased awareness, training, laboratory recognition, and possible identification of a sentinel case long before the initial diagnosis may be confirmed at a physician's office or health care facility.",11.525300338794718,7.676962866609767

Although various model systems engineered with plasmids proved to be e¡ective in some cases [59] , the full applicability of such circuits could not be realised before their combination with transposon vectors. Two types of containment systems have been developed depending on whether the GMO is required to die after ful¢lling a certain function (such as biodegradation of an environmental pollutant) or whether inhibition of the lateral transfer of the recombinant genes is desired. In a welldeveloped instance, Pseudomonas strains degrading 4-ethyl benzoate are programmed to activate a killing function after this substrate has been consumed from the environment [60, 61] . In another genetic design, recombinant genes are associated with a killing gene which is counteracted by an antidote gene in trans in the GMO [62, 63] . However, the antidote gene is lost after transfer of the genes of interest into a new recipient, thus causing its death. This last approach has been instrumental in constructing fully contained Pseudomonas strains for biodegradation of PCBs in which horizontal transfer of the recombinant genes is well below any of the currently available methods for detection [64] .",8.356697191397418,7.514095189531668

For higher transmission rates, the opposite becomes true. That is, the vaccine-only scenario is almost as effective as the combined scenario for reducing infection incidence, but the NPI-only scenario fares worse. If a vaccine is not available immediately to the population at the start of an epidemic, epidemic mitigation through adaptive NPI behaviour can curb the growth of an epidemic. Thus, if vaccination is made available to the population within a given time frame, health outcomes will be very similar to situations where a vaccine was always available. If, however, the effects of NPIs are not incorporated, then these time frames are comparatively shorter. Moreover, the increases in infection incidence for the vaccine-only scenarios are significantly higher the later the vaccine is introduced, resulting in increasingly higher predictions of epidemic final size. Finally, the impact of varying vaccine efficacy on both vaccine uptake and epidemic final size varies significantly between scenarios with and without adaptive NPI behaviour. The increases in both final size and vaccine uptake when vaccine efficacy is decreased are much higher for the vaccine-only scenario than the combined scenario. Hence, a model of adaptive vaccinating behaviour that does not also account for adaptive NPI behaviour will make very different predictions than a model that accounts for adaptive behaviour toward both interventions. This again highlights the positive benefits of epidemic mitigation through adaptive NPI behaviour.",9.343013674792111,6.939509956808648

Importantly, PAPR provides almost 100% protection against an aerosol infection when operating properly [27] .

Would the funding agencies require an IBC reviewed registration document, including a risk-benefit analysis and risk mitigation plan, to accompany the funding solicitation? This would make sense as otherwise the DHHS review committee would have to generate de novo the risk-benefit analysis and the risk management plan for each project it reviewed. Although perhaps advantageous for the DHHS review committee, this approach would increase the IBC workload as most IBCs review registration documents only after the award of funds as ~80-90% research proposals are not funded. If the DHHS review committee did generate its own risk-benefit analysis, would the IBC be able to modify a DHHSapproved risk mitigation plan or would the DHHS risk-benefit assessment replace that aspect of the IBC review? And, finally, would the DHHS risk mitigation plan replace the need for the risk mitigation plan mandated in 2015 DURC Policy, since the plans likely would end up in the same place, that is the funding agency?

For instance, the nature of the spatio-temporal structure, including composition of the social mixing groups and temporal dynamics of the affected population, drives the contact process which is the main determinant of the disease transmission (Larson 2007; Halloran et al. 2002; Ferguson et al. 2006; Wu et al. 2006b) . A comprehensive decision-aid model for containment and mitigation must take into account all of the above constituents; it must incorporate the mechanism of disease progression, from initial infection, to asymptomatic earlier phase, symptom manifestation, and final health outcome (recovery or death) (Handel et al. 2009; Pourbohloul et al. 2009; Atkinson and Wein 2008) ; it must also consider the population dynamics of disease spread, including individual susceptibility (Pitzer et al. 2007a,b) , transmissibility (Handel et al. 2009; Yang et al. 2007 Yang et al. , 2009a Cauchemez et al. 2004) , and human behaviors that mediate infection generation (Colizza et al. 2006; Epstein et al. 2007 Epstein et al. , 2008 Halloran 2006) ; finally, it must incorporate the impact of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical prevention and intervention, including vaccination, antiviral therapy, social distancing, school and workplace closures, travel restrictions, and use of low-cost measures, such as face masks and hand washing (Longini et al. 2004; Wu et al. 2006b ; Atkinson and Wein 2008; Yang et al. 2009b; Tang et al. 2006; Scharfstein et al. 2006; Glass et al. 2006; Lipsitch et al. 2007; Nigmatulina and Larson 2009 ).

Later on, animal cell culture became essential for scientific research, diagnosis and biotechnological activities. Along with this development, biosafety concerns have emerged pointing to the risks for human health and in a lesser extent for the environment associated to the handling of animal cell cultures. The management of these risks requires a thorough risk assessment of both the cell cultures and the type of manipulation prior the start of any activity. It involves a case-by-case evaluation of both the intrinsic properties of the cell culture genetically modified or not and the probability that it may inadvertently or intentionally become infected with pathogenic microorganisms. The latter hazard is predominant when adventitious contaminants are pathogenic or have a better capacity to persist in unfavourable conditions. Consequently, most of the containment measures primarily aim at protecting cells from adventitious contamination. Cell cultures known to harbour an infectious etiologic agent should be manipulated in compliance with containment measures recommended for the etiologic agent itself.

The development of the gene cloning technology by Cohen et al. in the early 1970s [1] constituted a revolution for all of the biological sciences, seeded new industries based on these sciences, and ushered in the era of Biotechnology. Recombinant DNA methods grew as a standard practice during the next decade bringing about two important and simultaneous steps in the synthesis of biological materials. One was cloning and transgenic implantation, which allowed to easily transfer DNA segments from given organisms to others and express their contents in heterologous hosts. The second one was the directed mutagenesis of given genes by either deletion or allelic replacement. This period of time witnessed the arch-famous Asilomar Conference in 1975 and its proposals for guidelines and self-regulation on the use of genetic constructs [2, 3] . Although many specific recommendations were largely ignored in subsequent years, Asilomar laid the foundation for most of the biosafety measures in place today for both biological and physical containment. Inter alia, the conference expressed that containment should be made an essential consideration in any experimental design and that the effectiveness of the containment should match, as closely as possible, the estimated risk. Since it was difficult to predict the biosafety threats of these new experiments, recommendations mentioned at that time stressed the exercise of an extra vigilance. However, they also foresaw that over the years GE practitioners would learn more about the actual risks in order to gradually decrease the (pre)caution to a realistic level. The now standard Biological Safety Levels (BSL) 1-4 were established and some types of experiments with highly pathogenic organisms (for humans, animals and plants) were even ruled out for the time being.",9.026447800891159,7.711156687968765

One special aspect of such a research on genetically engineered microorganisms (GEMs) for environmental release [21] [22] [23] dealt with the engineering of circuits for the containment of modified bacteria and their recombinant (trans)genes. The notion, pioneered by Søren Molin [24, 25] contemplated the possibility that GEMs could be endowed with conditional lethality circuits to either program their death at a given time or once they had completed their mission [26, 27] . Note that the novelty of such active containment was altogether different from the much earlier concept borne in the Asilomar Conference that advocated the use of multi-auxotrophic strains as the recipients of recombinant DNA with the purpose of decreasing the chances of survival in the environment [2, 3] . The downside of this otherwise judicious concept was that the proposed strains were so weak that they were rendered nearly useless for biotechnological applications and even for routine laboratory work. In contrast, active containment pursued the vigorous performance of the cells of interest where and when desired, until a known signal appeared in the stage that triggered a quick death.",9.114695981395538,7.212195881543858

One is mitigation, i.e. to limit the risk factors, and the other is adaptation, which means that although all efforts must be made in seeking to limit the negative impacts of industrial development, some degree of inevitable environmental or agriculture changes should be accepted. Mitigation and adaptation share the same ultimate purpose, which is to reduce undesirable impacts (Swart and Raes, 2007) . The bottom line is that the more effective mitigations undertaken now, the less need will there be for adaptation in the future. The most successful example is the current responses to climate change, which is undertaken by a majority of all countries (Dowlatabadi, 2007; Willbanks and Sathaye, 2007) . However, even the most rigorous mitigation efforts cannot avoid further impacts of climate change because of historically committed emissions, making action on adaptation essential. At the same time, adaptation cannot be allowed to rule indefinitely, so urgent mitigation is needed to avoid the worst effects of climate change. Investigations needed to answer how to best balance these demands are proposed to be implemented in community-based studies involved by local stakeholders to get more evidence-based results (Willbanks and Sathaye, 2007) .",12.359300876806252,7.04791863243036

ROS also appear to function as signaling molecules, upregulating pathways of autophagy and mitophagy at low levels to remove damaged mitochondria from the cell and inducing cellular apoptosis at high levels ( Figure I ) [76] . Autophagy is believed to play an important role in cell tumor regulation via mitigation of genome damage to limit tumor necrosis and inflammation; however, defective autophagy is known to enable tumor survival in starved cells by downregulating apoptosis [100] . not vary among species, causing the author to suggest that bats might simply generate fewer ROS in more-efficient mitochondria than comparable non-volant mammals.

Consequences of working in high containment are the practical difficulties associated with containing specialist assays and equipment often essential for experimental analyses. In an era of increased interest in biodefence pathogens and emerging diseases, immunological analysis has developed rapidly alongside traditional techniques in virology and molecular biology. For example, in order to maximise the use of small sample volumes, multiplexing has become a more popular and widespread approach to quantify multiple analytes simultaneously, such as cytokines and chemokines. The luminex microsphere system allows for the detection of many cytokines and chemokines in a single sample, but the detection method of using aligned lasers and fluidics means that samples often have to be analysed in low containment facilities. In order to perform cytokine analysis in materials from high containment (CL3 and CL4 laboratories), we have developed an appropriate inactivation methodology after staining steps, which although results in a reduction of median fluorescent intensity, produces statistically comparable outcomes when judged against non-inactivated samples.

For example, it may be that no loss avoidance is achieved at low levels of expenditure (marginal benefit = zero), but that expenditures need to reach a certain threshold for an effect to become noticeable, or that there are increasing marginal benefits at first followed by diminishing marginal benefits (Tisdell 1995) . Such scenarios obviously would lead to different optimal points of disease mitigation, as illustrated by Tisdell (1995) . Importantly, only by understanding these relationships it is possible to make the best use of the resources available for disease mitigation and reduce the economic cost of zoonotic disease to a minimum. Empirical data allow demonstrating whether a disease mitigation programme is subject to increasing or diminishing returns.

This application can also be extended to determine responses post-vaccination or after drug therapy, especially when assessing novel interventions. Such work with highly pathogenic material has only been possible by performing downstream assay work in high containment laboratories or by inactivating infectious material using gamma irradiation. Currently the practicalities of such down-stream assay work are difficult in the UK due to (i) a regulatory history of working with contained pathogens in biological safety cabinets, thereby using the concept of primary containment; and (ii) the consequential lack of amenable facilities including ready access to irradiation equipment. Additionally the availability of a contained (CL3/CL4) luminex reader presents difficulties: as there is an unknown risk of using of aligned lasers within microbiological safety cabinets and it is unclear what impact subsequent treatments with formaldehyde vapour during cabinet decontamination procedures will have.

The optimal level can be influenced by two key factors, namely technical changes that lead to an improvement of disease control measures with no price changes and changes in the value of losses avoided relative to the costs of mitigation (Howe et al. 2013) . Consequently, when the value of unpriced negative externalities are taken into account, the total losses increase, which impacts on the optimal point of mitigation as illustrated in Fig. 45.4 . To be able to add the negative externalities, their value must be added to the total losses. Often their value cannot be directly deducted from prices in the conventional sense; instead they must be valued using indirect estimation methods, such as the DALY approach described above. Similarly, the value people place on the welfare of their companion and recreational animals can be estimated for example from how much they spend on veterinary services and medicines. Freedom from fear of infection is more problematical to quantify, but may be revealed by changes in people's normal consumption behaviour. Disease mitigation programmes at national level generally comprise two important components, namely surveillance and intervention. Surveillance is defined as the ""systematic, continuous or repeated, measurement, collection, collation, analysis, interpretation and timely dissemination of animal health and welfare related data from defined populations, essential for describing health hazard occurrence and to contribute to the planning, implementation, and evaluation of risk mitigation measures"" (based on Hoinville et al. 2013) . In other words, surveillance provides information for interventions directed at loss avoidance. Surveillance and intervention are often inextricably linked; they can be technical substitutes or complements (Howe et al. 2013) . The above conceptual basis to define the optimal level for mitigation can then be extended to identify the optimal combination of surveillance and intervention, namely the point where the marginal cost of surveillance and intervention (combined at least cost) equal the marginal benefit (= loss avoidance) on the expansion path (Howe et al. 2013 ). The expansion path (Fig. 45 .5) links all identical tangent points on iso-mitigation curves (along such a curve, the losses avoided are the same for all combinations of surveillance and intervention) with the gradient corresponding to the price ratio for surveillance and intervention. Each point of tangency is a least-cost combination for surveillance and intervention for the given price ratio. If the iso-cost line represents a budget constraint, the surveillance and intervention resources cannot be increased above this level. In Fig. 45 .5, the optimal location on budget line BB' would be at H for A3 avoided losses, although H' would also be a feasible, albeit inferior use of resources. If adding externalities such as negative effects of disease in people, the point H would no longer be optimal and a case would need to be made to increase investment to be able to reach point K (Häsler 2011; Howe et al. 2013) (45.5) .",12.556463295407323,7.3700394342000575

In other words, for an investment to be justifiable the benefits should outweigh the costs; an acceptability criterion commonly found in cost-benefit analyses that compare the costs and benefits of potential programmes in monetary terms. In a nutshell, cost-benefit analyses compare the total discounted benefits of a project in monetary units with its total discounted costs in monetary units and recommend the implementation of the project if the benefits exceed the costs. It includes the definition of the useful life of the project, the estimate in physical units of benefits (losses avoided) and costs (mitigation resources used), translation of the physical units into economic values, the conversion of future values into present values by discounting, and finally the calculation of the net benefit (net present Fig. 45 .5 An iso-mitigation map with an expansion path to identify the optimal balance between loss avoidance, surveillance and intervention resources.

The mitigation strategies were further subdivided based on parameters such as sensitivity of detection, confi rmation of results, frequency of sampling, number of negative results before reopening for harvesting, and time to action. Direct HAV monitoring resulted in greater risk reduction than did the use of conventional bacterial indicators. In both contamination scenarios, twice monthly virus testing was an effective risk management strategy, avoiding about 40-50 % of the baseline cases. When contamination was accidental and homogeneous, waiting for three negative test results to reopen an area for harvesting was not effective in risk reduction. However, when contamination was endemic, waiting for the three negative test results was effective in preventing human cases. Any control measures that could reduce contamination by at least 2 log 10 units (e.g., improving sanitation, harvesting from lower risk areas) resulted in the greatest risk reduction (87-88 %).

The daily decline in new cases by mid February suggests that China is on the right path, showing that containment could be feasible. Other countries should be aware and reduce the spread of COVID19. What is already known is that exportations to other countries need not result in rapid largescale outbreaks, if the countries have the political will to rapidly implement early case detection, prompt isolation of ill people, comprehensive contact tracing, and immediate quarantine of all contacts.

This analysis will also point to the people and infrastructures that are most at risk and will allow assessment of humanitarian and economic costs of likely events.

What he calls the mutation-contagion package is composed of the following core ideas: that microbes are on the rampage and that we are experiencing a 'wave of new assailants'; that microbes are cleverer than us and are evolving to 'outwit us'; that microbes and environment are conjoined in an ecological parable, and that population growth, environmental degradation and factors such as antibiotic overuse are responsible for this unfolding catastrophe; that microbes know no boundaries (through globalisation and travel); and that we are waiting for the next plague (apocalyptic prophesy). This package is clearly constructed around a frightening core with few instances of reassurance. However frightening this may be, the sense of threat is still somehow hypothetical. The diseases themselves and the likelihood that readers will be personally affected (at least for now) remain abstract and distant as the threat tends to arise in geographically distant or marginal populations. At the same time, the threats are offset by the promise of 'medical progress', which presents a stream of 'amazing new discoveries'. Soon after the initial reporting however, the tone of newspaper coverage tends to shift to what Ungar (1998) calls the containment package, which aims to defuse the potential panic that emerges early in the coverage.

For instance, when ""complexity"" is interpreted merely as the unknown aspects of an SES, it may encourage managers to invest heavily in monitoring and data collection, rather than encourage the employment of adaptive approaches that allow for experimentation and the probing of boundaries as a mechanism to address uncertainty (Walters and Holling, 1990) . Also, as a CAS approach implies a change in management paradigm from a focus on causality and control within short time-frames, to a focus on coping with change and uncertainty over longer timescales, ineffective operations in this management shift may occur. In addition, an incorrect attitude toward a CAS mental model may regard it as a static management form, rather than a dynamic management approach that pursues continued learning, experimentation and adaptation. As these problems may compromise resilience in SES to varying degrees, efforts should be made to avoid or solve them. For more detailed discussions, refer to Bohensky et al.

CEP modelling showed that under the proposed scheme, the tourism sector would contract with falls in real tourism gross value added and tourism employment. The largest falls were projected to be in accommodation, air and water industries and in cafes, restaurants and food outlets. Overall, the gains experienced by some tourism industries will be heavily outweighed by contractions in some of the tourism characteristic industries.

Some very innovative and useful visitor safety programmes are discussed in the Adventure section of this book; however, as Tarlow points out in Chapter 7, tourists behave differently when away from home, often doing things in a state of disorientation or 'anomie'. So the tourism response must go beyond the minimum duty of care responsibilities in many cases, to understand and prevent reasonably foreseeable incidents from occurring in the first place. This is not to suggest that tourists do not have to take personal responsibility for their actions, but rather that the relevant authorities need to assist them in making informed choices. For example, some countries have severe penalties for drug trafficking. This should be drawn to the attention of visitors so that there can be no misunderstanding of the consequences if local laws are disregarded.

The Theory aims to overcome the problems of a typical bureaucracy and to improve the efficiency of the public sector by adopting business management skills and by emphasizing output and outcome of public policy rather than the input to implement the policy (Rosenbloom and Goldman 1998) . The Theory was accepted through the National Performance Review project during the Clinton Administration, and laid the foundation for FEMA's reformation (Waugh and Streib 2006) . The demand for the reformation of FEMA started from Hurricane Hugo, which hit North Carolina and the Virgin Islands in 1989, causing $15 billion in damages. In the aftermath of Hurricane Hugo, the Loma Prieta earthquake struck California, a fire broke out in Oakland, and Hurricane Andrew struck Florida and Louisiana, dealing a massive blow to the two states. Disappointed by FEMA's ineffective response to these massive natural disasters, political groups and citizens in the USA raised the need to improve FEMA's performance, which was endorsed by the Clinton Administration in 1993 (Anna et al. 2006 ). James Lee Witt, appointed as director of FEMA by President Clinton, emphasized disaster mitigation and shifted from recovery-oriented policy to preventionoriented policy. Additionally, he insisted that disaster mitigation investment should be based on the assessment of the effectiveness. Consequently, government policy has continued to embrace this line of thinking. To quantify the future savings of hazard mitigation activities, the Multihazard Mitigation Council (MMC) of the National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS) analyzed three major hazard mitigation grant programs: the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, Project Impact, and the Flood Mitigation Assistance Program.",13.446027688703381,7.505379605673259

Though earlier, the model system tobacco, which is easy to transform and manipulate, was the system of choice for production of most of the plant-derived recombinant proteins, today a large number of plant species are being used for this purpose including tomato, banana, rice, maize, wheat, carrot, soybean, pea, potato, lettuce and alfalfa. A wide variety of products can be produced in plants, but each one has its own requirement for its production. Therefore, no single species can be ideal for the production of all these products. The choice of the host species is associated with the type of protein in question i.e. the form of the recombinant protein which is to be finally used. The life cycle of the host, biomass yield, containment and scale-up costs are other deciding factors. The performance of any host depends upon many biological as well as geographical factors and needs to be evaluated on case by case basis. Therefore, success largely depends upon the understanding of species-or tissue-specific factors that affect the recombinant product accumulation and its quality. With the technological developments, a large number of plant species have attracted the attention of scientific community. Generally domesticated species are preferred over the wild species for molecular farming as they are adapted to wide range of environmental conditions because of their commercialization. But wild species could be more advantageous as they will not be mistaken for the food crops and would address the issue of food crop mix-up with transgenic material. The self-pollinating species are advantageous for the containment of the transgenic crops as compared to cross-pollinating crops as chances of spread of transgene through pollen would be minimized. The issue can also be addressed by using plants which can be grown in containment e.g. tomato which can be grown in green houses. Further, the use of plant cell cultures addresses the issue of containment where dedifferentiated cells such as in calli or cell suspensions are used and can be grown on industrial scale using fermenters (Shih and Doran, 2009 ). For the proteins which need to be purified, the downstream processing may affect the overall production cost to a large extent. Therefore, the host from which the extraction and purification of the recombinant protein is easy and economic, is chosen.",8.626580348110855,7.214509430203668

There are several reasons why local and national health institutions should invite nurses with disaster management experience to participate in decision making and action plans. First, nurses have invaluable frontline empirical experience as well as immediate and reliable information. Gottlieb (2004) stressed that nurses have always played a key role in case detection, infection control, public education, risk mitigation, and risk containment. Second, nurses form the largest professional group in the health care marketplace; hence, their inputs should be seriously considered and incorporated in the design of institutional missions and policies (Des Jardin, 2001) . Third, a significant part of nurses' responsibility is to act as patient advocates and ensure that patients retain their right to quality care and informed choice. DiGaudio (1993) asserted that the active involvement of nurses in policymaking would lead to better resource allocation. Meanwhile, increased participation would promote nurses' control over their practice and enhance the respect given to nurses as professionals. As such, political and action involvement at the local and national levels will offer nurses various opportunities to influence and seek changes in their workplace and to act as a voice for others.",10.10194384772693,4.880266239262523

These computer simulations have also provided a systematic platform to assess the effectiveness of different pandemic containment and mitigation strategies that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to evaluate in empirical settings.

[63] . Several groups consistently concluded that large-scale vaccination targeted at schoolchildren during the early phase of a pandemic would be the most efficient use of vaccines across a wide range of plausible scenarios. [47, 50, 64, 65] However, given that vaccine production required at least 4-6 months, initial waves of the pandemic would be largely over in most countries by the time pandemic vaccines became available. Therefore, large-scale vaccination at that stage would probably have limited value in reducing morbidity and mortality and a more relevant question was the optimal use of vaccines following an initial wave. A recent modeling study suggested that the optimal vaccination strategy would in general depend on the stage of epidemic at which vaccination begins. [48] Mathematical modeling was also used in the ""war-time"" during the 2009 influenza pandemic to inform situational awareness and public health decision making. In one example, a mathematical modeling approach was used to interpret surveillance data on influenza-like illness. [66] Although in the initial phase the model was unable to predict the course of the epidemic, once the epidemic peaked the model was able to accurately predict how long the epidemic would last, and the final attack rate. In the UK, an age-structured mathematical model fitted to influenza-like illness reports was able to track the course of the epidemic through time and provide timely predictions on the timing and size of the winter 2009-10 wave [65] . The results were subsequently validated on serologic data which showed substantial attack rates among children in certain areas of the UK in the spring 2009 wave [67] .",10.38016084890498,8.461743047051893

There has also been substantial investment in research infrastructure, essential to guide evidence-based policy locally as well as internationally. Following the World Health Organization (WHO) global alert in April 2009, Hong Kong health authorities initially operated under containment efforts, including entry screening at airports, ports and border crossings, hospital isolation of cases, tracing and quarantine of contacts, and routine antiviral prophylaxis. Once the first local case was identified on June 11, Hong Kong transitioned to mitigation efforts, with greater attention to public health promotion of preventive measures.

The Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 established specific requirements for hazard mitigation planning, and grants became available to allow local and state governments to use mitigation funds for predisaster planning. 6 In 2001 the actions of Sept. 11 pushed Congress to create the Department of Homeland Security, which was the largest reorganization of federal agencies since the Great Depression. 6 The magnitude of disaster recovery depends on the magnitude of the destruction. In a small local disaster, volunteer organizations such as the Red Cross and private insurers may be enough to aid victims. When a disaster overwhelms the recovery forces of a community, that community can turn to the state government, and ultimately to FEMA, for resources. Within the first 48 hours of a disaster, an assessment team should provide an initial assessment of the damage. This includes identifying immediate needs such as food, shelter, and infrastructure. A preliminary damage assessment by the local government will determine whether federal aid may be needed and should be requested. Once the immediate needs are identified, and if federal aid is requested, a second, more in-depth survey should be done by FEMA. This second survey should include asking the plans of the displaced citizens: Do they plan to move, or rebuild in the same spot? Public infrastructure, sewers, and storm drains should be examined. What about the town? What was there before the disaster? What currently exists? Were there any existing plans for expansion of the area that could be used for rebuilding? What are opportunities looking at the long term? 10 Every U.S. state maintains an Emergency Management Agency (EMA) and an Emergency Operations Plan. Their role is to establish and maintain an emergency program concerned with preparedness, response, mitigation, and recovery; to coordinate and train state and local governments; to recommend whether federal aid is needed in the case of a disaster; and to coordinate state and federal resources and act as an intermediary between local and federal groups. 6 In the past, the majority of these plans have been concerned primarily with the short-term response. 2 Recently many states have been trying to adapt to a more long-term response.",11.50824164987546,5.0829198482069335

Although some success of the live polio vaccine was contributed by excretion of the vaccine virus to contaminate waterways leading to the involuntary immunization of many, it is now established that it is unethical to vaccinate individuals who did not elect to be immunized and give their informed consent. There is also an economic basis for biological containment and nonsurvival of vaccine strains in the environment. This is most relevant for vaccines used to control infections in agriculturally important animals where commercial development is dependent on repeat sales of the vaccines. Kong et al. (2008 Kong et al. ( , 2012b described two regulated delayed lysis in vivo systems, one for delivery of protective antigens synthesized by the Salmonella vaccine strain and the other for delivery of a DNA vaccine for expression of the genes encoding the protective antigens within the nucleus of the cells in the immunized animal host. In the former case, the synthesized antigens can be delivered by a combination of using antigen secretion by either or both T2SS and T3SS, as well as by lysis (Juarez-Rodriguez et al., 2012b) . These strains are unable to persist in vivo and fail to survive if excreted. Kim et al. (2011) constructed a conditional lethal S. Typhimurium strain using an araC P BAD asd fusion using araC P BAD from S. Typhimurium SL1344 and asd from pYA3332. Strains with this genetic construction are analogous to the strains with ΔP murA ::TT araC P BAD murA constructed by Kong et al. (2008) . In both cases, strains will commence to lyse after several cell divisions, but will not persist as long or achieve as high titers in effector lymphoid tissues as the recombinant regulated delayed lysis strains constructed by Kong et al. (2008 Kong et al. ( , 2012b . Both constructions would provide complete biological containment. Grangette et al. (2004) used alr mutants of Lactobacillus plantarum and L. lactis and, like the ΔasdA Shigella strains (Sizemore et al., 1995; Vecino et al., 2004) , will commence to undergo lysis during vaccination even when d-alanine or DAP are supplied during the process. Both types of mutations confer complete biological containment. Lee (2010) described multiple means for attenuating and providing biocontainment to Lactobacillus strains, and noted that the genetically modified microorganisms (GMM) are no longer generally recognized as safe (GRAS). He also stresses that GMM vaccines cannot express antibiotic resistance attributes. He discusses alr mutants and then pyrimidine-requiring mutants and noted that thyA mutants are bacteriocidal in the absence of thymidine or thymine, whereas pyr mutants are bacteriostatic in the absence of pyrimidines. Furthermore, a thyA mutant of L. lactis was stably maintained in pigs. This was shown by Steidler et al. (2003) , who recognized that the thyA mutation with human Il-10 insertion might be replaced by a thyA + gene from some other bacterium. They were mainly concerned with survival/persistence of the thyA vaccine strain after excretion, such that thymine-less death under these conditions would be sufficient. This is interesting, since thyA mutants of S. Typhimurium are not attenuated (Curtiss and Kelly, 1987) . Of course, L. lactis does not need additional attenuation. It is therefore not clear whether a thyA mutation would be needed to attenuate or even provide biological containment in the intestinal tract, which contains substantial quantities of digested DNA components. Guan et al. (2011) fused a Fur regulated promoter P vluB to the ΦX174 E gene introducing transmembrane holes and tested efficacy in a laboratory E. coli strain. In animals, it is hard to know whether the iron concentration would repress or derepress the E gene. Thus, it might be well to couple the E gene with the ΔP fur ::TT araC P BAD fur construction ). Whether this system as described provided complete biological containment was not established. Wang et al. (2013) deleted the genes for the twin arginine secretion pathway (ΔtatABCD) to render E. tarda saltsensitive (also more sensitive to other stresses) and thus confer containment for use in a marine environment. However, the deletion was not sufficiently attenuating such that other means would be required in an E. tarda recombinant vaccine. No tests were done to see if this strategy contributed to biological containment.",8.543640154180668,8.07742385283332

ABSL-2 is suitable for work involving laboratory animals infected with agents that are associated with human disease and pose moderate hazards both to laboratory personnel and the environment [5] . It also addresses hazards from ingestion as well as percutaneous and mucous membrane exposure. Certain training requirements must be met, and this may involve institution-specific training. At a minimum, training for research personnel should include facility procedures, handling of infected animals and training on the actual administration or manipulation of the pathogenic agents being used in animal studies. Personnel knowledgeable of the potential hazards associated with these agents, as well as the relevant animal manipulation and husbandry procedures, should supervise individuals working at ABSL-2. One of the critical differences between ABSL-1 and ABSL-2 is in the introduction of engineering controls for primary containment at ABSL-2, usually in the form of a biosafety cabinet. These could include Class II A2-type biosafety cabinets that mostly exhaust to the room or Class II B1 or B2 biosafety cabinets that exhaust air to the outside at varying percentages. A biosafety cabinet not only provides a sterile working environment when used correctly, but also offers a primary protective barrier for personnel. When a risk assessment determines that an element of containment is needed, elevation of the agent's risk group and an increase of the biosafety level from ABSL-1 to ABSL-2 are indicated through assessing the risk to humans, animal, environment, or other factors specific to the work being conducted. Other engineering controls may also be administered, but the biosafety cabinet is the most common form of primary containment at ABSL-2. The biosafety cabinet also comes into play when manipulating infectious materials or conducting procedures that have the potential to produce aerosols. Biosafety cabinets may also be used for necropsy, harvesting of tissues, or even animal cage changes if required [5] .

If the imaging equipment is located inside high containment, subjecting the imaging device to decontamination procedures may increase the risk of damage (e.g. caustic etching of detectors, progressive degradation of device wiring insulation, corrosion of solder points). In general, BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratory areas are decontaminated by exposure to paraformaldehyde gas followed by ammonium bicarbonate neutralization. Frequent maintenance of MI equipment is often necessary, and requiring service engineers to enter BSL-4 areas is an untenable option. Two options were considered to permit safe insertion of the infected animals into the bore of the instrument without breaking the biocontainment barrier. One option is to place the animal in a closed containment tube that is then transported and positioned within the bore of the instrument. However, the logistics of maintaining ventilation and anesthesia of these animals while maintaining BSL-4 conditions inside the tube seem insurmountable. The alternative approach is to reconfigure the equipment, leaving only the bare minimum of components within the BSL-4 laboratory and developing an extension of the BSL-4 laboratory that protrudes into the bore of each machine. These unique challenges were innovatively addressed (de Kok-Mercado et al., 2011) by placing the bulk of the imaging equipment outside the BSL-4 suite (Fig. 2) . The high-containment zone is extended into the bore of each imaging device with the use of transparent biocontainment tubes made of polycarbonate resin thermoplastic (Philips Bioshield TM , North Ryde, Australia). This design facilitates routine maintenance of the delicate instruments by factory-trained personnel without entering the BSL-4 environment.

A possible explanation for the delay might be that the hMPV and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus were competing for the human host and that the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was disseminating faster in the population, thereby causing a greater number of infections and thus suppressing the hMPV epidemic for several weeks.

Risk Assessment and Containment: The process of risk assessment begins with the investigator's initial assignment of a biosafety level appropriate for the research that will be performed. The NIH Guidelines provide tools to aid the investigator in the initial risk assessment by classifying biological agents into risk groups according to their potential to cause disease in a healthy adult (Appendix B) [16] . Biological agents are assigned to risk groups 1 through 4, with agents that are not associated with disease in healthy adults assigned to risk group 1, and with each successive risk group 2-4 posing a greater risk to human health. It is important to note that the listing of biological agents in the NIH Guidelines is not comprehensive, and that an investigator should not assume that biological agents not specifically listed are properly classified as a risk group 1 agent. Once an initial risk group assignment has been made by the investigator, the NIH Guidelines describe appropriate containment levels for: -In vitro work in the laboratory and work in small animals that are of a size that is conducive to housing in cages that provide containment of biological agents, most often laboratory rodents (Appendix G) [16] , -Work with large animals that are of a size at which caging to provide containment of biological agents is not available and where the room itself provides containment (Appendix N) [16] , -Work with plants (Appendix P) [16] , and -Work with large volumes of biological agents in production facilities (Appendix K) [16] . b. Each containment level, defined as a BL, consists of a combination of appropriate microbiological work practices, containment equipment, and facility design features. Each BL, a combination of the above risk-mitigation strategies, is developed to ensure safe research with biological agents that pose a greater risk to human health requiring progressively more complex containment practices and facilities (e.g., BL1 through BL4, BL1N-BLN4, BL1P-BL4P, good large-scale practice (GLSP), BL1-LS-BL3-LS) [16] . 5. The NIH Guidelines require each institution to establish an IBC, which is responsible for reviewing research with recombinant and synthetic nucleic acids at the institution and ensuring that all such research is performed in compliance with the NIH Guidelines (Section IV-B-2) [16] . The composition of the IBC is specified in the NIH Guidelines to ensure that the committee includes members with adequate expertise to fully evaluate all research with recombinant and synthetic nucleic acids performed at an institution. For example, institutions performing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid work in plants, animals, or human subjects are required to have at least one plant, animal, or human subject research expert as a committee member (Sections IV-B-4, IV-B-5, and IV-B-6, respectively) [16] . Similarly, any institution performing large-scale research or research at BL3 or BL4 must appoint a biological safety officer (BSO) who must serve as a member of the committee (Section IV-B-2(a-(1)) [16] . The NIH Guidelines also require at least two members of the IBC to be unaffiliated with the institution to represent the interest of the surrounding community (Section IV-B-2(a-(1)) [16] . Other recommendations for committee membership may be found in the NIH Guidelines, Section IV-B-2-a [16] .

In addition, the best mitigation strategy may be to develop safe and effective vaccines that could prevent disease from some of the most serious biothreat pathogens.

Early characterization experiments should be done at a level of containment that may be in excess of what is used after the risk of the experiments is better known or fully studied. For those novel agents that are recognized due to a human disease outbreak, crucial experiments with live agent that demonstrate susceptibility (or resistance) of the ""unknown"" agent to possible treatments, cross-reactivity with available vaccines, and/or permissiveness of human cells to infection or biological dysfunction should be performed at a containment level commensurate with the information surrounding the novel agent's/toxin's/technology's discovery/emergence. In a practical sense, novel agents that are recognized due to high virulence, or are closely related to highly virulent viruses, should be initially characterized at higher (e.g. BSL-3 or above) biosafety levels or maximum containment. Those agents that are discovered by research into multifactorial syndromes and/or as adventitious agents not specifically linked to a disease in humans, animals, or plants can be dealt with at a lower containment level depending on an assessment of their risk to laboratory workers and/or the environment. This approach, however, is based on the explicit willingness of an IBC to downgrade the biosafety level at which work is initially performed once sufficient data are available that counter or inform the initial risk assessment. In the past, there have been only a few examples of human pathogens that were initially classified at a high biosafety level and then were downgraded. If downgrading is an unlikely event even in the presence of supporting data, it becomes ""risky"" for a scientist to (for instance) suggest BSL-4 classification of an ""unknown"" that causes significant disease in humans, as the low number of BSL-4 facilities greatly limits research and therefore the development of possible countermeasures. The Asilomar attendees knew, and expressly stated, that ""(t)he means for assessing and balancing risks with appropriate levels of containment will need to be reexamined from time to time"" [1] . Biosafety classification should therefore be re-assessed over time, weighing new or developing information that may condition scientific or public opinion about the pros and cons of the work to laboratorian (and overall public) health.",10.527922622976481,6.705857775028768

Of course, natural and political barriers can alter the structure of the contact networks, by possibly reducing interactions between infected and susceptible individuals, and thus delaying the course of the epidemics. While this effect may explain pandemic waves in wide areas (such as the US), its influence is much weaker when narrower areas are considered (e.g., at city level). Moreover, possible effects of containment/mitigation strategies may not be disregarded (Bootsma and Ferguson, 2007; Hatchett et al., 2007) , especially for more recent outbreaks. Other explanations for pandemic waves should be sought in the genetic variation of the influenza virus (Castillo-Chavez et al., 1989; Andreasen et al., 1997; Boni et al., 2004) , i.e., the appearance of new strains that could reduce or eliminate acquired immunity. However, the presence of more than one strain in the same pandemic outbreak has not been observed yet. Exogenous time changes in transmission rates, such as seasonal forcing, is a further candidate explanation (Colizza et al., 2006 (Colizza et al., , 2007 . While the role of seasonal forcing as a trigger of steady oscillations for endemic diseases, as measles, is well established (Fine and Clarkson, 1982) , and factors underlying the winter seasonality of influenza have been suggested (Hemmes et al., 1960) , the phenomenon can hardly be taken as a robust explanation of waves of pandemic flu (at least at local scale).",15.575443567341239,9.474522039817755

Each method of decontamination requires that the equipment be exposed for an extended period of time (h) to a highly reactive or corrosive chemical vapor for the destruction of microbial life. The same chemical exposure can also be very destructive to the electronic components and optics, and therefore, decontamination cycles should be kept to a minimum to avoid shortening the life of valuable equipment. Routine equipment maintenance is often performed by a factory-trained service professional, but many factory service professionals are barred (because of medical surveillance and biosecurity restrictions) or refuse to enter high-containment facilities, so equipment must be removed from high containment and decontaminated for maintenance or repair. This is a critical factor in the selection of equipment for use in a high-containment laboratory. Large devices that are difficult to move, complex instruments that need frequent service support, or equipment that must be installed by a service engineer are not suitable for use in containment laboratories. Small robust instruments that can be maintained and repaired by the operator are a better choice for this application. Physically moving the equipment to and from its site of operation also means that it must not require a service person to set it up for operation. To minimize equipment damage from decontamination while preserving the routine maintenance schedule for the facility and the HTS equipment, decontamination and maintenance of equipment are often coordinated with regulatory-required annual shutdowns of the BSL-3 or -4 facilities. This allows service personnel to safely enter the facility or for equipment to be removed from the facility for maintenance. In addition, training in advanced equipment maintenance should be given to high-containment laboratory staff who can troubleshoot and repair equipment as needed. Real-time cameras with a clear view of the equipment as well as the networking of instrument computers can assist more experienced technical personnel in directing troubleshooting operations from outside of containment, but for security reasons, there may be limitations on this type of access.",11.830728984444576,8.55400298019174

It takes a coordinated effort by the institutional environmental health and safety staff, the biosafety committee, facility manager, and the responsible investigator to maintain and update programs to comply with current regulations. For example, local Institutional Biosafety Committees are frequently chartered for oversight and approval of biosafety operations as well and should be included as early as possible in the process for guidance and approval of HTS processes within BSL-3 and -4 laboratories. Institutional Biosafety Committees may differ in their interpretations of the BMBL requirements and/or wish to add additional layers of safety to the operation, any of which could affect HTS operations in containment. A biosafety oversight example might be handling of microtiter plates containing infectious material when they are being moved from the BSC to another location, such as an incubator or a plate reader, within the containment laboratory. This may involve sealing and surface decontamination of the plate before removal from the BSC or use of secondary containment for transport of unsealed plates. If assay plates need to be removed from the Fig. 3 . The amount of personal protective equipment (PPE) increases with BSL.

The operator is shown manipulating a smallfootprint noncontact liquid dispenser. containment facility, then the IBC and EHS personnel are involved with determining what the proper decontamination process should be. Such requirements could affect the quality of the results and/or the number of plates that can be processed within a work day. One compliant solution is to seal the microtiter plates and surface decontaminate them in the BSC before reading them on the plate reader. This requires that the plate reader be capable of bottom reading the assay endpoint or that optically clear seals be used. Stackers should not be used because they can pose a safety risk (plate jammed inside of an instrument requiring decontamination) and add complexity to the instrumentation (which can increase instrument down time and increase service calls). Laboratory space within high containment is highly constrained, limiting the number of people and pieces of equipment in a room. This makes the standard BSL-1 and -2 procedures to increase throughput by duplicating equipment and/or increasing personnel either extremely costly or impossible to achieve. Now that computers are widely used to control laboratory equipment and collect data, it is possible to remotely access these computers for technical support from a remote location. This is done routinely using Webex (Cisco, San Jose, CA) or by using software like pcAnywhere (Symantec, Mountain View, CA) to allow access to computers for the purpose of troubleshooting software or equipment problems by trained personnel who do not have physical access to the computer. This is an extremely powerful technology that can quickly resolve a technical problem and prevent failed screening runs, but information security concerns might also prohibit remote access to computers inside the containment facility, making data transfer and equipment troubleshooting and repair more difficult. Finally, having duplicate equipment outside the containment laboratories allows for technical personnel to be trained in the best use and troubleshooting of the equipment without the restrictions imposed by working under high containment.",10.176179993177078,7.770606805690743

While the use of HTS equipment does not typically affect the global airflow within laboratories, the size and location of the equipment does have the potential to disrupt local airflow. For example, the automated HTS liquid handlers and dispensers that are used to prepare assay plates and dispense pathogen-containing solutions will generate aerosols during their operation and, therefore, must be contained within a BSC. When placing a large piece of equipment inside a BSC, two major factors must be considered. First, the BSC must be large enough to completely contain the equipment and still provide reasonable work space inside the cabinet. Second, the size of the equipment should not decrease the operator level of protection by disrupting the air curtain provided by the BSC. Preservation of the engineering controls in a high-containment HTS laboratory is more readily accomplished by the use of wider and deeper BSCs (1.8 m instead of 1.2 m width and 0.25 m extra depth), equipment with reduced space requirements (small footprint), and modular laboratory designs (mobile equipment and benchtops) for maximum process flexibility. Moving large, heavy pieces of equipment to and from fixed benches creates the opportunity for accidents and exposures in a containment laboratory. Mobile workstations for larger equipment, like plate readers, facilitate moving the equipment into the airlock when moving the instrument into the containment laboratory or for decontamination of the equipment to remove it from the biocontainment laboratory.",9.594385566985867,6.247779265976639

[29] , we introduce a time-varying human mobility pattern to model the time variation of global human travel due to the emergence of an epidemic. In this pattern, human mobility rates are governed by the global epidemic prevalence and the fraction of people who have awareness of the epidemic spreading. In addition, not just by simulation method, we also theoretically explore the impacts of the mobility pattern on metapopulation epidemic dynamics. Interesting results are found as follows: (i) the time-varying mobility pattern does not alter the epidemic threshold, but it can slightly lower the final average density of infected individuals as a whole; (ii) more importantly, we also find that the pattern can produce different impacts on nodes with different degree, and that there exists a critical degree. For nodes with degree smaller than the critical degree, the pattern produces a positive impact on epidemic mitigation; conversely, for nodes with degree larger than the critical degree, the pattern produces a negative impact on epidemic mitigation. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the metapopulation epidemic model with the time-varying human mobility pattern is suggested. In Section 3, by applying the MF (mean-field) approach, the theoretical analysis of the model is performed. Section 4 gives the simulation results. Conclusions and discussions are presented in Section 5. In addition, Appendix gives the method of calculating the critical node degree in details.",6.989485819634504,5.795408562644171

It is easy to see from Fig. 4 (a)-(d) that there always exists a common point at which the ρ S,k values are equal for the two patterns, regardless of the ρ value. Here, we denote the nodes' degree corresponding to the common point as the critical degree k c . For nodes with degree smaller/larger than k c , the relative density of susceptible individuals ρ S,k of the Case II pattern is higher/lower than that of Case I pattern. Moreover, it is noticed that the equation ρ S,k + ρ I,k = kρ/⟨k⟩ is always satisfied for these two cases. So we can derive that the relative density of infected individuals ρ I,k of the Case II pattern is lower/higher than that of the Case I pattern for nodes with degree smaller/larger than ρ c . This means that k c is a critical threshold with respect to the node degree separating the positive impacts from the negative impacts on epidemic mitigation. This phenomenon can be understood as follows. The nodes with higher degree have more individuals, and this is convenient for epidemic spreading inside those nodes. So the infection densities in the stationary state are higher than those in nodes with lower degree nodes. Compared with the Case I pattern, the Case II pattern can decrease the number of individuals moving among nodes. This will restrain, in some sense, the percolation of infected individuals from high infection density nodes to low ones.",5.291449016650575,4.853664248398959

Since the 12th century, quarantine and isolation of patients has been a structuring public health issue. Marseille in 1120 used the Fort Saint-Jean as a containment area and created the first lazaret in 1526 (under Aragon Spanish Kingdom rule), then built the first hospital Hotel Dieu in 1643 and the Lazaret of Saint Martin of Arenc installed in the northern part of the city in 1814. All of these quarantine stations were situated out of town but on the coast of Marseille. In 1821, a large yellow fever outbreak in Africa reached Spain, indicating that Europe was not protected against this disease. Finally, it was on the Frioul Island, at the forefront of Marseille, that was erected in 1828 the Caroline hospital designed by the architect M. R. Penchaud (1772-1833), able to assure the containment of 48 patients and 24 convalescent patients. Penchaud chose this place essentially because of the main direction of the wind (mistral), expecting to dilute the presumed contagious entities (miasmas). It was first used for the quarantine of soldiers evacuated from African areas with yellow fever. It was then rehabilitated in 1850 by the health architect Jean-Marc Samuel Vaucher (1798-1877) to replace the Arenc Lazaret. The Caroline hospital was renamed ""Ratonneau"" after the name of the island and would become the Lazaret Island, the largest quarantine station and isolation hospital of the Mediterranean region [19] . At this time, 2 theories were erected concerning contagion: that transmission was due to contact between humans, justifying quarantine; and that of Lazaret and others, who considered transmission to be due to miasmas that were carried by the air and trapped in contaminated areas. In the Caroline Hospital, the 2 theories were combined: isolation of patients and natural air circulation. Contagious patients were cared for in a specially isolated area next to the entry of the hospital, avoiding unnecessary circulation within the building, while the convalescent patients were placed next to intendancy and administration, the nurses being located in between ( Figure 1A and 1B). It is particularly interesting to note that these principles of protection implemented at the time remain valid: isolation, containment, air as a vector of asepsis, and easy cleaning of the walls to evacuate the miasmas.",7.610344413499799,6.562497307115066

These gaps are, however, likely to occur over a limited duration if the cases occur over several weeks and the numbers of cases are limited. As the number of cases increases, however, provincial and national capacity is likely to be tested in certain ways if clinical care and surveillance are expected to remain at a similar standard as when cases are limited. The results of such a scenario are similar for some countries of western Europe (21) . Although policy makers will, in all likelihood, need to consider issues of rationing and priority setting explicitly in national strategic planning, resources in Thailand are substantial overall, although geographic distribution likely poses logistical challenges. In the event of a modest outbreak of pandemic infl uenza (WHO phase 6) similar to these locally developed scenarios, Thailand, a relatively affl uent country in Southeast Asia, might encounter relatively modest gaps in available resources. However, if a pandemic is substantial in terms of the severity of illness and proportion of deaths, resources are likely to be insuffi cient, and policy makers will have to consider whether such resource gaps can be closed in reality. This conclusion has important policy implications and raises several questions. Should most resources and planning be focused explicitly on early containment potentially at the expense of mitigation, particularly in developing countries? How, to whom, and where should the deployment of scarce resources be planned (22) ? A further issue raised is how realistic simulation exercises are and whether they effectively inform preparedness planning. Investment to address gaps in resources can be focused where the most important gaps exist. Some gaps, however, for example, in clinical and nursing staff, will take time and considerable investment to fi ll.

In particular, we consider the idea of shutting down the schools in order to try to contain the spread of the disease. This approach is perhaps overly simplistic, as the contact patterns of children outside of school would be modified, and probably increased, after a school closure (see, for example, Eames et al. (2011) ), yet we include it to demonstrate the ease with which control strategies can be modeled and tested within the framework we present here. As above, we simulate epidemics using parameter values sampled from the posterior distribution, but we set the η parameters corresponding to Classroom 1 and Classroom 2 both equal to zero. Examining the resulting simulated outbreaks, a couple of observations can be made. First, this containment strategy does little to diminish the ultimate size of the outbreak. The left panel of Figure 6 shows a histogram of the number of individuals infected in the simulated outbreaks. While the outbreaks simulated under the containment strategy do indeed tend to be smaller, the difference is very small. (In fact, in both the presence and absence of the containment strategy, the epidemic affects almost all of the 187 susceptible individuals in virtually all of the simulations.) The right panel of Figure 6 gives a histogram showing the day on which the infectious group reaches its maximum size; we use this as a measure of the speed of the outbreak. We can see that the epidemic does spread considerably less rapidly in the presence of the containment strategy. These histograms indicate that this containment strategy, while only minimally effective in diminishing the ultimate size of the epidemic, is indeed able to significantly slow down the progression of the disease through the population.",11.509908801470946,8.667839547151488

It is very often found that adaptation is probably more challenging than mitigation measures given China's top-down political system. It might be easy for a nation to develop an adaptation plan, however, a plan is only as good as its implementation and realisation. For many developing Asian countries, this, perhaps more than the need for mitigation measures, is the real challenge. Apart from the need to finance adaptation measures, the other challenge is technology.

This may be especially true considering the stage of pig production sequenced feed is fed. For example, high health herds from nucleus farms, boar studs, or breeding stock multiplication units are critical to swine production. Porcine epidemic diarrhea infection in these herds would disrupt swine production and have devastating economic impact. Thus, sequencing alone may not provide enough hazard mitigation for these swine herds since the magnitude of the risk of infection increases when feeding larger populations (Davies et al., 2015) .

Between 30 April and 23 August 2009, more than 56 million individuals were scanned at border entries, 17,909 febrile patients were identified and 757 (4.2%) were subsequently confirmed. 13 Among the 9938 close contacts under medical observation, 551 (5.5%) were confirmed to have acquired the H1N1 infection. Such large-scale implementation of strong measures was supported by technological advances, including the distribution of PCR diagnostic kits to all public health and port-of-entry laboratory networks in early May. Beijing's experiences of these containment strategies were also shown to detect the H1N1 cases efficiently, with a considerable usage of resources. 14 The absence of large clusters until early June also suggests that the system succeeded in preventing sustained chains of transmission from the initial imported cases and in delaying the spread of the pandemic. The first 'local' cluster of 50 confirmed and 69 suspected cases without any clear links to international travel was reported in Guangdong province on 18 June, 38 days after the detection of the first 'imported' case. 15 A discussion was organized by the SAC on a possible adjustment of the control strategy. Given that the 'local' transmission was still quite limited and the schools in China would soon start the summer break, the SAC suggested that the containment strategy should be continued until July, which would significantly reduce the speed and scale of community outbreak. This suggestion was endorsed by the MOH and then at the level of the NRPC. To support this decision, the Ministry of Education decided to start the summer break at the beginning of July, approximately 10 days ahead of the usual schedule, and asked schools to cancel all unnecessary group activities during the summer holidays. This decision, together with the public health campaign at the community and public transport level, might allow China to experience 2 additional months of low pandemic activity.

Since then, there have been several participatory surveillance systems for influenza developed for different countries (see Figure 1 ). In 2008, Influenzanet, a European-wide consortium for monitoring influenza-like illness using participatory surveillance systems was established (Paolotti et al., 2014) . The Influenzanet network is composed of the United Kingdom, Sweden, Spain, Ireland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Italy, Portugal, and France. The consortium aims ''to rapidly identify public health emergencies, contribute to understanding global trends, inform data-driven forecast models to assess the impact on the population, optimize the allocation of resources, and help in devising mitigation and containment measures'' (Paolotti et al., 2014) . Although there are some differences in the participatory surveillance systems presented in Figure 1 , these systems typically collect some background information at time of registration and send surveys to registered participants at regular intervals, usually weekly, to gather data on disease symptoms experienced during the previous week. The symptoms data are processed and presented using maps or other methods aimed at informing the public of influenza-like illness activity levels. Challenges to participatory surveillance include recruiting and maintaining participants, accuracy of self-reported data, developing a nationally representative sample, and specifically monitoring at-risk populations. Despite these limitations, data from these systems have been shown to have similarities in trends and peak timing when compared to reports from practitioner-based surveillance systems (Paolotti et al., 2014) . Furthermore, data from these systems have also been used to assess vaccination coverage and inform epidemiological models for influenza-like illness (Paolotti et al., 2014; Wó jcik et al., 2014) .",8.554698018028734,2.3841837055762998

We present two simulation-based optimization models for developing dynamic predictive resource distribution strategies for cross-regional pandemic outbreaks. In both models, the underlying simulation mimics the disease and population dynamics of the affected regions. The quantitybased optimization model generates a progressive allocation of limited quantities of mitigation resources, including vaccines, antiviral, administration capacities, and social distancing enforcement resources. The budget-based optimization model strives instead allocating a total resource budget. Both models seek to minimize the impact of ongoing outbreaks and the expected impact of potential outbreaks. The models incorporate measures of morbidity, mortality, and social distancing, translated into the societal and economic costs of lost productivity and medical expenses. The models were calibrated using historic pandemic data and implemented on a sample outbreak in Florida, with over four million inhabitants. The quantity-based model was found to be inferior to the budget-based model, which was advantageous in its ability to balance the varying relative cost and effectiveness of individual resources. The models are intended to assist public health policy makers in developing effective distribution policies for mitigation of influenza pandemics.",17.070871122654168,10.80866740027225
A comprehensive decision-aid model for containment and mitigation has to invariably consider all of the above aspects,0.27741670167416105,3.1549108028411865,2.3731777667999268,a11653f5-26f6-482d-b9c1-4f543ad61f6a,custom_license/Two resource distribution strategies for dynamic mitigation of influenza pandemics,"Prediction of the exact emerging virus subtype remains a difficult task, and once it is identified, a surge production of sufficient vaccine quantities can take from six to nine months. 6, 7 Even if the emerged subtype has a known epidemiology, the existing stockpiles would be limited due to high production and inventory costs. 8, 9 Also will be significantly constrained the supply of antiviral, immunizers and other healthcare providers, hospital beds and supplies, and logistics. Thereby, pandemic mitigation has to be done amidst a limited knowledge of disease and population dynamics, constrained infrastructure, shortage of effective clinical treatments, and to-be-proven resource allocation policies. This challenge, faced during the recent H1N1 outbreak, has been acknowledged by WHO 9 and echoed by the Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 10, 11 The existing literature on pandemic influenza (PI) modeling aims to address various complex aspects of the pandemic evolution process including: (i) underlying spatio-temporal structure, (ii) contact dynamics and disease transmission, (iii) disease progression, and (iv) development of mitigation strategies. A comprehensive decision-aid model for containment and mitigation has to invariably consider all of the above aspects: it must incorporate the mechanism of disease progression, from initial infection, to the asymptomatic phase, manifestation of symptoms, and a final health outcome; [12] [13] [14] it must also consider the population dynamics, including individual susceptibility 15, 16 and transmissibility, 12, [17] [18] [19] as well as the behavioral factors that affect infection generation and disease progression; [20] [21] [22] [23] finally, it must incorporate the impact of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical measures, including vaccination, antiviral therapy, social distancing and travel restrictions, and use of low-cost measures, such as face masks and hand washing. [24] [25] [26] [27] In recent years, the models for PI containment and mitigation have focused on integrating therapeutical and nontherapeutical measures in search for synergistic strategies, aimed at better resource utilization. Most of these approaches implement a form of social distancing to reduce infection exposure, followed by application of pharmaceutical means. A number of significant contributions has been made in this challenging area. 1, 25, [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] One of the most notable among the recent efforts is a 2006-07 initiative by the Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study (MIDAS) 33 which examined independent models of large-scale PI spread for rural areas of Asia, 34,35 U.S. and U.K., 36, 37 and the city of Chicago. 38 MIDAS cross-validated the models by simulating the city of Chicago, with 8.6 M inhabitants, and implementing targeted layered containment. 39, 40 The research findings of MIDAS and other institutions 14, 25 were used in a recent ""Modeling Community Containment for Pandemic Influenza"" report by the Institute of Medicine (IOM), to formulate a set of recommendations for mitigating PI at a local level. 41 These recommendations were used in a pandemic preparedness guidance developed jointly by CDC, HHS, and other federal agencies. 42 At the same time, the IOM report points out several limitations of the MIDAS models, observing that ""because of the significant constraints placed on the models"" being considered by policy makers, ""the scope of the models should be expanded."" The IOM recommends ""to adapt or develop decision-aid models that can ... provide real-time feedback during an epidemic."" The report also emphasizes that ""future modeling efforts should incorporate broader outcome measures ... to include the costs and benefits of intervention strategies"". 41 It can indeed be observed that practically all existing approaches focus on assessment of apriori defined strategies; virtually none of the synergistic decision models are capable of ""learning"", ie, adapting to changes in the pandemic course, yet predicting them, to generate a dynamic optimal strategy. Such a strategy is advantageous in its ability to be state-dependent, ie, as being formed dynamically as the pandemic spreads, by selecting the optimal combination of available mitigation options at each decision epoch, based on the present pandemic state.",18.36501089372367,10.021011383070007

This pattern was probably an artefact of changes in testing priorities (as Hong Kong switched from containment to mitigation phase) rather than a real decline in epidemic growth. 10 Substantial declines have been seen previously in R t during SARS outbreaks, in response to implementation of government control measures. 1, 11 In contrast, there were no apparent substantial changes in R t through the first wave of H1N1pdm in Hong Kong, other than the suppression of R t during school holidays.",18.753182013804384,9.615326933057242

Laboratory-confirmed pandemic H1N1 cases were medically isolated and ususally prescribed oseltamivir treatment. Their close contacts were quarantined for 7 days and usually prescribed oseltamivir chemoprophylaxis. Imported pandemic H1N1 cases were sporadically identified from late April to June. On 11 June 2009, following identification of the first untraceable local pandemic H1N1 case, the Hong Kong government initiated a ""mitigation phase"" and announced immediate class dismissal in primary schools, kindergartens and childcare centers for 14 days starting from 12 June 2009. The school closures were subsequently extended to summer vacation in early July. Some containment phase policies, such as medical isolation of confirmed cases and contact tracing of airplane passengers, continued through June. On 13 June 2009, 8 public outpatient clinics were converted to designated flu clinics across the territory to provide low-cost highthroughput outpatient medical consultation, free laboratory testing for pandemic H1N1, and antiviral treatment. These public outpatient clinics resumed some chronic disease services in mid-August. Figure 1A shows the epidemic curve of notified pandemic H1N1 cases and associated hospitalizations from May through October 2009. Under containment-phase protocols, all laboratory-confirmed cases until 28 June were medically isolated in hospitals, and recorded as hospitalizations in the e-flu database.

Thus, a very high likelihood of occurrence with very small consequences may require simple [,] low cost mitigation measures [countermeasures] , but a very low likelihood of occurrence with very grave consequences may require more costly and complex mitigation measures.

If one assumes that the number of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic cases is several times as high as the number of reported cases, the case fatality rate may be considerably less than 1%. This suggests that the overall clinical consequences of Covid-19 may ultimately be more akin to those of a severe seasonal influenza (which has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1%) or a pandemic influenza (similar to those in 1957 and 1968) rather than a disease similar to SARS or MERS, which have had case fatality rates of 9 to 10% and 36%, respectively. 2 The efficiency of transmission for any respiratory virus has important implications for containment and mitigation strategies. The current study indicates an estimated basic reproduction number (R 0 ) of 2.2, which means that, on average, each infected person spreads the infection to an additional two persons. As the authors note, until this number falls below 1.0, it is likely that the outbreak will continue to spread. Recent reports of high titers of virus in the oropharynx early in the course of disease arouse concern about increased infectivity during the period of minimal symptoms. 6, 7 China, the United States, and several other countries have instituted temporary restrictions on travel with an eye toward slowing the spread of this new disease within China and throughout the rest of the world.

Such strategies could include isolating ill persons (including voluntary isolation at home), school closures, and telecommuting where possible. 9 A robust research effort is currently under way to develop a vaccine against Covid-19. 10 We anticipate that the first candidates will enter phase 1 trials by early spring. Therapy currently consists of supportive care while a variety of investigational approaches are being explored. 11 Among these are the antiviral medication lopinavir-ritonavir, interferon-1β, the RNA polymer ase inhibitor remdesivir, chloroquine, and a variety of traditional Chinese medicine products. 11 Once available, intravenous hyperimmune globulin from recovered persons and monoclonal antibodies may be attractive candidates to study in early intervention. Critical to moving the field forward, even in the context of an outbreak, is ensuring that investigational products are evaluated in scientifically and ethically sound studies. 12 Every outbreak provides an opportunity to gain important information, some of which is associated with a limited window of opportunity.

To achieve this goal, we built a large-scale two-layer locationbased social network model including an innovative location-based network to design vaccination strategies and an individual-based spatially explicit disease model to evaluate the efficacy of the above vaccination strategies. We implemented the network model in parallel algorithms to take advantage of a high performance platform of CPU to tackle the challenge of extremely intensive computation with millions of nodes and edges. The simulation results suggested that geo-social interaction patterns can be used to design effective vaccination strategies to contain epidemic outbreaks at the source. Increasing extents of local geo-social containment areas lead to decreasing control effectiveness because it becomes challenging to confine the spread of influenza within local containment areas. Especially when the local containment scale is larger than the upper limit, there is little difference in terms of spatial effectiveness. Vaccination designs should consider spatially heterogeneous population distribution and movement in an urban area. It is possible to confine disease outbreaks for early infections in the low population areas, even if local geo-social containment areas have been set too large. It is unlikely to confine disease outbreaks for early infections in the high population areas if local geo-social containment areas are set too large. This study highlighted the importance of identifying the population density for the early infections and an appropriate geo-social scale for local containment in order to achieve maximum control effectiveness with a limited number of vaccines.",9.794967046022451,7.973739471757424

This section only displays the simulation results with the random-based vaccination strategies, because the other two strategies display the similar patterns. Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 show the results of the two metrics: the number of infections and the success rate of local containment, respectively. They both display consistent patterns: the initial infections occurring in the higher population density areas can lead to higher number of infections (Fig. 4) because they increase the local containment failure rates with the same number of vaccines (Fig. 5) . For example, the disease transmission caused by the first infection from locations with a medium population density can areas be confined locally at a very high percentage (i.e., 80 %) with less than 100,000 infections using 350,000 vaccines ( Fig. 4b  and 5b ), whereas the same amount of vaccines can only successfully contain the disease outbreak from high population density locations less than 20 percent with more than 300,000 infections. Such patterns imply that we need more vaccine available in order to contain disease outbreak from critical locations with high human interaction density and large numbers of population flows from infected locations to others. Thus, it is essential to place sensors in the hubs of the locations to allow highly efficient outbreak detection. Fig. 4 and 5 show that increasing scales of local geo-social containment areas lead to decreasing efficacy of the same amount of vaccines. For example, the random-based control scenario with more than 150,000 vaccines can successfully contain the disease outbreak in a high population density area (Fig. 4 a) , but it generates less than 600,000 infections (Fig. 4 b) and more than 600,000 infections (Fig. 4 c  and d) . From the both (c) and (d) of the Fig. 4 and 5, we can tell that there is no obvious difference in terms of containment efficacy when the local containment areas are larger than certain scales in both (c) and (d). One explanation is that a certain number of vaccines have its threshold of susceptible population pool. The number of local control failure increases after the susceptible population pool goes beyond the threshold with the increasing local geo-social containment areas. When the disease outbreak occurs outside of the containment areas in the most simulation runs, the number of total infections finally reach similar amounts. We also notice that it is unlikely to confine the disease outbreaks caused by the first infection from high population density areas, if the local geo-social containment areas are set too large (Fig. 5c  and 5d ). When the first infection is from low population density areas, the likelihood to contain disease outbreaks within a large local geosocial containment areas is still very high ( Fig. 5c and 5d) . Thus, we can reach the conclusion that an appropriate geo-social scale for the local containment and the population density where the first infection resides are two keys for prevention strategies to achieve their maximum control effectiveness.",10.583536741349285,7.613184087499594

The simulation will stop when there are no new infections for six consecutive days (length of exposed period + length of infectious period). We randomly picked one infectious individual as the infection source in the study area on the first day of the simulation. Based on the strategy rationale, we considered the locations where the first infection visited as the original case cluster. The original case cluster and all of the rest locations which have the population flows to the original case clusters were used to determine the first level local containment scale. The second level geo-social local containment scale was determined by all of the locations in the first level local containment area and the locations which have the population flows to the locations in the first level local containment area, so were the third, the forth, and the fifth level local geo-social containment scales. Though the location network was dynamic over time in a day, the strategy design was based on the total population flows among different locations within one day for a practice purpose. It is more practical to design vaccination strategy at a daily basis instead of at an hourly basis. In order to understand the impact of the spatially heterogeneous population distribution and mobility on the design of vaccination strategies, we randomly pick the first infection 10 times with varying total number of individuals in the first level local containment area (i.e., 1000, 5000, and 10000). The larger number of individuals within the first level local containment scale is caused by the high local population density which potentially leads to more complicated population interaction and mobility to larger geographical regions.",11.02470565232149,7.484662546092062

For the first metric, a better vaccination strategy is expected to generate a lower number of infected cases. For the second metric, we measure how well we can contain the outbreak at the source. If the number of infections outside of the containment areas identified by geo-social interaction patterns is zero, we consider the local containment successful. Otherwise we consider the local containment a failure. Fig. 3 show the containment effectiveness of three typical vaccination strategies in which the first initial infections occurring within the first level local containment scale with approximately 5,000 individuals in the city of Portland according to the two metrics: the number of infections and the success rate of local containment. Fig. 2 illustrates that an increasing number of vaccines can produce a decreasing number of infections. The random-based vaccination strategy generates the largest number of infections, followed by the degreebased and betweenness-based vaccination strategies. The latter two vaccination strategies produce the similar control efficacy in which betweenness-based ones lead to a relatively faster decreasing number of infections. The explanation of such patterns is illustrated in the Fig. 3 . Fig. 3 shows that an increasing number of vaccines can produce a decreasing number of local containment failure rates. In other words, betweenness-based vaccination strategies can contain disease outbreak at the local geo-social scales more successfully than the other two vaccination strategies. One reason is that betweenness-based vaccination strategies target high risk individuals who lie on the bridge among different communities, so they can control epidemics more effective through preventing epidemic outbreak from the local geo-social containment areas to outside areas.",11.625446403718277,7.13081353271375

The criteria weights are represented by a vector of scalar quantity given by: Scw = (Scw 1 , Scw 2 . . ., Scw n ) T , where 0 Scw i X, X being an integer whose value is usually determined during the decision-making process. 4. A range of scalar vector defines the utility value of a design option. This is given as U k = (u 1 k , u 2 k , . . .u n k ), where u i k is determined by a scoring means that assigns a utility value for a given design alternative based on its comparative performance in a given KPI. 5. A vector of linguistic terms can also be mapped into a fuzzy set of utility values. For example, let L k = (l 1 k , l 2 k , . . .l n k ) be a linguistic vector that defines some qualitative indicator such as Fecological impact as to assessment under EIAO._ As illustration, for a bridge pile operation, the assessment may consider mitigation measures required to prevent excavated soil from contaminating and polluting the seawater thereby impacting the wider ecosystem. The set of linguistic terms may include: L k (low-level mitigation measures, {Yes, No}, high-level mitigation measures {Yes, No}). These could be mapped into equivalent scalar utility vector: U k = {(a 1 ,b 1 ), (a 2 ,b 2 )}. Examples of low mitigation measures to counteract such ecological impact include the use of cofferdams and silk curtains. Thus, a scalar utility vector of the form U k = {(a 1 , b 1 ), (a 2 , b 2 ), (a 3 , b 3 ). . .(a n , b n )} can be further associated with a given vector of linguistic terms, where a i , b i represent corresponding assigned values. 6. For a given set of sustainability KPIs, the decision maker (e.g., designer) would select an applicable subset of criteria based on the location-specific considerations, as applicable to a project under consideration. This indicates a need for tool(s) that facilitate the composition (construction and deconstruction) of indicators Fon the fly._ Let the selected subset be defined by Sc = {Sc I -1 ,",10.543190565916865,5.236721361204523

The native organism is not always ideal as an immunogen if it cannot be adequately purified. Panels of mAbs against complex antigenic mixtures, such as a whole bacterium, require more downstream work (secondary screenings) in order to determine which molecule is targeted (Western immunoblots, immunoprecipitation, etc.). This can be further complicated when dealing with a biocontainment level 3 or 4 organism which must first be inactivated and then brought out of containment to level 2 for mAb production.

Design and operational protocols in BSL-3 containment address hazards to personnel related to inadvertent inoculation, ingestion, and exposure to infectious aerosols. BSL-3-Ag, an augmented form of BSL-3 containment, addresses concern about the risk of environmental exposure to pathogens of consequence to agriculture by adding filtration of supply and exhaust air, sewage decontamination, exit personnel showers, and facility integrity testing. BSL-4 containment is used for work with dangerous and exotic agents that pose a high individual risk of life-threatening disease that may be transmitted via the aerosol route and for which there is no available vaccine or therapy. BSL-4 guidelines mandate daily inspection of facilities and equipment, extensive training, and monitoring of personnel for signs and symptoms of infectious disease.

However, prevention and control strategies are more difficult than those for influenza pandemic, since morbidity is different and no vaccine or specific treatment agents against this new virus are expected in the near future. The recent identification of locally transmitted cases outside China without identifiable links suggests that the containment strategy might have reached its limit. While we have concentrated our effort on the containment of imported cases so far, what we have observed are calls for the preparation for the next stage: sustained transmission in countries outside China.",10.043732806239332,8.897261986601185

Koch35 and Barbisch et al36 argue that quarantine of whole communities could be ethically justified, particularly if the containment area included the entire area within which individuals from a community would usually travel. Koch35 describes this as a spatial focus for quarantine rather than one focused on a targeted population. It allows for better concentration on humanitarian medicine for the infected, as far greater concentration of resources would be available for a smaller pool of infected people. A call for “spatial” quarantine for EVD containment may be at odds with the “principle of least infringement”, an ethical principle applied in public health contexts to curtail the use of liberty-restricting interventions to the least restrictive action required to meet a public health goal. But when the public health goal is containment of an infectious disease to meet the dual goals of enabling the best possible care for the sick within the quarantine zone, as well as to reduce the spread of infection, such a measure could be ethically justified. Restrictions should therefore be done in a way that is relevant, legitimate, and necessary, and stakeholders should be fully informed about the risks and benefits, especially as they affects their health, well-being, and personal liberty.37 Those quarantined should also not suffer unfair economic penalties.37",9.710485573672095,7.88852125865419

HEV infection may be asymptomatic in industrialized countries, where it can be considered quite rare, with a tendency toward an increase, possibly mediated by migration flows from endemic countries [12]. Consumption of raw meat of infected animals, in particular pigs, as well as occupations involving contact with pigs or biologic pig materials have been identified as possible routes of transmission. Different studies have shown that in swine workers the prevalence of subjects with detectable serum anti HEV immunoglobulin G (IgG) is higher than in general population [13], but data regarding seroprevalence might be affected by the different kits used for the analysis, showing significant variability in levels of sensitivity. Therefore, the real incidence of HEV infection in the general population and among workers cannot be estimated yet and further research is needed. Collecting this information is also particularly important because HEV might have a dramatic impact on human health, and in particular in pregnant women.

Effective public health interventions, including social distancing, contact tracing, and isolation/quarantine rely on the rapid and accurate identification of confirmed cases. However, testing capacity (having sufficient tests and laboratory throughput) to support these non-pharmaceutical interventions remains a challenge for containment and mitigation of COVID-19 infections. We undertook a sentinel event strategy (where single health events signal emerging trends) to estimate the incidence of COVID-19 in the US. Data from a recent national conference, the Conservative Political Action Conference, (CPAC) near Washington, DC and from the outbreak in Wuhan, China were used to fit a simple exponential growth model to estimate the total number of incident SARS-CoV-2 infections in the United States on March 1, 2020, and to forecast subsequent infections potentially undetected by current testing strategies.

Here we devise a simple model to predict the effectiveness of different mitigation strategies. The model consists of a set of simple differential equations considering the population size, reported and unreported infections, reported and unreported recoveries and the number of Covid-19-inflicted deaths. For simplification, we assume that Covid-19 survivors are immune (e.g. mutations are not considered) and that the virus can only be passed on by persons with undetected infections. While the latter assumption is a simplification (it is neglected that e.g. hospital staff may be infected by detected patients with symptoms), it was introduced here to keep the model as simple as possible. Moreover, the current version of the model does not account for age-dependent differences in the death rates, but considers higher mortality rates due to temporary shortage of intensive care units. Some of the model parameters have been fitted to the reported cases outside of China 1 from January 22 to March 12 of the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic. The other parameters were chosen in a plausible range to the best of our knowledge. We compared infection rates, the total number of people getting infected and the number of deaths in six different scenarios. Social distancing or increased testing can contain or drastically reduce the infections and the predicted number of deaths when compared to a situation without mitigation. We find that mass-testing alone and subsequent isolation of detected cases can be an effective mitigation strategy, alone and in combination with social distancing. However, unless one assumes that the virus can be globally defeated by reducing the number of infected persons to zero, testing must be upheld, albeit at reduced intensity, to prevent subsequent waves of infection. The model suggests that testing strategies can be equally effective as social distancing, though at much lower economical costs.

To incorporate containment policies in our formalism, we consider that a given fraction of the adult population κ 0 is isolated at home whereas both young and elderly people are assume to stay at home . In this sense, let us remark that parameter κ 0 allows us to tune the strength of those containment mesaures proposed to contain COVID-19. In this sense, κ 0 = 1 reflects a total lockdown of the population which isolates the households from each other, thus constraining the transmission dynamics at the level of household rather than municipality. From the former assumptions, we compute the average number of contacts of agents belonging to each group g ∈ {Y, M, O} as",8.092814770255707,7.433724826991536

The confinement leads to a reduction in the number of daily contacts to the household size and mobility. Furthermore, the confined population is subtracted from the pool of susceptible individuals but corrected accordingly to the permeability of the households φ (understood as the probability of members of a household to skip confinement for purchase of essential goods).

In our case, the containment has an effect on both terms. First, κ 0 reduces the pool of individuals susceptible of contracting the disease, i.e. it reduces the term ρ S . And, second, κ 0 reduces the average degree of the individuals and thus it reduces R 0 . Eq. (S50) allows us to accurately determine the effective reproduction number and capture the impact of human mobility and containment measures on the spread of the disease. Computing Eq. (S50) by means of the NGM approach involves the calculation of the spectral radius of tensor Z, which hinders an understanding of the roots behind the transition from flattening to bending the epidemic curve triggered by an efficient confinement, as illustrated in the main text. In order to have an analytical estimation of the critical value of the needed confinement to observe this transition, κ c 0 , let us consider a single well mixed population.

Social distancing measures imposed by state authorities can hardly be fine-tuned enough to hit this critical interval precisely. Furthermore, herd immunity within these intervals is at best 15% percent of the population and would hence not provide sufficient protection for a second epidemic wave. The main reason for the narrowness of the mitigation interval as well as for the low critical value R min is the household structure. Infections within the households for patients with mild progression can hardly be avoided and therefore a small number of infection links between the households can already make the epidemic overcritical. In the subcritical domain we observe a strong dependence of time till extinction on the outreproduction number R*. Reasonable extinction times are only achievable for very low values below 1/3 secondary infections outside of households. We conclude that instead, an extinction strategy implemented by quick, effective 11 .
