The hospital in SC appeared to have more patient-centered care, while the hospital from GN appeared to be more profit-oriented. It is suggested that these differences in mentality were due to differences in resource allocation systems, and security of funding. Following the financial decentralization, performance-based payment systems have been prevalent in Chinese public hospitals, which may have encouraged gaming within the health system to raise additional funds by charging from patients [32] . This approach is not encouraged in the TB clinics, however it is entrenched within practice as operational costs are not fully met by the government. Loss of income due to free TB treatment policy may be a universal concern [11] . Hospital providers may thus comprise the standardised TB treatment through unnecessary prescription of drugs, tests and admissions for general TB patients. These distorted incentives constrain the patient-orientated care provision and can negatively impact on the care of patients. While government funding has largely improved for public health facilities such as CDC, there is an urgent need to increase funding to subsidize the newly integrated public-health services in the hospital. The resource allocation mechanisms in TB control seemed to favor the CDC, and so hospitals may suffer from a ""reallocation"" of the TB control budget from the CDC. Integration requires transfer of funds for care from the CDC to the hospital. An appropriate budgeting mechanism needs to be explored to ensure equitable allocation of resources and successful integration as in the case of SC. Different practices of hospitalizing TB patients in SC and GN could also reflect the conflicts between the clinical and public health perspectives of TB care delivery. Clinicians in the hospital should be educated to improve the public health awareness, and specifically implement an outpatient-based systematic public health TB approach. Both sites presented the challenges of retaining qualified TB personnel. To ensure that TB services are sustainable and maintain a high quality of care, fair pay should be provided to attract and stabilize a motivated and skilled workforce.",33.49794554574462,14.340833973408841

The World Health Organization (WHO) highlighted the value of national surveillance systems in the International Health Regulations (2005) , an agreement among all member states to develop and maintain sufficient capacity for the detection, reporting, and control of public health threats of international concern [2] . Infectious disease surveillance should enable (i) the timely detection of outbreaks, (ii) the quantification of health problems, (iii) the identification of subpopulations at risk, and (iv) the assessment of temporal trends including the impact of control strategies [3, 4] . National surveillance systems typically collect data from patients seeking care at sentinel hospitals or other healthcare facilities and can provide useful information for public health purposes. However, hospital-based surveillance generally underestimates disease burden since only a proportion of cases visit a hospital for care [5] . Low case detection may also undermine the value of hospital-based surveillance for outbreak detection. Moreover, if patients captured by the surveillance system are not representative of all cases in the community, surveillance statistics could lead to erroneous interpretations of disease patterns and misallocation of prevention resources. In particular, sex, socioeconomic status, or distance can affect healthcare seeking at hospitals, especially where access to care is limited [6] [7] [8] [9] .

Routine surveillance has continuously evolved since 2010, expanding in scale and scope with more sites reporting on more conditions every year since. The ability to add diseases and conditions to the system before and during outbreaks, and if necessary set up enhanced complementary components such as cholera surveillance exemplifies the system's adaptability, scalability, and flexibility. The planned integration of community-based surveillance will improve detection of health threats in rural communities where health-care utilization is very low. 20 In line with CDC and WHO guidelines on Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response, the system should be integrated to coordinate and streamline the portfolio of existing surveillance activities and to maximize efficiency and resources, rather than trying to maintain separate vertical activities. 21 The experience of establishing a surveillance system of national scope in Haiti utilizing existing surveillance infrastructure highlights the fact that it is more efficient to integrate existing disease surveillance data flows into a matrix-like structure where vertical (or in-depth) surveillance systems capture the information necessary to meet the surveillance data needs of a horizontal (or broad) system. Cholera surveillance provides a working example of a vertically designed module capable of being integrated into the horizontal routine system. Such an integrated and centralized platform of surveillance is a step in helping Haiti to conform to the 2005 IHR core capacity requirements for surveillance and response. 22, 23 Through a resolution in 2008, WHO emphasized the role of public health laboratories by calling for the organization of a national public health laboratory that would link national, regional, subregional, and international laboratories. 24 Internationally, the national laboratory has already developed partnerships with the relevant regional laboratory (Caribbean Public Health Agency) and reference laboratories (e.g., CDC-Atlanta). Within the country, the national laboratory is working on implementing in-country regional laboratories that will greatly improve the laboratory component of the surveillance system and ensure that laboratory results are linked in surveillance system with cases. Integrating laboratory confirmation into routine surveillance and its complementary systems is essential to minimize delays in taking public health action. 20 The laboratory-enhanced surveillance system represents a significant step in the long-term transition toward laboratory-based surveillance and a model for how the laboratory testing can be best integrated into routine surveillance STRENGTHENING NATIONAL DISEASE SURVEILLANCE AND RESPONSE activities as capacity in this field continues to grow. However, much work remains to be done along this axis. As one example of an area for future improvement, the ongoing implementation of electronic laboratory information management systems will allow testing results to be linked with case data in real time. Furthermore, laboratory diagnostic capacity at the level of health facilities across the country needs to continue to be improved in parallel to the strengthening of regional reference laboratories. To achieve this, in parallel to building diagnostic capacity at this level, sites should be encouraged to routinely send samples to the national laboratory as a part of their quality assurance program.",34.54644052232564,15.622669216154428

Convincing policy makers of the benefit of planning and investing in animal surveillance for public health gain is often challenged where data on burden of zoonoses are scanty and when the threat is not immediately apparent zoonotic and/or not an existing emerging disease threat.

The EU-level task to promote best practice exchange among member states was regarded as influential, which is represented by a top position in one of the rankings presented in this paper. With regard to the task of establishing monitoring and evaluation structures, some respondents perceived the status of the EU health information system rather as a failure. This corresponds to observations in the literature indicating that although ground work such as the development of a common EU health indicator set is acknowledged [50, 51] further efforts are needed to implement and maintain health indicators [51] and to develop a permanent and sustainable EU public health monitoring and reporting infrastructure that supports decision making in public health on EU level [50, 51] . Respondents agreed that cooperation in the area of public health between member state representatives and experts as well as with other stakeholder groups has increased and has been facilitated by the EU through various projects, networks, forums, and platforms. This trend was mainly positively perceived since it supported EU-level public health policy by accumulating and exchanging knowledge, generating public support and a legitimacy to act on certain fields [3] . This finding is corroborated by the literature on the potential of new governance instruments for health-and social policy-making at EU-level [11, [52] [53] [54] . However, these new governance instruments can also be regarded as a rather strategic investment of the EC to keep topics on the agenda until a political window of opportunity opens but as an ineffective policy tool to enforce and implement action in due course [6] . The collaboration of a diverse set of stakeholders as it is the case for example in the EU Platform for Action on Diet, Physical Activity and Health can lead to actions that constitute rather a compromise of various interests. Consequently, the results might be disappointing from the viewpoint of public health experts [6, 55] . A final judgment on the impact of facilitating collaboration is to be awaited and may only be made in the long term future. It will require different ways of measuring 'impact' compared to the analysis of domestic adaptations when implementing EU hard law [56] .",30.56471712509656,12.65739974470886

For example, Collaboration and System Integration sub-themes pertain to multiple health-care stakeholders. Multi-sectoral partnerships and engagement has also been noted as important domains for PHEP operations in the US [86] . Opportunities for generating knowledge to examine complexities such as system integration could address knowledge gaps and inform operational activities and policy. Another notable knowledge gap relates to the theme of Quality Improvement and Performance Standards. Multiple publications have noted the importance of quality improvement and development of standards or metrics for PHEP [5, 9, 88] . Despite this, little research was identified that has empirically examined the development of standards and metrics. Research in PHEP that advances empirical knowledge in this area would be valuable. This review has several limitations. First, this study specifically focused on research that was relevant to the actions and activities of public health as defined for the Canadian setting. The findings therefore may not translate to other countries that have differing scope of public health responsibilities. As was noted in the emergent themes, the importance of integration and collaboration within the health system is key for PHEP, and it is possible that this review did not capture the extent of public health connectedness to the rest of the health system, as found in the literature. This focus on public health was carefully defined, however, with the purpose of identifying themes and relevant knowledge gaps that specifically pertain to public health agencies and departments. Second, as with all systematic reviews, there is a possibility that literature was missed, which may have resulted in a lack of recognition of key themes or gaps. We used a rigorous search strategy for the indexed and grey literature to minimize this. In addition, we conducted stakeholder consultation in order that experts in the field would provide information and contribute knowledge that was missing. As a result of this iterative approach, additional articles were included in the final thematic analysis. Third, computer simulation studies were excluded due to scope of the current study, with a focus on the field-derived primary research studies. An attempt to account for themes that resulted from datacharting of this group was done and compared with the final emergent themes. In general, these studies pertained to vaccination and outbreak management, which were captured under themes of Communicable Disease Control or Surveillance, Epidemiology and Public Health Information. Finally, quality of research studies was not assessed beyond research design in this review and for this reason, the themes identified in the literature and the knowledge gaps do not take into account specific methodological strengths and weaknesses of the included studies. While quality assessment is ideal to include, we addressed the varying quality in the PHEP literature by focusing on identifying a group of articles that did not include event reports or 'lessons learned' commentaries, and focused on primary research studies.",29.742600484449994,13.837336770013735

This is not surprising given the integral nature of surveillance and epidemiology to public health, as well as the manner in which quantitative data are used for analytic processes to assess risk or measure outcomes of public health emergency events. Efforts in the US to identify key domains for PHEP are consistent and have similarly identified 'health surveillance' [86] . Communication is an area that has been noted to be problematic in post-emergency event assessments; thus, it is positive that research is emerging under this theme [6, 87] . The social behavioural facets of communication relating to PHEP have recently been explored in the literature. For example, concepts of trust and preferences for certain characteristics of messaging highlight the contextual aspects that are emerging from PHEP communication research [40, 43, 45] . Important knowledge gaps were identified for communication in PHEP relevant to the use of emerging technologies. Education, Training and Exercises was another theme in which preliminary study on approaches to training for 'hard skills' such as technical skills and 'soft skills' such as leadership has been undertaken [53, 54] .

For these reasons, surveillance systems for HAI, including AMR patterns, are an essential component of both national and facility IPC programmes. National IPC surveillance systems also feed in to general public health capacity building and the strengthening of essential public health functions. However, a recent WHO survey on the global situational analysis of AMR, showed that many regions reported poor laboratory capacity, infrastructure, and data management as impediments to surveillance [16] . In our inventory of IPC national strategy or action plan documents, most (79%) contained guidance relating to the establishment of priorities for surveillance, despite some regional variations.

Although not routinely done, proactive and stable funding for these and other scientific inquiries provides opportunities to increase the knowledge-base from which decision-makers can draw when considering appropriate infection control actions, a suggestion supported by several scientific organizations. For example, longer-term studies, such as those on New World hantaviruses, have produced a great deal of information relevant to public health [82] , including changing infection prevalence with species richness [83] , the preponderance of infected males [84] , and the role of climatic changes in causing fluctuations in rodent reservoir populations and their links to localized, sporadic disease outbreaks. Although these studies were initiated as part of a reactive response to an acute outbreak-in this case, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome-in 1993-1994, the information produced addresses key knowledge gaps that can inform future outbreaks. Similarly, research supported during and after EVD outbreaks has generated data on wildlife reservoir hosts and people's perceptions of health and healthcare practices, both of which could inform future outbreak assessments and response efforts. In addition, funders should establish a process through which the results and assessments can be communicated to public health decision-makers, leveraging the recent movement towards open access publication requirements. As a positive example, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and The Wellcome Trust require all grantees to make their results publicly available, enabling access to various stakeholders, including decision-makers [85] [86] [87] .

This does beg the question how we can achieve faster dispersal of funding resources that can be mobilized in public health emergencies like this, whether through the WHO or World Bank or others. Dedicated teams of experts that can tackle such challenges perhaps also need to be convened to see if they can help lead global efforts. These need to be initiated in days and not weeks or months.

As outlined in the examples above, EU laboratory networks coordinated by ECDC as well as the European Commission over the last years have brought public health added value through fitforpurpose harmonization and validation of laboratory methods, quality assurance and training activities as well as contribution to preparedness and response for biological threats. The EULabCap surveys concluded that the EU/ EEA as a whole has a strong and improving public health micro biology system (7) . Its key assets include harmonized methods for AST, extensive reference laboratory services, and laboratory inputs within national and EU surveillance networks. The use of molecular typing for surveillance and laboratory participation in outbreak response showed significant progress. In an era of rapid progress in electronic recording and transmission of health data, it is noticeable that half of the EU/EEA countries have implemented automated electronic reporting of microbiology laboratory data to their national communicable disease or antimicrobial resistance surveillance systems (7) . To track the transmission of resistance genes needed for targeted control measures, ECDC has developed a protocol for genomicbased surveillance of carbapenemresistant and/or colistinresistant Enterobacteriaceae at the EU level (56) .

(5, 6) . The GDD Operations Center has a team of six staff and a Director with professionally diverse backgrounds, e.g., human and veterinary medicine, microbiology, and epidemiology, and is situated within dedicated space located within CDC's Emergency Operations Center (EOC), with which we liaise both during GDD Operations Center supported international deployments of CDC teams and also when the EOC is activated to respond to an international disease event. Both official information sources, e.g., ministries of health or agriculture and WHO, as well as unofficial and unverified reports from media sources are reviewed. The latter are verified through a global network of public health professionals. Information sharing is built on trust and an understanding of how to appropriately handle information, particularly when it is not in the public domain and disclosure could harm relationships with partners. Information about disease events also comes from CDC subject matter experts in both the United States and those assigned to programs abroad. We also utilize disease-specific sources, which are particularly useful with regard to pathogens that typically are laboratoryconfirmed prior to reporting (e.g., influenza, polio), and although laboratory confirmation may result in delays, such etiology-specific sources typically are rapid in reporting verified cases. We monitor outbreaks from infectious and non-infectious causes including those attributable to disasters, intoxications, and chemical, radiological, or nuclear releases. We also monitor outbreaks of unknown etiology, many of which are later determined to have an infectious cause. Outbreaks among animals may also come under surveillance for known zoonotic diseases and to assess signals that may herald emerging or re-emerging outbreaks of human disease. Regardless of the type of outbreak or public health event, increased awareness of such an occurrence is critical for rapid public health response.

The public health system is the lead in responding to outbreaks and in minimizing the impact of diverse emergencies on health [2, 3] . Public health sector activities in infectious disease emergencies include leading other emergency management organizations during outbreaks, conducting surveillance and investigation, implementing control measures, developing guidance for health-care practitioners, and communicating risks [3] . In addition, public health is the lead sector in preparing for the population health effects of non-infectious events incited by natural or anthropogenic hazards. Emergency preparedness levels have been a concern globally in past emergencies; for example, Canada's response to the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak raised a number of issues: lack of surge capacity in the clinical and public health systems, difficulties with timely access to laboratory testing and results, and weak links between public health and the health care system were clear gaps in preparedness [3] . Recognizing complex and system-level challenges that affect emergency preparedness efforts globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) has called for all countries to create resilient integrated systems that can be responsive and proactive to any future threat, although this remains a knowledge gap [4, 5] . While risks vary for different communities, disaster and emergency preparedness is recognized as essential for all nation-states [4, 6] . Local and regional public health agencies aim to mitigate risks and protect population health; however, they face challenges to ensure readiness for potential emergencies ranging widely in likelihood and impact.

For example, analysis of data obtained through the HealthMap system found a bias towards increased reporting from countries with more media outlets, more developed public health resources and greater electronic communications infrastructure [25] . the internet, and, in some cases, the high costs of accessing data (e.g. GPHIN) have the potential to compound the degree to which developing countries are underrepresented, with negative repercussions for national surveillance capacity and investment in disease control. Efforts have been made to identify factors associated with disease emergence so that surveillance resources can be focused where emergence is most likely [1,24,31 -33] . While progress has been made in analysing the geographical distribution of emerging disease events to identify emergence 'hotspots' [24] , the data informing these models are currently limited.

National primary care bodies can coordinate with public health leads to cascade information to practitioners, communicate with the public, and collate health intelligence from the frontline primary care. 8 The Ebola crisis taught us a valuable lesson about what happens when an outbreak takes health workers away from core functions to focus on crisis response; the number of people who died from reduced access to usual care probably exceeded the number killed by the virus. 9 Strong health systems built on comprehensive primary care are able to integrate both functions, disseminating the emergency response resources and information required to community-level staff who have the breadth of training required to manage new suspected cases alongside routine family medicine.

Many variables cannot always be accounted for, such as travel history, previous medications (including prophylactic treatment), animal movements and owner compliance. Travel of dogs across regions and borders in particular affects data interpretation; ideally, anomalous results would be traceable to the animal so that a history could be obtained. The nature of the diagnostic test used would also aid interpretation of a positive result, for example, whether the test suggests active infection rather than previous exposure. Furthermore, animal-sentinel surveillance is an indirect method of measuring risk to human disease, and it is difficult to translate data obtained from such surveillance into a measured risk to humans. Therefore, it would be prudent to focus on the trends, patterns, and emergence of pathogens rather than to try and quantify risk. While not a limitation of dogs as sentinels, there is also the issue of funding sources, as it is not immediately obvious whether a sentinel-surveillance study of companion animals would fall under the mandate of the CFIA, which is typically concerned with animal health and food safety, or the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), which includes disease prevention and response to public-health threats in its activities.

Neither the entire USA, nor the entire Florida state, was declared at risk during its notification in July 2016. Instead, precise public health surveillance identified two at-risk areas situated at Miami-Dade County. Mosquito control measures focused on those areas. After six weeks, when the health officials were convinced by ongoing surveillance, restrictions in one area was lifted and resources were mobilized to the other area [9] . So precision public health is a concept that guides precise interventional strategies to address public health problems among precisely defined population using precise surveillance data [13] . Instead of issuing high alert for impending outbreak for entire country at a single point of time, it can be done more precisely at different place at different point of time based on geospatial modelling, simulated using precise surveillance data.

As with curative services, government successfully reduced the cost but maintained the operation of public health services and CDC by encouraging self-sufficiency through the charging of fees for inspections and vertical programs, and there is good evidence of reduced wastage and improved productivity and efficiency in this regard (34) . However, again there were problems with over-servicing of facilities who could afford the fees and ignoring weaker ones with greater problems. In food safety, this was shown by the rising incidence of hepatitis, typhoid and paratyphoid from 1979 to 1988 (19) . Public preventive health activities (public goods without direct benefit to consumers) that were not profitable were often neglected or ignored; fees were even charged for vertical disease control programs (such as those against TB and schistosomiasis) despite national targets indicating their priority in the 7 th and 8 th five-year plans (7), an acknowledgement of the reliance on their implementation by staff whose participation could only be guaranteed with a financial incentive (or who charged fees regardless of services being notionally free). New charges for specific activities such as vaccination, control of schistosomiasis, TB, leprosy and also MCH reduced their uptake and impact. However, rather than cancel vaccination fees, the government introduced an immunization insurance scheme to counter falling coverage (apparently with good effect) (15) , and fees for routine vaccination were only officially banned in 2007; the sale of optional vaccines (including several of the new vaccines recommended by WHO) remains a significant source of income for CDCs in China. Decentralisation of social service funding resulted in differential services according to counties' and townships' ability to fund them and the level of prioritization of public health by local authorities. Vertical lines of communication and control of the health system by health authorities also weakened (19) . Administration of township health services gradually devolved from county to township governments, and the township health facilities divided into clinical and preventive sections, with separate funding, revenue and reporting streams (15) . Most EPSs reported to local government rather than to higher levels within the health hierarchy, exacerbating the politicization of data and probability of its desensitization. Local government was usually more concerned with economic than social indicators, and disinclined to report bad news like disease outbreaks. They were also disinclined to spend public money on CDC when they could use it to make the county rich.",30.311070742916456,14.698262415278938

Reported cases based on positive test results are often only the top of the surveillance pyramid ( Figure 1 ). The degradation of information through the surveillance hierarchy remains a challenge, with detailed records that are somewhat unstructured at the individual physician level and highly structured surveillance records with limited data fields, less detail and, for some countries with a poor ability to examine the original records at national and, thus, at EU level. Surveillance data need to be timely and distributed to those who need it for the early detection and control of outbreaks, for measuring the impact of interventions, or for undertaking research. Surveillance may be compulsory or voluntary, active or passive, case-based or aggregated (although aggregated data is usually less useful). Some environmental surveillance data can also contribute to disease surveillance processes. Ensuring that public health infrastructures are adequate is the best preparation for the coming changes in infectious diseases that will result from climate change and other drivers. It is therefore important to review existing surveillance systems and the data they provide as part of a response to these future risks.

There is increased risk of disease transmission because of huge influx of those attending the event. Overcrowding and overwhelmed medical services in such gatherings often aggravate the risk of infectious disease outbreaks [3] . Considerable challenges are posed by a mass gathering event (MG) in terms of communicable and noncommunicable disease surveillance, emergency preparedness, environmental health, vaccination, crowd management, and various other issues [4] . In spite of the fact that MGs are an undeniably regular activity of our society that are attended by huge crowds, such gatherings are not very well understood. Even though such gatherings are accumulations of ""well people,"" vast number of people associated with MGs can put a serious strain on the entire health care system [3] . Along these lines, such MG events are more perilous and hazardous in terms of higher incidence of injury and illness compared to population in general [5] . Preplanning for MG events is crucial, and identification of potential health risks can be a vital element in pre-event planning for a MG [6] . Broadly, it includes health management and major incident planning [7] . Public health managers need to plan for, and respond to, a wide range of incidents and emergencies that could affect health or patient care. These could be anything from extreme weather conditions to an outbreak of an infectious disease or a major transport accident related to the MG event [1] . It is important to note that planning for MG events offer a chance to enhance health service delivery, strengthen public health systems, and escalate health promotion activities [8] but failure to plan sufficiently can also disturb the routine health services as the existing system is not attuned to deal with such gatherings of people [9] . The aim of public health at MGs is to prevent or limit the risk of injury or ill health and boost safety for participants, spectators, and residents of host community. Scope of planning for MG is largely dependent on the type of event, risk assessments (RAs), and available resources. Unfortunately, effective preparedness to mitigate and control health risks are inadequate when it comes to planning and management of MG events, especially in countries with poor resources [1] . It is important to note that public health priorities are determined based on the assumptions laid down during initial stages of public health planning of MGs [10] . For instance, in the development of any surveillance system, utilizing syndromic surveillance during MGs requires making suitable inquiries of the data before the event. Those inquiries are a result of RA, a process which has to be performed before and during the event in order to determine what public health-related outcomes will potentially occur and whether these outcomes can be addressed through syndromic surveillance [11] . RA serves as an initial step in the process of planning [12] . RA for a MG is a process that determines the intent and implementation of risk reduction measures, response planning, and capacity building for health functions. RA for MGs is undertaken to empower the public health authorities to identify and evaluate the generic characteristics of a MG which introduce or escalate specific threats. It incorporates assessment of the potential public health effects of the MG [1] . Systematic assessment of risks also helps to identify the potential health security risks that require cooperation of other departments and government agencies [8] . Existing research in the field of MG health is dedicated to the development of rapid diagnostic methods, monitoring and response, and treatment and vaccines. Public health surveillance systems are less likely to include information on non-infectious health threats such as air quality, which can be extremely important for event organizers. This area poses particular challenges for traditional public health surveillance which is generally designed to detect when things happen. This is where RA comes into picture [13] . For example, the leading causes of morbidity and mortality during the Hajj are heat-related illnesses and trauma-related injuries. Identification of such risks had allowed event planners to instigate preventive measures and rapid response strategies. For instance, provision of shaded areas reduced the incidence of heat-related illnesses and effective crowd control reduced the risk of a stampede. Drug and alcohol use were identified as health risks for other types of MGs [14] ; therefore, restriction of their use mitigated the associated illnesses. In the context of limited resources, it has been suggested that one can choose to alleviate more likely events even if their potential impacts are smaller. Events that are catastrophic, but extremely unlikely, can then be given less priority [15] . During religious gatherings in India, some special events and unforeseen events occur at the places of religious MGs besides fixed places of worshipping. Special events like idol procession, chariot pulling, fire walking, and animal sacrificing happen pulling larger crowds within the MGs and causing more damage to human beings and property. History is in replete with incidences when MGs at fairs and festivals of India have turned into the hotspots of various types of risks [16] . Fire incidents have been reported to have occurred as a result of plastic sheets used as construction material for building cottages as temporary shelters for the pilgrims and also due to the use of liquid petroleum gas cylinders in the Kumbh mela premises and presence of unplanned and faulty electrical lines near lodging areas [17] .

Diagnosis by microscopy is the gold standard for malaria and is used in most hospitals in China. However, the current capacity of microscopists to manage malaria cases in hospitals and public health facilities to meet the surveillance needs to eliminate and prevent the reintroduction of malaria is unknown. Methods: Malaria diagnoses were assessed by comparing the percentage of first visit and confirmed malaria diagnoses at Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCs) and hospitals. The basic personnel information for public health departments and hospitals at different levels was investigated. The skills of microscopists for blood smear preparation and slide interpretation were also examined at the county and township levels.

In the third section, I reexamine the rationale for restricting new medicines to clinical trials (at any stage of the development process and for any patient population) to show that its objective to protect public health, now or in the future, could soon be defeated in a pandemic. Furthermore, I suggest that the method used to achieve such a public health objective (which places a burden of scientific proof on researchers to gather evidence of safety, and in most cases 2. I thank James Wilson, whose teaching notes filled gaps in my knowledge of pandemics. 3. In addition, the fact that the Chinese government failed to notify the WHO about the spreading virus until it was much too late added to the problems. efficacy, before making a new treatment widely available) may require judicial application. However, in the fourth section, I discuss why some regulation of clinical research, despite the extreme circumstances of a pandemic, is ethically required. In light of these points, in the fifth section, I explore how regulation might offer a good balance between the need to widen therapeutic access to new treatments and the need to gain scientific information. I suggest that the use of research designs such as cluster randomized controlled trials (CRCTs) might be suitable in this instance. Randomized cluster trials can be used to introduce a new therapy in a stepwise fashion to the population at large without restricting it first to a series of trials and only then distributing it more widely. Those clusters waiting for the therapy act as controls in the meantime. The distinction between research and practice thus falls away, at least for the purposes of therapeutic access. However, as I show in the sixth section, there are important moral limits to the use of alternative research designs, as described earlier, especially in such a crisis. These must be carefully considered before mounting clinical research along what may become politically divisive lines. These limitations, however, might not be prohibitive in the end, but serious attention should, nonetheless, be paid to how social conflict and attendant health inequalities could be mitigated by their use.",31.935739493187782,13.132179603512864

This paper's main goals was to direct attention and open the doors for a scientific discussion among professionals and academics to direct research in this field to bridge the gap and increase visibility of health problems in Arab countries. Health policy makers in Arab countries should identify gaps in public health research and allocate funds to carry out studies to fill these gaps. It is hoped that such a study will serve those who draw future plans regarding public health to direct research into research areas mostly needed based on the changing political and social atmosphere in the Arab world. Both communicable and non-communicable disease problems need to be made visible to the international health organizations as well as governmental health bodies in Arab countries in order to set priorities for funding and financial allocations. Furthermore, this study should enable academics and investigators to search for most potential international investigators who share the same public health interest in order to cooperate successfully in research and publications. International publications should be directed toward making serious and common health problems in Arab countries more visible to internal and external audience in order to take an action by those in the authority. Definitely, topics like environmental health and preventive medicine need to be over emphasized, not only at the research level but also at the academic and governmental levels. The present data show a good start and promising rise for research activity in public health in Arab countries. However, research output in environmental and occupational health is still low. Studies in the field of preventive medicine as well as epidemiological studies in Arab countries are particularly needed. Investing in more international and national collaborative research projects should be highly encouraged. One potential method to broaden such international cooperation is through academic scholarships, exchange visits of graduate students as well as investigators. Establishing national specialized institutions for public, environmental and occupational health at the level of the entire Arab world is helpful and will make cooperation, even among Arab countries themselves, stronger and better.

Thanks to the worldwide spread of diseases coupled with the easy access to network information, communicable diseases such as Ebola, did not only affect the locations of the outbreak but also could cause panic or even major public health events in non-endemic areas. In the public health field, increased Internet searching implied the tremendous need of Ebola-related preventive knowledge to the public. That is to say, high attention areas could be more susceptible to rumors or false online information if public health authorities did not address the emerging public concerns in a timely manner. To handle the demand warranted by this emerging situation, traditional epidemiological methods and public health education modes were obviously inadequate. Online surveillance, with the aid of opinion indices, may have sensitively detected the emergence of serious infectious diseases at their initial stage via the Big Data platform in previous studies, which could buy time for controlling outbreaks of these diseases and reducing the risk of transmission to humans [28, 38, 39] . That is to say, this modality, different from classic epidemiology questionnaires and telephone interviews developed to know the public reaction after the disease outbreak, enables surveillance beforehand and saves health resources. More importantly, online surveillance can reflect public reactions to emergency public health events and disease outbreaks in a timely manner so that public health interventions can be implemented during epidemic crises to avoid deterioration. Additionally, compared to the classical health education mode aimed at high-risk populations in high morbidity regions, our results implied a need for a shift in health education methods to a public-attention-based mode, especially in non-epidemic areas, to identify the regions of high attention. This new mode should be based on the findings of opinion monitoring through public reaction indices like BDI and SMI. Different interventions, in the future, should be adopted for areas with different indices, more attention being targeted at high-index areas in terms of public propaganda and education.",34.47166502810253,16.141886062600776

The broad and multifaceted practices of surveillance approaches are used to monitor the progress and outcome of interventions to mitigate or stop the progression of an outbreak, including of economically and ecologically important animal or plant species and the transmission of zoonotic diseases among animal and human populations over space and time, as well as to predict future transmission patterns [20, 22] . Currently, disease outbreak surveillance and detection relies heavily on the astute individual: the clinician, the veterinarian, the grower, and the livestock manager noticing both routine and suspicious symptoms and bringing them to the attention of the public health or veterinary community including academics and zoological parks. Most developed countries have a surveillance system in place and the ability to detect and diagnose human and animal diseases. Innovations and strategies for the surveillance and detection of human and animal diseases, and assessing the resource needs and opportunities for improving and coordinating infectious disease surveillance, early detection, tracing, case investigation, prompt reporting, and management are needed in upholding health systems strengthening and future sustainable development in most under resourced countries [21, 22] . Technological advances in disease surveillance and detection that have benefited public health surveillance such as rapid, automated, and sensitive biosensors; portable sampling and assay systems; and DNA-based diagnostic tools remain to be adapted to track animal diseases. Models and interventions incorporating M&E systems and true coordination and collaboration would enable optimal surveillance response, thereby driving policy and action, with a feedback process to facilitate continuous evolution and adaptation [20, 21] . Information would be drawn from a broad range of disciplines relevant to physical and mental health, as well as domestic and wild animal health and plant health, through the complementary processes of agent or disease surveillance and host and environmental monitoring with potential economic benefits of surveillance systems for all. Nevertheless, the release of surveillance information should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, as trust is not built by merely sharing data, but by helping people understand information that is context-specific. Active engagement to discuss the perception of risk of outbreak and identifying priorities for action is also essential. Community or regional active surveillance systems, new effective rapid diagnostic methods, and prompt reporting have the potential to advance infectious disease control and prevention efforts in Africa and elsewhere. Although, the Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community-Based Epidemics (ESSENCE), operated by the Department of Defense, allows epidemiologists to track-in real-timesyndromes reported in daily data feeds from regional hospitals and clinics, it is yet to be actively implemented in most Africa countries. Due to the persistent outbreaks of infectious diseases across Africa, it is crucial to analyze the applicability of surveillance response systems in order to improve the ability of hospital/health center triage systems to identify and appropriately treat patients who show symptoms associated with an emerging infectious disease, a threat of an infectious disease (e.g., influenza, SARS, and Ebola, as well as potential bioterrorism agents such as anthrax and smallpox), or an emerging infectious disease. Laboratory diagnosis may be possible by building a network of information about early warning alert and response systems that travels up or down the public health hierarchy, from the local to the international level and vice versa [20] [21] [22] . 4. Shifting towards an effective public and global health paradigm Due to globalization, health for all under the ""One Health"" initiate calls for immediate Ebola and other outbreak actions plans. A future, in which outbreaks and bioterrorism agents are continually reengineered to evade standard detection and diagnostic methods, as well as therapeutics, is imagined. Hence, Africa and the global community has no choice but to move from postsymptomatic to presymptomatic detection and diagnosis, and to prompt effective surveillance response systems that seek to benefit the global community. Ultimately, to reach the best-case scenario stage in which microbes are ubiquitous, constantly evolving, and adapting requires community and national surveillance policies to inform and guide action on the basis of importance, not for reaction and emergency to dictate priority [21, 22] . There is no magic bullet for changing paradigms; steady progress, albeit being slow, can be made through small successes. This needs to be properly recognized as an effective engine for change to educate the next generation of leaders early in their careers and encourage greater global, inter-, and trans-disciplinary awareness in future public health professionals. The quest for EEE in shifting the public and global health paradigm to achieve the MDGs post the 2015-2030 agenda, the ""One Health, One World"" and other global health initiates requires: Community outreach and advocacy, and local and international mobilization to combat outbreaks in Africa and globally.

The revised IHR outline specific minimum core public health capacities and implementation processes that nations need to adequately address acute public health threats. Although 194 states parties signed onto this legally binding treaty, progress toward implementation of the IHR has been very slow. The initial target for full IHR implementation was 2012; however, even by 2014, only 33% of nations indicated that they had successfully implemented these minimum requirements. 4 To jumpstart stalled progress toward implementation of the IHR, the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) was established in 2014 with the goal of increasing national government support for IHR implementation and fostering a multilateral and multisectoral approach to developing health security capacity. Currently consisting of more than 50 countries, and with support from intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), the GHSA provides support for nations to assess their existing health security capabilities, identify gaps, and formulate plans to fully implement the IHR to ensure domestic and international capacity to detect, prevent, and respond to health security threats.

Applied research should increase our understanding of the health system needs of schistosomiasis control, while development strengthens the capacity of the health system to meet the needs of disease control. In so doing, there are four important considerations. a) An important theme running through this paper is to shift away from the commercialisation of the public sector and move towards strengthening of the role and integrity of the public sector in schistosomiasis disease control. This is apparent in the strengthening of policy-making in government, intersectoral action for health, the importance of equity as a key value, the access to treatment, the provision of public goods and the strengthening of resource management and planning. These need to be broken down into specific measures, such as strengthening surveillance systems, urban and rural health insurance, and funding for public goods and services. b) An underlying value of the whole approach to the control of schistosomiasis is that of equity. On the one hand, this requires a reaffirmation of public service values around health systems based on improved and more equitable health and health care.

Even with the recognition of adverse health outcomes in migrant populations, providing secure access to equitable health services for populations of migrants can be difficult. These difficulties can exist even in nations with long-standing immigration programs. For nations that have only recently begun to deal with the growing dynamics of international migration, the difficulties can be much greater. Professional and population education, training, and orientation to societal values in health promotion and maintenance, disease prevention, and health services utilization also take time and commitment to achieve. 68 New and evolving populations of migrants and mobile populations can result in rapid arrival and growth of large communities with diverse characteristics, which include social, linguistic, cultural, and economic status; these can be associated with disparate health outcomes. Access to and utilization of health and medical services by some foreignborn communities may have a different pattern than those of the host population. 69, 70 Specialized services encompassing linguistically and culturally competent providers, designed for the problems of migrants, will be required to ensure adequate health-care programs and service delivery models. Similar features may need to be integrated into public health and disease-control programs designed to mitigate health threats or risks. 71 This is reflected in the need to have educational and instructional information prepared in the language of migrants at an appropriate level for comprehension, and the need for translation or visual tools to deliver messages in a culturally appropriate manner. 72 Depending on the location and health sector capacities, these forces can affect the design and function of the health program. Migrant-specific programs may be more effective for the migrant community, but they may engender additional costs and resource demands. Additional challenges occur as a result of migrant diversity itself and can be seen in many locations where demands or needs for culturally competent health services can extend across several nationalities and ethnicities. Strategies to deal with these situations include (1) support for acculturalization and integration to allow migrants to better use domestic medical and health services and (2) the provision of migrant-specific or migrant-friendly health services. 73 National, regional, and municipal differences in migrant history and demography make it unlikely that a single approach will be applicable to all venues. 74 However, modern information technology and networking does provide opportunities for the sharing and exchange of best practices and information across cultural environments. 75, 76 The legal or administrative status of the migrant does affect access to services and care. 77 Migrants in an unauthorized situation and some foreign-born women 78 have been shown to have a lower utilization of health services than the local population. For example, health services may be too costly for migrants who do not have health insurance coverage. Although linguistically appropriate health services are available and affordable, they may not be used because of migrants' lack of information about their rights and entitlements or out of fear for deportation. 79 Limitations to traditional responses to the health challenges of migration Traditional approaches to health and migration frequently deal with specific diseases, primarily communicable diseases of public health significance that may be associated with the arrival of migrants. 80, 81 Coordinated attempts at the international level to manage infectious disease transmission were organized and consolidated into the International Health Regulations (IHR), which was revised in 2005. 82 Some nations with integrated and long-standing immigration programs have systematically screened applicants for permanent residency status (immigrants) and some other classes of mobile populations (such as temporary resident applicants, including foreign students or migrant workers 83 ), for various health conditions and illnesses. Immigration medical screening, quarantine, and isolation have been used in attempts to address the possible introduction of health threats by exclusion. 84 Major immigration-receiving nations continue to use these processes to reduce the impact of health disparities in arriving mobile populations. 85 Important as they are from a legal and administrative perspective, programs and policies that continue to embrace responses of inspection and exclusion will be increasingly costly and ineffective in the context of modern migration and population mobility. 86 Furthermore, attempting to manage or mitigate health risks in arriving travelers, when many of the health risks may be latent or subclinical, without affecting international travel and commerce is operationally and logistically impractical.",29.366270263650765,13.67369415549493

Although discrepancies are expected in any pandemic planning nationally or internationally due to the uncertainty associated with pandemics, it is important to have a consistent basis for planning, especially if it is to be applied at both local and national levels. While Malawi developed communication strategies, strengthened influenza surveillance and updated overall goals in PRPI, most response actions addressing the 2009 pandemic failed to achieve the important public health goals that the plans set out. We found that the national pandemic plan was not updated regularly and experts in influenza emergency management were rarely consulted. A number of gaps in national action were also identified, including poor coordination between national policymakers with local stakeholders, weak leadership in the influenza working committee and lack of surveillance structures such as IACs and diagnostic laboratories. There is need for coordination between the private and public sectors in order to continue providing essential services such as water, energy and safe transport. Cooperation on influenza activities would reinforce the implementation of PRPI, but this would require that responsibilities and actions are defined phase by phase. Influenza research focusing on the national and local context is important to manage challenges and problems that might be experienced during the influenza outbreak. In addition, there is need for political interventions to improve pharmaceutical logistics which in turn would improve the availability of vaccines and other drugs, enabling people to be vaccinated on time during seasonal and pandemic periods. However, there is also a need to ensure that the public is aware that influenza is a reportable disease. Most importantly, there is a need to upgrade laboratory networks and diagnostic capacity, to include active sentinel surveillance through the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) and other operational structures like FluNet. In general, PRPI operations can be strengthened through effective IEC activities such as communicating real time surveillance data or communicating the nature, spread, peak and decline of influenza (both seasonally and during pandemics) to the general public. This can be done by electronic means, phones and meetings.

The WHO recommends reinforcement of routine surveillance capacity both from an epidemiological and virological standpoint to monitor influenza. This requires collection of sickness reports combined with laboratory and clinical investigations as valuable indicators of the occurrence of influenza. It is essential to monitor for influenza-like illnesses (ILI), including severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) during influenza season and non-season periods. Unless these ILI and SARI are characterised and monitored, policymakers will not be well informed on the burden of respiratory diseases in order to prioritise resources and plan public health interventions to mitigate influenza infections.

Big data-based electronic surveillance, by commercial bodies and government agencies (for profit or population control), which draws on a plethora of internet-and mobile device-based sources, has been widely accepted, if not universally welcomed.

Fourteen agreed or strongly agreed with statements about the core MBDS values of cooperation, mutual trust, and transparency, and their own contributions to national and regional disease control (average score of 4.4 of 5.0). Respondents felt they implemented well to very well activities related to surveillance reporting (average scores 3.4 to 3.9 of 4.0), using computers for their work (3.9/4.0), and using surveillance data for action (3.8/4.0). Respondents reported that they did worst in implementing research (2.1/4.0) and somewhat poorly for local laboratory testing (2.9/4.0) and local coordination with cross-border counterparts (2.9/4.0), although all 15 maintain a list with contact information for these counterparts and many know their counterparts.

This should begin with an unbridled global joint signaling structure which encompasses syndromic surveillance and risk surveillance for emerging zoonoses. The signaling structure should foster a regular rapid flow of information between veterinary and medical health sectors, give early warning of pathogen emergence, and focus on determinants of disease emergence. Parallel systems of processing evidence regarding the proposed diagnosis, interventions, medical measures, and other public health strategies to assist decision making, emergency preparedness, and response should evolve in the lines of the existing evidence updates resources. Emerging zoonoses causes serious health threats and global economical losses. Countering them mandates the adoption of a one-health approach involving various stake holders, including ecologists, to understand the hostÁ parasite interaction in the natural reservoir and to understand the ecological constraints, often limiting adaptation to other hosts. Providing early warning of zoonotic pathogen emergence requires a one-health surveillance system at local, regional, and global levels. Evidence updates on diagnostic, preventative, and therapeutic interventions; antimicrobial resistance; and public health policies would support clinicians, public health practitioners, scientists, and policy makers to prevent and control emerging zoonoses. To accomplish this, a multi-disciplinary evidence-based strategy integrating with the existing EBP resources would provide a useful tool.

Geographic modelling approaches, mostly informed by spatial ecology, attempt to fill gaps where no data has been observed, hence inferences may be uncertain, as the underlying ecological process may be poorly understood and dynamical aspects of the invasion process are ignored. These deficiencies can be ameliorated, in part, by adding virus genome data that contain information about past transmission and invasion patterns [103] . However, due to incomplete and poor sampling (as discussed above), genomic data alone may provide an incomplete picture of the timing of viral introduction and spread among locations. This, in turn, can be supported by the addition of epidemiological time series of reported cases and serological information about population immunity [104, 105] . Despite this, building a joint inference framework that combines all available data sources and which characterises observation and sampling processes correctly is a daunting task. However, we are entering a period where the data for this task are becoming available in a timely fashion but need to ensure that results are communicated as soon as they are generated in order to avoid delays.

It must be however observed that unrestricted free open access to data may lead to users being overwhelmed and unable to make sense out of the data, unless there is available capacity and capability for appropriately analysing and synthesizing the data into valuable information for policy-makers, implementers, care providers, researchers, health-related institutions and stakeholders including the community. This requires increasing and improving human resource capacity side by side with the call for unrestricted free open access.

For the public health community, however, there is a vital need for affordable and open access by all to such resources.

Specifically, more resources should be provided to CDC's Division of Global Health Protection at this component of the CDC's Center for Global Health works with ministries of health and other partners to protect the health and improve the well-being of people globally by building public health capacity to prevent disease, disability, and death from communicable and noncommunicable diseases. In support of this, screening at airports for Ebola was carried out from August to November 2014 of estimated 80,000 travelers of 12,000 that were en route to the United States, none of which were reported as symptomatic with Ebola during travel since these procedures were implemented [32] . Screening from passengers from hot zones has to be done in a culturally competent manner to ensure risks and benefits of cooperation are fully understood to minimize bias in histories.

While there is significant agreement within the public health community regarding the use of data analytics and informatics techniques as being central to the success of any biosurveillance program, the development of machine learning and data analytic techniques specifically designed to handle heterogeneous datasets at massive scales has been especially challenging. These challenges can be attributed to the lack of standards and tools that facilitate data/information exchange and secondly, to the lack of available data analytic frameworks that can automatically integrate heterogeneous datasets and analyze them in near real-time to provide insights into emerging public health problems. Additionally, the complex etiologies of diseases pose special challenges in developing analytic tools to monitor them. For example, the symptoms of the common flu and a serious outbreak such as West Nile virus can be very similar, but teasing out these symptoms from a context specific search of Twitter and other social media data can be quite challenging. Therefore, there is a need to develop novel machine learning tools that can not only handle large datasets, but can also simultaneously examine heterogeneous data sets to identify emerging patterns of disease spread across geographically distributed regions.",28.382513946623888,11.834132450040132

The latest available statistics (from 2006) indicate that China has 18,703 county hospitals, 40,907 township hospitals and 201,562 medical clinics [4, 5] . Hospitals at the prefecture level or above are usually equipped with reference laboratories that are capable of carrying out molecular surveillance for cases. Together with laboratories from academic institutions, they form the front line of surveillance for outbreak detection and notification of infectious diseases in China. All hospitals and clinics are obliged to report both suspected and confirmed cases of notifiable infectious disease to their nominated county Centre for Disease Control (CDC). After recording the details of the reported cases (including their geographical location, demographicl information and infection status), county CDCs send the information to the country's central CDC, through the National Infectious Diseases Monitoring Information System Database, which was established in 2004 [6] . This reporting mechanism bypasses the previous stepwise hierarchical reporting framework, thus allowing information to flow directly from grassroots CDCs to China's central disease database. However, regional, provincial and national CDCs do not have equal access to all of the data in the database: their access rights are limited to their own administrative regions, and only national CDCs has the full access to all data [7] . In addition to their responsibility for verifying the disease information from their administrative regions, municipal and provincial CDCs are required to report to the appropriate level of the Bureaus of Health or Department of Health and to form networks with local research bodies, universities and other health organisations. At the top of the hierarchy, China's central CDC is the overseeing organisation with responsibility for assembling and analysing diagnostic data for all diseases and then presenting a final report to the Ministry of Health, which is the main public health policymaker in China.

In the past 10 years there have been important global incidents that emphasise the tension between countries and international organisations when commercial and political interests are perceived to have an undue eff ect on global pandemic preparedness policy. 4, 16 This eff ect is further exacerbated when inequity in access to tech nology, expertise, and the best diagnostic, prophylactic, and treatment methods are prevalent. An example is Indonesia's refusal in 2006-07 to share samples of infl uenza H5N1 isolates with WHO in direct protest to the inequitable sharing of virus samples and vaccine development technology. 43 Lack of trust in WHO's response was evident following the H1N1 pandemic in 2009 too, including from the Council of Europe which highlighted potential confl icts of interest of individual members of the emergency committee convened by WHO to respond to the pandemic-linking them to industry, and noting WHO's policy on keeping the membership of the committee secret. Substantial shortfalls and delay in distribution of vaccine supplies to low-income and middle-income countries were also emphasised by subsequent reviews of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic response. 4, 16, 45 The Indonesian Government's call for more equity and developments since the H1N1 2009 pandemic have led to several positive initiatives. 46 Within WHO's PIP Framework, discussions have evolved to improve virus sharing in the context of recognising the need for shared benefi ts. Indonesia is now one of several low-to-middle income countries that are developing or have already developed in-country vaccine manufacturing capacityothers in the WHO-supported programme of technology transfer include Brazil, China, Egypt, India, Kazakhstan, Mexico, South Korea, Romania, Serbia, South Africa, Thailand, and Vietnam. Initiatives such as the creation of a technology transfer programme at the Netherlands Vaccine Institute (RIVM) to provide training in the embryonated egg production of inactivated infl uenza vaccine are helping to achieve this aim. 47, 48 There are still barriers to eff ective international cooperation and benefi t sharing despite the number of reports emphasising the importance of this key facet of pandemic preparedness. Substantial agreement exists across the public health community about how global collaboration should work, there is greater political acceptance of the value of such collaboration, but there are still barriers arising from commercial and academic drivers. China, with its direct experience of SARS and the economic and political consequences of not being ready to respond, has shown a good example by facing the economic challenges of H7N9. 31 The experience of Saudi Arabia with MERS-CoV highlights other barriers, such as ineff ective international collaboration and partnerships. 44 Despite a declared willingness to collaborate and share, and the publication of substantial epidemiological and microbiological information about early coronavirus cases and outbreaks, there appeared to be delays at times Series in sharing information between public health authorities before it was accepted for peer-reviewed publication, and in sharing clinical and viral samples for public health use without prejudice to subsequent commercial development of products derived from that material. Confl icts of interest that are barriers to trust will probably continue as long as academic and research organisations are judged primarily by their publication record or there is an associated commercial imperative. An urgent need exists for suffi cient global public health capacity that is free from these constraints to allow free and rapid sharing of information and samples. Politicians are beginning to understand the importance of tackling these issues. The Global Health Security Action Group (GHSAG) has initiated work to develop sample sharing protocols and arrangements that build on the WHO PIP Framework but that move on from infl uenza viruses to include any organism that might lead to a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC under the IHRs). The GHSAG initiative is initially intended to focus on sample sharing between the countries in the GHSAG but it will be open to other countries to use the GHSAG-agreed protocols for sharing, and these protocols should encourage and help with sharing without compromising the commercial rights of the sending countries and without prejudicing future benefi t sharing. 49 Specifi c capacity building activity could help to increase trust and engender a true spirit of global cooperation. The positive global experience gained from the development of the Supranational Reference Laboratory (SRL) Network for the surveillance of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis under the Stop TB partnership could serve as a template for the development of a more integrated global laboratory surveillance, diagnostic, and vaccine development and manufacture network working across a series of high priority EID pathogens. 50 The eventual aim of such an initiative would be to ensure that suffi cient numbers of biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) and BSL-3 (adapted for animals) reference laboratories exist in every WHO region to serve the needs of its member countries and peoples. 51 Benefi ts of a global network would include a greater capacity of regions to respond to local and international EID threats more quickly and effi ciently, and, importantly, to retain human resources and expertise within those regions. The latter could have an additional benefi t in aiding eff orts to curtail the brain drain of scientists and technical experts from low-to-middle income countries to more developed regions of the world.",31.79941632668442,16.091443391761114

The healthcare system, which had been reformed to suit the market economy, 5 faced multiple challenges: limited financial support from governments; high rates of catastrophic out-of-pocket spending and impoverishment through health expenses; inequalities in health and healthcare utilization; and limited financial protection even among those with insurance (a small minority of the population). 6 Due to the above challenges, the old 'three-tiered' hospital system, which involved local neighbourhood hospitals, district-wide secondary hospitals and city-wide tertiary hospitals, was forced to rely on the sales of new drugs and technologies to boost income, which resulted in expensive and inefficient care and strained patientedoctor relationships. 7 The old public health system was the responsibility of dozens of disparate institutes, centres, agencies, bureaus and departments, which resulted in overlapping and sometimes conflicting mission statements and agency mandates. 8 With an increase in life expectancy, increased burden due to chronic diseases, and the challenges of emerging infectious diseases (e.g. severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003), the Chinese Government re-examined the public health infrastructure and saw the need for a new public health system to address the many health issues associated with these changes. 5 To minimize overlapping of functions and to increase efficiency, the Chinese Government consolidated existing institutions into a new agency: the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The goal of the CDC is to provide a central public health organization with responsibility for both community and individual health needs. The development of the CDC strengthened the Government's role in public health. 5 As public health and primary care share the common goal of improving the overall health of specific populations, it was decided to integrate the two systems by strengthening public health functions in primary healthcare settings. This approach could improve local public health surveillance and reinforce disease prevention and health promotion. 9 In order to resolve the problems of the increasing burden of healthcare expenses and limited access to health services, the Chinese Government initiated its CHS programme in 1997. 4 The 'threetiered' hospital system was replaced by the current 'twotiered' CHS centre system. The new system consists of ambulatory care in CHS centres and inpatient care in referral hospitals. 7 The main roles of the CHS centres are to provide high-quality, affordable, accessible primary health care and public health services to community residents.",28.131925590053147,11.432473322277497

This is because the 2005 IHR's requirement that signatory states develop event-based surveillance capability is one aspect of a broader strategy, other parts of which have encountered implementation problems.

According to the latest detailed WHO report, only a third of countries worldwide had attained the law's national public health capacity requirements as of late 2014. 19 The 2005 IHR requires the WHO to help countries respond to outbreaks when they request it. Yet recent publications caution that neither the WHO nor the international community at large has the capacity to provide the needed support and coordination. 1, 2, 6, 20 The 2005 IHR limits the travel and commercial restrictions that signatory states may implement to protect themselves from public health risks abroad. But noncompliance has been rife. 20 In short, it is not enough to detect early warnings of outbreaks, especially because the level of false positive signals is high. Many developing countries lack the infrastructure to conduct followup verification and response efforts, and the WHO currently lacks the resources to assist them. Without an effective verification and response system, the media attention resulting from an early warning can cause unnecessary economic havoc as other countries impose excessive restrictions to international trade and travel, or can lead to a diversion of scarce resources from basic health and nutrition programs to infectious disease control that may not make sense for the local population.

Emerging diseases, such as SARS can appear very quickly, requiring public health officials and surveillance applications to respond just as quickly [10] . When a disease outbreak occurs, it is essential that the technology tools be in place to track cases and contact information. Public health officials do not have the luxury of time to develop systems in response to each disease outbreak. An application must be flexible to handle new diseases [10] . In addition, given the possible links between outbreak events, epidemiologists analyzing data collected by a surveillance system may need to gather different data as they discover new information. A surveillance application must be able to adapt to these changing data and analysis requirements. • Maintainability: Applications are inherently expensive to maintain. The cost of supporting a deployed software product can be between 60 and 80% of its lifetime cost [11, 12] . The greater the degree of heterogeneity that exists in the application suite available for an organization, the more expensive it is to maintain. For example, different applications tend to use different technologies and different versions of third party software. Keeping track of all the applications' technology version matrices can be complex, and the licensing costs can be expensive. Making viable the sharing of common architectural components among applications reduces support complexity and licensing costs. • Jurisdictional configurability: Each jurisdiction collecting public health surveillance data has its own policies or business rules governing the content and format of data to be collected. For instance, larger jurisdictions may be able to collect last names of their subjects, while smaller jurisdictions may only be allowed to collect their initials. Similarly, some jurisdictions may want to include the complete date when collecting a birth date, while others can only record the month and the year. An application distributed to different jurisdictions must be able to handle these variations in policy. Furthermore, since policies can change within jurisdictions, established or already implemented applications must be readily configurable. • Alert notifications: A core requirement of a surveillance application is to send alert notifications to designated people indicating that a certain event has occurred. An event could be the occurrence of two or more cases of a similar disease being reported in potentially multiple jurisdictions within a certain time frame (i.e., outbreak). Another event may raise attention to data anomalies within a case that requires attention. An event could even be a user accessing an application after hours. Events such as these help users to manage their applications and understand the data being stored. Alerts could take the form of an email notification, a message sent to a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA)/cell phone, or a posting to a web site. • Security: Due to the sensitive nature of public health surveillance data, security is of the utmost concern. One area of concern within security is authorization. Particular individual users of applications may only see a subset of the data, and only certain functions of the application depending upon their role. For instance, if an application collects data from different jurisdictions, a public health official in one jurisdiction should not be able to see data collected in another jurisdiction. Furthermore, access to different parts of the application should be restricted only to those who are authorized. Auditing functions can also assist in monitoring what applications and which data are being accessed by a specific user. • Usability: Prior to the analysis and reporting of public health information, data must exist in a repository. Currently, data collection poses the single most resource intensive component of surveillance cost, since data must be manually entered into a repository. A disease case can require the collection of, potentially, a few hundred data elements. Based on our experiences, data entry clerks often complain of user interfaces being crowded with irrelevant data fields since not all data elements need to be collected for a case. To reduce this overhead associated with data collection, the presentation of a surveillance application interface must optimize data entry and filter out irrelevant data. • Data sharing: Public health surveillance applications collect data about different diseases from different demographics. This data is usually stored in different databases. Valuable information could be discovered if field entries from these databases were cross-referenced, and in line with existing legislation and privacy controls stored in a central database. The Pan-Canadian Electronic Health Record project by Canada Health Infoway is a multi-year initiative focussed on integrating Canadian surveillance systems from a data perspective [13] . To support this important objective, a surveillance application must have the capability of sharing data with other applications. • Statistical analysis and reporting tools: Once data has been collected and entered into the system, epidemiologists and other public health professionals must be able to analyze the data and report on its contents. A number of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) statistical analysis and reporting tools adequately support this requirement. Thus, PHAC has elected to integrate COTS products into the surveillance environment to support this need.",33.89711415341424,15.989397923646614

But rather than relying on official reports, this information is obtained directly from witnesses of real-time events or indirectly from reports transmitted through various communication channels (eg, social media or established routine alert systems) and information channels (the news media, public health networks, and nongovernmental organizations) ( Table 1 ). Monitoring that relies on data from these Internet sources can be used to detect threats not specifically found by indicator-based surveillance, since this information relies less on data structured and filtered through the aforementioned preestablished structures for surveillance. Event-based surveillance can identify events faster than indicator-based reporting procedures can, and it can detect events that occur in populations not able to access formal channels for reporting. In addition, event-based surveillance can be used with other established indicator-based methods, thereby enhancing the combined arsenal for combatting critically prevalent pathogens with a high threat potential, such as influenza virus or Escherichia coli.

Knowledge of the type of surveillance systems upon which decisions are made may aid in planning the timing of the deployment of system health care resources when surge capacity is needed. To address all these challenges, the next generation of surveillance systems for notifiable disease called the National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NEDSS) will integrate the various reporting sources (labs, public) with clinical databases from hospitals, clinics, emergency rooms that are secured by Health Level Seven American National Standards Institute (HL7) security protocols for protected health information as well as an interface of automated grouping software (for syndromes), statistical and geospatial analysis (see Fig. 3 ). HL7 covers how messaging transactions regarding patient information to various data repositories are transmitted, authenticated, and determined to be complete and accurate (Edwards, 2008 ). This new system architecture will facilitate real-time surveillance and the early detection of outbreaks. The eventual integration of databases from outside the hospital setting, such as from pharmacies, is critical. Lack of access to health care and/or lack of health care insurance may prompt individuals to self-care/medications (e.g., purchase of over-the-counter antidiarrheals, cold remedies at pharmacies) or seek no care thereby missing and underestimating emerging diseases in some communities.

Civil society groups, the donor community, scientists, and the public want to benchmark progress and performance of public health and medicine. An important example of this tendency is the emphasis on monitoring, including the health-related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 1,2 and the creation of the Healthcare Commission in the UK to independently monitor the National Health Service (NHS). 3 Second, the media, civil society, and the general public are more sceptical about both statistical and scientifi c claims. 4 An example is the public dismay about the confusing messages on fat in the diet over the past two decades. 5 Evidence of government manipulation of data during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic added to the decline in trust. 6 Third, many representatives of the technical and scientifi c community and the general public are becoming increasingly sophisticated consumers of information. The scope of relevant information is expanding from simple descriptive epidemiology about health to dimensions of public health and medicine such as quality, effi ciency, and equity. Consumers often need more detail including quantifi cation of uncertainty. Increased communication and access to diff erent views through the internet are driving scepticism and sophistication, which in turn adds to the broad demand for transparency and accountability.",28.598861209410217,13.9305294723811

It was designed to provide surveillance information that is obtained from unified and broadly applicable health surveillance methods for all levels of public health to detect diseases and related health problems early with a timely assessment and response. BioSense uses many forms of surveillance information, including complaints, symptoms and laboratory tests that are required for clinical diagnoses. Focusing on clinical symptoms and symptoms of diagnosed or undiagnosed cases, it reflects syndrome surveillance and constitutes, together with BioWatch and NBIS, the three core biological surveillance programs. BioSense is an international, multijurisdictional, information-sharing surveillance platform that applies to all levels of the public health sector. At the same time, given its use of standardized data elements and analytical methods, BioSense analysts can compare the public health status in different countries or regions in the same country. BioSense can visualize time, space, people and other information via maps, charts, tables and other forms, and the information that it presents can indicate data anomalies. When receiving a prompt, users can confirm the anomalies with related information and may provide an early warning of health problems. Since its development in 2003, BioSense has been greatly improved and developed to meet changing demands and user feedback, and its sources of information have expanded to the US Department Introduction CHAPTER 1 of Veterans Affairs, health-related information from the US DOD and treatment information for all citizens.

Those forces are still at work. Table 1 is a summary of some of the economic forces, including the rise of managed care organizations and their attendant accumulation of bargaining power with reference laboratories. In the face of ever-rising health care costs, hospitals are enduring unrelenting pressure to reduce laboratory costs, resulting in the formation of consortium laboratories among hospital groups, referrals of specimens to private reference laboratories, closings of smaller hospital laboratories, and reductions in laboratory staff. Table 2 shows the forces at work for clinical laboratories, which are fighting battles on two fronts to maintain staff levels against further erosion. Management is asking for workforce reductions, while fewer qualified applicants are available for open positions. With the closing of many medical technology schools over the past two decades, graduating medical technologists, clinical laboratory scientists, and technicians number less than half of projected workforce needs. At the same time, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) has placed new demands for secure patient information handling, adding another burden on laboratory staff (1, 2) . Table 3 lists the forces at work with public health laboratories. While engaged in traditional public health activities, these laboratories are experiencing multiple new pressures, including HIPAA and CLIA regulatory compliance issues, the need to be prepared for analytic response to bioterrorism acts, loss of state funding with a parallel need to bill Medicaid for patient testing and provide testing on a fee-for-service basis.

The first GLASS plan suggests that at a later stage it will allow progressive incorporation of information from other surveillance systems related to AMR in humans, such as for foodborne AMR, as well as monitoring of antimicrobial use [62] .

Consistent with IHR (2005), Greek reform reintroduced the communitarian foundations of control strategies, mandating restrictions of individual liberties when necessary for protecting public health. Disease control is consistently treated as public health protection and crafted to avoid undue impact on individuals. Thus Greek law aligns with public health provisions in the revised IHR, and in laws of France, Sweden, and other countries. [24] [25] [26] Disease control is not treated as a national security issue that would be reminiscent of the older policing approach. 27 Thus, Greek law embodies current understanding of effective public health practice with emphasis on public education and transparent procedures, not on punitive, coercive or stigmatizing ones that may drive epidemics 'underground'. 28, 29 Along with these amendments to align Greek law conceptually with EU and international legislation, the Ministry of Health drafted a national public health plan (2008) incorporating policies for meeting EU and IHR (2005) disease control objectives. However, Greek implementation has lagged; the pressing economic situation raises questions about whether the country will fully meet its obligations by the IHR (2005) deadline in 2012. Major legislative weaknesses stem from failing to follow up core infectious disease control law with supplementary legal and administrational regulations needed to guide implementation. Inconsistent and uncoordinated law making contributed to incomplete establishment of structures and procedures. Governmental change or emergence of new diseases exposed legal and administrative inadequacies, whereas consecutive reforms remade structures, policies, and procedures. Reforms have not thoughtfully integrated preexisting legislation, nor have obsolete or conflicting provisions regularly been removed. Thus, the existing body of pertinent law consists of fragmented requirements from numerous legal texts and different eras; these vary in content, applicability, and, possibly, legal validity.",31.751686661503506,14.213614649744457

What is clear is that public health rights and responsibilities for infectious disease are global as well as national. If we are to assess the adequacy of our legal frameworks for pandemic preparedness, we also need to assess the adequacy of our laws in terms of their suitability for meeting our international obligations. While developed countries of the world already have sophisticated public health systems, the capacity to meet their obligations under the IHR (2005), and the financial resources to develop national vaccine stockpiles, the developing countries of the world face a very different outlook. 57 As we consider the intersections of law and public health in the context of the shared global risks of an influenza pandemic, it is important to realize that pandemic preparedness must necessarily involve improved international cooperation and the sharing of expertise to assist in capacity building for public health and the regulatory frameworks surrounding it, as well as a renewed dialogue around international obligations to help the world's poorest and least healthy people. 58 Legal analysis must be a key part of our planning for pandemic influenza. It is essential that federal and state laws are harmonized so as to ensure their smooth functioning and to eliminate crossjurisdictional differences and uncertainties.

The language of human rights is increasingly part of the landscape for health law in Australia and a See, for example, Public Health Act 1991 (NSW) s 23. internationally. [43] [44] [45] Given the potential for public health laws to impact upon the freedom of individuals, and the need for public health laws to balance the interests of individuals and society, public health laws will ideally have a transparent ethical framework, articulating the principles upon which state intervention will be premised. 46 The World Health Organization has acknowledged the importance of legal and ethical considerations to pandemic preparedness, noting that public health measures such as quarantine, compulsory vaccination and off-licence use of medicines 'need a legal framework to ensure transparent assessment and justification of the measures that are being considered, and to ensure coherence with international legislation (International Health Regulations)'. 47 Consideration of ethical issues is also essential for, as the World Health Organization has noted, ethical issues 'are part of the normative framework that is needed to assess the cultural acceptability of measures such as quarantine or selective vaccination of predefined risk groups'. 48 The exercise of state powers in terms of quarantine, isolation and detention during a public health emergency is likely to be particularly controversial in Western liberal democracies such as Australia. The extent to which the state can and should exercise its powers in this area has become increasingly relevant in public health, as is clear from debates over detention of tuberculosis patients, 49, 50 and from the use of quarantine during the SARS crisis. 51 Although comparable countries to Australia in Europe, the USA and Canada all have human rights charters or equivalents, which could provide procedural protections and safeguards for citizens in relation to quarantine and detention, Australia has yet to develop a Bill of Rights at the federal level. While Australian state and territory governments have begun enacting human rights legislation, 52 there is no comprehensive inclusion of human rights safeguards in the federal Quarantine Act, which raises issues about the mechanisms for ensuring procedural safeguards in the event of a pandemic. 53 Public health measures directed at implementing social distancing, quarantine or travel restrictions will not only infringe on individual liberties that are often taken for granted in Western societies, but are also likely to have a profound economic impact. As outlined above, estimates indicate that pandemic influenza will have a significant impact on the global economy. At local level, businesses may be closed or experience a reduction in their cash flow as public health measures are introduced or people stay home voluntarily. In such an environment, the economic cost to individuals and businesses may be significant, which in turn demands consideration of development of support systems and compensation systems for those affected. 54 In the USA, a great deal of work has been done on strengthening the public health laws, both generally and specifically for public health emergencies. The Turning Point Public Health Statute Modernization National Collaborative developed the Turning Point Model State Public Health Act. 55 In 2001, the Centre for Law and the Public's Health at Georgetown and Johns Hopkins Universities prepared a Model State Emergency Health Powers Act, setting out the powers for a state of public health emergency. The provisions of the earlier Model State Emergency Health Powers Act were adapted and included in the Turning Point Model Act. 56 Article V of the Turning Point Model Act deals with the powers of public health authorities, including the powers of quarantine and isolation. The Model Act provides that the principles to be applied in relation to quarantine and isolation include that they should be by the least restrictive means necessary to prevent the spread of disease (s 5-108[b](1)).

Because of this limited supply and the fact that many of these medical countermeasures are not commercially available, the United States, a few other countries, and international organizations that have acquisition programs and stockpiles have been requested to deploy medical countermeasures internationally to assist partner countries in containing a disease or mitigating the public health consequences of an event. A typical example was the largescale international deployment of antivirals and vaccine during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, which evidenced the lack of global access to medical countermeasures and, due to multiple legal, regulatory, and logistical challenges, showed the limited capacity of WHO and donors to rapidly deploy vaccine to areas where assistance was needed. 3 The threat of future pandemics and other international public health emergencies has not diminished. In the past 2 years alone, multiple cases of the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 have been detected in Southeast Asia, and North America has recently seen the first imported case. In the period between 2012 and 2014, multiple countries around the world, including the United States, had imported cases of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). 4 In 2013, the world also witnessed the emergence of avian influenza A (H7N9), and in 2014, both the polio outbreak and the outbreak of Ebola virus disease in western Africa have been declared public health emergencies of international concern (PHEIC) by WHO in accordance with the International Health Regulations (2005) [IHR (2005) ].

Persons afflicted by this and other deadly viruses cannot wait for compulsory licensing schemes or for contracts to be negotiated on favorable pricing schemes as their lives hang in the balance. The Commission on Human Security recognized that the burden of HIV/AIDS is overwhelmingly concentrated among the poorest people in the poorest regions. HIV/AIDS decreases the ability of affected individuals to work and increases their health care costs, resulting in greater financial strain on their households. 43 National disease surveillance and control systems should be strengthened and then networked into a global system. Health empowerment and protection depend on reliable and up-to-date data and analysis and a capacity to act in response to information. Central to health and human security, therefore, are systems to collect and deploy information for detecting disease threats, monitoring their changes, and guiding control efforts. All surveillance and control activities ultimately depend on people and local communities, but national and international systems are needed to empower people and communities. 44 Health and human security are central matters of human survival in the twentyfirst century.

This sharing can also reduce the potential or actual impact of a global health crisis. For example, the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System, a laboratory network that shares information to detect the emergence of novel influenza viruses with pandemic potential (21) , helped prevent SARS from becoming endemic after the 2003 outbreak (22) . This network also improved the timeliness of the response to the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic (21) . Besides being useful for outbreak management, sharing of routine public health surveillance data enables national and international collaboration, capacity strengthening, insight into public health system performance, and ultimately better control of infectious diseases (18).",37.57695475523735,14.810915898847309

The Public Health Emergency Response Regulations defined four categories of such events: (1) serious epidemics, (2) mass diseases with unknown causes, (3) large scope food or profession poisoning, and (4) other events that can severely affect public health, for example, leaking of infectious bacteria from laboratories. The public health alert system in China has three levels: yellow alert, orange alert, and red alert. Fig. 1 depicts the structure of this alert system. Two levels of public health emergency response plans are triggered by emergency alerts: the provincial and the national. If the public health emergency is confined within a certain region of a province, the provincial plan will be appropriate. If the public health emergency is diffused across provinces and endangers the national public health, the national plan will be needed. Specifically, in the event of a yellow alert, the provincial public health emergency response will become ready; in the event of an orange alert, a provincial public health emergency response will be started or the national emergency response will be ready; in the event of a red alert, the national emergency response plan will be activated. The national public health emergency response plan signifies the highest level of public health threat, and China responds to this type of crisis by gathering relevant departments in the State Council and military to form a national emergency command center. One of the leaders of the State Council, that is, the premier or a vice premier, will be appointed as the commander to direct actions resolving the emergency. The command center co-ordinates and allocates national resources, makes major deci-sions, determines outward statements in press conferences, and possibly resorts to police and military forces. On the other hand, the provincial public health emergency plan is determined by the provincial government. A command center with the provincial government leader as the commander will be organized to direct emergency response activities. The difference between the national plan and the provincial plan is mainly the scope of the response activities. In addition, it should be noted that when a public health emergency response plan becomes ready, it does not necessarily have to be activated. In this scenario, the major task would be to continue carrying out disease surveillance and epidemiological investigation to examine how the emergency develops. Related stakeholders are informed to make preparations and some resources might be allocated. But if the emergency shows no sign of escalation or is controlled before it escalates, the alert would be cancelled. The major responsibilities of the MOH are supervising and co-ordinating a wide range of activities relating to the emergency, such as organizing public health surveillance and reporting, applying for approval to start the national public health emergency response plan from the State Council, organizing and co-ordinating professional organizations to conduct field investigations, treating infected patients, tracing, sterilizing, or quarantining people who were in contact with infected patients, developing technological standards, declaring new infectious disease as legal infectious disease according to pertinent laws (only legal infectious diseases can trigger public health emergency alerts), and ",32.87112339301772,14.633496121439869

Regarding the content, governments can identify the most suitable approaches to increase the usefulness of the messages and thereby mitigate public health risk by analyzing the types of information that citizens want or/and need, the preferred format, and the appropriate level of detail. Furthermore, it is important that such e-government services can prevent inaccurate, incomprehensible information, by monitoring the system and adopting filtering tools. As for social media channels, the public health risk communicators should engage in clear, balanced and beneficial approaches to deal with potential emotional responses of the public because social media is a personalized network with subjective norm-based communication infrastructures (Graham et al., 2015; Mergel, 2016) .

The first challenge is the citizens' selfprotection.

The second challenge is about the citizens' voice. Because of the externality of health problems, citizens usually shift the accountability of protecting themselves from health risks to their government. Furthermore, they want to (or should) keep interacting with their government to put their voices into policy (Barg et al., 2017; Li, Abelson, Giacomini, & Contandriopoulos, 2015) . The third challenge involves co-production between citizens and government. Citizens are increasingly becoming co-producers with their governments for public values (Alford, 2009) .

The fourth challenge concerns citizens' utilization of health-related services.

The concern here is to broaden the causal basis of the emergence of specific ecosystem-mediated health problems beyond exposure to disease vectors and microbes, to incorporating people-environment power dynamics and how such dynamics result in the exposure of weaker actors to environmental health risks. Explaining health problems from the basis of exposure to microbes and pathogens alone is equivalent to blaming the victim, while relieving important social and political factors that constrain the individual from freely making the decisions to avoid risk in the first place. Similarly, the uneven distribution of the costs of ecological activities and the resulting social patterning of poor health should be examined from the context of how unequal power relations allow powerful actors to displace their environmental costs to weaker actors through such acts as dumping toxic waste in other communities.

Investing in this capacity in developing countries is thus increasingly seen as a shared concern within the global community. As a result multilateral and bilateral donors committed a total of US$582 million in loans and grants to buttress the response capacity of developing and middle-income countries. 1 While there is broad agreement on the need for additional funding, there is less clarity on how the funds should be spent. Although the developed world has invested its bioterror-and pandemic-preparedness dollars and euros into building highly specialized emergencyresponse capacity, it is not clear whether this could or should be replicated in the developing world, where public health infrastructure is weak due to years of underinvestment and where there are urgent, competing public health priorities that by necessity take center stage. 2 This article examines the value of a multiple-use approach to emergency preparedness in the develop-ing world-one that aims to build capacity for both emergency preparedness and current core public health activities. Such an approach could offer developing countries an opportunity to strengthen their public health system platforms, allowing them to respond to multiple priority diseases rather than creating specialized programs that will likely be difficult to sustain in the longer term. First, it reviews evidence from developed countries on the impacts of emergency preparedness for bioterrorism and pandemic influenzawhich require similar public health system responseson public health departments and the overall public health system, focusing on investments proven to have substantial collateral impacts on other public health activities.

Significant additional funding to strengthen this capacity followed. In the U.S., the biodefense preparedness budget increased from $294 million in 2001 to $3 billion in the next year and to $5.2 billion in 2004. Of the funds committed since 2001, $3.6 billion was spent on state, local, and hospital preparedness, representing a substantial infusion of new money into public health systems that had seen little new funding in the preceding decade. 16 At the same time, the European Union (EU) established the Health Security Committee to develop a health information system, EU-wide surveillance, a database of the medicines stock, a facility to disseminate medicines and specialists, and health-specific protocols for a coordinated EU response to an attack. 17 By 2006 a growing concern about the possibility of pandemic influenza of avian origin in the U.S. led to an infusion of another $3.8 billion into preparedness activities. 18 The bulk of preparedness budgets in the U.S. was allocated to a range of related health activities intended to respond to acts of bioterror, emerging infectious diseases, and later pandemic influenza. Bioterror and pandemic preparedness investments included the upgrading of disease surveillance, hospital capacity to handle mass casualties, patient isolation systems, laboratory diagnostics for new biologic agents, and the enhancement of command and control structures as well as communication among health and emergency services agencies. 19 Public health officials became concerned that the singular focus on new threats might overshadow the traditional activities of public health departments and hospitals and weaken their ability to tackle existing challenges. 20 -23 Among the negative effects observed was the diversion of staff in hospitals and public health departments from routine activities to meetings and training sessions on preparedness, and reduced attention to nonbioterror-related concerns. Implementing new preparedness activities while maintaining ongoing activities proved to be a challenge. 20, 24 For example, the program to vaccinate health workers against smallpox-one of the most prominent bioterror-preparedness activitiescaused many health departments to defer or cancel other core public health activities, because of the burden of program work and the required monitoring for adverse effects. 17, 25 While infectious disease response may have received a boost from preparedness funding, chronic disease programs lost ground because of the diversion of managers' attention. 20 -22 However, not all preparedness funding was earmarked restrictively, and health managers were able to direct some of the preparedness funding to investments such as infrastructure-human resources and communication-which proved to have multiple uses. 19, 21 As described below, these investments were found to improve both the general functioning of public health departments and hospitals and their ability to handle traditional health threats (Table 1) .",35.9546311552236,14.085210733534728

The use of appropriate surveillance systems ensures timely information management for effective planning and response to infectious diseases threats during the pilgrimage. The literature describes infectious diseases prevention and control strategies for Hajj but with limited information on the operations and characteristics of the existing Hajj infectious diseases surveillance systems. Method: We reviewed documents, including guidelines and reports from the Saudi Ministry of Health's database, to describe the characteristics of the infectious diseases surveillance systems that were operational during the 2015 Hajj, highlighting best practices and gaps and proposing strategies for strengthening and improvement. Using Pubmed and Embase online search engines and a combination of search terms including, 'mass gatherings' 'Olympics' 'surveillance' 'Hajj' 'health security', we explored the existing literature and highlighted some lessons learnt from other international mass gatherings. Results: A regular indicator-based infectious disease surveillance system generates routine reports from health facilities within the Kingdom to the regional and central public health directorates all year round. During Hajj, enhanced indicator-based notifiable diseases surveillance systems complement the existing surveillance tool to ensure timely reporting of event information for appropriate action by public health officials. Conclusion: There is need to integrate the existing Hajj surveillance data management systems and to implement syndromic surveillance as an early warning system for infectious disease control during Hajj. International engagement is important to strengthen Hajj infectious diseases surveillance and to prevent disease transmission and globalization of infectious agents which could undermine global health security.",33.74676458122295,15.183273752815392

Systems using informal electronic information have been credited with reducing the time to recognition of an outbreak, preventing governments from suppressing outbreak information, and facilitating public health responses to outbreaks and emerging diseases. A huge amount of real-time data and information about infectious disease outbreaks is found in various forms of web-based data streams (Brownstein et al. 2008; Freifeld et al. 2008; Brownstein and Freifeld 2007) . The web-based data sources exist outside traditional reporting channels; therefore, they are invaluable to public health agencies that depend on timely information flow across national and subnational borders. These information sources, which can be identified through Internet-based tools and social media, are often capable of detecting the first evidence of an outbreak, especially in areas with a limited capacity for public health surveillance (Yang et al. 2013) . For example, the World Health Organization's Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network rely on reporting data for day-to-day surveillance activities (M' Ikanatha et al. 2004 Ikanatha et al. , 2006 ).

This contributed to the development of modern surveillance systems for the Hajj, evolving from the paper-based reporting tools to a more efficient web-based electronic surveillance systems. Enhanced IDSSs were introduced to complement the conventional surveillance system in addressing the increased risks of infectious diseases transmission and outbreaks during the Hajj. Existing electronic surveillance systems (HESN and CITREX) automatically generates reports and have the advantage of timeliness, as public health personnel at different locations can access and synchronize information management once data is captured at the reporting sites. However, the implication of having parallel systems capturing and interpreting the same health data has some potential implications, including duplication of work, depletion of already limited resources during Hajj and uncertainty of the accuracy of the data. Therefore, there is a need to conduct operational studies to assess the feasibility of integrating the diverse surveillance systems utilized during Hajj into one efficient tool. Prioritizing systems that remain operational for routine surveillance after Hajj may promote the most efficient use of resources. 14 Furthermore, there is need to sustain the enhanced surveillance system and other public health interventions at key locations in the Kingdom, including the points of entry, after the Hajj, as a prevention and control strategy for the international spread of diseases during other mass gatherings with international dimensions, principally the Umrah pilgrimage.

As a result, the number of sentinel surveillance sites increased sixfold during the period from 2003 to 2008, and 18,820 PLWH received diagnoses at these sites. This activity increased the coverage and quality of surveillance information available for decision-making, while also increasing local capacity for developing referral systems, care linkages, and case management capacity .

In 2003, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) revealed gaps in Ontario's emergency response capability, and highlighted the need to prepare for future epidemics. The effects of this outbreak resulted in a total of 251 probable cases and 43 deaths in Canada [1] . SARS heavily impacted the health care system in Ontario and in affected areas across the globe. Recent memories of this outbreak, coupled with the threat of pandemic H1N1 (2009) warn of the impacts of a major outbreak in Canada. Accordingly, planning has become a pressing issue for stakeholders in government, industry and community. While the exact timing, pattern and impact of a future pandemic is unknown [2, 3] , in Canada an influenza pandemic could result in as many as 10.6 million people (35%) who become clinically ill, 138,000 (0.5%) who require hospitalization, and up to 58,000 deaths (0.2%) [4] . Such concerns have become a high profile public health issue, and fears of a potential global pandemic continue to grow. Governments, policy makers, and health care providers (HCP), are planning for future pandemics, in part, based upon the lessons learned from SARS. Health Canada [5] has identified gaps in the response to SARS that should influence current policies and planning. For example, there is still a need to address ethical concerns during a pandemic, for instance, governments may be required to infringe upon civil liberties to ensure infection control, and policy makers need to establish frameworks for decisionmaking to allocate scarce health care resources [6] .

Litigation on access to anti-retroviral drugs is one area in which notable success has been achieved. In Minister of Health versus Treatment Action Campaign (2002), the Constitutional Court of South Africa held that government limits on the public sector provision of nevirapine were unreasonable and unconstitutional. Nevirapine halves perinatal HIV trans mission rates. The Court found that limiting access was a breach of the right to health care, which was not consistent with a positive state obligation to progressively realise the rights of mothers and infants to essential health services. 60 Similarly, the Venezuelan Supreme Court (1999) required the State to provide HIV treatment and to develop social awareness campaigns. 61 In 2000, the Argentine Supreme Court found that the ""right to health falls within the right to life…the first natural right of the individual"", and directed the government to provide HIV treatment. 62 These cases, along with other right to health litigation, have contributed greatly to social movements. 63 Controversies in public health litigation have also been reported. Modelled on the cases described above, individuals have increasingly launched health rights litigation around the world on issues including reproductive rights, mental health, and smoking in public places. 64 Notably, this litigation often occurs in the context of democratic failure: litigants turn to the courts because corruption, autocratic practices, and the dominance of powerful interests provide little opportunity for changing policies through the political system. 65 Although gaining traction, 66 the justiciability of the right to health (ie, the question whether or not a court can adjudicate a claim brought on the basis of the right to health) remains a contested issue in many jurisdictions. 64 The long-term effects of litigation on equity and justice are not yet clear, 64 and are dependent on context. For example, one study of litigation in a southern Brazilian state concluded that ""judicialization largely serves the disadvantaged who turn to the courts to secure a wide range of medicines."" 67 However, in other cases, courts have granted individuals access to expensive medications, some of which have little demonstrated value. When courts override careful policy assessments by the legislature, they might divert resources for health that could otherwise have been used for more cost-effective interventions. Consequently, scholars have noted: ""Courts in adjudicating health human rights need to frame the right in the context of In 1991, Colombia enacted a new Constitution followed by a series of reforms intended to extend health insurance to all citizens. The 1991 Constitution enshrined economic and social rights, establishing a Constitutional Court as a specialised tribunal to oversee the new constitutional jurisdiction. This gave individuals the right, when economic and civil rights were not being met, to take the government to court through a writ called a tutela. 69 Tutelas give citizens an avenue to ensure that the government actively provides for their constitutional rights, including rights to health care.",30.167553730279668,14.389835118864639

Solutions to all of these complex health problems require a variety of scientific and legal skills. Progress in these areas can be achieved only if health advocates have access to the training and resources needed for deep under standing not only of the health hazard, but also of the legal rules and mechanisms that govern the particular field. Understanding the field of non-communicable diseases and the law requires a strong understanding of multiple other areas, including consumer law, marketing law, food law, tax law, and environment and planning law. 341 Similarly, the law surrounding access to medicines requires understanding the linkages between trade law, intellectual property law, and health. 340 Health advocates push for affordable access to medical technologies, but to be truly effective they need the acumen to understand the legal rules governing the pricing and regulation of vaccines and medicines. 342 Health diplomacy is another crucial legal capacity. Whether at the national, regional, or global level, legal and health professionals must develop the skills and gain the experience needed to bridge often bitter ideological and political divisions to forge effective norms and standards. Health diplomacy requires the ability to genuinely listen to the concerns of stakeholders, while identifying common ground and finding fair and innovative ways to coax the parties toward consensus.

Greater surge capacity in terms of both human workforce and resources at the regional, national and international levels ultimately contributes to a flexible, rapid and effective response. As such, outbreak prevention, preparedness and response must be kept at the top of national and global agendas, and must not slip as it has in recent years.

Establishing robust health systems and implementing improved surveillance and response systems were identified within these documents as necessary conditions to better protect global health, but it was widely recognized that these steps alone are not sufficient. Fear, panic, denial and mistrust/distrust led to the rejection of public health interventions in many instances during this EVD outbreak.

Asymmetries of information have been reduced in an era of globalized knowledge exchange, contributing to a reduction of isolation, an increase in life spans, and improved health. 10 Conversely, advances in globalization are blamed for some health problems, including an increased adoption of unhealthy Western habits and lifestyle, resulting in increases in obesity and the increased prevalence of chronic disease. Open borders and open access, hallmarks of globalization, have also resulted in faster transmission of infectious agents, the so-called ""microbial hitchhikers."" Many societies find globalization and open information exchange threatening to current ideologies and social structure. Others view the concept of globalization, particularly via ICT, as a new age form of electronic colonialism, where existent cultures are bulldozed and assimilated. 11 How does ICT fit in this discussion of health and globalization? The World Health Organization (WHO) believes that ICT holds great promise for improving health and health care around the world and is critical to achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. 12 The core beliefs that ICT will contribute significantly to the reduction of poverty, improve the delivery of education and health care, and make government services more accessible are prominent in the 2006 World Health Report. The 2007 report, Towards a Safer Future, continues to emphasize the importance of ICT in relation to health: ""Today, the public health security of all countries depends on the capacity of each to act effectively and contribute to the security of all. The world is rapidly changing and nothing today moves faster than information. This makes the sharing of essential health information one of the most feasible routes to global public health security."" 13 A widely held view, both within the WHO and elsewhere, is that ICT in health enables rapid and global access to new therapies, techniques, and knowledge resources, with the potential to forever change the health of nations. The role of ICT in the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) crisis of 2003 is a prime example. During the first cases of SARS in China in 2003, the WHO initiated a digital virtual environment consisting of 11 laboratories in 9 countries connected via ICT. Using e-mail and a secure website, these collaborators shared outcomes, post-mortem tissue analysis, electron-microscope pictures of viruses, genetic sequences and other related materials in real-time to collaboratively identify and intervene in a markedly dangerous public health risk. Other examples exist that point to the impact that ICT has had on global health efforts, such as the Academic Model for the Prevention and Treatment of HIV/AIDS Medical Record System for Africa (AMPATH-MRS), the Partners in Health Electronic Medical Record in Peru, the HIV Electronic Medical Record System in Haiti. 14 Efforts such as those mentioned above and scores of others, too extensive to enumerate, have made significant impacts in the health of large regions of the globe. However, it is important to realize that ICT can never be viewed as a panacea or singular solution to the very multifaceted problem of worldwide health. The contributors to global health are very complex, rooted in societal structures, political agendas, and the presence of marked global poverty. Solving one issue without addressing the others will result in the same outcome experienced by Sisyphus; the summit is reached, only to have the boulder roll back down to the base. In particular, efforts to improve health without addressing the pressing problem of poverty will be unsustainable.",29.678746352749503,13.021512118533355

Approximately 15-20% of the world's population have one or more mental or substance use disorders; 289 in 2016, approximately 1·1 billion individuals had a mental or substance use disorder. Some argue that the true burden of mental health and substance use disorder is even higher because of factors such as difficulties in accurate measurement and reporting, along with challenges in categorisation of overlapping conditions. 290 Mental health is neglected in most countries, particularly in relation to physical health conditions. Individuals with mental health disorders face pervasive stigma and discrimination, resulting in considerable disparities between the services available for physical and mental health, with decreased availability, accessibility, and quality of mental health services. 290 Although countries vary widely in access to mental health services, even the best performing systems have yet to meet the need, leaving a wide treatment gap between the need for treatment and actual service delivery. Estimates range from 76% to 85% of people with mental disorders not receiving treatment in low-income and middle-income countries, compared with 50% of comparable individuals in high-income countries. 291 WHO has identified the development of mental health policies and laws that promote human rights as crucial to the protection of people with mental health disorders, observing that such policies and laws are inadequate in most countries. 292 WHO's Mental Health Action Plan 2013-20 set a target that 50% of countries should have developed or updated their mental health laws in line with international and regional human rights instruments by 2020. 293 Although successful mental health policy involves myriad components, a foundational issue is access to affordable, quality mental health services, which requires laws supporting such access along with adequate funding for services. Historically, countries devoted their scarce mental health resources almost exclusively to high-cost inpatient services for relatively few acute cases, which has contributed to the treatment gap. As evidence has shown the effectiveness of community-based outpatient treatment and integration of mental and physical health services, countries are slowly transitioning their laws and policies accordingly.",30.460745793472984,12.917869406602719

Air travel, which has steadily increased in Europe over the last decades [13] , is an effective means for introducing measles into a country.

Thus, early detection is pivotal to limit further spread in the community. This legitimates tracing of individuals exposed to measles, a public health measure that requires considerable time and effort. For this to be effective, passenger information must be obtained in a very short time frame, a condition often not met today. It is debatable in this context whether contact investigations should be conducted by LHA, like in Germany, which have to request passenger information from international airlines whose competent organizational unit is often located outside their jurisdiction, sometimes even outside their country, to then trying to inform passengers who, for the most part, do not reside in their jurisdiction. In several incidences in Europe, airlines have been doubtful of the legal basis for providing personal data to LHA, i.e., the International Health regulations (IHR), and concerns about data protection led to a delayed or no release of passenger manifests [9] .

A list with relevant contact persons from airlines operating European airports could be managed and maintained centrally in Europe (e.g. at the ECDC) and local health authorities should be able to access this information rapidly through secure channels.

CDC's secure, webbased Epidemic Information Exchange (Epi-X) allows state and local public health offi cials to access and share health surveillance information about such events as illnesses associated with a case of human bubonic plague (2010), reports about airline travellers potentially exposed to com municable disease (2010), and the recreational use of designer drugs that were components of items marketed as bath salts (2011). In April 2009, Epi-X reported cases of acute respiratory illness in Veracruz, Mexico, an outbreak that was identifi ed as a novel form of infl uenza A (H1N1). CDC's Health Alert Network (HAN) is another important system of communication for sending messages to health professionals and the public (including media). HAN alerts have featured guidance about use of infl uenza antiviral agents during the 2010-11 season, and updates for detection of increased levels of radioactive material in the USA caused by the 2011 Japanese Fukushima nuclear incident. The US Government is increasingly recognising that preparedness and core (routine) investments in public health are synergistic. Large-scale and unpredictable natural, accidental, or intentionally caused disease outbreaks and environmental disasters need many of the same routine surveillance, laboratory, risk com munication, and other core public health systems. The fl exibility of the Laboratory Response Network shown during the anthrax attacks, for example, has also played a key part in validating BioWatch results, and for responses ranging from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), monkeypox, West Nile virus, and H5N1, to investigations for ricin and saxitoxin poisonings and numerous exposures to mercury. Individuals, families, and communities are also essential partners in building resilience to public health hazards. Development of informed empowered individuals and communities (a cornerstone of the whole-of-nation policy approach 16 ) demands new actions and investment in many sectors to transform the populace from victims to potential responders. Prepared communities understand potential risks and their roles before, during, and after an adverse incident. These communities also have members who are engaged in local decision making, are prepared to take action during an incident, and are committed to their personal preparedness to protect their own health and that of their neighbours until help arrives. A continued public health focus on development of healthy communities can also have ancillary benefi ts to improve preparedness because healthy people are more resilient to health threats.",36.294974643809624,16.130326012361106

The quality of the assessment depends on the data used to reach it. For example, reliance on public agencies' estimates of a disease, which may be inflated to increase public attention and consequently increase funding, will distort global calculations.

Such confidentiality provisions, with respect to HIV/ AIDS, can be found in public health legislation in many jurisdictions.

These initiatives have been assisted by regional coordination and the formation of, for example, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, and subregional networks such as the Mekong Basin Disease Surveillance Network. 82, 83 The adoption of the revised International Health Regulations, which have a target of establishment of minimum core capacities, or specific plans, by mid-2012, by the 194 member states of WHO was a noteworthy advance. 84 The revised Regulations incorporate a broad definition of outbreaks of public health concern, which include outbreaks in non-human animals, and provides an incentive for low-income countries to build capacity for pandemic surveillance and prevention. Although implementation will probably be delayed because many countries have so far been unable to achieve minimum core capacity goals, the adoption of the Regulations should greatly improve standards for surveillance, reporting, and response. 82 Efforts to reduce or prevent pandemic zoonoses before they emerge in people have also begun, and might form the template for a new, globally coordinated pandemic prevention strategy. For influenza, these efforts have been focused on animal surveillance as a strategy to identify periods when the risk of spillover to people is high. 64 Wider surveillance in wildlife to include targeted pathogen discovery has been called for. 3, 5, 7, 64 However, few coordinated efforts have been implemented to pre-empt zoonotic disease emergence with wildlife surveillance.

As with other modes of transport, most notably rail travel, the issue was whether public health surveillance should be implemented on departure or arrival; that is at or beyond the sovereign borders of a nation. As we note, one solution was to pass some of the responsibility for implementing public health measures on to the airlines and their passengers. After all, it was the commercial airlines that were required to carry out disinsection, and it was the passengers who were responsible for ensuring that they carried valid documentation detailing the inoculations they had received prior to travel.

This aim can only be achieved if incoming refugees feel welcome and not the subject of stigmatisation or persecution. 7 Experience from around the world shows that many refugee groups-eg, Myanmar's Rohingya minority-have long been deprived of essential health care in their home countries, and arrive in host countries in extremely poor health. These poor baseline health conditions might be exacerbated by provision of inadequate health services at refugee reception or processing centres, which can thus become a risk to the collective health of host populations. For example, conditions in Australia's Nauru and Manus Island detention centres for off shore processing have resulted in outbreaks of infectious diseases. 21 By contrast, the strong system of vaccination surveillance in Germany identifi ed low measles immunisation in incoming refugees to Lower Saxony; measures are being taken to vaccinate arriving groups, illustrating how evidence can be used to reduce health inequalities in refugees and host communities. The European Vaccine Action Plan 2015-2020 22 details the importance of equitable access to vaccination and to encourage access for refugees and migrants with culturally appropriate services. 7 High-income countries have all the experience, knowledge, and resources to fi nd cost-eff ective solutions to health challenges that might arise from incoming refugees, as well as the institutional strength and innovative capacity to integrate and harness the potential socio economic benefi ts of these incoming groups. Innovative solutions to strengthen the control of infectious diseases in refugee populations could include mobile diagnostic and surveillance units similar to the Find and Treat service for tuberculosis for homeless and disadvantaged people in London. 23 These solutions could also include an integrated support function for psychosocial care and new public-private partnerships for health surveillance, delivery of messages about health promotion and phone-based incentives, and signposting of essential health services. Lessons could be learnt from the large US refugee resettlement programme 17, 24 and their electronic disease notifi cation system used since 2006, which has improved the timeliness and accuracy of infectious disease notifi cations. However, further studies should include economic analyses that account for longterm outcomes for conditions, such as latent tubterculosis infections, detected in incoming refugees. Sweden, where more than 100 000 refugees were taken in during 2015, is trialing creative approaches to integrate refugee communities, improve health literacy, and ensure adequate access to health services. Sweden has introduced many fast-track schemes to integrate refugees (particularly from Syria), who are already medically trained, into the labour market, thus addressing many diffi culties associated with staff shortages, language barriers, and cultural sensitivity. 25 However, for interventions to be eff ective, improved coordination and cooperation is needed by European countries. Additionally, there is a need for a more integrated and well managed role for humanitarian nongovernmental organisations to provide services for refugees in the absence of adequate provision by government and local authority agencies. In 2015, an important step was taken in this direction with the publication of a joint statement-by European countries, the European Commission, and WHO-addressing the health needs of incoming refugees to Europe 26 and the development of a patient health record that will be piloted at borders to evaluate refugees' medical needs and to reconstruct their medical history. 27 A joint technical statement by UNHCR, WHO, and UNICEF on vaccination for refugees entering Europe provides further support to harmonise and develop consistent standards in the continent. These eff orts are important and build on the continuing work of WHO's Europe Public Health Aspects of Migration in Europe project, 28 which has developed both evidence-based guidance and a series of tools to assist countries to assess and address the health needs of migrant and refugee populations. Unfortunately, the eff ectiveness of these initiatives continues to be limited by the insuffi cient fi nancial and political commitment to improve cross-border coordination for the health needs of refugees.",30.790412413537627,14.541151173523112

Integrated programs and collaboration, on the other hand, facilitate the efficient management of the complex, varied, and proliferating issues and information sources that exist today. The nature of public health surveillance also lends itself to multiple-purpose approaches in that strategies for preventing and controlling diseases, such as West Nile virus, are to a great extent the same as for an influenza epidemic, a foodborne disease outbreak, or a bioterrorist attack. 31 Technology that enhances communication and data sharing across disease programs, surveillance systems, and even across jurisdictions increases the ease of obtaining and disseminating useful information to a broad audience, including public health agencies, healthcare providers, policymakers, and the general public. 6, 32 This rapid information exchange not only facilitates timely response, but can also reduce emergency room visits, hospital admissions, and even costs of care. 33 However, many health departments currently have systems that are not flexible enough to respond to changing health IT needs, which makes it difficult to deliver information when and where it is needed. 4 Disease or program-specific funding also exacerbates program vulnerability to funding and budgetary cuts. For example, when funding is earmarked for specific purposes (e.g., emergency preparedness and associated surveillance systems), and then is reduced, such as has occurred for public health emergency preparedness cooperative agreement funding through CDC in the past seven years, 34 it can undermine and reverse efforts to establish sustainable systems that serve multiple crosscutting purposes throughout public health.

There were also serious outbreaks of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) in hospitals in New York City and Miami (73) . Factors pertinent to the overall upswing included the emergence of HIV, the increasing numbers of immigrants from countries with a high prevalence of TB, and perhaps more significantly, stopping categorical federal funding for control activities in 1972. The latter led to a failure of the public health infrastructure for TB control. Since 1992, the trend has reversed as the CDC transferred most of its funds to TB surveillance and treatment program in states and large cities. From 1992 to 2001, the annual decline averaged by 7.3% (74) , but the following year this was reduced to 2%, indicating that there was no room for complacency.

During the Japan nuclear disaster response, Twitter was used to correct the dangerous myth that healthy people in the USA should take potassium iodide to prevent harm from radiation. 8 These technological advances have been developed in parallel with diplomatic information sharing advances. WHO's International Health Regulations and multilateral collaborations, such as the Global Health Security Initiative, have provided a framework for international cooperation during public health disasters. Improved capacity and the high priority placed on rapid information sharing led to China's timely reporting in 2013 of clinical and genetic information about infl uenza A H7N9 and early sharing of isolates, by contrast with the response to sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) a decade earlier, when information was slower to emerge. 9,10 Cloud computing allowed for distribution of validated epidemiological and analytical programmes to the global community, while allowing China to share genomic sequences, providing the opportunity for immediate actions to analyse the viral genome and develop vaccine candidates. 6 The Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasure Enterprise was established by HHS to coordinate federal eff orts and build new ways to respond to 21st century health threats-from discovery to deployment. The programme generated a government-wide strategic plan to build all-hazards capabilities and countermeasures throughout federal public health agencies.",33.66531912808627,13.979549887913002

During the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic, inadequate surge capacity highlighted the need for intensive-care reserves and improved health-care resource planning at all levels. 17, 18 In an effort to improve ECMO preparedness 19 for an outbreak of an emerging infectious disease, we highlight the ten key components of an ECMO action plan (panel) based on these four categories, with practical recommendations for health centres to ensure appropriate training, capacity, and planning, depending on local priorities and resources. The focus is on building sustainable systems that ensure quality care for patients and their families and staff safety and wellbeing. Details on the organisation of ECMO programmes have been reported elsewhere. 20, 21 WHO interim guidelines recommend offering extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to eligible patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The number of patients with COVID-19 infection who might develop severe ARDS that is refractory to maximal medical management and require this level of support is currently unknown. Available evidence from similar patient populations suggests that carefully selected patients with severe ARDS who do not benefit from conventional treatment might be successfully supported with venovenous ECMO. The need for ECMO is relatively low and its use is mostly restricted to specialised centres globally. Providing complex therapies such as ECMO during outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases has unique challenges. Careful planning, judicious resource allocation, and training of personnel to provide complex therapeutic interventions while adhering to strict infection control measures are all crucial components of an ECMO action plan. ECMO can be initiated in specialist centres, or patients can receive ECMO during transportation from a centre that is not specialised for this procedure to an expert ECMO centre. Ensuring that systems enable safe and coordinated movement of critically ill patients, staff, and equipment is important to improve ECMO access. ECMO preparedness for the COVID-19 pandemic is important in view of the high transmission rate of the virus and respiratory-related mortality.",32.77952243533666,13.752628850702715

In fi nancial terms, funding from diff erent partners is harmonised under one fi nancing plan with clear funding needs and gaps-another model for other programmes. Furthermore, the failure to control tuberculosis in the past-when tuberculosis services were not free-and the success in tuberculosis control over the past few yearswhen tuberculosis services have been free-have provided policymakers with arguments to increase funding for public health from the government. With regard to management, several features of DOTS-eg, directly observed therapy to manage treatment of patients and the management of logistics and drugs-are now used to tackle HIV/AIDS and in other public-health programmes. Furthermore, although many public-health workers are being trained to implement DOTS, setbacks caused by inadequate numbers of trained workers have shown governmental leaders the importance of such resources in public health, and thus they have increased planning for them. In terms of information systems, the tuberculosis programme's quarterly recording and reporting system has long been a model for other disease control programmes.

The findings of our analysis demonstrate the potential for public health agencies to acquire time-sensitive information on rapidly evolving outbreaks occurring outside of their countries through social networking sites. In our analysis, Weibo served as a platform leveraged by central/provincial governments, local news agencies and the public for the timely release and retrieval of information. The Chinese social networking sites' timeliness of reporting are significantly better compared to international mainstream media in English, official websites of the central Chinese government and WHO. Information was released by the local news agencies on the social networking site in the local language before any reports in the conventional news websites or government websites. The information was subsequently amplified by the social networking sites through re-posting of the original report. This allowed the international community greater access to more detailed and timely information compared to that released at the central government level to the international media. The central Chinese government may have allowed the provincial/municipal health authorities to release information on new cases when available to ensure transparency and timeliness of public communications. The access to such timely, crowd-sourced information on infected cases greatly facilitated the understanding of the epidemiology of an unknown disease, which is key in developing effective prevention and control measures. public health practitioners, social media surveillance could provide early warning for unusual public health events in a foreign country and serve as an additional source of epidemiological intelligence to complement conventional surveillance tools.

These policies need to be updated with resultoriented strategies that aim to improve accountability and effectiveness by clearly defining expected outcomes, facilitating monitoring and evaluation, and reflecting improvements resulting from performance assessment processes. For example, in 1997, Pakistan introduced a National Health Policy targeting non-communicable diseases, and in 2003, it introduced an integrated national plan for action on four major non-communicable diseases and their risk factors, injuries, and mental health. Both the Policy and plan could not be implemented properly because of a change in government. 269 In Pakistan, vaccination against HBV was incorporated into WHO's Expanded Programme on Immunisation in 2002, providing the first vaccine dose at the age of 6 weeks; however, coverage for all three doses has reached 75% according to WHO-UNICEF estimates in 2018. 270 National guidelines on treatment and surveillance, provision of screening kits, injection safety equipment, training for preventive measures, and campaigns to increase mass awareness and financial support for treatment have also been developed. 271 The National Programme for Hepatitis Prevention and Control was launched in 2005, after which provincial implementation units were also set up. 272 The Programme focused on screening and treatment for HCV infection and did not establish laboratory-based viral hepatitis surveillance. At the time, hepatitis surveillance in Pakistan was syndromic, not providing laboratory confirmation of infection or information on the type of virus, and not collecting information on risk factors. In 2009, to monitor the effectiveness of the Programme's activities and guide the implementation of evidence-based preventative interventions, the Pakistan Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Programme (under the akistani Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and the Ministry of Health) launched a hepatitis sentinel-site surveillance system (appendix p 3). The sites were located in five public tertiary care hospitals in four provincial headquarters (Lahore, Peshawar, Karachi, and Quetta) and in Islamabad.

The consideration that should accord severe infectious diseases the top priority in emergency public health events was inadequate. Nowadays, infectious diseasesespecially acute and severe ones transmitted via respiratory and intestinal tractsmay appear as either newly emerged infectious diseases or weapons in biological terrorism. Since such diseases usually emerge in an explosive and indiscriminate manner and have wide spread impact, they often lead to panic, social disorder, and economic trauma. Historically, severe epidemics had sometime changed war outcomes, wreaked social disorder, and altered political regimes. Considering these grave potential impacts, the establishment of a response system to severe infectious diseases should be given significant priority in the response system of sudden public health incidents. Acute and severe viral infectious diseases generally do not have specific and effective prevention and treatment measures; therefore, emergency response, prevention, and control need to be given the top priority. 2. The most significant revelation from the SARS outbreaks is that the response system to emergency public health events is inadequate. In the epidemics, weaknesses in China's command system, information system, prevention and treatment teams, and corresponding material storages were completely exposed. For the past two decades, the public health service in China has lagged behind, primarily due to inadequate funding. To solve these problems is an essential step for China to build a harmonious modern society with long-term lasting and equilibrating economic development. The establishment of China's CDCcentered nationwide laboratory monitor network, epidemic information network, emergency teams, and material storage is an essential component in building up the national response to public health emergencies. 3. No consummate public reporting institution of epidemic is observed. In the beginning of the epidemic, the policy of ""strict inward while loose outward"" concerning SARS blocked the epidemic information. The mystery of epidemic disease hovered among the public. Information was not transparent and blocked between related CDCs and researchers, even among departments of government including China and international organizations. This delayed the timely control of the epidemic and even initiated a confidence crisis among the public. It is essential to develop a complete system to announce and report epidemics -a scientific system to analyze and explain epidemics so that various departments can coordinate control of the epidemic and so that the public can correctly understand the epidemic and positively support the measures that the government takes to contain the epidemic.

The geographical coverage includes the marine environment and coastal zones of China, North Korea, South Korea, Japan and Russia. Interested countries around the Northwest Pacific sent their representatives to attend the initial contact meeting held in Nairobi shortly thereafter. 74 Subsequent developments showed that establishing a regional programme in East Asia was not as easy as in other regions. The main culprit could be abnormal political relations among the coastal states of the East Asian region. 75 The tension in the Korean Peninsula and the Taiwan issue are obstacles for smooth regional cooperation for marine environment protection. For example, when the first meeting of National Focal Points and experts convened in Vladivostok in October 1991, North Korea did not send its representative. 76 In 1994 the action plan was finally adopted with five objectives: monitoring and assessing environment conditions, creating an efficient and effective information base, integrating coastal area planning, integrating coastal area management and establishing a collaborative and cooperative framework. 77 To implement the action plan, a number of projects have been designed and carried out in parallel by national institutions with the support of relevant regional and international organisations. In the case of multiple projects, the scattered nature of various activities, as well as the wide scope of input possible from both within and outside the region, necessitates the establishment of a network of participating institutions coordinated by regional activity centres. Besides, a Regional Coordination Unit (RCU) needed to be established to ensure integrated and well-managed execution from within the region of the projects under the action plan. For the meantime, the member governments had designated the UNEP as the organisation responsible for the coordination for implementing the action plan. 78 The RCU was finally established in 2000 and was co-hosted by Japan and South Korea. It served as a nerve centre and command post for executing the action plan. Two RCU offices started their operations in January 2005. A network of regional activity centres was established for the implementation of the action plan.

Some cities, like Shanghai and Suzhou, have already achieved some of these goals and can therefore specify higher targets. Baseline health surveys are needed to allow short-term and mid-term goals to be set on the basis of each cities' specific status and available resources. This process should be combined with a systematic analysis of existing strengths and gaps in health management to ensure action plans are tailored to local needs. Regular assessments of progress should follow the adoption of goals and be based on a combination of self-evaluation and third-party evaluation. The indicator system for healthy cities developed by the National Patriotic Health Campaign Committee provides detailed data, allowing health experts to identify drivers of progress or hurdles. However, because the system is not easily understood by the public, a simplified indicator system is needed. As a starting point, we suggest a system based on three indicators: life expectancy, premature death rate from chronic diseases, and a composite index derived from the WHO HEART tool. The first two are included in the Healthy China 2030 targets and reflect the status of health and of the health-care system, respectively, in metrics that are easy to understand. Both indicators are monitored regularly by the Disease Surveillance Points System so no extra effort will be required. The third indicator reflects the status of health inequity. Since health for all is a guiding principle in the Healthy China 2030 plan and an international focus, it is key that progress in this area be measured. Most indicators in the WHO HEART tool are also used in the indicator system for healthy cities in China and should therefore be easy to attain.

Keeping the public healthy requires not only a well-educated public health workforce but also much better educated citizens. The Institute of Medicine has recommended that all university undergraduates should have access to education in public health, and that public health education should be introduced in high schools. The report 22 sets out basic competencies and curricula. This trend to a broader liberal education is being followed in Hong Kong, where the university curriculum is being extended to 4 years along the lines of the US and mainland Chinese model. Not only has a new BSc now been introduced at university level, 23 but public health has been added into the curriculum for high school students as part of liberal studies for all students, and a further module on health and social care management is also being taught in years 4-6 in middle school. 24 In the USA, there is a growing demand for public health undergraduate courses, and the Association of Schools of Public Health is in the process of devising undergraduate public health competencies. The Asia-Pacific Academic Consortium of Public Health is working to improve public health through the delivery of education, research and public health programmes by member institutions, and actively supports increasing undergraduate public health opportunities, stressing that public health education is more urgent for its region than the rest of the world and that a better system needs to be built, based on developments and experiments already occurring in other universities and other countries and regions. 25 ",32.497874060437695,14.334502460269098

Today, the core business of public health falls into disease prevention and control, public health emergency response, epidemic reporting and management of health-related information, surveillance of and intervention against health hazards, laboratory testing and evaluation, health education and health promotion, technical management, and applied research guidance. Undergraduate education in public health, which takes place in medical schools, covers areas including epidemiology, biostatistics, environmental health, occupational health and safety, food hygiene, school health, health toxicology and radiation protection. In recent years, medical sociology, maternal and child health, health management and policies, health economics, health inspections and their roles within healthcare services have been gradually added to the curriculum of most schools. There has also been an increase in masters courses in public health. Currently, most graduates in public health work in centres for disease prevention and control at various levels, and some work in health inspection institutions which have functions of inspecting and managing goods and services related to health. From discussions at the workshop, 10 significant problems facing public health education in China were identified: Goals for public health education and training at the national level have not been clearly defined; Public health education is not seen as independent of the traditional medical education system, and the unique characteristics of public health education are not recognized and respected; In schools of public health, there is a lack of expertise in health economics, health management, health policy, and health-related law and regulations; It is difficult to attract high-quality students to public health as compared with clinical medicine; The importance of public health education as part of the public health system has not been well recognized by the Government; Curriculum development has not kept up with the modern developments in public health; Teaching has not kept up with the new technology and teaching contents; Structure of teaching faculty has not kept up with the requirements of education reform; Teaching materials have not kept up with the rapid growth of scientific evidence and with the change in health needs; and Links across universities (e.g. with social science faculties) are poor.",34.03565664586101,13.823973914224265

Curricula for urban planning programmes in higher education institutions should expand to include topics related to the interactions of society, environment, economy, and health. Urban planning elements as diverse as housing, transportation, information technology development, and land use can affect health through their influence on food access, physical activity, housing quality, health information, access to care, transport choice and affordability, school locations, social equity, clean air and water, and other factors. 330 Therefore, a multi-scale, cross-sectoral vision of urban health should be built into city and regional planning programmes to ensure that urban planners are fully aware of the various elements required for a healthy city. If health cannot be given proper consideration in the design and planning of districts, communities, individual buildings, and urban infrastructural elements (such as roads), the healthy functioning of an entire city is unlikely to be achieved. A healthy city should also have the capacity to shield its citizens from potential health risks. Correspondingly, the curricula of public health programmes should provide the skills and knowledge needed to work together with urban planners to jointly develop strategies that address the root causes of poor health, rather than simply targeting specific diseases or individual behaviours. 315",34.112228142258445,13.791574527286413

INTRODUCTION: DISCOVERING ISSUES AND CHALLENGES IN LOW-AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES,"Where are the pharmacists when the nations are crippled by these threats? Do the pharmaceutical policies fail to curb these problems? The lack of adequate, resilient public health surveillance systems, infrastructure to effectively deploy resources, and a health workforce to provide accessible, quality care where needed leaves us vulnerable to regional and global spread. Despite the progress that has been made in the last two decades, more needs to be done to create enabling regulatory environments. Understanding the social and cultural contexts that may contribute to these problems, plus effective solutions, is also crucial. Health communication often receives less attention and fewer resources than medical, scientific, or policy areas. There is an urgent need for society to value and invest more in evidence-informed public health strategies. The multifactorial nature of broader global health issues poses an enormous challenge to all stakeholders (WHO, 2016b). Effective public health action depends on understanding the scale and nature of threats to health (WHO, 1986) . According to the Ottawa patient charter, the public health community has a duty to make the invisible visible. They must measure and assess the burden of diseases, health status, and risk factors including the protection factors. The public health community must make the best use of data to promote health. Public health interventions should be evaluated, using rigorous research methods, and the results disseminated. The public health community must ensure that evidence is used to give voice to those who would otherwise be unheard.

Significant medical school debt can drive new physicians away from the ID specialty and public health. Targeted loan repayment opportunities would allow more physicians to pursue these critical career paths. In July 2018, in a move supported by IDSA, the US House of Representative's Energy and Commerce Committee passed legislation that would authorize the CDC to provide loan repayment for those who serve in the Epidemic Intelligence Services (EIS). More than 85% of EIS officers continue serving in public health roles, and this proposal would significantly help make this career path more financially feasible for physicians. Such loan forgiveness opportunities could also be broadened to support ID physicians who work in public health at the federal, state, or local level and face similar challenges around compensation and medical student debt. Establish financial compensation for ID physicians who work in public service (eg, local, state, and federal public health agencies) or who do ID work that provides broader public health benefits (infection control and antimicrobial stewardship). Physicians who perform infection control and antimicrobial stewardship work should be compensated for these activities. As part of hospital accreditation, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) mandates that every participating facility have an active infection control program [37] . States could attach an accreditation process to such mandates that would formally document ID clinicians who oversee hospital infection control and antimicrobial stewardship committees, with loan forgiveness or other financial incentives attached to this accreditation. Ensure that ID physician compensation reflects public health value added. As a cognitive specialty, many of the clinical services ID physicians provide are billed under Evaluation and Management codes, which have not been reevaluated in more than 20 years. The CMS should update these codes to reflect the increasingly complex care provided in inpatient and outpatient settings. Public and private payers, healthcare systems, and hospitals should also provide appropriate compensation and protected time for nonclinical services that are crucial to public health, including infection prevention and control, antimicrobial stewardship, and bioemergency preparedness and response.

The reasons for this are varied and complex, but they include limited access to resources that can help people to take action during an emergency, culture and language barriers, lower perceived personal risk, distrust of authorities, lack of preparation and protective action, and frequent reliance on informal sources of information. 1, 2 Central to these factors, we argue, is the phenomenon of communi-cation inequalities, which we define as differences among individuals and social groups in accessing and using health information and the resultant impact on knowledge and behaviors. [2] [3] [4] While a solid body of work in social epidemiology has documented a connection between social determinants such as socioeconomic position, race, and ethnicity and health outcomes, the mechanisms linking the 2 have been less clear. Viswanath and colleagues developed an explanatory framework of how inequalities in public health emergency preparedness outcomes attributable to social determinants could potentially be explained by inequalities on various dimensions of public health emergency preparedness. 5 The framework is summarized by the Structural Influence Model (SIM) of preparedness communication depicted in Figure 1 . 5 The model is a heuristic framework developed to link social determinants with preparedness outcomes through public health emergency preparedness communications. The framework was originally developed in the context of health communication 5 and subsequently adopted to public health emergency preparedness communication to the public. 6 Communication to the public is critically important in public health emergency preparedness. It is one of 15 public health emergency preparedness capabilities developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): ''Public Information and Warning.'' 7 During a crisis, federal, state, and local public health agencies are typically engaged in a variety of public information efforts to inform the population, encourage the adoption of preventive behaviors, and limit the adverse impacts of specific events. Yet, individuals and groups may not be able to access and use some of the resources offered to them, including information on health and specific threats, because of existing social inequalities, including socioeconomic position, race, ethnicity, and physical and mental health disabilities, among others. 8 Emergencies, including disasters, also can lead to longterm disparities, even controlling for predisaster socioeconomic status, as a study of Hurricane Katrina showed. 9 These disparities are also found among nations. For ex-ample, a United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) study showed that the adverse consequences of disasters, such as mortality, are greater among countries with low income, low life expectancy, and less education. 10 In contrast, advanced countries with higher income and education and more stable governance suffer fewer losses in disasters. 9 Poorer households tend to have poorer coping strategies and suffer consequences over the longer term. 11 In an analysis, Kim showed that poor people are more likely than nonpoor people to be exposed to disasters and that the poor are much more likely to be concentrated in disasterprone areas, highlighting the importance of public health emergency preparedness communications. 6 During an emergency, a number of psychosocial as well as social factors influence action, even when information about a probable hazard is available and promptly communicated to the public. For example, Mexican Americans often have delayed responses to natural emergencies because of the time they spend in trying to communicate with their extended families. 12 Hearing impairment may leave elderly people more vulnerable to information processing and cause difficulty in understanding evacuation orders, 13 and individuals with low literacy may be challenged in interpreting written messages and are likely to benefit from preparedness resources that are easy to read and visually appropriate. 14 Given the importance of communicating to the public in public health emergency preparedness, it is important to examine the extent to which this issue has received attention from the scientific community. The goal of this project was to conduct a systematic review of the scientific literature to describe current research in public communication in public health emergency preparedness, with a particular focus on communication inequalities and their association with communication and preparedness outcomes.

It is a three-in-one strategy to help countries: (1) strengthen the generic capacities for managing emerging diseases, (2) improve pandemic readiness, and (3) build up to meet the IHR core capacity requirements for surveillance and response. APSED (2005) identified five programme areas as priorities for national capacity-building, namely surveillance and response, laboratory, zoonoses, infection control and risk communication. Through the collective efforts of countries and areas, WHO and partners, considerable progress has been made in all five APSED (2005) capacity areas. For example, most countries have now established event-based surveillance systems to detect public health events including disease outbreaks. Trained rapid response teams (RRTs) are able to conduct field investigations quickly. The capacities of the national influenza centres have been significantly improved. These capacities were tested through a realworld global public health event -Pandemic (H1N1) 2009. The pandemic response clearly demonstrated the value of regional investment in capacity-building. 15 The 2005 Strategy has been recently revised in response to requests from countries and areas following recent developments and evolving needs. The updated Strategy, now called the Asia Pacific Strategy for Emerging Diseases (2010), also known as APSED (2010), was endorsed at the sixty-first Session of the Regional Committee for the Western Pacific in October 2010. 16 It builds on the experiences and accomplishments gained from implementing APSED (2005) and takes into account the key lessons learnt from the pandemic response, the needs expressed by countries and areas and the technical advice provided by experts during the intensive country and regional-level consultations between July 2009 and October 2010. Table 1 shows the similarities and differences between APSED (2005) and APSED (2010).

Approximately 80% of all antibiotics are prescribed in primary care, and up to 80% of these are for respiratory tract infections (53 ) . If an infection has a viral cause, antibiotics are useless and unlikely to provide clinical benefit to patients (53, 54 ) . At the same time, the inappropriate therapy of using antibiotics for viral infections increases the risk of emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains. In May 2015, the 68th World Health Assembly endorsed a global action plan to tackle antibiotic resistance. One of the 5 main actions of the plan was to optimize the use of antibiotic medicines in human and animal health (55 ). The Assembly declared that ""Decisions to prescribe antibiotics are rarely based on definitive diagnoses.

The precautionary information should be communicated to travelers with the risk assessed properly. Of course rapid detection of cases can lead to rapid response and early containment and finally to prevention of indigenous transmission of exotic pathogens. In this respect, effective infectious disease surveillance is essential. In this study it was not difficult to overview the situation of imported infectious diseases because the current Japanese surveillance system requires the presumptive place of infection including the specified country if possible. But there have been no studies on the evaluation of reporting rate. Before April 1999 when the infectious disease control law was revised, 50e80 cases of malaria were reported annually in the framework of the old infectious disease prevention law, but the Research Group on Chemotherapy of Tropical Diseases reported by their field investigation that approximately 120 patients have been confirmed with malaria annually. 12 It means that cases notified to the Ministry of Health and Welfare were about 50% in those days. Reports of malaria peaked in 2000 one year after the new law enactment and steadily decreased to the same level before 1999. On the other hand, Dengue fever is increasing. It is not possible to determine whether the reporting rate of malaria has decreased recently or not, it will be necessary to evaluate the surveillance system including assessment of missed opportunity for diagnosis and treatment.

In this vein, Radest notes that Canada's rapid and coordinated response to the SARS outbreak significantly limited its spread and impact in the United States. 56 The above examples echo the interconnectivity of the modern world and show how a course of action in one place, however passive, may significantly influence the course of events in another for good or bad. It supports the idea that contemporary health in the twenty-first century is now inevitably and inherently global with respect to infectious diseases. 57 At the heart of these remarks, however, is the possibility of utilizing different networks of human interconnectivity to actively foster the global good. In other words, learning about how people connect and relate at different levels (individually, communally, institutionally et cetera) and learning about the chief actors and players in such a relationship nexus may provide a powerful tool for driving global public health agenda. Yet, integral to such a process is how responses to pandemic influenza are framed and implemented locally as well as their attendant limitations.

While the benefits to human and public health are tangible in that understanding influenza virus patterns in swine may lead to more accurate and timely diagnosis of zoonotic influenza events, the reward for swine producers is less definable. The perception that influenza surveillance programs for pigs have fewer advantages for pork producers is likely due to several reasons, including the minimal impact of influenza virus infection on overall swine health and productivity, fear that trade and profits will be negatively affected, and the lack of readily available, consistently reliable, and inexpensive vaccines to control influenza once it is detected.

Surveillance is the systematic, ongoing collection, management, analysis, and interpretation of data to stimulate and guide action. The best-recognized use of surveillance is the detection of epidemics and community health problems. Big data has the potential to accelerate early detection of outbreaks and other community health issues. 4 New technologies will accelerate timeliness and completeness of electronic laboratory reporting for notifiable conditions. Tracking population movements and contact of potentially infected individuals can also be modernized using available technologies. For example, during the West African Ebola outbreak, mobile phone data provided objective, real-time information on location and movement of people to pre-empt future outbreaks. 7 Population data are also used to detect changes in health behaviors, monitor changes in environmental exposures, and evaluate control measures. The quality of surveillance will improve owing to new data sources, such as electronic health records, and communication methods, such as mobile technologies. More-accurate laboratory technologies will allow tracking of trends in environmental exposures and disease outcomes. The growth of interconnectivity in digital information can be used to monitor health both at the individual and population levels. Population disease surveillance systems, such as cancer registries, will benefit from enhanced refined diagnostic classification of diseases by adding molecular markers of etiology and treatment response as exemplified by the recent National Cancer Institute report to the nation on the status of cancer (e.g., HER2 mutations in breast cancer). 12 CDC's new surveillance strategy 13 will jump start accelerated use of tools to improve availability, quality, and timeliness of data, and linking public health data more effectively with clinical systems. A radical transformation is taking place in epidemiology, the fundamental science of public health, to include and integrate disparate sources of data. As with precision medicine, separating signal from noise will not be easy. A healthy dose of skepticism may be needed to guard against the overpromise of big data. For example, in compared with public health surveillances. 14 Even more problematic could be the potential for many false alarms by mindless examination, on a large scale, leading to putative associations between big data points and disease outcomes. This process may falsely infer causality and could potentially lead to faulty interventions. As the authors discuss in detail elsewhere, 4 separating signal from noise will require epidemiologic study designs that minimize bias, robust knowledge integration process, adherence to principles of evidencebased medicine and population screening, and a robust multidisciplinary translational research agenda that goes beyond initial discoveries to implement findings in populations. 4",32.31063459136397,13.846752725406574

These challenges and the attendant lessons learned were detailed in Learning from SARS: Renewal of public health in Canada -Report of the National Advisory Committee on SARS and Public Health (1) . Key among them were the need for better coordination of response actions taken by the multiple levels of government and the need for increased or renewed recognition of the public health threat posed by emerging or re-emerging infectious disease. Although the emergence of SARS was not predicted, an influenza pandemic was and still is considered inevitable in the context of public health emergency preparedness. As such, in an effort to formally recognise and widely share Federal/Provincial/ Territorial (FPT) coordinated planning, the Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan (CPIP) was first published in 2004, incorporating lessons learned from SARS. With an updated and evergreen CPIP released in 2006, Canada was much better prepared to respond to the 2009 emergence, spread and ensuing global pandemic of novel H1N1 influenza virus that originated in Mexico (2). Canada benefited from significant capacity-building investments, such as assuring access to a domestic pandemic vaccine and stockpiles of antiviral drugs. As it turned out, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic was not as severe as some of its predecessors. Hence, during and post-H1N1, national governments and the World Health Organization (WHO) recognized that a more flexible and adaptable response to future pandemics was needed to reflect local and regional circumstances (2). The Ebola virus disease outbreak that began in West Africa in late 2013 was not only a severe disease with high morbidity and mortality, it was also an epidemic of fear. This outbreak demonstrated the fatal impact of poor communications and the importance of accounting for local cultural beliefs and local leadership in the response. It was also a poignant example of the need to strengthen public health emergency response capacity in every country and to better coordinate rapid global response capacity, including research, if we are to protect others as well as ourselves (3, 4) .",30.11532048666808,12.579498776788677

The current practice of medicine ''. . .depends upon the decisionmaking capacity and reliability of autonomous individual practitioners, for classes of problems that routinely exceed the bounds of unaided human cognition.'' 1 Medical errors and suboptimal quality of care are an inevitable consequence of a health care system based on these unrealistic expectations. Recent reports from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) 2,3 and others 4,5 document safety and quality problems and clearly indicate that major improvements will require the application of information technology (IT) to provide physicians with immediate and effective access to both information about individual patients and current medical knowledge at the point of care. 6 For example, computerized physician order entry (CPOE) reduced charges in one institution by 12.7% and costs by 13.1% 7 and decreased serious medication errors by 55%. 8 A recently published estimate of the potential benefits from universal use of ambulatory CPOE projected substantial improvements in quality of care along with national savings of $44 billion per year. 9 The National Health Information Infrastructure (NHII) concept has evolved over several decades as medical informatics professionals implemented individual and enterprise-wide clinical information systems and explored the implications of extending such systems throughout the entire health care continuum. The widespread application of computer-based records in health care was recommended as early as 1991 by the IOM, which called them ''an essential technology for patient care.'' 10 This report was updated in 1997 11 and followed by the IOM's ''To Err Is Human'' report in 1999, which focused the nation's attention on the problem of medical errors. 2 Since then, several additional national expert panels have advocated widespread application of health IT. 3, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] Health IT should deliver complete medical information immediately for patient care when and where needed, including both patient-specific information and relevant decision support based on the latest scientific findings and guidelines. The set of organizing principles, systems, standards, procedures, and policies needed to achieve this vision, known as the NHII, would allow care providers to concentrate their efforts on applying judgment and experience to the clinical problem at hand based on complete information, rather than depending on potentially fallible memory applied to incomplete patient data. With presentlyavailable Internet and encryption technologies, patients with chronic illnesses can be monitored at home and can seek information to educate themselves about their problems. Also, facilitating access to electronic patient records by public health authorities and legitimate researchers under appropriate privacy protections could enable the development of population-based strategies to improve primary care as well as surveillance for diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or bioterrorist events.",31.82526177844713,14.363106494530623

Public-private partnerships for infectious disease surveillance are becoming increasingly common. An encouraging effort has begun, with support from the Rockefeller Foundation and GHSI, to develop a process for the various operating and nascent regional infectious disease surveillance systems to share best practices on issues, such as governance and the technical aspects of cross-border surveillance. 22 This effort should have the effect of bringing more government and private sector resources into infectious disease surveillance capabilities, which, if sustained, will bring about an increase in overall global surveillance capacity. This complements the essential and more topdown efforts of the WHO's strategy for epidemic alert and response that also relies on collaborative partners, including WHO Collaborating Centres, nongovernmental organizations, and industry. 7 Countries, therefore, will benefit from the renewed impetus to strengthen national capacity in surveillance and response and from the enhanced access to international investors interested in improving health in countries across the world, in the interest of global health and security. 7",34.884083603728385,15.28432057819565

The current practice of medicine ''. . .depends upon the decisionmaking capacity and reliability of autonomous individual practitioners, for classes of problems that routinely exceed the bounds of unaided human cognition.'' 1 Medical errors and suboptimal quality of care are an inevitable consequence of a health care system based on these unrealistic expectations. Recent reports from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) 2,3 and others 4,5 document safety and quality problems and clearly indicate that major improvements will require the application of information technology (IT) to provide physicians with immediate and effective access to both information about individual patients and current medical knowledge at the point of care. 6 For example, computerized physician order entry (CPOE) reduced charges in one institution by 12.7% and costs by 13.1% 7 and decreased serious medication errors by 55%. 8 A recently published estimate of the potential benefits from universal use of ambulatory CPOE projected substantial improvements in quality of care along with national savings of $44 billion per year. 9 The National Health Information Infrastructure (NHII) concept has evolved over several decades as medical informatics professionals implemented individual and enterprise-wide clinical information systems and explored the implications of extending such systems throughout the entire health care continuum. The widespread application of computer-based records in health care was recommended as early as 1991 by the IOM, which called them ''an essential technology for patient care.'' 10 This report was updated in 1997 11 and followed by the IOM's ''To Err Is Human'' report in 1999, which focused the nation's attention on the problem of medical errors. 2 Since then, several additional national expert panels have advocated widespread application of health IT. 3, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] Health IT should deliver complete medical information immediately for patient care when and where needed, including both patient-specific information and relevant decision support based on the latest scientific findings and guidelines. The set of organizing principles, systems, standards, procedures, and policies needed to achieve this vision, known as the NHII, would allow care providers to concentrate their efforts on applying judgment and experience to the clinical problem at hand based on complete information, rather than depending on potentially fallible memory applied to incomplete patient data. With presentlyavailable Internet and encryption technologies, patients with chronic illnesses can be monitored at home and can seek information to educate themselves about their problems. Also, facilitating access to electronic patient records by public health authorities and legitimate researchers under appropriate privacy protections could enable the development of population-based strategies to improve primary care as well as surveillance for diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or bioterrorist events.",34.307295282612074,15.231818220988352

Core capacities include the establishment of common laboratory standards, an effective surveillance system (based on disease, syndromic, or rumor reporting), and effective response capabilities (eg, contact tracing and monitoring through field epidemiology). For example, each member state has to ensure that it has the laboratory capacity to rapidly identify outbreaks; 1,6 to do so, provisions for technical support and extra resources for less-developed countries also are written into the revised IHR (2005). 1 The core response capacity requirements apply at all public health response levels-from local to intermediate to national. 9 Strengthening national public health capacities contributes to improving national and international readiness to detect, verify, investigate, and control disease outbreaks that have the potential to spread internationally. 7 Importantly, the revised IHR specify measures to prevent disease spread at designated points of entry. 6, 9 Operational and technologic communications and trust across countries are central tenets of regional surveillance networks. Moreover, each country's particular strengths can be leveraged across regional network partner nations. MECIDS and MBDS have acted as catalysts for the introduction and spread of new communications and laboratory technologies. For example, MBDS members are working with several international funding and technical partners to increase technical capacity for surveillance and disease control through computing; high-speed Internet access recently has been enhanced by the Trans-Eurasia Information Network 2 effort in Vietnam. When Vietnam lacked such Internet capacity in 2006, Thailand facilitated Vietnam's participation in the multinational videoconference on pandemic preparedness (organized by APEC Emerging Infections Network) by hosting the Vietnamese representatives at their videoconference center. As another example, tabletop exercises in individual MBDS countries and a regional MBDS exercise suggest that each country has unique strengths that can be considered for application across the region, such as electronic surveillance reporting in China; epidemiology training in Thailand; laboratory capacity in Thailand, China, and Vietnam; community surveillance in Cambodia; and government organization for national influenza preparedness in Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR) (Dr. Moe Ko Oo, MBDS Coordinator, personal communication, 2008).",34.35028632089469,14.846863248564208

But the provincial contribution to public health spending, which is based on what the minister considers appropriate, has varied considerably in recent years (Pasut 2007). Before 1997, the province funded 75% of the mandatory program budgets for most boards of health and municipalities funded the remaining 25%. In 1996, the Social Services Sub-Panel of the Ontario Who Does What? panel concluded that the province has the primary interest in public health and that public health services should be delivered by provincially appointed and funded boards of health (Crombie and Hopcroft 1996). However, this recommendation was never implemented. Instead, public health and many social services were downloaded to municipalities in 1997, with the province assuming more responsibility for education (see Graham and Phillips 1998). This total download of public health lasted until 1999, when the province moved to a 50/50 funding formula (Campbell 2004). The 50/50 formula stayed in place until 2004. In 2005, the province began to phase in a return to its previous mandatory program contribution level of 75%. This increase in provincial funding was in response to the fallout from two public health emergencies – the Escherichia coli outbreak in Walkerton in 2000 and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 – and was intended to increase the capacity of the public health system. The province's original plan was to reach the 75/25 funding split within three years, but it has since capped its annual increases.

HPHS did not act with the same level of independence, but it started out from a healthier funding position; so, perhaps the need was not as strong.

Many in the public health field have argued that autonomous health units are in a better position to pursue their legislative responsibilities than health units that are integrated into municipal structures. The MLHU did behave according to these expectations after the funding increase, but, prior to this, it took its budget direction from its largest municipal funder. Under this arrangement, it was not able to act with much independence and fared worse in terms of per capita funding than HPHS. In other words, autonomous health units might only be able to act according to provincial expectations when most of their funding comes from the province.

This could address the issue of staff not presenting to work since community involvement in planning could positively influence decisions healthcare workers take during an emergency with respect to work and surge capacity.

We found that the public trusted the CDC director to lead the COVID-19 response with trust in the public health/scientific leadership being high. Responsive, open, and respectful communication with the US population by these agencies may improve public health compliance and safety. 3 Furthermore, although participants reported relatively low risk perception, many supported restrictive policies for infection prevention. A portion of the sample also supported temporary discrimination based on someone's country of origin. These responses are concerning, and preemptive targeted messaging by the public health agencies is required to ensure a compassionate response to this outbreak. Our findings may be influenced by possible selection bias because participants needed a CloudResearch account and access to smartphone/computer to participate.

We implement one of the first nationally representative surveys about this unprecedented public health crisis and use it to evaluate the Italian government' public health efforts and citizen responses. Findings: (1) Public health messaging is being heard. Except for slightly lower compliance among young adults, all subgroups we studied understand how to keep themselves and others safe from the SARS-Cov-2 virus. Remarkably, even those who do not trust the government , or think the government has been untruthful about the crisis believe the messaging and claim to be acting in accordance. (2) The quarantine is beginning to have serious negative effects on the population's mental health. Policy Recommendations: Communications should move from explaining to citizens that they should stay at home to what they can do there. We need interventions that make staying following public health protocols more desirable, such as virtual social interactions, online social reading activities, classes, exercise routines, etc. -all designed to reduce the boredom of long term social isolation and to increase the attractiveness of following public health recommendations.
