Here, three issues are perhaps most critical. Firstly, data gathering resources are almost always limited. Therefore, carefully designed randomised sampling schemata should be employed to maximise the power of the statistical techniques used to analyse data, rather than having to reply on data augmentation techniques to work around the problems present in ad hoc datasets. This aspect is particularly important when working on network data derived from population samples. Secondly, any inference on both network and infectious disease models should be backed up by a careful analysis of model fit. Although recent advances in statistical epidemiology have given us an unprecedented ability to measure population/disease dynamics based on readily available field data, epidemic model diagnostics are currently in their infancy in comparison to techniques in other areas of statistics. Therefore, it is expected that with the growth in popularity of network models for analysing disease spread, much research effort will be required in designing such methodology.",25.59148166642826,12.336360137891614

We believe IRMA is successful in assembling reads to more distant references because viral gene segments have varying levels of conservation across their length that allow for the capture of a portion of the reads. Furthermore, the first reads gathered will not, on average, solely overlap the more conserved regions but will span some of the less conserved regions as well.

Whereas the surveillance system was implemented in five of six target provinces, six of 11 provinces of the country were not covered. Adding additional surveillance sites could improve representativeness; however, this would also increase costs and logistical difficulties. Given that the existing system met the surveillance objectives (especially those related to seasonal influenza), adding surveillance sites in other provinces is not recommended. The identification of avian influenza viruses' infection in humans (one of the objectives of the surveillance system) through facility-based sentinel surveillance remains challenging due to the limited number of surveillance sites that can be supported with limited resources. Close collaboration with the animal health authorities and the joint investigation of animal and human populations during identified avian influenza outbreaks in birds would represent a more costeffective strategy to identify potential zoonotic transmission of avian influenza viruses. System stability was demonstrated by its ability to operate continuously since its establishment in 2006. The stability of most surveillance systems in the African region is related to human and financial resources. The stability of the ISSS in DRC is probably reliant on its simplicity that resulted in the acceptability of surveillance activities by surveillance staff. Nonetheless, the simplicity of the system may have affected the extent of information collected. Not all minimum data collection requirements suggested by WHO for influenza sentinel surveillance [1] were met. The collection of additional data about underlying medical conditions may allow, for instance, the identification of more vulnerable populations for severe influenza-associated illness that in return could guide targeted prevention measures such as annual influenza immunization [16, 17] . Nevertheless, the introduction of more intense data gathering should be weighed against its impact on acceptability. Whereas the system overall was stable, logistical constrains in terms of power supply and transport of samples were identified. The simplicity and acceptability of the system as well as the periodic supervision of the sentinel sites may also have contributed to the observed good quality and completeness of the data. Nonetheless, the ISSS in DRC is largely reliant on external funds (> 90%) and the acceptability of maintaining the surveillance system through national funds should be evaluated and/or contemplated as lack of external funds could impact the stability of the system.",11.59143545060773,5.67352194826103

The previously common practice of sequencing a relatively conserved RdRp amplicon of 300-400 bp renders many sequences available in GenBank of little use in detailed phylogenetic analysis, as does the frequent missing metadata regarding species of isolation, country, and date of collection. Sequencing small regions is not adequate to determine if a virus strain is a novel, divergent strain or a recombinant virus. Recommendations should be made to encourage full genome sequencing where possible and the deposition of associated host and demographic information. Although analysis of amino acid sequences of the capsid region is required for classification, it leads to confusion regarding appropriate phylogenetic analysis, with highly inconsistent publication of nucleotide and amino acid trees further complicating attempts to clarify diversity and classification. The topologies of amino acid trees differ to those of nucleotide trees, particularly for the analysis of MAstV, and whilst amino acid trees are required for classification, nucleotide trees may be more appropriate for describing within species diversity (Figures S1 and S2) . Incorporating a standardized nomenclature to aid in classification has proven invaluable in the classification of numerous viruses, including rotavirus and influenza [122] . Adopting a nomenclature that records the appropriate metadata associated with sample collection including host, location, date of collection, and determined species and serotype as proposed by Martella and colleagues would vastly improve the usability of strains for more complex analyses [38] .",11.97640414440695,8.488478489631635

Their exclusion has been shown to substantially reduce potential outbreak size [22, 23] . Likewise, Webb and colleagues [15] found that agricultural shows increase the potential for epidemic outbreaks in British sheep. Both markets and shows can be described as gathering events, where animals from many holdings are brought to the same location for a short period of time and are again distributed to many holdings, afterwards. Gathering events of both human and animals can drastically increase the risk of acquiring and transmitting disease [24, 25] . In network terms gathering events can be described as 'hubs'-nodes with high in-and out-degree, connecting a high number of holdings. The existence of hubs in a network can lead to a highly skewed or heavy tailed distribution, which has important implication for the spread of diseases [26, 27] . Some cattle networks have, indeed, degree distributions which are almost scale-free [23, 28, 29 ]. Switzerland's cattle industry is characterized by high market activity. Even though relatively few in numbers, cattle markets occur at different periodicities and have a wide range of catchment areas. They also vary in terms of veterinary regulations.

Systematic survey of current practices and methods,"Background: Guidelines in the healthcare field generally should contain evidence-based recommendations to inform healthcare decisions. Guidelines often require 2 years or more to develop, but certain circumstances necessitate the development of rapid guidelines (RGs) in a short period of time. Upholding methodological rigor while meeting the reduced development timeframe presents a challenge for developing RGs. Our objective was to review current practices and standards for the development of RGs. This is the first of a series of three articles addressing methodological issues around RGs. Methods: We conducted a systematic survey of methods manuals and published RGs to identify reasons for the development of RGs. Data sources included existing guideline manuals, published RGs, Trip Medical Database, MEDLINE, EMBASE and communication with guideline developers until February 2018. Results: We identified 46 guidelines that used a shortened timeframe for their development. Nomenclature describing RGs varied across organisations, wherein the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention produced 'Interim Guidelines', the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the United Kingdom developed 'Short Clinical Guidelines', and WHO provided 'Rapid Advice'. The rationale for RGs included response to emergencies, rapid increases in cases of a condition or disease severity, or new evidence regarding treatment. In general, the methods to assess the quality of evidence, the consensus process and the management of the conflict of interest were not always clear. While we identified another 11 RGs from other institutions, there was no reference to timeframe and reasons for conducting a RG. The three organisations mentioned above provide guidance for the development of RGs. Conclusions: There is a lack of standardised nomenclature and definitions regarding RGs and there is inconsistency in the methods described in manuals and in RG. It is therefore important that all RGs provide a detailed and transparent description of their methods in order for readers and end-users to be able to assess their quality and validate their findings.",12.922351254818562,8.717394017010136

The fusion domains of class II and III penetrenes have a highly similar structure. Therefore, a class III domain nomenclature is used here that can apply to both rhabdovirus G and herpesvirus gB and assigns domain II (IV in the VSV G nomenclature of Roche et al. [17] , I in the HSV-1 gB nomenclature of Heldwein et al. [19] ) as the class III fusion domain as in class II penetrenes. In addition to minor adjustments in the ends of domains, the current class III penetrene numbering also combines two interacting domains into domain III (I + II in Roche's VSV G nomenclature, III + IV in Heldwein's HSV-1 gB nomenclature). The fusion domains of all class II or III penetrenes contain 1 or 2 prominent fusion loops, which give significant scores on the WWIHS [34] . Sequences with positive WWIHS have a high potential to interface with or disrupt lipid membranes, and therefore are key features of viral penetrenes. Another feature of the fusion domains of class II and III penetrenes is the presence of several dicysteine bonds, which appear to stabilize the overall domain architecture. Regions in THOV GP (aa and AcMNPV GP64 (aa 49-186) with 6 or 8 cysteine residues, plus 1 or 2 sequences with positive WWIHS scores (Fig. 1 , red letters) are likely to represent the fusion domains.",12.84887222408296,8.492774035390859

The annual practice of summering to access forage at high pastures dates from ancient times and about half of all Swiss cattle farms participate in it [30] . The animals are walked up on foot in April/May and down in September/October. Usually, the animals from different farms form a single herd that roams during the day and overnights in a single stable with shared milking facilities. Thus, alps can be considered as another type of gathering event where disease could be transferred [31, 32] . In contrast to that of the markets, the periodicity of the alps is yearly, and their duration is around three months. As small gathering events, alps can be expected to contribute to network connectivity, yet due to differences in size and duration their contribution might differ from that of markets. While the impact of markets on network connectivity has been studied previously [21, 23] , the role of alpine summering has not yet been evaluated.",13.67547593504001,8.173816059991054

Over time, and aided by further introductions from nonswine hosts, swine H1 viruses have diversified into three genetic lineages. Due to limited global data, these H1 lineages were named based on colloquial context, leading to a proliferation of inconsistent regional naming conventions. In this study, we propose rigorous phylogenetic criteria to establish a globally consistent nomenclature of swine H1 virus hemagglutinin (HA) evolution. These criteria applied to a data set of 7,070 H1 HA sequences led to 28 distinct clades as the basis for the nomenclature. We developed and implemented a web-accessible annotation tool that can assign these biologically informative categories to new sequence data. The annotation tool assigned the combined data set of 7,070 H1 sequences to the correct clade more than 99% of the time. Our analyses indicated that 87% of the swine H1 viruses from 2010 to the present had HAs that belonged to 7 contemporary cocirculating clades. Our nomenclature and web-accessible classification tool provide an accurate method for researchers, diagnosticians, and health officials to assign clade designations to HA sequences. The tool can be updated readily to track evolving nomenclature as new clades emerge, ensuring continued relevance. A common global nomenclature facilitates comparisons of IAVs infecting humans and pigs, within and between regions, and can provide insight into the diversity of swine H1 influenza virus and its impact on vaccine strain selection, diagnostic reagents, and test performance, thereby simplifying communication of such data.

Some reported conditions were delay or substandard care, which had been previously reported [21] . Reasons for the delay in treatment were the woman or family member (including delay in identifying the condition, seeking care and refusing to accept treatment), health service (difficulties in obtaining equipment or medical supplies) or health professional (delays in identifying the correct diagnosis and providing appropriate patient treatment). Sample size was determined by the prevalence of about 8 maternal near miss cases per 1000 births and a maternal mortality ratio of 140/100,000 live-born infants (95 % confidence interval). It was predicted that 75,000 births [19] needed to be monitored.",11.827683565981028,9.950833409317724

Latent variable modelling is a meritorious method of identifying resilient individuals due to the removal of researcher-defined thresholds, that is, greater objectivity, and the ability to categorise individuals into different relative trajectories. In contrast to definition-driven methods that employ a series of components and thresholds, latent variable modelling allows group membership to be determined based on the characteristics of individuals in the sample relative to each other rather than relative to an external criterion. This is useful in unpicking different levels of resilience using person-centred methods, that is, study participants with similar performances, rather than variable-centred methods, that is, participants who perform above or below an a priori threshold on a variable, as in definition-driven methods. Studies in the present review generally captured three waves of data over an average of 5 years; however, when more follow-up data waves are available, data-driven methods are better able to represent changing trajectories than definition-driven methods that posit binary states.

Results from a Systematic Literature Review and Analysis of the National Outbreak Reporting System,"To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to describe the frequency and characteristics of mass gathering-related respiratory disease outbreaks occurring in the United States. Mass gathering-related respiratory disease outbreaks appeared to be relatively rare during our 10-year project period, but were reported from agricultural fairs (zoonotic transmission) and summer camps where participants had close social contact in communal housing. Though legionellosis outbreaks were more common, none of these water-borne outbreaks was linked to a mass gathering in our analysis. The type and duration (multi-day events with communal housing) of mass gatherings could be important factors in mass gathering-related respiratory disease outbreaks. International participation may be a contributing factor for certain diseases. As anticipated, we identified several mass gathering-related pdm09H1N1 outbreaks involving school-aged children [41] . These persons are a high-risk age group for the novel 2009 influenza virus. Compared to other settings, influenza transmission among children and teenagers is more likely to occur within households, school classes, peer groups, and sports teams [42] [43] [44] -all of these social mixing opportunities are prominent at summer camps. Children and adolescents can easily have more than 20 close contacts with other children lasting 5 minutes of more during a typical school day [45] . Both the number and duration of close contacts could be higher in residential camps. This is supported by the outbreaks reported from Maine where the camp size and the number of campers per cabin were associated with influenza outbreaks [25] . Though respiratory disease transmission can occur at summer camps, influenza transmission during the summer (in the United States) outside a pandemic is uncommon; pdm09HIN1 was circulating since early spring and was involved a number of school-based outbreaks in states reporting camp-related influenza outbreaks in summer 2009. No respiratory illnesses were detected from a syndromic surveillance system implemented at a large school-aged summer camp in Virginia in 2005 [40] .",10.269681887590517,6.029099395739307

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) gB are closely related in sequence to HSV-1 gB.

CMV gB is glycosylated to a similar extent as BDV G, while EBV gB has an intermediate level of glycosylation. Therefore, a high level of glycosylation does not preclude the possibility that BDV G is a class III VFP.

The evolutionary dynamics of eleven genes in H5N1 virus are complicated, but the substitution rates of HA and neuramidinase (NA) are significantly higher than the rates of the internal protein segments (such as PA or M1 ) [43, 44] . According to a nomenclature system devised for H5N1 in 2008, the HAs can be divided into ten phylogenetic clades (0-9), of which three clades, namely clade 0, clade 1 and clade 2, are responsible for most human infections [45] . There was a marked divergence in the last four years, as several new subclades emerged and predominated in the H5N1 epidemics. When some groups in one monophyletic clade meet the divergence criteria (bootstrap values .60), they can split into second, third or even fourth-order clades [46] . [4] . However, several previously circulating clades were not detected for the past 4 years, and it was likely that these clades were supplanted by the new clades. Based on an updated unified nomenclature system, the current circulating H5N1 virus in the past two years are centralized primarily in clades 1. [46] .",11.601473952967865,7.8824586182570755

These two models are not applicable for diseases with lower incidences such as anthrax, cholera and the plague; therefore, other methods are necessary for early warning [7] . Because the Chinese Notifiable Infectious Diseases Surveillance and Report System began to operate nationwide in 2004 [18] , only disease data in the recent 16 years could be obtained. The sample size of the training set was small, which may have influenced the calculation results for synaptic weights in the model to a certain extent. This study only references a new modelling approach and was limited in its scope in terms of validation. Future work will be focused on gathering more data and cases and providing a more comprehensive model validation. Furthermore, we evaluated the epidemic intensities of infectious diseases in the entire nation. However, infectious disease epidemics, such as dengue fever and malaria, might be limited to a certain area, or they may spread throughout the entire country after an outbreak in a certain area, such as SARS and H1N1 influenza A. If analysis and judgement were performed only based on the national data of these diseases, prevention and control of the epidemic would usually be delayed. Therefore, this model should be implemented in every province and every city to increase the timeliness of early warning of infectious diseases all over the country. In addition, real-time multivariate analysis is currently one of the research focuses in the field of early warnings for diseases, including multistatistical process control, biological change-point detection and some others [7] . Since the application of artificial neural networks in the field of early warnings for diseases is relatively new, further research is required to achieve greater precision.",10.306455854570114,7.592184711891745

Some of these methods have been applied to the same data sets and formally compared [18, [37] [38] [39] [40] . Of the two studies that addressed the value of historical data, a generalized linear model (GLM) that took advantage of 3 years of past data often outperformed EARS [39] , whereas a seasonally adjusted cumulative sum (CUSUM) method did not [18] . Even though a number of explanations could help reconcile these results, we note that as the size of an epidemic signal increases relative to the background noise, outbreak recognition becomes easier and the performance of alternative detection methods becomes more and more difficult to distinguish [39, 41] . This rationale could explain why the GLM approach implemented by Jackson et al. did not add value under all conditions, but performed well with slow-escalating outbreaks qualitatively similar to the one used in our study [39] . In our particular real-world case, we found SARIMA to be more sensitive than EARS at discovering signals related to the pH1N1 pandemic wave that hit Baltimore in the summer of 2009. However, there was no associated timeliness advantage to SAR-IMA, as the initial peak of ARI cases was large enough to be picked by both statistical approaches.

Moreover, treatment facilities might be evaluated by the proportion of their patients who survive; here the relative CFR calculated would be for treatment in one facility versus treatment in another. There will be a temptation to conclude that treatment facilities with higher CFR are doing a worse job-that is, to apply a causal interpretation to observed differences in the CFR. Even in settings with more resources to measure covariates, methods of risk-adjustment of comparative outcomes to account for the mix of patients seen are complex and controversial [38] . In an emergency setting, with few covariates available to characterize the ""case mix"" of a health care provider, causal interpretation of differences in CFR would be particularly prone to error, potentially producing conclusions that mislead and thereby damage control efforts. For instance, if through confounding, larger referral treatment centers primarily receive patients who have survived infection for some time and are therefore less likely to die, independently of treatment, this may be erroneously interpreted as more effective treatment in these centers. Similarly, if certain treatment centers preferentially admit the most symptomatic patients, they may falsely appear to be less effective or even harmful to patient outcome. With at least five separate sources of bias in CFR or relative CFR estimates, and only imperfect solutions typically available for most due to lack of data, separating causal from non-causal factors in relative CFR estimation seems extremely risky. This is not to deny that data should be gathered or analyzed; on the contrary, the biases here suggest that more thorough data gathering is necessary before analyses of such quantities as relative CFR are relied upon for any decision.",15.113932575063844,7.3496320424943455

A broad restructuring of the poultry distribution system would greatly help to reduce environmental contamination and thus risk of transmission in both poultry and humans. Key changes would include a shift from rLBMs to cold-chain distribution, and introduction of a centralized slaughter system with standardized, hygienic practices for slaughter, decontamination, and waste processing. These changes are more difficult to implement in some countries because of the cultural and social importance of rLBMs as well as the ever-changing animal-trade network which involves many small businesses. Nevertheless, policies that require standardized poultry supply activities, with minimal stay-times of birds in any specific holding and minimal transfers between holdings before entering rLBMs are essential to control the transmission of AIVs in poultry populations, and thus prevent the emergence of novel strains.

Hospital administrative support for the infrastructure required for ongoing measurement and reporting of antimicrobial use and other related outcome measures, including feedback to prescribers, is a critical component of a successful antimicrobial stewardship program. An antimicrobial stewardship program can optimize clinical outcomes while decreasing unintended consequences of antimicrobial use, including the emergence of resistant organisms. Additionally, use of specific antimicrobial agents can alert the IPC program to the presence of potentially infectious patients (e.g., with pulmonary tuberculosis, MDROs). National guidelines exist for developing and implementing an institutional antimicrobial stewardship program, including core components for acute care hospitals and for long-term care facilities. 68, 70 The Natinal Quality Forum and its partners have also developed a Playbook that provides additional guidance for implementation of antimicrobial stewardship programs in acute care. The knowledge and skills required for antimicrobial stewardship leaders also have been defined. 50, 71 these data by the public remains difficult, and more research is needed to optimize methods of data display to the public. 57 New York State is the first state to have published an improvement in process and outcomes of central line-associated bloodstream infection rates in NICUs following implementation of a public reporting program. 58 Although various surveillance methods are used, the basic goals and elements are similar and include using standardized definitions of infection, finding and collecting cases of HAIs, tabulating data, using appropriate denominators that reflect duration of risk, analyzing and interpreting the data, reporting important deviations from endemic rates (epidemic, outbreaks) to the bedside care providers and to the facility administrators, implementing appropriate control measures, auditing adherence rates for recommended processes, and assessing efficacy of the control measures. Medical centers can use different methods of surveillance, as outlined in Box 2.1. Most experts agree that a combination of methods enhances surveillance and reliability of data, and some combination of clinical chart review and database retrieval is important. Whatever data collection systems are used, validation is required. Administrative databases created for the purposes of billing should not be used as the sole source to identify HAIs because of overestimates and underestimates that result from inaccurate coding of HAIs. 59 Use of software designed specifically for IPC data entry and analysis facilitates real-time tracking of trends and timely intervention when clusters are identified.

The CDC recommends the following: (1) prospective surveillance on a regular basis by trained infection preventionists, using standardized definitions; (2) analysis of infection rates using established epidemiologic and statistical methods (e.g., calculation of rates using appropriate denominators that reflect duration of exposure; use of statistical process control charts for trending rates); (3) regular use of data in decision making; and (4) employment of an effective and trained healthcare epidemiologist who develops IPC strategies and policies and serves as a liaison with the medical community and administration.

Standardization of surveillance methodology has become especially important with the advent of state legislation for mandatory reporting of HAI rates to the public. The NHSN now receives, analyzes, and reports data from >17,000 healthcare facilities in the US. A standardized infection ratio (SIR) that takes into account differences in risk among healthcare settings, unit types, procedures, and patient populations has been included in summary reports of HAI rates since 2009. 56 The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and most states use the NHSN data for public reporting of HAI rates on their websites.

Early publications provided guidelines for gene and strain nomenclature, a list (database) of strains and substrains, and a list (database) of abbreviations for the researchers or institutions maintaining the mice. 12 The list of abbreviations became the ""laboratory codes"" (lab codes) that are currently curated by ILAR (http://dels.nas.edu/global/ilar/lab-codes) and are available to producers and researchers at no charge. The lab code identifies the mouse source and becomes part of its name. The 1963 revision includes a listing of named genes, including histocompatibility alleles for many of the common strains. Subsequent committees updated the guidelines and included lists of inbred strains, substrains, and known genetic variants.

While there are several required data related to both the participants attending the event and the event itself, the most important aspect is the incoming and outgoing travel patterns before and after the event. Travel patterns of the participants can be used to predict the path and the dynamics of a potential global epidemic. There is a need for more advanced studies in the context of modeling disease spread in MGs. These studies should provide reliable methods to determine or adequately estimate the incoming and outgoing travel patterns, the event size and setting, and the characteristics of the expected population. These studies should also identify the best methodologies to utilize and integrate these data into disease-spread models.

Moreover, gathering detailed data about the expected participating populations at MGs prior to the event is very challenging if not infeasible. But, it is essential to have at least an adequate approximation of the demographics of the expected populations. For example, data from previous occurrences of MGs can be collected and analyzed to estimate the features of future participants attending similar events. In addition, as suggested by Nsoesie et al. [20] and Chowell et al. [22] using advanced monitoring and sensing devices of a representative sample provides higher levels of details about participants at MGs and their interactions and movements. With such advanced methods extensive amounts of data will be generated and need to be analyzed to extract useful information about the participants, their demographics, contact patterns, and behaviors during the event. Social media such as twitter can provide an alternative data sources about these events. Analyzing tweets posted by the participants can provide insights about their behaviors, movements and the event itself, which can be used when modeling disease spread. Moreover, simulating vastly increasing and high dimensional heterogeneous data representing the populations at global MGs provide a great big data challenge. As there is a need to integrate individual differences when modeling disease transmission at each stage of the event.

Similarly, the need for guidance on the analysis and integration of qualitative and quantitative data is a prominant issue (Bazeley, 2009 ). This paper firstly intended to review the types of analytic approaches (parallel, concurrent or sequential data analysis) that have been used in mixed methods studies within healthcare research. As identified in previous research (O'Cathain et al., 2008) , we found that the majority of studies included in our review employed parallel data analysis in which the different analyses are not compared or consolidated until the full analysis of both data sets have been completed. A trend to conduct separate analysis on quantitative and qualitative data is apparent in mixed methods healthcare studies, despite the fact that if the data were correlated, a more complete picture of a particular phenomenon may be produced (Onwuegbuzie and Teddlie, 2003) . If qualitative and quantitative data are not integrated during data collection or analysis, the findings may be integrated at the stage of interpretation and conclusion.",10.543316188189921,7.040561185237506

It has been argued that mixed methods research can be particularly useful in healthcare research as only a broader range of perspectives can do justice to the complexity of the phenomena studied (Clarke and Yaros, 1988; Foss and Ellefsen, 2002; Steckler et al., 1992) . By combining qualitative and quantitative findings, an overall or negotiated account of the findings can be forged, not possible by using a singular approach (Bryman, 2007) . Mixed methods can also help to highlight the similarities and differences between particular aspects of a phenomenon (Bernardi et al., 2007) . Interest in, and expansion of, the use of mixed methods designs have most recently been fuelled by pragmatic issues: the increasing demand for cost effective research and the move away from theoretically driven research to research which meets policymakers' and practitioners' needs and the growing competition for research funding (Brannen, 2009; O'Cathain et al., 2007) . Tashakkori and Creswell (2007) broadly define mixed methods research as ''research in which the investigator collects and analyses data, integrates the findings and draws inferences using both qualitative and quantitative approaches' ' (2007:3) . In any mixed methods study, the purpose of mixing qualitative and quantitative methods should be clear in order to determine how the analytic techniques relate to one another and how, if at all, the findings should be integrated (O'Cathain et al., 2008; Onwuegbuzie and Teddlie, 2003) . It has been argued that a characteristic of truly mixed methods studies are those which involve integration of the qualitative and quantitative findings at some stage of the research process, be that during data collection, analysis or at the interpretative stage of the research (Kroll and Neri, 2009 ). An example of this is found in mixed methods studies which use a concurrent data analysis approach, in which each data set is integrated during the analytic stage to provide a complete picture developed from both data sets after data has been qualitised or quantitised (i.e. where both forms of data have been converted into either qualitative or quantitative data so that it can be easily merged) (Onwuegbuzie and Teddlie, 2003) . Other analytic approaches have been identified including; parallel data analysis, in which collection and analysis of both data sets is carried out separately and the findings are not compared or consolidated until the interpretation stage, and finally sequential data analysis, in which data are analysed in a particular sequence with the purpose of informing, rather than being integrated with, the use of, or findings from, the other method (Onwuegbuzie and Teddlie, 2003) . An example of sequential data analysis might be where quantitative findings are intended to lead to theoretical sampling in an in depth qualitative investigation or where qualitative data is used to generate items for the development of quantitative measures.",11.130003531766759,7.006812385715533

Nomenclatures simplify textual documents by uniting synonymous terms under a common code,0.25799265850509556,2.1119041442871094,2.7925755977630615,50c7c070-6a08-419f-81f9-9b052eec6c40,custom_license/Taxonomic Guide to Infectious Diseases Section 8.1 Abandoning Koch's postulates,"(1) the nomenclature terms are not annotated with definitions, (2) nomenclature terms may be multiword, and (3) the terms in the nomenclature are limited to the scope of the selected knowledge domain. In addition, most nomenclatures group synonyms under a group code. For example, a food nomenclature might collect submarine, hoagie, po' boy, grinder, hero, and torpedo under an alphanumeric code such as ""F63958."" Nomenclatures simplify textual documents by uniting synonymous terms under a common code. Documents that have been coded with the same nomenclature can be integrated with other documents that have been similarly coded, and queries conducted over such documents will yield the same results, regardless of the term is entered (i.e., a search for either hoagie or po' boy will retrieve the same information, if both terms have been annotated with the synonym code, ""F63948""). Optimally, the canonical concepts listed in the nomenclature are organized into a hierarchical classification [103, 104] . Problematica The term ""problematica"" is used by taxonomists to indicate a class of organism that defies robust classification [105] . The very existence of this term tells us that taxonomy is a delicate and tentative science. We must always be prepared to examine and test our current classification, and to make corrections wherever warranted. Proximate cause Synonymous with the immediate cause. The proximate cause of a biological event is the closest action that can be held responsible for the cause of the event. For example, the rupture of a blood vessel in the lung may be the proximate cause of death, while an invasive lung cancer may have been the underlying cause of death. The erosion of a vessel by tumor cells was one of the sequence of events leading from the underlying cause of death to the proximate cause of death. The underlying cause of death satisfies the ""but-for"" condition. But for the lung cancer, the vessel would not have eroded, and blood would not have flooded the lung tissue. The proximate cause of death need not be a necessary condition resulting from the underlying cause of death. Had the vessel not ruptured, the individual may have died from an alternate proximate cause (e.g., metastasis, pneumonia). Root cause The earliest event or condition that is known to set in motion a chain of additional events that can result in some specified result. The term ""root cause"" is preferable to another term ""underlying cause"" that is often applied to the same concept. Any of the events that precede a result could be construed as underlying causes. The term ""root cause"" conveys the idea of a first or earliest event in a multievent process. Of course, we can never be certain what the earliest event is in any process. For example, infections from Naegleria fowleri result from exposure to free-living organisms in their natural habitat (pond and river water). The organism travels from the nose to the brain, where it causes a meningoencephalitis. It seems self-evident that Naegleria fowleri is the root cause of Naeglerian meningoencephalitis.

Serum markers are useful because they are easily accessed by established and noninvasive standardized collection procedures and serum specimens are near homogeneous. Indeed, serum biomarkers, such as periostin, have been used recently in efforts to predict treatment benefit in patients with asthma [24] . Furthermore, we found that the biomarker spectrum in nasal secretion and serum was not identical, suggesting that both systemic and local specimens need to be examined in an effort to identify best biomarkers for clinical practice and research. We undertook a methodical screening approach using network visualization tool to study serum parameters in CRS exacerbation. Biological parameters can be analyzed by pre-selected variables based on pre acquired, scientific knowledge or by using methods that aid in discovery of patterns in larger sets of data. Conventional analyses employ measurements of central tendency, such as median, mean, or mode, for a limited number of variables, which allows organization and interpretation of data; however, in the process may compress outliers and individual variations, and thus potentially risk missing important clues of information. In contrast, unsupervised simultaneous variable analysis methods allow for the concurrent overview of a high number of variables without compression of information. In particular, certain novel multivariate methods, such as network analysis employ unsupervised learning, allowing the data to reveal patterns without a priori assumptions in comparator classes (e.g., cases and controls) leading to discovery of associations and correlations without preconceived distinctions. The potential advantage of employing such methods is to identify high-level patterns during an initial step, which can then be further focused and substantiated using conventional analyses.",11.376598548365587,8.244419510181281

All lowercase letters used denote deciduous teeth, capital letters permanent teeth: I, incisors; C, canines; P, premolars; and M, molars. A number then is assigned to the letter that denotes the location of the tooth in the oral cavity (e.g., first molar and second incisor). The oral cavity is divided into four quadrants. The horse's right maxillary arcade is the first arcade. The other three quadrants are assigned sequentially in a clockwise manner from the examiner's position facing the horse. The anatomic letter then has the positional number placed around the letter to represent the location of the tooth.

The criterion standard to gauge the effectiveness of CP would be a randomized controlled trial that compared CP of similar dose, timing of administration, and antibody titers to non-CP plasma infusion. Although standardizing the dose and timing of administration of CP is straightforward, determining antibody titers is not because there is no standardized assay available. Even when considering the assays used in Ebola virus research studies, variability exists in methodology, substrates, and nomenclature, making comparisons difficult. Owing to CP as a biologic product, many additional variables may affect any potential efficacy including the donor's immune response, whether the donor was infected by a similar strain of Ebola, and the epitopes recognized by the anti-Ebola antibodies. Because only GP is accessible on the virus surface, anti-GP antibodies mechanistically are more likely to be neutralizing [39] . As such, CP collected from survivors of EVD may be different from donors who were vaccinated against Ebola. Possibly, a subset of donors with hightiter neutralizing antibodies as measured by a clinically validated assay would yield CP with measurable efficacy. Given these challenges, truly meaningful conclusions regarding the value of CP remain elusive. However, as new outbreaks of infections emerge, especially with a high case-fatality rate, CP will continue to be a useful frontline tool given its favorable safety profile and ability to be rapidly deployed, which is likely to only improve with more widespread pathogenreduction availability.",10.792889544751386,8.977409833952933

It was designed to provide surveillance information that is obtained from unified and broadly applicable health surveillance methods for all levels of public health to detect diseases and related health problems early with a timely assessment and response. BioSense uses many forms of surveillance information, including complaints, symptoms and laboratory tests that are required for clinical diagnoses. Focusing on clinical symptoms and symptoms of diagnosed or undiagnosed cases, it reflects syndrome surveillance and constitutes, together with BioWatch and NBIS, the three core biological surveillance programs. BioSense is an international, multijurisdictional, information-sharing surveillance platform that applies to all levels of the public health sector.

BioSense can visualize time, space, people and other information via maps, charts, tables and other forms, and the information that it presents can indicate data anomalies. When receiving a prompt, users can confirm the anomalies with related information and may provide an early warning of health problems.

As to the first, the intense interest of the international media created a news storm that no jurisdiction -not even China -could escape. Where there were obstacles to news-gathering and reporting, the internet and text-messaging were vital ""unofficial"" methods of access to and dissemination of information about the disease.

Some of the most common HAI's are bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections (UTIs), surgical site infections (SSIs), pneumonia, tuberculosis, Clostridium difficile infections, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections (MRSA), severe acute respiratory syndrome, gastroenteritis, pertussis, and ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP). HAIs impose tremendous direct (e.g. hospitalization, utilities, devices, medications, lab tests, etc.), indirect (e.g. mortality, lost/wages, etc.), and intangible (e.g. anxiety, disability, job loss, pain, etc.) costs [2] . In the United States, HAIs are estimated to result in ""direct annual costs of $35.7 -$45.0 billion for hospitals and healthcare facilities with combined medical costs of $20,549 -$25,903 per infection occurrence"" [2] . Many of the HAIs and related costs can be effectively prevented through proper surveillance and control plans. In most hospitals in Canada, infection control practitioners rely upon routine microbiology test results to flag patients with a possible HAI. Once a patient is flagged, staffs gather the patient's data from multiple sources to determine whether a HAI has occurred [3] . Automating this data gathering and integration is currently very challenging because the data in each of the source systems lack the contextual information necessary for automated integration and reasoning. Standardization and consistent integration of disparate biomedical data, however, would enable automated data integration and reasoning. This capacity could improve the decision-making process by allowing infection control staff to querying over several heterogeneous knowledge sources. In this context, a knowledge-based approach to surveillance of Healthcare-Associated Infections could advance data and knowledge integration, and thereby decrease the incidence of HAIs and facilitate effective resource allocation to improve patient care and enhance overall health systems performance.",13.269194875666837,8.422712040025264

The approach consists of the graphical representation of the standardized level of a smoothed indicator computed using the Hodrick and Prescott (1997) filter (in order to eliminate short-term fluctuations) on its month-on-month changes. The standardized levels of tourism on the y-axis are plotted against their month-on-month changes on the x-axis. This approach provides an attractive visual tool for the inspection of tourism series through circular movements across the four quadrants of the graphs, corresponding to the four growth cycle phases. These phases can be characterized in a counter-clockwise rotation as follows: above average and increasing (upper-right quadrant, corresponding to ""Expansion""), above average but decreasing after having reached the peak (upper-left quadrant, corresponding to ""Downswing""), below average and decreasing (lower-left quadrant, corresponding to ""Recession"") and below average but increasing after having passed the trough (lower-right quadrant, corresponding to ""Upswing""). The peaks occur in the upper center of the graph, in the transition from ""Expansion"" to ""Downswing"", while the troughs are located in the lower center, in the transition from ""Recession"" to ""Upswing"". Therefore, the resulting diagrams can be divided into four quadrants allowing, in this way, for the association of the temporal evolution of the smoothed variables to the different phases of the tourism cycle: the first quadrant corresponds to the expansion phase and is observed when the standardized series are above their means and increasing; the second quadrant indicates that the cycle entered in downswing, i.e., when the standardized series are above their means but decreasing; the third quadrant indicates recession since it corresponds to the case where the standardized series are below their means and decreasing; and finally, the fourth quadrant indicates that the cycle entered into an upswing as the standardized series are below their mean but increasing. This classification follows the conventional notion of the business cycle and offers a simple and clear method to characterize the development of economic indicators throughout the cycle and may also be used as a monitoring tool for destination management when applied to the number of overnight stays.",10.27364749479509,8.004717629838744

The key focus a researcher must have under consideration is how an internet system can be managed and function as a replacement system, a supplementary system, a support system, or an extension to traditional monitoring systems. Peek, Holmes, and Sun (2014) research is about the effective management of big data, collected through both traditional and internet surveillance systems. The scientists of this research believe that data for health and biomedicine have become so big and complex that the traditional methods and tools for managing them are not efficient any more. They call this development a big data revolution. They examine and discover the technical aspects of big data and the infrastructure needed for the management of them, to provide useful information. They also review analytical information about health and biomedicine regarding selection of cases and control, bias and confounding in observational data and techniques for mining health dimensional data. These data come from medical records, administrative data, web search logs, and social media. It is widely recognized that internet and electronic health data are quickly growing as technology advances. Capturing health data from various sources needs a change in the technical and management techniques regarding, such as the infrastructure, the file systems as well as the multidimensional data processing. To catch data from the internet, this can be done either with real-time techniques and nonreal-time techniques. Nevertheless, if we need early prediction of epidemics, we must support real-time data gathering and new technologies must be introduced to do so, such as Apache Spark and Storm. examined various studies about the usability of data from the social media. Many authors claim that social media programs should primarily be used to support existing surveillance programs. The researchers of this study concluded that the use of search queries and social media for disease surveillance are relatively recent phenomena and there is also an evolution of the tools and the methodology to exploit them. Although these surveillance systems, based on internet data, have a support function to the traditional ones, they require a high level of familiarity about capturing social behavior through social media. The data from social media, such as Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook, are abundant, but the quality of health information among users in these media is highly variable and this may raise some concerns (Schein, Wilson, & Kealan, 2011 ) that social media users are exposed to unopposed viewpoints that counter core public health recommendations. We believe that this is logical but partly true as people interact with each other through social media about health issues, but it is hard to imagine that an individual could ignore the official treatment and medication or precaution measures for severe health issues just based on what people say in the social media. On the other hand, a person could be further alerted using social media.",13.91307924098074,8.4599669264476

This task is supported by the intellectual input from specialized groups, the ICTV Study Groups. Study Groups serve as advisory committees and connect the ICTV taxonomists with laboratory virologists, who investigate viruses scientifically. ICTV Study Groups and other expert groups, but not the ICTV itself, propose unique virus names and abbreviations. Fauquet et al. discussed in 2008 that ''[i]t is de facto accepted by the virologists that there is no homogeneity in the demarcation criteria, nomenclature and classification below the species level, and each specialty group is establishing an appropriate system for its respective family'' [9] . Unfortunately, most ICTV Study Groups or other expert groups have not provided clear guidelines in the past, accepting strain and genetic variant names as they were suggested by different researchers in their publications rather than creating consistent nomenclature schemes that apply at least to all viruses of one family. The status quo is, therefore, that variants of particular viruses are often named according to different standards. For instance, one may be assigned a number only, whereas another may be referred to by a name, whereas yet another one may have been designated with the year of isolation. Such variety is not necessarily cause for grave concern when the number of virus variants is very limited and experts in the field are aware of them. However, their number, and in particular the number of sequences deposited in databases, has increased considerably in recent years. It is therefore becoming difficult for researchers to be aware of them, and in particular, to know their specific characteristics. Decreasing sequencing costs and ongoing improvements in sequencing technology have led to increased submission of genomic consensus sequences of viruses to databases without associated peerreviewed descriptive publications and without fulfilling (yet undefined) minimum standards for sequencing and metadata. In practice, this means that crucial information about these sequences and the associated viruses is lost when, for instance, the date of isolation or the location of isolation, i.e., the ''biological context'' in the form of metadata, are not deposited along with the sequences. In a recent report from a National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) workshop on virus genome annotation, the authors of the report concluded that ''‚Ä¶only when information‚Ä¶[is] included does a viral genome sequence become something more: a sample isolated in evolutionary time and environmental context, which can be compared to others, allowing inferences between sequence, host, chronology, and geography'' [3] . The amount of genomic information for members of the family Filoviridae is unlikely to become overwhelming in the short term. However, their importance in regard to biodefense measures, and recent calls for genetic filovirus variant standardization to expedite countermeasure development [18] , make them suitable candidates for name standardization trends started by influenzavirus, coronavirus, and rotavirus experts. Here, we propose guidelines for the establishment of a standardized nomenclature for natural genetic variants of filoviruses, and how to build designations for them from metadata in GenBank records and publications.",15.57973854635565,11.317080842584797

It is generally accepted within the influenzavirus research community and has the advantage that the isolate designation is mostly self-explanatory, allowing non-influenzavirus specialists to comprehend it quickly.

The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses Filoviridae Study Group and other experts have recently established an almost consistent classification and nomenclature for filoviruses. Here, further guidelines are suggested to include their natural genetic variants. First, this term is defined. Second, a template for full-length virus names (such as ''Ebola virus H.sapiens-tc/COD/1995/Kikwit-9510621'') is proposed. These names contain information on the identity of the virus (e.g., Ebola virus), isolation host (e.g., members of the species Homo sapiens), sampling location (e.g., Democratic Republic of the Congo (COD)), sampling year, genetic variant (e.g., Kikwit), and isolate (e.g., 9510621). Suffixes are proposed for individual names that clarify whether a given genetic variant has been characterized based on passage zero material (-wt), has been passaged in tissue/cell culture (-tc), is known from consensus sequence fragments only (-frag), or does (most likely) not exist anymore (-hist). We suggest that these comprehensive names are to be used specifically in the methods section of publications. Suitable abbreviations, also proposed here, could then be used throughout the text, while the full names could be used again in phylograms, tables, or figures if the contained information aids the interpretation of presented data. The proposed system is very similar to the well-known influenzavirus nomenclature and the nomenclature recently proposed for rotaviruses. If applied consistently, it would considerably simplify retrieval of sequence data from electronic databases and be a first important step toward a viral genome annotation standard as sought by the National Center for",14.279276423655325,7.943994737218649

Bombarda et al. [42] investigated the Zn 2+ binding and acid-base properties of four single-point mutants of a short peptide corresponding to the distal finger motif of NCp7. In each mutant, one Zn 2+ -coordinating residue is substituted with a noncoordinating one. Using the spectroscopic properties of Co 2+ , it was establish that the four mutants retain their ability to bind a metal cation. The mutations do not affect the acid-base properties of the Zn 2+ -coordinating residues. The apparent Zn 2+ binding constants of the four mutants are strongly reduced compared to those of the native peptide but are similar to those of various host Zn 2+ binding proteins. As a consequence, the loss of viral infectivity following the mutation of one Zn 2+ -coordinating residue in vivo may not be related to the total loss of Zn 2+ binding. The pH dependence of Zn 2+ binding indicates that the coordinating residues bind Zn 2+ stepwise and that the free energy provided by the binding of a given residue may be modulated by the entropic contribution of the residues already bound to Zn 2+ [42] . This implies that Cys49 may act as a switch for Zn 2+ dissociation in the distal finger motif of NCp7, a feature that may contribute to the high susceptibility of Cys49 to electrophilic attack.",13.350319836261093,7.555123248500404

Several religious mass gatherings occur on a yearly basis in Iraq, drawing millions of pilgrims from across the country. The Arbaeen is one of the largest, during which pilgrims from Iraqi provinces visit the holy shrine in Karbala, and poses major public health challenges. 114 In West Africa, each year up to 5 million Muslim pilgrims from the Mouride community in Senegal, and from neighbouring countries, assemble in the holy city of Touba in Senegal for the Grand Magal religious pilgrimage, 115 the largest religious mass gathering in West Africa. This pilgrimage attracts individuals from outside Africa and has the potential for globalisation of local endemic infectious diseases. 115 Research on communicable diseases and non communicable diseases, including heatrelated disorders and disasters, with a more collaborative approach between local and international researchers and organisers of mass gathering events is required. The creation of the Africa Centres for Diseases Control (Africa CDC) on Jan 31, 2017, in Addis Ababa by the African Union, with five regional CDCs in Gabon, Egypt, Nigeria, Kenya, and Zambia, 116 creates major opportunities for improving coordination and public health capacitybuilding initiatives in partner ship with organisers of sporting and religious mass gathering events. For example, the majority of the live stock for ritual sacrifices during the Hajj are exported from Africa to the Middle East-the One Human EnvironmentalAnimal Health approach 101, 117, 118 should be adopted in partnership with Africa CDC. This initiative should aim to define the risk and threats to global health security and help reduce the risk of outbreaks and spread of zoonotic infections, such as Rift Valley fever, MERS CoV, Ebola, and other viral haemorrhagic fevers, across Mass gathering events provide unique opportunities for crosscontinental multidisciplinary collaborations on public health and basic science research, which will allow for the development of a strong evidence base for public health planning and health services at mass gatherings (panel 5). Although the formalisation of mass gatherings medicine has led to an increase in research studies into the specific health issues affecting pilgrims at the Hajj, they have not been forthcoming for the Kumbh Mela and other mass gatherings. Research output from mass gathering events is focused on small studies of pilgrims from individual countries and the data are not generalisable and no outputs have changed global policy. A need remains for more coordinated action by a global coalition of interested partners to share experiences from various mass gathering events, gather and translate appropriate evidence base into public health policy, and push for the best health promotion and educational policies. The creation of a mass gathering medicine specialist society or formal network, with a dedicated journal, might generate more frequent dialogue and enhance international collaborations on mass gathering medicine. A need also remains for high quality studies that are appropriately designed and adequately powered using participants from several geographical regions to provide data that stand up to rigorous scientific review. Advances in technology and closer monitoring of pilgrims at the Hajj provide an opportunity for large cohort studies of attendees of mass gathering events. These studies could focus on infectious diseases priorities, inc luding neglected tropical diseases, 119 noncom municable diseases, mental health, and heatrelated disorders (panels 4 and 5). The widespread availability of next generation sequencing, genotyping and phenotyping, and other molecular methods also provides an opportunity for analyses of health risks among large population cohorts and for appropriate research to obtain an evidence base for the production of WHOapproved guidelines, which will be useful for countries that host mass gathering events.",13.746403284327808,10.070820939153252

In general, a grading scheme of slight, moderate, and severe/marked is most common. When using this grading scheme for the transparent media (cornea, aqueous, lens, and vitreous) a grading of slight would imply a lesion that does not obstruct visualization of the deeper tissues past the lesion, a moderate grade implies a lesion that interferes with but does not fully obstruct the view of the tissues deep to the lesion, and a severe/marked lesion fully obstructs the view of structures deep to the lesion (Table 1 ). This is analogous to the terms incipient, immature, and mature when applied to a cataract. Lesions may also be characterized with respect to the area of involvement with the terms most commonly used being focal, multifocal, and diffuse.

This might have implications for future research. Along this line, centers should agree on a standardized cytokine detection method as comparability between methods is low [48] . ELISA has been a reliable method at our center. However, it is costly and requires strict adherence to time protocols. FACS or Luminex¬Æ assays may be alternatives for selected cytokines, yet these methods have yielded less reliable results in our laboratory. Also, numerous potential confounders related to medication (dosage of immunosuppression, anti-infective prophylaxis and treatment, additional individual medication) and immunological analysis make interpretation of cytokine data in LTRs challenging.

Molecular and experimental evidence suggests that humans and cattle are hosts for 14 and 13 of these species, respectively, although there will likely be increases in these numbers in the future (the number of new species identified is growing at about 1 per year). However, not all of these potentially infective species are frequent parasites of clinical importance in either host species. In cattle, the majority of infections are associated with C. parvum, C. bovis, and C. andersoni. Zoonotic transmission from cattle to people is most commonly caused by C. parvum, and neither C. bovis nor C. andersoni are considered as major a human health risk as C. parvum.

The risk of infectious disease transmission during a mass gathering is the same or even more as the risk of transmission that prevails in any one of the home or host countries of mass gathering participants. During the world health Assembly 67, a side event took place to launch the lancet series on Mass Gathering Medicine in May 21, 2014 ( Figure 1 ). Mass-gatherings are held for various purposes including religious rituals, sports activities, or festivals and therefore the demographics, risks, and the intensity of activities vary. Further, the risks are exacerbated during mass gatherings such as the Hajj for airborne, droplet, and body fluid-related transmission due to the absence of social distancing among participants; increased susceptibility due to stress, lack of sleep, and changing nutritional factors during peak events; disruption of medications among persons with chronic debilitating diseases; and participation in some of the rituals such as animal sacrifices or the practice of scalp hair shaving practices by self-help groups using unsterile blades rather than in regulated barber shops. Given that two-thirds of the emerging diseases are zoonotic, human-animal interaction during some mass gatherings such as the Hajj further increases the risk, and Saudi Arabia imports sacrifice animals from 6 countries. Thus, except for vaccine preventable diseases, perfection of disease control strategies in one or few countries alone including in the host country may not offer blanket protection from all types of disease transmission dynamics for epidemic prone disease agents present in any one of the countries. The impact of these challenges on public health during mass gatherings can be minimized by two strategies. First, each of the countries that participate in a mass gathering should have alert systems in place to identify diseases of transmission-potential during a mass gathering, control measures in place to avoid the exportation of such risks, and reduce the participation of individuals at risk increased risk for disease acquisition. For GHSA 1 , this relates to adequate syndromic-and agent-based surveillance, laboratory enhancements, and reporting systems and risk communication managed by adequately trained workforce including one epidemiologist for a population of 200,000. Furthermore, countries participating in mass gatherings should have public emergency preparedness in response mode and adequate surge capacity to be able to respond to potential emergencies from participants returning from mass gatherings. Existence of a public health emergency operations center with sufficient pool of response manpower and medical countermeasures available will be critical. This can only be functional if relevant a national public health preparedness policies and authorities are in place to coordinate a response with diverse organizational entities such as the ministries of aviation, defense, interior, and health.",11.913873337666406,9.277891053791915

An exploratory factor analysis (principal components extraction) indicated that all items loaded on 1 factor (Cronbach's alpha ¬º 0.78) for a scale labeled ''Perceived personal consequences.'' The items were reverse coded in order to make higher values on the scale reflect increasing personal consequences. Because of differing numbers of answer categories, the responses were standardized to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, and then a mean standardized score was calculated for all 5 items for each individual. Because the questions were highly intercorrelated, to maximize the number of cases included in the analysis, we imputed the mean of the remaining items as the response to questions with missing data (1.7% or less missing on all questions). This was done only for respondents with 1 missing answer. The standardized scale ranged from √Ä1.321 to 2.609, with a mean of 0.009 (SE ¬º 0.024). While the standardized scale values are less intuitive for interpretation than the original scaling, the scale can be interpreted in the same way with higher values on the scale indicating greater perceived personal consequences.",12.987132230941981,8.335132451693799

Methods: Investigators evaluated ill travelers returning from a mass gathering, and presenting to a GeoSentinel site between August 2015 and April 2019, and collected data on the nature of the event and the relation between final diagnoses and the mass gathering. Results: Of 296 ill travelers, 51% were female and the median age was 54 years (range: 1-88). Over 82% returned from a religious mass gathering, most frequently Umrah or Hajj. Only 3% returned from the Olympics in Brazil or South Korea. Other mass gatherings included other sporting events, cultural or entertainment events, and conferences. Respiratory diseases accounted for almost 80% of all diagnoses, with vaccine preventable illnesses such as influenza and pneumonia accounting for 26% and 20% of all diagnoses respectively. This was followed by gastrointestinal illnesses, accounting for 4.5%. Sixty-three percent of travelers reported having a pre-travel encounter with a healthcare provider.

In these structures, L1 spans S2 and crosses the deep groove of the helix, whereas L3 spans S1 and crosses the shallow groove (FIG. 2) . The geometry of the pseudoknot is such that when S2 is six or seven base pairs in length, L1 can be as short as a single nucleotide 3, 21 . However, in some pseudoknots, the loops are much longer and include their own secondary structure elements. Pseudoknots are also formed upon base-pairing of single-stranded bulge (B), interior (I) and multibranched (M) loops with complementary regions elsewhere in the RNA (which themselves can be constrained in a secondary structure, for example in intramolecular hairpin-loop-hairpin-loop (H-H or so-called kissing loop) interactions) 22 . However, unless all of the loop nucleotides are paired, these pseudoknots are generally considered as H-type pseudoknots, as the additional base-pairing interaction is viewed as a substructure within the loop. For this reason, the B, I and M nomenclature (as well as H-H) is not extensively used, and most structures are referred to as H-type pseudoknots and often simply as pseudoknots. An additional issue regarding nomenclature is loop numbering. In the early pseudoknot literature, most examples did not possess unpaired residues between the two stems, so the convention was to name the groove-spanning loops L1 and L2 (now L1 and L3).

This is a paradigmatic case to consider for security concerns about ongoing research and the availability of ""big data"" in the life sciences, particularly in the fields of synthetic genomics and synthetic biology. After the open scientific publication of this poliovirus experiment in the journal Science, the U.S. policy community raised concerns about whether terrorists might pick up the experimental methods used in this paper to re-create poliovirus, or other more deadly viruses. Using standard data gathering and analytic methods, it would appear that this synthesis experiment would be replicated by anyone with access to relevant materials and equipment, which are commercially available. However, closer ethnographic study of this case revealed important laboratory know-how that constituted the success of this synthesis experiment. Without this know-how, one would be unable to synthesize poliovirus using the experimental protocol regardless of how many pieces of DNA one might buy, what equipment one has, who one might buy these materials from, or the step-by-step procedure. What I have learned about this experiment is that in spite of a wealth of explicit information and readily available materials out in the public domain, critical portions of making this experiment work remain craft-like techniques that involve quite a bit of specialized, localized knowhow that is difficult to transfer to other laboratories or contexts. This is not to suggest that all synthetic genomics experiments will be this difficult to be used for harm. But, this analysis did reveal that there is a spectrum of skill difficulty involved in different kinds of biological work that needs to be considered in conducting threat assessments. The poliovirus case study illustrates the need to examine, at a detailed micro-level, the social context and relationships that comprise scientific and technological work and the complex practices and timescales that contextualize the replication and transfer of these techniques, even in cases when the science or technology in question seems at first approximation to be readily standardized, accessible, and transferable. As sociologists of science Nigel Gilbert and Michael Mulkay have long noted, the public and private accounts of science are very different; only the private discourse reflects the varied, contingent, and messy character that constitutes the social character of scientific work [26] . As a result, scientific publications, presentations, and other formal means of codified scientific knowledge that are readily accessible through many ""big data"" approaches do not tell the whole story. Therefore, caution should be used in applying ""big data"" analytics to published scientific experiments as these analytics may not capture important details crucial to accurate threat assessment.",12.818875345612382,8.483986174621865

Hajj rituals are concluded within 5 days but the hajj journey for overseas pilgrims spans over four to 6 weeks.

Standing and praying in the designated area of Arafat valley during the daylight is the main ritual of Hajj. Official account of the past gatherings in Arafat ranges from two to just under four million people. There have always been thousands of unauthorised pilgrims in the past events. All pilgrims must leave the valley at the sunset and travel to a mountainous place known as Muzdalifah, located between Arafat and Mina. To and fro Arafat journey of all must be completed on the same day. Next day all of these pilgrims must return to Mina and then walk to Jamarat Bridge for first stoning ritual.

Indeed, reporting science involves a constant struggle between the theoretical frameworks of the scientist and the historian, as both are theory-laden. Given the influence exerted by editors and even the scientific community, scientists face a conflict with respect to using passive or active voice while reporting their findings.

As primary care givers with a coordinating function, general practitioners (GP) play a key role in dealing with epidemics and pandemics. As of yet, there are no studies in Germany describing the difficulties experienced by GPs in patient care during epidemics/pandemics. Objectives. This study aimed at identifying the problem areas in GPs' patient care during the H1N1 and EHEC (enterohemorrhagic strain of Escherichia coli) outbreaks. With this information, recommendations for guaranteeing proper patient care during future epidemics/pandemics can be derived. Materials and methods.

The primary goal of precision public health is the accuracy involved in gathering data including emerging pathogens, reactions based on susceptibility and geographical distribution of the diseases. It makes use of real-time data generated, among other computational methods, to gather quick observable data. Traditional methods of forecasting influenza trends by CDC usually lag behind real time by 1-2 weeks, whereas information contained in cloud-based electronic health records and search queries in the Internet are typically available near real time. Yang et al. (2017) combine these cloud-based records and Internet searches with historical flu data and use dynamically selected set of variables to give the best fit in their model for the 2013-2016 flu season. Their results correctly estimated the peak timing and magnitude of the studies of flu season. These kinds of predictive models of influenza activity help public health officials prepare and allocate resources for possible disease outbreaks. However, as with any individual's information, the use of public data calls for discretion: consent, privacy and security must be upheld and protected. Furthermore, an application that has come into prominence is the use of millions of data available from the social media platforms on the World Wide Web. However, the risk of inaccuracy in predictive analysis based on such data is high. A wide margin of error is required to compensate for over-or underestimation. Google Flu Trends, which is the recent surveillance tracking arm of the search engine giant, came into the spotlight for over-calculating the doctor visits for influenza-like illness than the reports generated by CDC which relies on records procured from laboratories (Lazer et al. 2014) . The idea was to correlate search criteria with flu incidence and establish a trend. The initial trials matched 50 million searches with 1152 data points (Ginsberg et al. 2009 ) and came out with erroneous results due to certain ad hoc procedures. Even after corrections to the programmes, GFT persistently overestimated flu prevalence and has been relegated to the background for now in favour of more traditional procedures as adopted, for example, by CDC. Ideally, perhaps a combination of the two approaches could auger for better predictive trend analyses.",11.084223981216766,7.963596688141749

Table I shows the differences in cost, practicalities and achievable resolutions of conventional typing techniques and WGS. A unified typing scheme linked to a freely accessible universal database would be ideal. WGS resolves differences between isolates down to the level of individual nucleotides. Because of poor resolution, conventional methods generate inconclusive results. For example, when two isolates are indistinguishable it does not mean that they are identical. WGS makes it possible to determine when sequences really are identical, and, if not, to state exactly by how much they differ.

This is an emerging, politically driven issue as market forces become more competitive and demanding with respect to demonstrating pigs are Trichinellafree. For example, in the UK there is a perceived need for data gathering and assessment of Trichinella in UK wildlife even though it has rarely been detected in the past (Zimmer et al., 2009 ). However, although there is increasing awareness that wildlife, particularly rats, can serve as reservoirs of infection for pig producers, particularly in free-ranging situations, surveillance capability is limited by the lack of diagnostic sensitivity of current meat inspection procedures (Newell et al., 2010; van der Giessen et al., 2013) . Pig farms need to show negligible risk of their animals becoming infected from wildlife. Similarly in Australia, the main concern regarding Trichinella is the ability of wildlife to become reservoirs and thus synanthropes and adaptors to be sources of infection for domestic animals and humans (AWHN, 2011) yet few surveys have been undertaken. Wildlife surveys are considered essential to truly determine the presence or absence of Trichinella but surveys in high-risk regions of incursion are largely lacking on the mainland of Australia (Cuttell et al., 2012) . However, a recent research survey led to the first report of Trichinella papuae in a wild pig from an Australian island in the Torres Strait (Cuttell et al., 2012) , a parasite not only infective to other mammals, including humans, but also to crocodiles (Pozio et al., 2009) .",12.624949099043187,6.289899361627015

Clearly, the development of tools to assimilate and interpret data is just as critical as the data itself to the knowledge discovery process in this new, data-rich ear. 1 The advantage of mathematical modeling of disease lies in the fact that such models not only shed insight as to how a complex process works, which could be very difficult to infer an understanding of each component of this process, but also predict what may follow as time evolves or as the characteristics of particular system components are modified. This approach is particularly helpful where these predictions are not already obvious to clinical or biological researchers, or where particular outcomes are expected, but the mechanisms leading to these outcomes cannot be directly intuited. According to how much a priori information of the system to be modeled is available, mathematical models are classified into black box (data-driven or data-supported) and white box (knowledge-driven) models.

In fact, the model-guided fieldwork paradigm [27] suggests that mathematical models can be incorporated into all phases of field research to improve our understanding of infectious disease ecology and complex biological systems. The iterative testing of hypotheses through empirical research and mathematical modeling while concurrently informing study design and model evaluation is a powerful approach for the study and control of disease (Fig. 14.3) . The need for sequential data-gathering efforts and analysis and the consequent increased collaboration among experimentalists, policy-makers, and modelers are surmountable barriers to the integration of modeling evidence and public health policy. This iterative feedback approach has been increasingly advocated by researchers [12, 18] and has been demonstrated with applications in the evaluation of the rapid diagnostic test Xpert for tuberculosis [28] . An early modeling Rather than extracting single-point estimates, modelers can make full use of data by (B) constructing data-driven distributions of possible values for parameters and then sampling values from those distributions during iterative model runs. Iterations of the model are executed drawing probabilistically from distributions of data to generate (C) probabilistic distributions of predictions. Examples of the types of predictions that can be generated include estimates of disease burden and cost of intervention to inform policy decisions. Policy questions, such as whether to recommend a new vaccine, determine (D) specific variables to evaluate (e.g., cost-effectiveness). In a probabilistic framework, decision-makers are conveyed not only appropriate estimates of outcomes but also a sense of how much confidence they can have in those estimates. Settings for (E) variables that are under the presumed control of policy-makers can be pre-defined and can be further informed by initial model findings that lead to updated iterations of the model. Such policy variables could include cost, dosage schedule, and age of administration study suggested that significant reductions in TB morbidity and mortality would be associated with increases in rates of TB diagnosis due to Xpert use and the assumed corresponding increases in treatment seeking. However, clinical trials in TB-endemic areas demonstrated lower-than-expected impact of the new diagnostic since treatment coverage in such areas was already very high [29] . The new data on TB treatment practices resulted in iterative improvements in the model so that it could more accurately evaluate new diagnostic technologies across different endemic settings [28] .",11.161401426395175,9.15568266556674

Over the last 10-15 years, many of these phenotypic approaches have been replaced completely or party by genetic analysis, often done using Sanger sequencing approaches or polymerase chain reactions based on detecting specific SNPs [65] . More recently, full-genome sequence analysis has been used to characterize viral strains [66‚Ä¢] .

The international virus species names end in 'virus', international genus names in Latinized binomials for virus names have been supported by animal and human virologists of the ICTV for many years but have never been implemented. Their recommendation was in fact withdrawn from ICTV nomenclature rules in 1990, and consequently, such names as Herpesvirus varicella or Polyomavirus hominis should not be used. For several years, plant virologists adopted a different nomenclature, using the vernacular name of a virus but replacing the word 'virus' by the genus name: for example, Cucumber mosaic cucumovirus and Tobacco mosaic tobamovirus. This system is called 'the nonlatinized binomial system', although the binomial order is the opposite of the typical latinized binomial system where the genus name ends with the virus name. Though this usage is favored by many scientists, and examples of such a practice can be found for human, animal, and insect viruses (e.g., Human rhinovirus, Canine calicivirus, and Acheta densovirus), it has not yet been adopted as a universal system by the ICTV; however, it has been decided that each study group would decide what is best for the viruses they deal with and the new names would have to be ratified through a formal taxonomic proposal by the ICTV.",12.327790119533542,6.9858055694894805

This is also common in ecological species distribution modelling and has led to the development of different sampling approaches to generate pseudo-absence data that can be used with regression methods requiring both presence and absence data, as well as the development of specific modelling techniques requiring presence-only data such as the ecological niche modelling (ENM) methods including ecological niche factor analysis (ENFA), genetic algorithm for rule-set production (GARP) and maximum entropy (Maxent) (Hirzel et al., 2002; Elith and Leathwick, 2009 ).

However, the assumptions, in particular, of frequentist statistical methods are usually not met for Big Data, and therefore analytical algorithms are required which are statistically robust (i.e. non-parametric) and also are capable of efficiently analysing very large datasets. The developments for epidemiological analyses have, so far, been primarily through the inclusion of machine learning regression amongst the modelling methods, whereas in visualisation and exploration it has been primarily through more effective use of interfaces and flexible software environments. It needs to be emphasised that data analysis plays an important role also in dealing with the five Vs of Big Data (i.e. volume, velocity, variety, veracity and value). The first four attributes refer to areas which are subject to significant research aimed at optimisation of data utilisation. A particularly difficult aspect is the challenge presented by differences in data quality, including the ubiquitous presence and heterogeneity of bias.

Scientific nomenclature of microorganisms is governed by the International Committee on Systematic Bacteriology and published as Approved List of Bacterial Names in the International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology (Tortora et al., 2010) . By accepted taxonomic conventions, the order names end in ales (e.g., the order Eubacteriales), family names end in aceae (e.g., the family Enterobacteriaceae), and the tribe names end in eae (e.g., the tribe Proteae). The order, family, and tribe names begin with capital letters. The genus name also begins with capital letter, but species name (e.g., coli) begins with running letter and not capital letter. Both the genus (e.g., Escherichia) and species names are either italicized or underlined when written in the text. The scientific name of the bacterium when written for the first time is written in full (e.g., Escherichia coli), but later mentioned in an abbreviated form (e.g., E. coli).

'Systems Glycobiology' is an emerging discipline that aims to quantitatively describe and analyse the glycome. Here, instead of developing a detailed understanding of single biochemical processes, a combination of computational and experimental tools are used to seek an integrated or 'systems-level' view. This can explain how multiple biochemical reactions and transport processes interact with each other to control glycome biosynthesis and function. Computational methods in this field commonly build in silico reaction network models to describe experimental data derived from structural studies that measure cellsurface glycan distribution. While considerable progress has been made, several challenges remain due to the complex and heterogeneous nature of this post-translational modification. First, for the in silico models to be standardized and shared among laboratories, it is necessary to integrate glycan structure information and glycosylation-related enzyme definitions into the mathematical models. Second, as glycoinformatics resources grow, it would be attractive to utilize 'Big Data' stored in these repositories for model construction and validation. Third, while the technology for profiling the glycome at the whole-cell level has been standardized, there is a need to integrate mass spectrometry derived site-specific glycosylation data into the models. The current review discusses progress that is being made to resolve the above bottlenecks. The focus is on how computational models can bridge the gap between 'data' generated in wet-laboratory studies with 'knowledge' that can enhance our understanding of the glycome.",12.91802246536631,11.280069078088168

Unlike the experimental methods, MR does not require experimentally determined phases for the unknown structure; instead, it relies on the existence of an MR model, a previously determined structure that either has homology to or is part of the new structure. The MR search simulates the packing of the MR model in the new crystal, and finds the best match to the diffraction data. Afterward, theoretical phases of the new structure can be calculated from the newly placed MR model and combined with the diffraction data of the new structure to calculate electron density maps. Compared with the experimental methods, MR does not require any bench work and hence is quicker and more convenient.

This is largely because of poor sensitivity due to the lack of broadly reactive antibodies that will detect all HuNoV strains. The high degree of genetic diversity for the NoV has historically complicated the development of broadly reactive RT-qPCR methods. Four 'regions' of the NoV genome have been used for primer design (designated regions A, B, C, and D). These regions are generally conserved among HuNoV strains of the same genogroup. The ORF-1-ORF2 junction (just downstream of region B) seems to be the most conserved and is frequently used for genogroup-specific detection. For strain comparison (as might be appropriate in outbreak investigation), primers corresponding to the NoV capsid region (region D) are usually used. Commercial RT-qPCR method detection methods are available for use in the food and environmental sector, but in all cases, substantial sample preparation to concentrate the viruses and remove the sample matrix is required before the application of RT-qPCR for detection.

To be feasible as a tool to inform policy in a setting such as Zambia, the process of hazard identification should first unpack and properly categorize different policy perceptions into risk statements germane to each policy-relevant stakeholder. This essentially entails that a hazard identification be performed in such a way that it 'maps' how the H5N1 'hazard' relates to general avian influenzas, human influenza and pandemic preparedness across sectors. The importance of this is that, as a standalone problem, different levels of priority were accorded to H5N1 in Zambia. 152 It was a high priority in the public health sector and low in the animal health sector, and while other local stakeholders did not know how H5N1 affected them, just the perception of H5N1 risk resulted in real consequences in the poultry industry. 153 A national level risk analysis in a resource-constrained country context would theoretically have a broad audience with divergent conceptions of risk and priorities. The objective in Zambia was to develop a coordinated, multi-sectoral risk management framework. This entails understanding different framings of risk in order to think more adaptively about information gathering for hazard identification. This requires bringing scientific and non-scientific considerations more explicitly in policy processes, thus allowing the appropriate actors participate in the risk analysis process. 154 The process of information gathering may therefore benefit from a stakeholder analysis, beyond international agency considerations, to identify important stakeholders, their viewpoints and information contributions. This is necessary to comprehensively define the hazard and capture information about how the hazard affects, and, more importantly, maybe affected by different policy relevant stakeholders.

This predicted tourist number is then subtracted from the actual number for a certain post-event period and this is usually interpreted as the effect of the crisis. Most forecasting methods have the advantage of controlling long-term trends. Quantitative forecasting methods are mainly divided into two groups. First, time series (TS) methods (basic, intermediate, and advanced) which have many advantages. It is based on the assumption that the present and past behavior of the data will continue in the future, and observations at different points in time are statistically dependent. The ARIMA model is the most popular TS forecasting model. One can fit an ARIMA model to almost any TS data with the desired precision. However, there are some disadvantages for the ARIMA model such as (i) there is no way to know where to start the ARIMA model; (ii) it cannot be used for non-stationary data; (iii) it requires a large number of data points; and (iv) it is a univariate TS forecasting method and cannot be used for a multivariate TS data analysis. The ITSA model is a further development of the ARIMA model and it can measure and test the effects of intervention/s. It uses both the preand post-intervention data, whereas the ARIMA model uses only the pre-intervention data. It provides better forecasts than the ARIMA model for interrupted TS data. The vector auto-regression (VAR) model is one of the most successful, flexible, and easy to use models for the analysis of multivariate TS data and can provide better forecasts than the ARIMA model.

The 16-27 kb genome is enclosed in a triple layered capsid composed of a double protein shell and an inner core. The 11 segments of RNA code for 11 proteins (six structural and fi ve non-structural). Their classifi cation has been traditionally based on the antigenic properties of two structural proteins, VP7 (G-type glycoprotein) and VP4 (P-type protease-sensitive protein), which comprise the shell and spike proteins of the outer capsid, respectively, and are important in virus infectivity and immunogenicity. The proteins have been used to defi ne P and G serotypes of rotaviruses (Estes and Kapikian 2007 ) . However, serotyping is time consuming and immunological reagents are not always readily available. While there is good correlation between G serotypes and VP7 genotypes, P serotype and VP4 genotyping results are not always in agreement (Greenberg and Estes 2009 ) , so classifi cation is now mainly based on sequencing of these genes or a double nomenclature for P types, based on genotype and serotype information (Desselberger 2014 ) . Genotyping by sequencing is based on identities between sequences of cognate gene segments. There are at least 27 G genotypes and 37 P genotypes within the Rotavirus A (RVA) species (Desselberger 2014 ) . Predominant strains circulating globally include six G types (G1-4, G9, and G12) and two P types (P[4] and P [8] (Desselberger 2014 ) .

Furthermore, the RCWG proposed a standardized strain nomenclature system for reporting complete rotavirus genome sequences and for use in epidemiologic studies (RV group/species of origin/country of identifi cation/common name/year of identifi cation/G-and P-type). Since this time, 50 new genotypes have been reported and in several cases, a link between animal and human strains has been revealed (Greenberg and Estes 2009 ).",11.42500843992692,8.01738500830334

Analysis can be completed in hours, rather than days, for detection of typical pathogens and weeks for detection of atypical pathogens. This approach eliminates concerns about decreased organism viability associated with transport of specimens and the effects of previous antibiotic therapy. Real-time PCR panels that include the common causative pathogens of CAP could substantially increase the diagnostic yield in clinical practice. Unfortunately, these assays are not standardized or widely available, and, except for L. pneumophila and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (table 2) , no FDA-cleared nucleic acid-amplification assays for bacterial respiratory pathogens are available. One major limitation to the molecular diagnostic approach to detection of bacterial causes of pneumonia is that culture would still be required to obtain an isolate for antimicrobial-susceptibility testing.

These methods have proven very successful for many types of microorganisms and are standardized for most of the known human and domesticated animal pathogens. However, one important limitation is that only a small fraction of the estimated number of microbial species have been described, and so are applicable to relatively a few species. Many microorganisms are very difficult to culture or may not grow at all and therefore they cannot be identified using traditional techniques. As many as 99% of all microbial species are estimated to fall into this category.

Immunoblot relies on separation of proteins in the gel by mass and/or charge, transfer to membrane and detection with antibodies. ELISA usually utilizes multi-well plates with immobilized antibodies to capture proteins, which are then detected directly (if labeled) or indirectly with another set of antibodies. Detection in both methods often involves signal enhancement; chemiluminescence or fluorescence are commonly used. For both these assays, the required quantities of sample per assay point are typically small and can be derived from a modest number of cells (10 4 -10 5 cells), but detection of low-abundance analytes is hard and multiplexing is limited.

First, nothing succeeds like success and as various groups produce models and simulations that make useful predictions about biology and these predictions are validated by experiment, others will seek to adopt such approaches in their own work. Second, the dissemination of improved tools for constructing complex models, conducting simulations, and sharing the results, together with greater access to ever cheaper mass computing power, will empower the community to work together in building and utilizing better and bigger models. Finally, the changes already in progress in the way students are educated, with the inclusion of more statistics, mathematics, and computer programming at various stages of secondary, college, and post-graduate education, will make it easier for new investigators to incorporate these methods into their research activities, just as the familiarity of newly minted MDs and PhDs with 'omic' technologies has led over the past decade to the facile inclusion of such methods into their projects. We therefore close on an optimistic note, suggesting that within a generation, modeling and simulation will have become a mainstream component of biological research, comfortable for many if not most investigators. This will result in the movement from cartoon representations of biological systems to instantiated quantitative models shared by the field and capable of high quality predictive analysis of how small and large scale aspects of the immune system will behave when perturbed experimentally, by genetic variation, or by medical intervention.

Oligonucleotide arrays have progressed from features with a 3‚Ä≤ bias that were unable to discriminate splice variants to currently available exon-tiling arrays that cover the entire transcript of each gene and provide significant insight to the specific splice variants expressed (111; 112) . Moreover, with the explosion of available whole genome sequences, it has become commonplace to generate arrays specific for multiple organisms, including pathogens (113) , which permits the simultaneous tracking of expression changes in both host and pathogen during an infection. Microarray technology has made a huge contribution to our understanding of the dynamic transcriptome in normal and disease states, and in clinical applications such as cancer cell profiling and disease prognosis, it has shown remarkable predictive capacity. Its ability to identify 'signatures' in samples from patients with acute myeloid and lymphocytic leukemia that correlated with disease outcome was one of the first demonstrations of the power of non-biased large-scale data gathering approaches to provide insight that would have been almost impossible to obtain from more reductionist methods (114) . These initial successes were followed with the clear demonstration that expression profiles could guide therapy, through correlation of signatures with clinical outcomes in many tumors, both solid and hematological (115; 116). The immune system has proven to be particularly accessible in this regard, through analysis of signatures from whole blood, PBMCs, or from specific hematopoietic cell populations. The obvious value of high quality transcript data repositories to biological research has led to numerous efforts to generate comprehensive databases of mRNA expression maps in most experimental model systems. Following characterization of transcriptional responses to pathogens in innate immune cells (117) (118) (119) (120) , analysis of the blood transcriptome of patients has produced comprehensive catalogs of gene changes characteristic of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders (121) (122) (123) (124) (125) (126) and specific responses to viruses (127) (128) (129) (130) , bacteria (131) (132) (133) , and parasites (118; 134) .

There are an estimated 30,000 protozoan species on earth and many of them live as symbionts or parasites. Most protozoa are motile since they carry moving organelles such as flagella or cilia. Alternatively, they are capable of moving by the for-mation of pseudopodia. According to their way of movement protozoa can be subclassified into Sporozoa (no active movement), Ciliata, (cilia as moving organelles), Flagellata (flagella as moving organelles) and Rhizipoda (formation of pseudopodia). When we searched the NCBI database for LOX-like sequences we did not get any hits for Sporozoa. For Ciliata we extracted two candidate sequences for Oxytricha (EJY76823, EJY73499). Next, we screened these sequences for additional structural parameters to increase the probability that they encode for functional LOX isoforms. For this purpose we employed a three step filtering strategy: (i) we excluded all sequences, which encode for proteins consisting of <300 amino acids. Since the two sequences encoded for 813 and 825 amino acid proteins this filtering step did not exclude either of the proteins. (ii) We searched the two sequences for the presence of the iron coordinating amino acids and excluded those sequences lacking one or both iron ligand clusters. Most functional LOX carry two iron ligand clusters [C1, His-w-x-y-z-His; C2, His-xy-z-Asn (His, Ser, Thr)] and each cluster contains two coordinating amino acids (bold face) for the catalytic nonheme iron. In the two Oxytricha sequences both iron coordinating clusters (C1, C2) were found, which did not eliminate either sequence. (iii) For most well-characterized LOX isoforms the distance of the two iron clusters varies between 180and 200 amino acids. Longer and shorter distances decrease the probability that the corresponding sequences encode functional LOX isoforms. For the two Oxytricha sequences a distance of 200 amino acids was calculated. Summarizing these data one may conclude that these two sequences might encode for functional LOXs. Searching the Flagellata database we obtained two putative LOX sequences but both of them were excluded from further consideration because of their small size (142 and 100 amino acids). Thus, there is probably no real LOX in Flagellata. In the Rhizopoda database we found a promising sequence (ETO32332, Foraminifera) encoding for a 393 amino acid protein. In this sequence we detected the two iron coordinating clusters C1 and C2 but they were only 95 amino acids apart. This small distance and the low molecular weight suggested that there are no real LOXs in Rhizopoda.",11.16519953529539,7.107266551277794

However, the choice of surrogate and its preparation, treatment time, inoculation methods and time allowed for inoculum to attach to product and differences in analytical methods could have significant impact on observed reduction data . Hence, a standardized or harmonized method for evaluating decontamination strategies for foods would be very useful (Table 13 ). In the absence of a large scale and widely available cultivable human NoV assay, evaluation and validation of antivirals and processes are commonly performed using a cultivable surrogate. It is yet unclear if inactivation data obtained through the use of surrogates are representative for human NoV. Additionally, variations in surrogate inactivation levels have been documented. Even if inactivation of a surrogate and a human NoV strain is correlated, the resistance of other human NoV strains is unknown. A surrogate for HEV is also needed, as validation is currently not possible and inactivation is difficult to assess due to the need of an animal model (swine bioassay). However, using newly established cell culture methods, comparisons with surrogates should be possible (Ettayebi et al., 2016; Johne et al., 2016) . Similarly, identified surrogates need to be cultured to high titers for industry pilot-scale trials in order to establish process validity along with simple rapid methods for reliable detection and quantitation.

It can be said that the results of a wear or friction test cannot be truly understood without an understanding of the test method itself. The final example concerns the development of ASTM D5000 [21] a widely-used standard in which the diameter of a wear scar produced by a ball sliding on a rotating cylinder is used to evaluate the relative lubricity of aviation fuels. Introduced in the 1960s, the geometry and purpose of the ball-on-cylinder lubricity evaluator gives the test its acronym: BOCLE. One important concern is whether scar size measurements are sufficiently precise (sensitive) and repeatable to be capable of distinguishing the subtle effects of various fuel additives or external contaminants. A 2014 report by the non-profit Coordinating Research Council Ltd. (USA) [22] describes the BOCLE test and twelve methods that have been used to assess lubricity and a tendency for scuffing in fuel system components. Among the extensive results, there was a set of data from a survey of BOCLE test results from samples taken in four regions of the world. Results from this study led Rolls-Royce Ltd. to support following a British Defense Standard to establish testing norms for the lubricity of aviation fuels.",10.146500282026665,6.972693276790845

For instance, for the detection and quantification of HCV, we have the International Unit (with an assumption -where are the published data -that it is similar for all genotypes), copies, genome equivalents or SuperQuant copies. One would suggest that by implementing an international standard, using a consensus nomenclature, life in diagnostic clinical virology would become much more clear. It is particularly irritating that the conversion factor from international unit to copy or genome equivalent varies somewhere between 2.4 and 5.2 (determined for genotype 1). It is also intriguing that the implementation of an international unit and its use is accepted for HCV, while for the description of quantitative results in the field of HIV-1 diagnostics, this is absolutely not the case. Data presented by quality control in molecular diagnostics (QCMD) which provides external quality control programmes, indicate that in these QC schemes, 88% of the participants in 2002 have presented their results of HCV-quantification in IU, while for HIV-1 this was done by none of the participants. Why is this not surprising to us? Simply because there is in general a limited acceptance of these standards, and it seems to depend on the viral target involved. This remains true even with the current focus on implementation of CE marked assays, for which it is clearly stated in the guidelines and the IVD directive that values should be related to an international standard. Indeed, this should even be an ""accepted standard"".

One must understand the special requirements for tissue sampling, trimming, fixation, and histologic processing for eye specimens in general, and for the eyes of different species in particular, in order to obtain histologic sections of suitable quality. From the biologic and anatomic perspectives, one needs to be aware of the differences in ocular anatomy among species in order to differentiate toxicant-induced changes from normal anatomical variations. Because of the accessibility of the intraocular structures to clinical examination and detection of lesions in vivo, the accurate identification and diagnosis of microscopic findings requires an awareness and understanding of clinical ocular findings. On the same note, there is an almost complete overlap between the terminology in clinical ophthalmology and ocular pathology, so familiarization with clinical and diagnostic terms is essential for accurate communication. Once identified, ocular findings need to be proper classified as treatment-related, spontaneous, or iatrogenic. A multinational effort involving the Society of Toxicologic Pathology (STP), British Society of Toxicological Pathology (BSTP), European Society of Toxicologic Pathology (ESTP), the Japanese Society of Toxicologic Pathology (JSTP), and the Registry of Industrial Toxicology Animal data (RITA) in Europe is developing standardized nomenclature for classifying microscopic lesions observed in laboratory rats and mice in toxicity and carcinogenicity studies.

In each case, œµ is varied from 0 (corresponding to no seasonality) to 0.4 (corresponding to minimums and maximums in the contact rate that are 40% lower and higher than the average value). We find that if the mass gathering occurs when the contact rate is maximized (red curve), then 0 increases linearly with œµ. On the other hand, if the mass gathering occurs when the contact rate is minimized (blue curve), then 0 decreases linearly with œµ. If the mass gathering occurs half-way between these times (green and black curves), then the effect on 0 of varying œµ (even quite significantly) is negligible. This is likely due to the fact that the contact rate is near its mean during these periods, and so varying œµ has very little impact on the contact rate until after the gathering has concluded.

Thus far, we have not discussed the impact that a period of latency (between the time of infection and the beginning of infectiousness) might have on our analysis. For many models, if the average life expectancy in the absence of disease is , ¬µ 1 then the inclusion of latency with an average duration of 1 reduces 0 by a factor of ¬µ + . Since this duration of latency is typically much shorter than life expectancy, this fraction is typically quite close to one and so the effect on 0 is small. For our model, however, the result is quite different. Here, the value of 0 is highly dependent on transmission that takes place during the mass gathering. A period of latency can significantly cut into the duration of the mass gathering, resulting in a larger reduction in 0 . In Fig. 8 , we present the analog of Fig. 3 , showing how 0 varies with œÑ (the offset between the peak in transmissibility and the beginning of movement to the mass gathering) for a variant of our main model that includes a period of latency that lasts an average of two days. There seems to be an approximately 30% reduction in 0 when the mass gathering happens at peak transmissibility and an approximately 20% reduction in 0 when the mass gathering happens at the minimum transmissibility. The difference in reduction is likely due to the difference in how much of the next generation of infections occur at the mass gathering for the different values of œÑ. This shows that future work should take full account of latency. ",11.653591233227413,5.624597040024217

Lessons for Zika virus and the Olympics 2016,"At the other end of the scale are unintentional 'mass gatherings' such as refugees taking shelter in huge camps, often in cramped conditions with poor hygiene. These are not usually regarded as mass gathering events, but nevertheless they pose the same problem in terms of the transmission of pathogens in the situation of a large number of people in a limited space. Currently the civil war in Syria has displaced many people, and diseases like tuberculosis, cutaneous leishmaniasis, measles, and polio are a risk. 1 Such conditions also increase the risk of transmission of zoonoses, with expected closer contact to rodents compared to normal conditions. Thus a One Health approach is also needed in this situation. 2 Mass gathering events are theoretically ideal situations for the spread of infections between people from very different and widespread geographical localities, with potentially different immune responses. One of the first events that focused the international health community on mass gathering events was the outbreak of meningitis in 2000-2001 after the Hajj. 3, 4 However, the spread of infections is rarely caused by mass gathering sports events. 5 All previous experiences from different mass gathering show that vaccine preventable diseases is the most important infections like influenza, hepatitis A, polio and meningitis. Three mass gathering held in Africa during the Ebola outbreak accepted participants from West Africa and was able to handle the theoretical risk without any incident. Therefore we believe that the Olympic games in Rio de Janeiro should not be cancelled. The number of visitors to the games is a tiny fraction (1%) of other visitors to Zika endemic countries and it will have no measurable effect on the risk of spreading Zika virus, if the games was cancelled. The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) from China to Hong Kong and further to Canada was not due to a mass gathering, but to infected individuals travelling late in the incubation period or just after the onset of symptoms. 6, 7 The introduction of West Nile virus to North America was probably through wild birds crossing the Atlantic, and it could not have been predicted. Lastly, the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Korea was caused by a single traveller waiting in an overcrowded hospital emergency room in South Korea. 8 The Korean MERS-CoV outbreak illustrates how difficult it is to predict the future. MERS was estimated to have a low epidemic potential, 9 and it was pointed out in this Journal that the outbreak was identified as being caused by MERS-CoV because it happened in a country with the resources (knowledge and laboratory facilities) to rapidly identify the virus. 10 ",11.743048589484093,8.542693170278937

Measurements are performed according to the latest recommendations by the ERS and ATS; often we were even stricter. For instance, for the analysis of tidal breathing at the age of 1 month, we used 100 instead of 30 breaths as currently recommended, for better accuracy. 21 There is still enough flexibility to develop new lung function testing methods. 32, 36 To validate exposure to air pollutants, we have started to assess individual exposure to air pollutants using passive samplers, which is expensive and has yet been rarely used in studies assessing the effect of long-term exposure to air pollution on lung function.

Called the ""Three Ones,"" these principles were one, agreed-upon framework for coordinating all partners, one national coordinating authority with support from multiple sectors, and one comprehensive, countrylevel monitoring and evaluation system (Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/ AIDS 2004). Achievement of the third of the ""Three Ones"" principles was expected, at the time, to be a significant challenge-countries' HIV M&E systems needed to meet the needs of the global community engaged in fighting HIV/AIDS, national and subnational stakeholders from multiple sectors, public health workers coordinating efforts ""on the ground,"" and funding agencies, both domestic and international, looking to examine the returns on their investments. Furthermore, these M&E systems needed to be built, tested, and launched quickly, yet be robust enough to achieve their purpose, and at the same time be flexible, scalable, and adjustable so that they could meet the needs of the future as well.

The LA kernel is very competitive in performance with AAP. Interestingly, the AAP significantly outperforms the RBF kernel trained using data in its binary representation. The AAP method is essentially an RBF kernel trained on the same data but using a different representation in which each peptide is represented by a vector of 400 numeric values computed based on the AAP propensity scale. The significant difference observed in performance of these two RBF-based methods highlights the importance of the data representation in kernel methods. All of these observations hold not only for the BCP20 data set but also for the homology-reduced data sets of peptides with different lengths (see Supplementary Materials). Most of the methods have their best performance on BCP20 data set and show slight decreases in performance on data sets with decreasing peptide length.

Only if standardized methods are defined, will it be possible to correctly evaluate the antiviral potential of the compound under examination. In this perspective, it is also important to compare the antiviral activity of the hypothetical antiviral with that of reference drugs (amantadine, oseltamivir, etc) in order to ascertain the influenza antiviral index of the new molecule.

Separate phylogenetic trees were produced for the three viral species, with 134 HAV genomes, 2,542 HCV genomes, and 557 HEV genomes, as shown in Figure 1. All trees were drawn to scale, to illustrate the much lower genomic diversity of HAV compared with the other two species. The trees for HCV and HEV were collapsed at 90% identity for graphical representation. The HAV branches remained un‚Äêcollapsed, since the shown branches per genotype all have a similarity >90%. The genomic diversity of HEV is higher than that of HAV but lower than that of HCV, as illustrated by the branch lengths of the trees. The produced HAV tree is in good agreement with previously published data (Vaughan et al., 2014), although we did not include simian serotypes IV to VI. Our HCV tree that was based on 2,542 genomes is also mostly in agreement with previous publications that used smaller datasets. A neighbor joining (NJ) tree based on 162 genome sequences (Jackowiak et al., 2014) already identified a relationship between genotype 1 (Gt1) and Gt4, which is also visible in Figure 1; these two genotypes have evolved later than the other genotypes (Preciado et al., 2014). The relationship between Gt2 and Gt7 was also noted before. However, our data produced a better resolution of genotypes than the NJ tree published by Jackowiak and colleagues. An ML tree based on 129 genome sequences (Smith et al., 2014) also did not fully resolve the branch of Gt1 and Gt4 with respect to the other genotypes. It is unclear on what data the tree shown in a review article (Preciado et al., 2014) was based, in which Gt1 and Gt4 were separated. In our tree, the branch leading to Gt1 and Gt4 is placed between Gt3 and Gt6/Gt8. Upon closer investigation of HCV genomes for which a subtype was specified in their Genbank annotation, only a few annotations did not match the current nomenclature, all of which were given a genotype before standardization of the nomenclature (Tokita et al., 1996). This illustrates that historical Genbank annotations must be interpreted with caution. The six genotypes of HEV are also well resolved in Figure 1, but the subtypes within these genotypes are not. Notably, one collapsed branch contained members of subtypes 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, and 1f, whose close distances have been noted before (Smith et al., 2016). On the other hand, the genetic diversity within Gt3 is extensive, even if rabbit isolates are ignored (Figure 1). Based on their overall genomic similarity, members of Gt3 could be considered to belong to multiple genotypes that could be newly defined. This was observed by Smith and colleagues as well, but they decided to keep the nomenclature of genotypes 1‚Äì4 as proposed by Lu, Li, and Hagedorn (2006), since this was already well established. As a result, there is no consistent degree of similarity within the different genotypes and their subtypes for HEV, in contrast to the more transparent nomenclature of HCV.",12.130696040032175,6.951718091540787

A synthesized view enables stakeholders to visualize the integrated information using a shared platform, thus reducing the need for reporting and notification.20,21 The risk is interpreted and tracked in near real-time. The final step of biosurveillance is an integrated response by stakeholders. The response is integrated as the members are naturally engaged in the process through a synthesized view of automated system.22",13.846073190939888,10.995372977058453

The minor populations consist of CD14++ CD16+ (intermediate) and CD14+ CD16++ (non-classical) monocytes.14 Monocytes expressing both CD14 and CD16 show a more mature morphological and functional phenotype than their CD16- counterparts and are thought to constitute the specific precursors of tissue-resident macrophages.15 Our studies use this new classification system, however many of the references use the old nomenclature and so will be referred to as originally published.",11.294502679361372,8.25737623408309

The population under study is not constant over time because users can opt-out sharing their geo-location at any time. Also, the internal logic of the data gathering system might fail in sensing users who stop moving for a prolonged period of time. This suggests that our estimates may underestimate the true effects of mobility restrictions.
