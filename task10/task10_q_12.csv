In Iran, the first cases of COVID-19 were officially announced between February 19 and 23, 2020 and it soon became clear that Iran is one of the countries that is worst-hit by COVID-19 outbreak (1, 2) . It is now evident that most cases of COVID-19 disease develop mild respiratory and constitutional symptoms (3), while some cases are asymptomatic (3, 4) . Involvement of other organs, including liver and kidneys has been reported in patients with COVID-19 (5). Many questions remain unanswered about associations and presentations of COVID-19. Shohada-e-Tajrish Hospital, a university hospital located in Tehran, Iran, was designated as one of the main centers providing diagnostic and healthcare services for patients suspected to be infected with the new virus. Here, we share our experience regarding computed tomography (CT) findings suggestive of COVID-19 disease among patients who underwent radiologic investigation due to traumatic injuries. Several trauma patients had findings on their chest and/or abdominal CT scans, which were suggestive or highly suggestive of COVID-19 (1). The findings were noted in the lung bases that were visible on an abdominal CT scan or on a clinically indicated spiral CT scan of the chest. The most frequent mechanisms of injury were fall and car accident. Conscious patients did not report dizziness or loss of consciousness before the trauma and most of them did not have any symptoms related to COVID-19 (e.g., fever, shortness of breath). To our knowledge, there is no study or report about the possible association between COVID-19 and trauma in the lit-erature. So, the mentioned observations could be just a coincidence, but this association could still be proposed as a research objective. The importance of this finding is that CT characteristics of COVID-19 could be seen in patients who were admitted to the hospitals not due to COVID-19 related symptoms, but because of chest and abdominal trauma. This issue should be considered by health care workers serving trauma patients and it should be kept in mind that during an outbreak of respiratory infections, in particular COVID-19 disease, every attempt should be made to protect the health and safety of the staff even when providing care for trauma patients.",31.049425877675215,14.996812702358444

Subsequently, on March 12, 2020, 125,048 cases and 4,614 deaths were reported. Coronavirus is an enveloped RNA virus, from the genus Betacoronavirus, that is distributed in birds, humans, and other mammals. WHO has named the novel coronavirus disease as COVID-19. More than 80 clinical trials have been launched to test coronavirus treatment, including some drug repurposing or repositioning for COVID-19. Hence, we performed a search in March 2020 of the clinicaltrials.gov database.",31.24746731696104,13.060066754839333

However, it is important to note this is not specific to COVID-19. Indeed, one review stated that the WHO does not currently recommend corticosteroids in other viral diseases, like Dengue as the 'glucocorticoid-mediated stimulation of the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal axis can also drive lymphocytopenia, or it may promote exaggerated pro-inflammatory responses that eventually cause a worsening of the pathogenic condition'. These are unprecedented times for the medical community and although evidence suggests a potential role for the use of NSAIDs and corticosteroids in COVID-19 treatment, caution should be exercised until further evidence, specific to this infection strain, emerges.

COVID-19 is a self-limiting disease in more than 80% of patients. Severe pneumonia occurred in about 15% of cases as revealed in studies with large cohorts of patients. The gross case fatality is 3.4% worldwide as of February 25, 2020. This rate is 4.4% for patients in Wuhan, 4.0% for patients in Hubei and 0.92% for patients outside of Hubei. The exceedingly high fatality in Wuhan might be explained by the collapse of hospitals, a large number of undiagnosed patients, suboptimal treatment or a combination of these. Up to date, we still do not have any specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents but an anti-Ebola drug, remdesivir, may hold the promise. As a nucleotide analog, remdesivir was shown to be effective in preventing MERS-CoV replication in monkeys. Severity of disease, viral replication, and lung damage were reduced when the drug was administered either before or after infection with MERS-CoV [10] . These results provide the basis for a rapid test of the beneficial effects of remdesivir in COVID-19. Other antiviral agents worthy of further clinical investigations include ribavirin, protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir, interferon α2b, interferon β, chloroquine phosphate, and Arbidol. However, we should also bear in mind the side effects of these antiviral agents. For example, type I interferons including interferon α2b and interferon β are well known for their antiviral activity. Their beneficial effects at an early phase of infection are well expected. However, administration at a later stage carries the risk that they might worsen the cytokine storm and exacerbate inflammation. Notably, steroids have been experimentally used widely in the treatment of SARS and are still preferred by some Chinese physicians in the treatment of COVID-19. It is said to be capable of stopping the cytokine storm and preventing lung fibrosis. However, the window in which steroids might be beneficial to patients with COVID-19 is very narrow. In other words, steroids can only be used when SARS-CoV-2 has already been eliminated by human immune response. Otherwise, SARS-CoV-2 replication will be boosted leading to exacerbation of symptoms, substantial virus shedding, as well as increased risk for nosocomial transmission and secondary infection. In this regard, it will be of interest to determine whether the report of fungal infection in the lungs of some patients in Wuhan might be linked to misuse of steroids. Nevertheless, the screening of new pharmaceuticals, smallmolecule compounds and other agents that have potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects will successfully derive new and better lead compounds and agents that might prove useful in the treatment of COVID-19.",29.944183051210395,11.947939039635273

Possible reasons quoted in the report were the lack of caution regarding the COVID-19 outbreak in January and insufficient supplies of protective gear. On 18 February, 2020, the National Health Commission of China reported that 323 patients with severe psychiatric disorders were diagnosed with the COVID-19 [2] . To limit the transmission of the COVID-19 and provide acute treatment for severely ill patients, central and regional authorities have undertaken several effective measures, such as setting up emergency infectious hospitals and quarantine facilities, and isolating suspected and diagnosed patients and their close contacts [3] .

Furthermore, in the past decade, internship period in internal medicine has been reduced for medical students whose major is psychiatry in many medical schools in order to extend their training in mental health. All these factors could limit their clinical competence to control the potential transmission of COVID-19 in psychiatric hospitals. In addition, the lack of community-based mental health services has led to an over-reliance on psychiatric services provided by large psychiatric hospitals [10, 11] . For the vast majority of patients with serious mental illness, they can only access appropriate mental health care in hospital settings, which are mostly located in city areas. Therefore, they are more prone to exposure to infectious diseases such as the COVID-19, unless the psychiatric hospitals themselves implement stringent measures of infection control similar to general hospitals. Clearly, preventive measures such as the provision of adequate medical supplies and protective equipment, public education on the risks of COVID-19 for hospital staff and patients, and restricting family visits to hospitals, are essential to reduce the likelihood of disease transmission in major psychiatric hospitals. Moreover, all people including patients' families and health care workers need to be advised to wash hands regularly and maintain good personal hygiene. Measurement of body temperature should be performed at least once a day to closely monitor any suspected infectious symptoms. Activities involving group interaction in communal areas should be avoided. Moreover, in order to minimize the potential risk of nosocomial infection, isolation units should be established and hospital access should be restricted for inpatients [9] .",32.099051135735344,13.746743482634248

Establishing a surveillance system for a new epidemic is believed to be a core intervention in controlling the disease (45). Surveillance system data provides reliable information for epidemiologists to identify weak chains of transmission and facilitates evidence-based decisions by policymakers both inside and outside the healthcare service. Moreover, updating and sharing interpretations of data with media, especially in earlier phase of an epidemic, will aid community engagement and participation in control activities and prevention of spreading rumors. Although, it may be too soon to compare the effectiveness of surveillance systems for COVID-19 epidemic in different countries, it seems that the Chinese surveillance system is highly effective as it ensures timely detection, recording, tracking, updating and sharing information on media for an outbreak with unknown origin and high burden of cases (4) . In a large number of countries, the initial focus of the surveillance system for CIVID-19 is examination of all suspected cases with symptoms of the disease (mostly fever) and all people with a travel history to China or visiting Chinese travelers or citizens it the previous two weeks. However, this type of screening program mainly relies on fever cases and those with direct flights from China, so it misses pre-symptomatic cases as well as infected travelers who are arriving from regions with high burden of disease via indirect flights, which could be a source of infection in COVID-19-free countries (46) . In a communicable disease outbreak, essential data are usually collected in parallel from different available information sources in the country including data of weekly outpatient visits to health care centers and hospital referrals with a chief complaint of fever, data of weekly inpatient fever cases and deaths with unknown origin (45). Furthermore, increase in the number of cases and deaths due to pneumonia may raise an alarm in COVID-19 free areas. A prerequisite for establishing a surveillance system is to provide basic laboratory facilities, particularly at ""point of care"" (10). This system should be constantly monitored and evaluated using sensitive indicators to ensure the quality of case detection, diagnosis and management. Detection of primary confirmed cases with poor prognosis in early phase of the epidemic without any link to confirmed cases from other regions emphasis on the insensitivity of a national and local surveillance systems and low performance of control activities against the disease in community level.

A large number of patients present to clinics and health centers with mild common cold symptoms such as dry cough, sore throat, low-grade fever or body aches. Patients usually go to the emergency departments if the symptoms of the clinical manifestations worsen after a few days. Because of the wide spectrum of clinical symptoms, research on biomarkers and clinical criteria predicting prognosis is of high priority to enable differentiating cases that require further interventions in the early phase of the disease (10) . No approved drug regimen has been introduced to treat infected cases so far, antiviral treatments are used to alleviate the disease symptoms. Studies on Remedesevir, as an antiviral agent, revealed its in vitro activity against the COVID-19 virus and its safety was proven in Ebola trials. Another proposed treatment is Chloroquine, an old drug for treatment of malaria, with apparent effectiveness and acceptable safety against COVID-19 associated pneumonia (48, 49) . Evaluating the efficacy of anti-influenza drugs such as Umifenovir and Oseltamivir against COVID-19 virus is interesting but lacks any biological plausibility. Using monoclonal antibodies has been suggested as an attractive choice among inactive prophylactic methods; however, its effectiveness has not been proven in other viral respiratory diseases and influenza, yet (50, 51) . Steroids and methylprednisolone seem to be widely used in the recent pandemic. However, in case of MERS, it has been shown that the drug prolongs the presence of the virus and WHO does not recommend its use for COVID-19, except for patients with acute respiratory distress syn-drome (ARDS) (52, 53) . The effectiveness of other medicines and regimens such as Chloroquine, Vitamin C, and Chinese medicine, as well as Lopinavir/Ritonavir combination therapy and Remedesevir are being evaluated in China. Even though randomized clinical trials are important for improving prognosis and interrupting transmission of disease, researchers and healthcare providers should concentrate on alleviation of the disease among subgroups of patients and in different phases of the disease (54) . In addition, since the emerging virus has become a serious global concern, there is a need for rapid development of a vaccine. There are a few vaccine candidates developed in response to outbreak. However, an effective anti-viral medication or a vaccine that has been evaluated for safety and efficacy against COVID-19 is not available yet, and most vaccines are still in the preclinical testing stage (55, 56, 57) .",29.40240479665883,13.163055400105918

Although a 30-bed ward in an infectious disease hospital in Wuhan was established for psychiatric patients on 3 February 2020, the rapidly escalating number of cases has led to a severe shortage of hospital beds. As an alternative, isolation wards have been established in psychiatric hospitals for psychiatric patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19, but this option could increase the risk of hospital-acquired infection especially if there is inadequate capacity for infection control in these hospitals [1] . Another option is to establish specific quarantine facilities for clinically stable psychiatric patients with mild-moderate symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Gymnasiums, exhibition centers and sports centers have been converted into 'Fang Cang' (temporary quarantine hospital facilities) for infected patients with mild symptoms [14] (Figure 1 ). In conclusion, the COVID-19 outbreak has raised numerous challenges for psychiatric hospitals in China to safely manage patients' major psychiatric disorders in addition to preventing and treating COVID-19. In addressing these challenges, future community mental health system reform is necessary to re-balance the system by re-distributing resources from hospital-centric services to community-based and primary care services.

However, the case fatality rate of SARS and MERS was 10% and 34%, respectively (18) . Results of a study in China revealed the overall case fatality rate of 2.3% for COVID-19 (27) and some studies reported case fatality rate of 0.9% in Beijing (28) . In another study, Jung and colleagues reported a confirmed case fatality risk of 5.3% to 8.4% for COVID-19 (23) . However, due to the rapid spread of COVID-19, there is a higher number of death cases in the recent pandemic (N=3043, up to 02 March 2020) compared to SARS and MERS (N=1871) (29) . There is a poor prognosis for the disease in middle and older aged patients (28) . In a study on 44672 confirmed cases in China, case fatality rate was highest in the group of over 80 years (14.77%), followed by the age group between 70 to 80 years (7.96%) and no mortality was reported in age group below 10 years (30) . Even though death outcome is uncommon in young people, a few deaths are reported in this age group in China and Iran. Availability of and access to healthcare facilities has likely contributed to increase in death outcome. As a probable explanation for the difference between fatality rate in Wuhan (3%) and other provinces (0.7%) in China, death rates are likely affected by shortage in health resources due to increasing number of patient who had sought diagnosis and treatment services in the early phase of the epidemic in Wuhan (31).",36.06354374079519,11.480457253987737

Accordingly, target genes for screening and confirmatory assays by RT-PCR are ORF1ab and N in Chinese laboratory protocol, while RdRP, E and N are checked in Germany. Furthermore, three targets in N gene are considered in the US protocol (40) .

Prevalence of Underlying Diseases in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19: a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"The key problems surrounding this novel virus are as follows: diagnosis, mode of transmission, long incubation period (3 to 14 days), predicting the number of infected cases in the community, and insufficient protection resources due to its pandemic specification (15, 18) . The accurate transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown, since various factors impact its transmission. Moreover, infection of family clusters and healthcare workers indicate the human to human transmission of the disease and its contagiousness, which makes the condition more complicated (19, 20) . Since SARS-CoV-2 is a newly identified pathogen, there is no pre-existing immunity to it in the human community, also there is no definitive cure to interrupt or reduce its astonishing spread. These ambiguities make the condition more serious for vulnerable members of the community, which include individuals with immune problems, co-existing comorbidity and elderly people. Despite the novelty of the topic, there are a lot of proposed studies about history, transmission route, urgency of responding, pathogenic potential characteristics and prevention strategies but there are still some underlying diseases that have remained unknown (21) . According to the current analysis, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, kidney disease, smoking, and COPDs were among the most prevalent underlying diseases among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. In terms of pre-existing medical conditions, cardiovascular diseases had the highest prevalence among diseases that put patients at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 threats. Decreasing the proinflammatory cytokines, which leads to a weaker immune function may account for this condition (2, 22) . It is worth noting that similar results were found regarding MERS (23) . We also found that smokers are more susceptible to Coronavirus infections, especially to the most recent species. Various reasons may justify this happening. It has been mentioned that smokers have unregulated ACE2 in remodeled cell types, which is consistent with results of SARS studies. However, factors such as amount of smoking, the duration of smoking, and the duration of smoking cessation also play a role. In some previous studies on MERS-CoV-2 it has been shown that dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4), which is the specific receptor for this virus, had a higher rate of expression in smokers and COPD patients (24) . Although the results of the current analysis indicate that smoking can be an underlying factor that makes people susceptible to COVID-19 complications, in some studies, especially COVID-19 related studies, no strong evidence has been found regarding the correlation of COPD and smoking with being infected with this new virus. But the important point that must be taken into consideration is that the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection is more severe in COPD cases and smokers (25) . As mentioned in the results section, patients with malignancies are more in danger than those without any tumor. Anticancer treatments such as chemotherapy and surgery put this group into an immunosuppressive state and subsequently at higher risk of MERS-CoV-2 infection (26) . Among those with malignancies, lung cancer patients seems to be more susceptible, and they must follow guidance on restricting any contact with possible infected zones or individuals for their safety (14) . Possible risk factors for progressive and severe illness may include the above-mentioned factors but are not limited to them; pregnancy and old age are other risky conditions, which should be monitored meticulously. However, there is no clear evidence about the risk of transmission of COVID-19 to the newborn during vaginal delivery or transmission via breastfeeding but care and protection of newborns against possible exposure to infection or contaminated conditions such as maternal breast contamination must be observed. Since MERS-CoV-2 is an emerging virus, no specific treatment is currently available (27, 28) , and pathophysiology of this condition is still unknown. Therefore, general prevention measures such as the following should be followed: Washing hands frequently and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, and mouth with contaminated hands, avoiding close contact ,especially with those who have fever, coughing or sneezing, avoiding contact with live animals and consuming raw animal products (29) . There are some responsibilities for health policymakers in this critical condition: Screening of travelers, triage all patients on admission and immediately isolating all suspected and confirmed cases, providing protective gear, preparing local guidance and instructions for people, especially for high risk groups (30, 31) . To the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis that estimates the prevalence of underlying diseases in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Given that most studies on CoVID-19 are in an early stage, and there are some limitations such as small number of studies, and reports being restricted to China and a few other countries, due to the pandemic nature of the disease, specific patterns should be introduced for different groups, including people with underlying diseases, to minimize the harm. Based on the experiences gained on this disease during this short time, a strong recommendation for all people, clinicians, and policymakers is to guide people to protect themselves to avoid being exposed to SARS-CoV-2, whenever possible (32) . Another very important advice to patients with underlying diseases during the epidemics like the one caused by the novel virus is to follow guidance on travel restrictions. These groups must be aware of their high-risk situation and comply with all health guidelines such as hand hygiene, face care, and restricting social interactions. In addition, to reduce the morbidity and complications of COVID-19 in different populations, especially patients with the mentioned underlying diseases, we recommend clinicians and policymakers to launch diagnostic procedures for such individuals first so that proper treatments can be designed and followed to ensure they are protected within epidemic regions (33) .",27.42073369069608,12.637408173236242

Also the estimation of the model parameters is based on an assumption, considering just the first period in which the first cases were confirmed and reported. Of note, COVID-19, which is thought to be principally transmitted from person to person by respiratory droplets and fomites without excluding the possibility of the fecal-oral route [21] had been spreading for at least over a month and a half before the imposed lockdown and quarantine of Wuhan on January 23, having thus infected unknown numbers of people.

This finding is in line with the results of a previous study on SARS-CoV-1 that was done by Wong and colleagues (15) . However, acourding to some studies, infection with COVID-19 during pregnancy can cause complications for both the mother and the fetus; including preterm delivery, respiratory distress, fetal distress, coaglopathy accompanied by liver dysfunction and death of the mother. The newborn and the mother with confirmed COVID-19 should be isolated in different rooms and be screened very carefully (4, 7, 21, 23) .

Previously published studies have demonstrated that being affected with SARS during perinatal period is associated with a high prevalence of harmful maternal and neonatal side effects including disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, abrupt abortion, preterm childbirth, intrauterine growth retard, neonatal intubation and need of newborn to be admitted to neonatal intensive care unit, and organ failure (17, 25) . Generally, our review of literature showed that pregnant women infected with COVID-19 and their newborns had less problems than would be anticipated for those with SARS-CoV-1 infection. Although the findings should be interpreted with percaution because of the small sample size, the results are mostly in line with the findings by Zhu and colleagues (24) that was done on ten newborn who were born to mothers with COVID-19 pneumonia.

Cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) is a phenomenon of immune hyperactivation typically described in the setting of T cell-engaging immunotherapy, including CAR-T cell therapy but also anti-PD-1 agents [15] . CRS is characterized by elevated levels of IL-6, IFN-γ and other cytokines, provoking consequences and symptoms related to immune activation, ranging from fever, malaise and myalgias to severe organ toxicity, lung failure and death. In parallel, one of the most important mechanism underlying the deterioration of disease in COVID-19 is represented by the cytokine storm, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome or even multiple organ failure [16] . The cytometric analyses of COVID-19 patients showed reduced counts of peripheral CD4 and CD8 T cells, while their status was hyperactivated. In addition, an increased concentration of highly proinflammatory CCR6+ Th17 in CD4 T cells has been reported, and CD8 T cells were found to harbor high concentrations of cytotoxic granules, suggesting that overactivation of T cells tends to contribute to the severe immune injury of the disease [17] . Moreover, the pathological findings associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome in COVID-19 showed abundant interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate in the lungs, dominated by lymphocytes, once again implying that the immune hyperactivation mechanisms are at least partially accountable for COVID-19 severity [17] . Considering these aspects, the hypothesis of a synergy between ICI mechanisms and COVID-19 pathogenesis, both contributing to a counter-producing immune hyperactivation, cannot be excluded.",30.14461338216408,13.195820348392132

Among such individuals, cancer patients represent a large subgroup at high risk of developing coronavirus infection and its severe complications. A recent nationwide analysis in China demonstrated that, of 1590 COVID-19 cases from 575 hospitals, 18 had a history of cancer (1 vs 0.29% of cancer incidence in the overall Chinese population, respectively), with lung cancer as the most frequent diagnosis [5] . Patients with cancer were observed to have a higher risk of severe events compared with patients without cancer (39 vs 8%; p = 0.0003). Moreover, cancer patients who underwent recent chemotherapy or surgery had a higher risk of clinically severe events than did those not receiving treatment. With the limit of a small sample size, the authors concluded that patients with cancer might have a higher risk of COVID-19, and poorer outcomes, than individuals without cancer. As a consequence, they recommended to consider an intentional postponing of adjuvant chemotherapy or elective surgery for stable cancer in endemic areas [5] .",30.90727908782988,13.142805435066323

A questionnaire should be used to screen patients with potential infection of 2019-nCoV before they could be led to the dental chair-side.

Furthermore, the limited cancer patient population described in this first report from the literature, was curiously characterized by the lack of individuals receiving anticancer immunotherapy. Indeed, only chemotherapy and surgery were cited among treatments received by patients in the month prior to developing COVID-19. Maybe, this could simply be due to the casualty of a small sample, or otherwise, it could suggest that cancer patients receiving immunotherapy are less prone to develop COVID-19 or to be admitted in hospital due to severe coronavirus symptoms. Currently, we are aware of the probably higher incidence of misdiagnosed coronavirus infections compared with that reported and updated every day; it is likely that a great portion of healthy and young population develop COVID-19 with mild symptoms, not requiring hospital admittance and thus escaping the laboratory confirmation of the disease [7] . Cancer patients undergoing treatment with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 or anti-CTLA-4 immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) currently used in everyday practice to treat solid tumors such as melanoma, lung cancer, renal carcinoma, urothelial cancers and head and neck carcinoma constitute a growing oncological population [8] . Their specific susceptibility to bacterial or viral infections has not been investigated.

Methods: This diagnostic accuracy study was conducted on suspected COVID-19 patients, who presented to Behpooyan Clinic Medical center in Tehran (Iran) from 22 February to 14 March, 2020. Patients were divided into two groups based on the results of real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19, and the accuracy of different laboratory parameters in predicting cases with positive RT-PCR was evaluated using area under the ROC curve (AUC). Results: Two hundred cases with the mean age of 41.3± 14.6 (range: 19-78) years were studied (0.53% male). The result of RT-PCR for COVID-19 was positive in 70 (35%) cases.

The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is formerly known as the '2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Pneumonia', which was originated from a wet market in Wuhan, Hubei province, China in early December 2019 [1] . On the 7 th January, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) identified and isolated this novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted between persons via close contacts [2] leading to COVID-19. Infected patients may develop severe and even fatal respiratory diseases (e.g., acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute respiratory failure) ending up in intensive care [2, 3] .

Consequently, they may experience loneliness, denial, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and despair, which may lower treatment adherence.

Chen et al., found that LDH had significantly increased in most patients, while albumin had decreased, but ALT and AST showed no significant changes (11) . The mentioned val- ues were also reported for patients with MERS-CoV, where elevated ALT, AST and LDH was observed (6) . Another study indicated that 2-11% of patients with COVID-19 had liver co-morbidities and 14-53% of cases had abnormal ALT and AST levels during progression of COVID-19 disease (12) . Furthermore, Shi et al. studied patients whose COVID-19 diagno- sis was confirmed by computed tomography (CT) scan while in the subclinical phase and found that incidence of AST abnormality among these patients was significantly lower than those diagnosed after the onset of symptoms (13) . Therefore, liver injury is more prevalent in severe cases compared to mild cases of COVID-19. In another report, Yang et al. found no difference in the incidence of abnormal liver function between survivors (30%) and non-survivors (28%) (9) . Liver damage in mild cases of COVID-19 is often transient and can return to normal without any special treatment (12) . We have found that the number and percentage of WBC, LYM and NEU were significantly different between positive and negative RT-PCR cases for COVID-19/or SARS-CoV-2. In comparison to the normal range, we found low WBC and LYM counts in patients with positive RT-PCR COVID-19, whereas NEU counts were higher in these patients. In previous reports, low LYM and WBC counts were found in most patients, which is in line with our study (14) . Laboratory studies showed leucopenia with leukocyte counts of 2.91 ÃŮ 109 cells/L, 70.0% of which were NEU (15) . Therefore, our result suggests that NEU might not be affected with SARS-CoV-2 in the initial phase of the disease. It also suggests that SARS-CoV-2 might mainly act on lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes, as does SARS-CoV. Virus particles spread through the respiratory tract and infect other cells, inducing series of immune responses, and causing changes in number of peripheral white blood cells such as lymphocytes (11) . Some studies suggest that a substantial decrease in the total number of lymphocytes indicates that coronavirus affects many immune cells and inhibits cellular immune function (11) . Tsui and others reported that high neutrophil count on admission of COVID-19 patients, and elevated LDH level were independent predictors of an adverse clinical outcome (16) . In the present study, ROC curve was used to analyze the specificity and sensitivity of different variables in suspected COVID-19 patients. The AUC of laboratory parameters such as ALT, CRP, AST, LDH, and NEU indicated that they could be used to predict the presence of COVID-19 disease, while those of albumin and WBC were below the reference line of ROC curve, indicating that they were poor predictors of the disease. The data is in line with results reported by Wang et al. (17) and Gao et al. (4) . In the current study, the AUC of CRP, ALT, LDH, urea and NEU were above 0.80; thus, they are effective and have very good predictive value for predicting COVID-19. It seems that, some blood laboratory parameters could be used in screening cases with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19. Considering the significant difference in laboratory parameters evaluated in this study between the 2 groups, one can hope to model or predict the results of coronavirus testing based on routine laboratory tests.",29.882189774687376,10.589352091611772

Despite the Chinese authorities have announced relevant policies and actuating principles in a strategic manner, the COVID-19 outbreak has posted an emerging serious challenge for the mental health services in China. There are some limitations that need to be addressed. First, several online mental health services have been constructed across different areas, however, unified national management and coordination policies are still inadequate, which could result in uneven distribution and wastage of medical resources, let alone evaluating the efficacy of these services. Second, online mental health services are the predominant assistance measure and therefore, some people (e.g., older adults) who may have limited access to smartphones and the broadband internet, may benefit less from the services [42] . Third, frontline health professionals may have limited time and energy to access to these services due to heavy workload. Fourth, based on experiences of SARS outbreak, some patients and health professionals would be traumatized by the COVID-2019 outbreak and still suffer from persistent psychiatric symptoms even after the outbreak [43] .

There are such cases with every infectious disease. They are also present during the flu epidemics, but they are extremely rare. This suddenly gives us another possible strategy for quarantine exit, where children and those under 50 years of age could first emerge if they do not have any underlying illnesses. Here, after this table, it already seems like we are beginning to have an increasing number of options to get out of quarantines and learn to live with this virus until the vaccine becomes available. However, at least a few more studies need to be carried out to confirm that this age group can be substantially protected, to provide reassurance that the virus is not becoming more dangerous for those younger than 50 years, too. There is another strangeness to the situation in Italy that will not be intuitive to the general public. The actual number of deaths attributable to COVID-19 in Italy will not be possible to estimate for several months after the epidemic finally ends. Namely, at present, due to the sole focus on the epidemic, most of the cases of death of very old people who have been diagnosed using a throat swab have been attributed to COVID-19. However, once the epidemic is over, it will be necessary to compare the deaths in individual areas of Italy with the average for the same months in the previous few years. It could be shown that a part of the already ill would have died in the same month, or a year, even without being infected with the new coronavirus. It is possible that among some of them COVID-19 accelerated this inevitability by a few weeks or months. Some of the deaths observed during the epidemic in Italy may need to be reclassified later and attributed to underlying diseases in accordance with expected levels, and those above expected levels will then be attributed to COVID-19.",31.512230668125063,13.850425421973197

However, it was difficult to subsequently determine R0 parameter on the first 425 patients in Wuhan. The estimate of the R0 for COVID-19 in their article was 2.2, but with a very wide confidence interval -from 1.4 to 3.9. It is a bit of tough luck for the Italians, again, that they calculated the lower bound of the confidence interval to be 1.4 exactly. This figure is well known to all epidemiologists, it' s the rate of the spread of seasonal flu in the community. It should come as no surprise that many epidemiologists would guess that, with more data, R0 for COVID-19 would start converging more towards 1.4. Unfortunately, the more recent data suggests that R0 is more likely to lean towards 3.9, implying an incredibly fast spread.

Very recently (25 January 2020) the first and complete genome sequence of COVID-19 was deposited in the NCBI (GenBank: MN908947.3) providing the key to the likely structure and glycosylation pattern of the viral proteins and consequent mode of interaction with the host cell. Similar to most other coronaviruses, the outer membrane spike glycoprotein, known for its glycosylation [3] , is the prime host interacting protein with host cell targets (such as ACE2, CD26, Ezrin, cyclophilins and other cell adhesion factors) important for cell adhesion and virulence [4, 5] . However, the specific host cell factors or proteins that facilitate the novel COVID-19 remain elusive.

Medicines currently prescribed to treat COVID-19 include Oseltamivir, Lopinavir / Ritonavir, Ribavirin, and Chloroquine Phosphate or Hydroxy Chloroquine Sulfate. All of these medicines are metabolized in the liver. Most of the metabolites derived from Oseltamivir, Ribavirin and some of the metabolites of Lopinavir / Ritonavir, Chloroquine Phosphate and Hydroxy Chloroquine Sulfate are found in the urine due to renal excretion. Therefore, injury to the liver and kidneys can impair metabolism, excretion, dosing and expected concentrations of the medications, which can increase the risk of toxicity using the aforementioned medications. According to the reports, liver and kidneys can be damaged in patients with COVID-19, which may make reaching the therapeutic dose of the medicines difficult and increase the risk of adverse drug reactions in patients. As a result, frequent and careful monitoring of liver and kidney functions in patients with COVID-19 can lead to early diagnosis of liver and kidney disorders, and also help in achieving the optimal therapeutic concentrations and reducing the risk of adverse drug reactions.",32.085644240033496,14.514773843882633

As reported herein, four pregnant women were confirmed to have the COVID-19 infection in our medical center, which is designated as one of the treatment centers for pregnant women with the COVID-19 infection. Importantly, we found neither SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic positivity nor immediate evidence of symptomatic COVID-19 among the infants born to the symptomatic, test-positive mothers.",29.64712025663762,13.19578222711412

A recent retrospective analysis in adults showed that the sensitivity of RT-PCR is 71% for COVID-19 infection (13) . Therefore, the reliability of diagnostic testing should be further evaluated, especially in children. Another limitation of this report was the small number of cases, and imperfect clinic data.

This suggests a possible tight interaction between the S1 domain loops in the modelled structure and the CD26 surface. Previous studies of CD26 binding have shown that residues K267, T288, A289, A291, L294, I295, R317, Y322 and D542 interact with Bat-CoV (MERS) spike protein [10] . Interestingly our docked model supports this despite the variability between these spike proteins' S1 domains, with the same CD26 residues in close proximity to the active region of S1 domain in COVID-19. We also observed additional residues (Q286, I287, N338, V341, R336) of CD26 predicted to interact with the S1 domain of the spike protein via van der Waals or by hydrogen bonding. However, regarding the COVID-19 spike glycoprotein, we noticed many different and unique residues (R408, Q409, T445, V417, L461, D467, S469, L491, N492, D493, Y 494, T497, T150, Y504) predicted to interact with CD26. Some of these unique residues of S1 domain are also predicted interact with the ACE2 protein [6] . This underlines the novelty and uniqueness of COVID-19 and its interaction with human target proteins. This observation guides us to suggest that COVID-19 may share infection modes with that of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and that interactions with other targets also warrant investigation.",27.750385561043693,12.494275547523433

This model was validated using the C-Score (confidence score) and TM score (structural similarity) ( Figure S2 ) demonstrating the most correct fold and confidence of the predicted structure. Further validation and refinement was completed by ensuring that the residues occupied Ramachandran favoured positions using Coot (www.mrcimb.cam.uk/) ( Figure S2 ). All amino acid residues were positioned according to their lowest energy possible orientation in the final model. The final modelled homotrimer structure of COVID-19 in C3 symmetry ( Figure 1(A) ) superimposes with SARS-CoV with a 0.85Å Cα RMSD and with a number of unique residues exposed on the surface COVID-19. A second modelled structure of COVID-19 spike glycoprotein, in ligandbound conformation (Figure 1(B) ) was also predicted based on the SARS-CoV/ACE2 complex structure (PDB:6ACG) [4] . This shows S1 domains in an open conformation, enabling it to interact with target host proteins.

During this epidemic, four live-born infants were born in our medical center, to pregnant women with the COVID-19 infection. Three of the four pregnant women gave birth by cesarean section due to concerns about symptomatic maternal infection. The other infant was born by vaginal delivery to a mother experiencing fever (highest temperature 38.3 • C), with a diagnostically confirmed infection. The most important question is whether the COVID-19 could be transmitted vertically to the fetus from the pregnant mother and cause a clinically significant infection. Recently, a finding from nine other cases suggested that there is no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy (1) . We believe this present report is the second case report on vertical transmission between COVID-19 pregnant women and their infants. Moreover, this report will focus more on infants.

A larger sequence difference (∼55% identity), was found in the S1 domain (aa01-aa550), which is known for its host cell target interaction underlying cell adhesion and virulence [4, 5] . Despite sequence dissimilarity in the S1 domains there are conserved residues involved in ternary folding which were conserved.

ND structure can be summarized in a core-shell model, in which the core (the diamond carbon) is inert, while the surface shell is partially graphitic based, allowing for the addition of a variety of functional groups, e.g., carboxyl, hydroxyl [10] , or biomolecules such as lysozyme [25] , which confers different properties to NDs [26] . Therefore, they can be used as a delivery system for a huge range of drugs, antigens, and antibodies [19] . The remarkable high affinity of NDs with proteins [27, 28] enables the generation of a stable and effective conjugate in different buffers, allowing an easy and effective protein load on their surface [27] [28] [29] . On the other hand, their spectroscopic properties make them ideal for in vivo imaging diagnosis [26] , especially for diagnosis of specific targeted cells, increasing the sensitivity of the current therapeutic or imaging diagnosis [4, [13] [14] [15] [16] 30, 31] . In fact, recent advances have highlighted NDs as double-agents combining imaging with drug delivery systems [32] (Figure 1 ). In this review, we discuss the properties that make NDs truly unique and extraordinary in comparison to other nanomaterials, focusing on their impact on the medical field, with special attention on infectious disease prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.",28.24908360821046,11.340400154826176

This is particularly pertinent since current governmental guidelines in the United Kingdom (UK) state that if you have either a temperature or a dry cough then to self-isolate. Should anosmia emerge as a symptom of COVID-19, this could encourage more people to self-isolate, even in absence of other symptoms, to prevent further spread of the virus. Therefore, more information surrounding this possible symptom is crucial. However, whilst it is possible that anosmia and ageusia are in fact symptoms of COVID-19, to our knowledge there is currently no published evidence or case reports noting anosmia and/or ageusia/dysgeusia in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, testing is not yet widespread in the UK and is mainly occurring only in patients hospitalised with the disease.

Given the limited resources available and time-sensitivity of the COVID-19 outbreak, we adopted the snowball sampling strategy. The snowballing sampling strategy was not based on a random selection of the sample, and the study population did not reflect the actual pattern of the general population. Furthermore, it would be ideal to conduct a prospective study on the same group of participants after a period. Due to ethical requirements on anonymity and confidentiality, we were not allowed to collect contact details and personal information from the respondents. As a result, we could not conduct a prospective study that would provide a concrete finding to support the need for a focused public health initiative. There was an oversampling of a particular network of peers (e.g., students), leading to selection bias. As a result, the conclusion was less generalizable to the entire population, particularly less educated people. Another limitation is that self-reported levels of psychological impact, anxiety, depression and stress may not always be aligned with assessment by mental health professionals. Similarly, respondents might have provided socially desirable responses in terms of the satisfaction with the health information received and precautionary measures. Lastly, the number of respondents with contact history and who had sought medical consultations was very small. Our findings could not be generalized to confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19. Notwithstanding the above limitations, this study provides invaluable information on the initial psychological responses 2 weeks after the outbreak of COVID-19 from respondents across 194 cities in China. Our results could be used as a historical reference. Most importantly, our findings directly inform the development of psychological interventions that can minimize psychological impact, anxiety, depression, and stress during the outbreak of COVID-19 and provide a baseline for evaluating prevention, control, and treatment efforts throughout the remainder of the COVID-19 epidemic, which is still ongoing at the time of preparing this manuscript.",35.87969178802528,14.29829231497015

During the 2003 SARS-CoV epidemic, researchers found that moderate levels of anxiety were associated with higher uptake of preventive measures by respondents [21] . Our findings showed the opposite trend. Specific precautionary measures including avoidance of sharing utensils (e.g., chopsticks), hand hygiene, and wearing masks regardless of the presence or absence of symptoms were associated with lower levels of psychological impact, depression, anxiety, and stress. The experiences of the 2003 SARS-CoV epidemic could have changed the perception of the general public towards precautionary measures and have led to a positive effect on the initial psychological responses to the COVID-19 epidemic by giving respondents confidence and sense of control in prevention. As the Chinese prefer to use chopsticks to pick up food commonly shared on a plate during mealtime as part of their culture, it is not unexpected that avoidance of sharing utensils (e.g., chopsticks) during meals is significantly associated with less psychological impact and lower levels of anxiety, depression, and stress. During the initial stage of the COVID-19 epidemic, health authorities outside China had different recommendations for mask usage due to a global shortage of masks. While some health authorities urged citizens not to wear masks if they were well (e.g., Singapore), other health authorities urged their citizens to always have masks and hand sanitizers ready (e.g., Malaysia, Vietnam) [36] . The official guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO) advises that healthy people should only wear masks if they are taking care of a person with suspected COVID-19 infection or if people are coughing and sneezing [37] . Our study found that wearing masks, regardless of the presence or absence of symptoms, was associated with lower levels of anxiety and depression. Although the WHO emphasizes that masks are effective only when used in combination with frequent hand-cleaning with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water, wearing a mask regardless of the presence or absence of symptoms could offer potential psychological benefits by offering a sense of security. This finding was anticipated because wearing face masks is a common practice when people are sick or to counter urban pollution or haze in parts of Asia, including China [38] . Governments and health authorities should ensure there are infrastructures to produce and provide an adequate supply of masks, soaps, alcohol-based hand rubs, and other personal hygiene products during the COVID-19 epidemic.",28.298421388568947,11.885686757163072

Using a mathematical model of screening effectiveness, with preliminary estimates of COVID-19 epidemiology and natural history, we estimate that screening will detect less than half of infected travellers in a growing epidemic, and that screening effectiveness will increase marginally as growth of the source epidemic decelerates. We found that two main factors influenced the effectiveness of screening. First, symptom screening depends on the natural history of an infection: individuals are increasingly likely to show detectable symptoms with increasing time since exposure. A fundamental shortcoming of screening is the difficulty of detecting infected individuals during their incubation period, or early after the onset of symptoms, at which point they still feel healthy enough to undertake normal activities or travel. This difficulty is amplified when the incubation period is longer; infected individuals have a longer window in which they may mix socially or travel with low probability of detection. Second, screening depends on whether exposure risk factors exist that would facilitate specific and reasonably sensitive case detection by questionnaire. For COVID-19, there is so far limited evidence for specific risk factors; we therefore assumed that at most 40% of travellers would be aware of a potential exposure. It is plausible that many individuals aware of a potential exposure would voluntarily avoid travel and practice social distancing-if so, the population of infected travellers will be skewed toward those unaware they have been exposed. Furthermore, based on screening outcomes during the 2009 influenza pandemic, we assumed that a minority of infected travellers would selfreport their exposure honestly, which led to limited effectiveness in questionnaire-based screening. The confluence of these two factors led to many infected people being fundamentally undetectable in our model. Even under our most generous assumptions about the natural history of COVID-19, the presence of undetectable cases made the greatest contribution to screening failure. Correctable failures, such as missing an infected person with fever or awareness of their exposure risk, played a more minor role.",25.41704294179074,11.007695438295276

He also argues that there must be a sustainable news movement, like a sustainable food movement that has already started in the US. In other words, people and even governments are not capable of dealing with the media to a great extent, but people can create their own information diets, like food diet. Therefore, information consumers are advised to consume information in a limited way. However, they must demand complete and credible news, not news that is based on emotional content and full of advertisements"" (4). In the present Coronavirus crisis, some people spend most of their time studying related information regarding Covid-19 in written and virtual media; Meanwhile, they are unwilling to spend time exercising at home, talking to their families, playing with their children or doing other useful tasks such as studying, watching movies and so on. To seriously address these problems in the Coronavirus crisis, not only people must have optimum consumption of appropriate information, but also consuming information should comply with specific terms and conditions. For example, children should not be exposed to the news related to the Coronavirus, because this information increases anxiety and causes other psychological problems among them. The elderly is also vulnerable to the spread of information, and should be provided with reliable and limited information, and they should not be given the ongoing news. On the other hand, individuals should be able to distinguish between high quality and poor quality information, since much of the information regarding Covid-19 is invalid and is produced and published for economic, political, social, and in general profitable purposes (disinformation). Nowadays, in-formation is being provided every day, and by contemplating on and reviewing the publication of statistics related to the Coronavirus crisis on websites, blogs, social media, television and satellite channels etc., it can be understood that the overload of information has already occurred. Hence, providing people with all kinds of health literature is the only option. Although people may not have the ability to control the production and supply of the information nowadays, each of them must control the extent and type of the information which they consume. Therefore, in order to achieve a comprehensive information diet in societies, people need to be equipped with the knowledge and skills of health information literacy, media health literacy, media literacy and health literacy.

Delivering these skills requires specific knowledge and skills which health information professionals (medical librarians) poses, and they can train other people in the society through mass media relying on their abilities.",28.440822415611454,11.727970961303967

Answering this question requires accurate forecasting the spread of confirmed cases as well as analysis of the number of deaths and recoveries. Forecasting, however, requires ample historical data. At the same time, no prediction is certain as the future rarely repeats itself in the same way as the past. Moreover, forecasts are influenced by the reliability of the data, vested interests, and what variables are being predicted. Also, psychological factors play a significant role in how people perceive and react to the danger from the disease and the fear that it may affect them personally. This paper introduces an objective approach to predicting the continuation of the COVID-19 using a simple, but powerful method to do so. Assuming that the data used is reliable and that the future will continue to follow the past pattern of the disease, our forecasts suggest a continuing increase in the confirmed COVID-19 cases with sizable associated uncertainty. The risks are far from symmetric as underestimating its spread like a pandemic and not doing enough to contain it is much more severe than overspending and being over careful when it will not be needed. This paper describes the timeline of a live forecasting exercise with massive potential implications for planning and decision making and provides objective forecasts for the confirmed cases of COVID-19.",30.723009850051387,13.737406358036631

This may be a good clue for early diagnosis in the future. Case 2 developed a fever a few days after the CT findings, suggesting a delay in symptom development in these patients. During the earlier days of the outbreak, there had been limitations in both capacity and turnaround time for the nucleic acid test, which had further caused delay in confirming the diagnosis of COVID-19 7 in many patients. It seems that the time for the early lung lesions or COVID-19 to become severe enough to cause clinical symptoms is rather long. Even among patients with fever, the typically used pharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction test may be negative, owing to the absence of viruses in the upper respiratory tract despite the presence of pneumonia. However, radiographic changes can occur early (chest CT scan is mostly employed in the People's Republic of China during the current outbreak). Therefore, during an epidemic season, it is prudent to carefully evaluate any lung infiltration for GGO, and an appropriate serology test must be performed to rule out potential infection. 7 These two incidents also typify a common scenario during the earlier phase of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, during which a significant number of health care providers became infected in hospitals in Wuhan, and patients in a same room were cross-infected, as they were exposed to unknown transmission sources. Because of this, it is important to practice ""universal precaution"" in surgical pathology laboratories and regard all fresh specimens as potentially infectious. In the People's Republic of China, most surgical specimens are received already fixed in formalin. However, for larger specimens, the center of a specimen may not be sufficiently fixed and still pose potential risk for infection. Therefore, proper personal protective equipment with surgical masks or N95 respirators is worn all the time in the gross room.

Notably, these observations in COVID-19 patients are similar to those who suffered from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during the 2003 epidemic. There may be a biological mechanism behind this epidemiological anomaly. 17 Several kinds of vaccines and antiviral drugs that are based on S protein have been previously evaluated. Du et al. showed vaccines can be based on the S protein include full-length S protein, viral vector, DNA, recombinant S protein and recombinant RBD protein. Considering that, in the in vitro study, antiviral therapies are design based on S protein include RBDeACE2 blockers, S cleavage inhibitors, fusion core blockers, neutralizing antibodies, protease inhibitors, S protein inhibitors, and small interfering RNAs. 18 There are some recombinant compounds such as IFN with ribaverin which has only limited effects against COVID-19 infection. 1 The receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 has a higher affinity for ACE2, while it is a lower affinity for SARS-CoV. 1, 19 Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and its homologue ACE2, belongs to the ACE family of dipeptidylcarboxy dipeptidase. However, their physiological functions are varied. On the other hand, ACE2 serves as the binding site for COVID-19.

Human Betacoronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV) have many similarities, but also have differences in their genomic and phenotypic structure that can influence their pathogenesis. COVID-19 is containing singlestranded (positive-sense) RNA associated with a nucleoprotein within a capsid comprised of matrix protein. A typical CoV contains at least six ORFs in its genome. All the structural and accessory proteins are translated from the sgRNAs of CoVs. Four main structural proteins are encoded by ORFs 10, 11 on the one-third of the genome near the 3 0 -terminus. The genetic and phenotypic structure of COVID-19 in pathogenesis is important.

The arrangement of nucleocapsid protein (N), envelope protein(E), and membrane protein (M) among betacoronaviruses are different as depicted in Fig. 3. 9 The role of replication process in pathogenicity SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) binds to ACE2 (the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2) by its Spike and allows COVID-19 to enter and infect cells. In order for the virus to complete entry into the cell following this initial process, the spike protein has to be primed by an enzyme called a protease. Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) uses a protease called TMPRSS2 to complete this process. 10, 11 In order to attach virus receptor (spike protein) to its cellular ligand (ACE2), activation by TMPRSS2 as a protease is needed (Fig. 4) . 10 After the virus enters the host cell and uncoats, the genome is transcribed and then translated. Coronavirus genome replication and transcription takes place at cytoplasmic membranes and involve coordinated processes of both continuous and discontinuous RNA synthesis that are mediated by the viral replicate, a huge protein complex encoded by the 20-kb replicase gene. 12 The replicase complex is believed to be comprised of up to 16 viral subunits and a number of cellular proteins. Besides RNAdependent RNA polymerase, RNA helicase, and protease activities, which are common to RNA viruses, the coronavirus replicase was recently predicted to employ a variety of RNA processing enzymes that are not (or extremely rarely) found in other RNA viruses and include putative sequence-specific endoribonuclease, 3 0 -to-5 0 exoribonuclease, 2 0 -O-ribose methyltransferase, ADP ribose 1 0 -phosphatase and, in a subset of group 2 coronaviruses, cyclic Genotype and phenotype of COVID- 19 3 phosphodiesterase activities. 13, 14 The proteins are assembled at the cell membrane and genomic RNA is incorporated as the mature particle forms by budding from the internal cell membranes. 15",25.01244337119651,9.307894806219114

Radiotherapy is delivered to nearly 50% of cancer patients, a particularly vulnerable group given their older age, frequent comorbidities, and underlying cancer diagnosis. 2 Prostate cancer is frequently treated with radiation and the most common solid tumor in men; it is a heterogeneous disease where timely therapy is indicated for some cases, and where watchful waiting, active surveillance, or deferral of treatment could be acceptable for others. 3, 4 Given the current epidemic crisis, delaying radiotherapy treatment (which requires multiple visits to healthcare facilities) for prostate cancer patients may potentially reduce the risk of iatrogenic exposure to COVID-19. At the healthcare system level, when clinically appropriate, reducing visits conserves limited hospital resources (e.g. personal protective equipment (PPE)) for use by health-care workers who will have to care for the potentially vast number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The decision to delay life-saving cancer treatment in a time of a resource-intensive pandemic represents a clinical conundrum without modern precedent. In these exigent circumstances, guidelines as to how to manage patients who present with prostate cancer would be valuable for the practicing clinician. This manuscript attempts guidance based on rapid expert opinion as to how to manage prostate cancer patients requiring radiotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic.",30.101108293269576,12.771606527951434

Respiratory droplets and contact are the main routes of transmission of COVID-19 [2] . However, the fetal-oral routes may also be a potential human-to-human transmission [3, 4] . Admittedly, recent studies have reported the detection of the virus (SARS-COV-2) in feces [4] [5] [6] . SARS-COV-2 infects human cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [7] , and the expression of ACE2 in the small intestine is significantly higher than that in the lung [8] . In theory, the intestine is the target organ for SARS-COV-2 infection. In fact, diarrhea as a bowel symptom is not rare in COVID-19 patients. Although the occurrence of diarrhea is not as high as that of fever and cough, it may be the first symptom of COVID-19. Here, we summarized the occurrence of diarrhea that are currently publicly available (Table 1) . A total of 2506 COVID-19 patients were included, of which 145 had diarrhea before admission and the overall occurrence of diarrhea was 5.8% (145/2506). In our own data, the occurrence of diarrhea is 6.3% (4/64) (not yet published). Differential occurrence of diarrhea across studies may be due to different criteria for determining diarrhea. Another possible reason is that the patient's bowel movements were not listed as the focus of observation. In general, diarrhea is not a common symptom in patients with COVID-19. More attention is needed because diarrhea is a reminder that SARS-COV-2 invades the intestine. In autopsy reports of patients with COVID-19, staged narrowing and expansion of the small intestine may be a more intuitive warning [9] . Future research should focus on how long SARS-COV-2 persists in the feces of COVID-19 patients with diarrhea. This helps to better manage discharged patients and to properly dispose of the patients' feces, thereby avoiding potential sources of SARS-COV-2. Clinicians, especially digestive physicians, should pay close attention to the atypical symptoms of COVID-19 and take personal protection against the feces of patients. When discharged from home, patients with COVID-19 should pay special attention to hand hygiene and avoid sharing toilets with family members.

Radiologically, COVID-19 is characterised by multifocal ground-glass opacities, even for patients with mild disease. 3 Knowledge of virus dynamics and host response are essential for formulating strategies for antiviral treatment, vaccination, and epidemiological control of COVID-19. However, a systematic study on these aspects has not been done. In The Lancet Infectious Diseases, Kelvin To and colleagues 4 report the viral load and antibody profiles of a cohort of 23 patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. In these patients, the viral load peaked during the first week of illness then gradually declined over the second week. Viral load was also shown to correlate with age. Furthermore, both IgG and IgM antibodies started to increase on around day 10 after symptom onset, and most patients had seroconversion within the first 3 weeks.

At present, there are no specific antiviral drugs or vaccine against COVID-19 infection for potential therapy of humans. The only option available is using broad-spectrum antiviral drugs like Nucleoside analogues and also HIV-protease inhibitors that could attenuate virus infection until the specific antiviral becomes available [7] . The treatment that have so far been attempted showed that 75 patients were administrated existing antiviral drugs. The course of treatment included twice a day oral administration of 75 mg oseltamivir, 500 mg lopinavir, 500 mg ritonavir and the intravenous administration of 0·25 g ganciclovir for 3-14 days [26] . Another report showed that the broad-spectrum antiviral remdesivir and chloroquine are highly effective in the control of 2019-nCoV infection in vitro. These antiviral compounds have been used in human patients with a safety track record. Thus, these therapeutic agents can be considered to treat COVID-19 infection [27] . Furthermore, there are a number of other compounds that are in development. These include the clinical candidate EIDD-2801 compound that has shown high therapeutic potential aganist seasonal and pandemic influenza virus infections and this represents another potential drug to be considered for the treatment of COVID-19 infection [28] . Along those lines, until more specific therapeutics become available, it is reasonable to consider more broad-spectrum antivirals that provide drug treatment options for COVID-19 infection include Lopinavir/Ritonavir, Neuraminidase inhibitors, peptide (EK1), RNA synthesis inhibitors. It is clear however, that more research is urgently needed to identify novel chemotherapeutic drugs for treating COVID-19 infections. In order to develop pre-and post-exposure prophylaxis against COVID-19, there is an urgent need to establish an animal model to replicate the severe disease currently observed in humans.

Efforts have been made to search for a reservoir host or intermediate carriers from which the infection may have spread to humans. Initial reports identified two species of snakes that could be a possible reservoir of the COVID-19. However, to date, there has been no consistent evidence of coronavirus reservoirs other than mammals and birds [10, 18] . Genomic sequence analysis of COVID-19 showed 88% identity with two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses [19, 20] , indicating that mammals are the most likely link between COVID-19 and humans. Several reports have suggested that person-to-person transmission is a likely route for spreading COVID-19 infection. This is supported by cases that occurred within families and among people who did not visit the wet animal market in Wuhan [13, 21] . Person-to-person transmission occurs primarily via direct contact or through droplets spread by coughing or sneezing from an infected individual. In a small study conducted on women in their third trimester who were confirmed to be infected with the coronavirus, there was no evidence that there is transmission from mother to child. However, all pregnant mothers underwent cesarean sections, so it remains unclear whether transmission can occur during vaginal birth. This is important because pregnant mothers are relatively more susceptible to infection by respiratory pathogens and severe pneumonia (https://www.thelancet.com, DOI:https://doi.org/10. 1016/S0140-6736(20)30360-3).",28.72144406111262,11.845871966828183

The COVID-19 most likely developed from bat origin coronaviruses. Another piece of evidence that supports the COVID-19 is of bat origin is the existence of a high degree of homology of the ACE2 receptor from a diversity of animal species, thus implicating these animal species as possible intermediate hosts or animal models for COVID-19 infections [20] . Moreover, these viruses have a single intact open reading frame on gene 8, which is a further indicator of bat-origin CoVs.

Such problems have occurred as recently as last year, when outbreaks of typhus, hepatitis A, tuberculosis, trench fever, and Shigella bacteria were reported among people experiencing homelessness in US cities with large homeless populations. 7 There are some additional issues, which are unique to people experiencing homelessness, to consider with regards to COVID-19. Homeless populations might be more transient and geographically mobile than individuals in the general population, 8 making it difficult to track and prevent transmission and to treat those who need care. COVID-19 was recently found to be transmittable via the oral-faecal route. 9 Some major US cities with large homeless populations, like San Francisco, have experienced issues with public defecation, which might pose an additional transmission risk for people experiencing homelessness and other individuals. Together, the multitude of potential vulnerabilities and risks for people experiencing homelessness in becoming infected, needing care, and transmitting COVID-19 cannot be ignored and must be planned for. Some lessons can be learned from the response to severe acute respiratory syndrome among homeless service providers nearly two decades ago. 10 Testing kits and training on how to recognise COVID-19 should be widely disseminated to homeless service providers and deployed in shelters, encampments, and street outreach.

In lockdowns, public spaces are closed, movement outside homes are restricted, and major roads of transport might be closed, all of which might negatively affect people experiencing homelessness. It is unclear how and where unsheltered people experiencing homelessness will be moved to if quarantines and lockdowns are implemented. In such a scenario, closures of shelters and other high-density communal settings (eg, drop-in centres and soup kitchens) are possible, which could increase the number of unsheltered people experiencing homelessness and reduce their access to needed services. Lockdowns and disease containment procedures might also be deleterious to the mental health of people experiencing homelessness, many of whom have fears around involuntary hospitalisation and incarceration. 11 In response to COVID-19, the State of Washington has declared a state of emergency, allowing cities to take extraordinary measures, which has included King County moving people infected with COVID-19 to housing units that were originally intended to provide housing for people experiencing homelessness. 12 As other cities follow suit, these actions might further displace people experiencing homelessness and put them at greater risk of COVID-19. Another complicating matter is that in December, 2019, the US Supreme Court declined to review the case of Martin v City of Boise, upholding a ruling that cities cannot arrest or punish people for sleeping on public property unless cities have provided adequate and accessible indoor accommodations. This legal precedent prevents the criminalisation of homelessness, but it is unclear if and how it will be applied during COVID-19 outbreaks.",39.08657921553293,14.549924444856481

It is important to mention here that although the cerebral damage may complicate a COVID-19 infection, it appears that it is the widespread dysregulation of homeostasis caused by pulmonary, renal, cardiac, and circulatory damage that proves fatal in COIVD-19 patients. With that being said, a dominant cerebral involvement alone with the potential of causing cerebral edema in COVID-19 can take a lead in causing death long before systemic homeostatic dysregulation sets in. Access of the COVID-19 virus to the brain via the transcribrial route, as described previously for other CNS targeting pathogens, 7 could have been the case in a recently reported patient with hyposmia and the cases of acute respiratory failure in COVID-19, 5 which needs to be further elucidated by isolating the SARS-CoV-2 virus from the zones that are in proximity to the olfactory bulb. It is expected that the differences in the sequence of spike proteins between COVID-19 virus and SARS-CoV ( Figure 2A ) will enable scientists to identify epitopes in COVID-19 virus for the development of monoclonal antibodies against this virus. With the recent COVID-19 outbreak, there is an urgent need to understand the neurotropic potential of the COVID-19 virus in order to prioritize and individualize the treatment protocols based on the severity of the disease and predominant organ involvement.

Evidence of the Distribution of ACE2 in the Human Brain. The brain has been reported to express ACE2 receptors ( Figure 1A , C) that have been detected over glial cells and neurons, which makes them a potential target of COVID-19. Previous studies have shown the ability of SARS-CoV to cause neuronal death in mice by invading the brain via the nose close to the olfactory epithelium. 3 The contribution of the neurotropic potential of SARS-CoV-2 in patients reported in the recent outbreak of COVID-19 remains to be established. In the SARS-CoV infections that were reported in the past, autopsy findings of the patients have shown strong evidence of the presence of SARS-CoV by electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and real-time reverse transcription-PCR 3 . Patients with acute SARS-CoV illness have also demonstrated the presence of the virus in cerebrospinal fluid. The role of the blood-brain barrier in containing the virus and preventing it from gaining access to the neural tissues needs to be further explored in patients diagnosed with COVID-19.

Finally, we recommend that patients in the remission phase having maintenance chemotherapy delay treatment for no more than 14 days. This increase in the maximum delay before chemotherapy strikes a balance between the potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and tumour recurrence, since paediatric patients in this phase of treatment have a reduced risk of tumour recurrence.

Notably, analyses using UK clinical data from the 1957 Asian influenza pandemic suggest that school closures would reduce the epidemic size by less than 10% when the R was similar to that of COVID-19 (ie, 2·5-3·5). 48 Reviews also note that the benefits of school closure might be less than what have been assumed or modelled, as social contacts between children and between children and adults continue as part of informal childcare and non-school gatherings of children and young people. 11 This conclusion is a particular concern for COVID-19, with its higher mortality among older people, as around 40% of the UK's grandparents provide regular childcare for their grandchildren. 49 The WHO Director-General noted on March 12, 2020, that ""all countries must strike a fine balance between protecting health, preventing economic and social disruption, and respecting human rights"". 1 Currently, the evidence to support national closure of schools to combat COVID-19 is very weak and data from influenza outbreaks suggest that school closures could have relatively small effects on a virus with COVID-19's high transmissibility and apparent low clinical effect on school children.

Patients who test positive for the novel coronavirus will, at a minimum, require a 14-day quarantine per CDC recommendations. 15 At the other end of the spectrum, cancer patients with immunosuppression may require hospitalization and isolation precautions, thereby preventing the continuation of radiation treatments. Data from a report of the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 showed that 6.1% of patients required intensive care, mechanical ventilation or died. 16 Although it is yet unclear how the virus will behave in the US, the situations in China and Italy suggest the burden on hospitals and intensive care units will be significant. Additionally, this study demonstrated that pneumonia and lymphocytopenia were prominent at 91.1% and 83.2%, respectively, which would impact decisions to hold off on treatments pending improvements in the patient's clinical status and immune recovery. 16 These treatment interruptions would be of utmost concern in tumors for which treatment package time significantly impacts outcomes such as head and neck and cervical tumors. 17, 18 However, this is also of concern in lung tumors and other thoracic tumors, for both tumor control and the lungs potentially lying in the path of treatment beams. Treatments would likely need to be paused while monitoring the course of COVID-19 in this setting. Treatment delays may also be due strains on the healthcare system in the setting of a pandemic due to travel restrictions, availability of workforce, and/or lack of access to hospital care. 19 If possible, travel restrictions for the general public should be tailored for patients with cancer, such as being done currently in Italy. 20 Little data exists currently to guide radiation treatment decisions in the setting of a pandemic. However, we may borrow insight from the response of Radiation Oncology clinics during Hurricane Maria. As per Gay et al, mitigating the impact of a natural disaster on cancer patients requires 4 components or ""PCOC"": prepare, communicate, operate, compensate. 21 In preparing, consideration should be made for scenarios which may require delayed treatment starts, or shorter fractionation regimens (i.e. hypofractionation), given that COVID-19 poses a substantial immediate risk for elderly patients. Again, there is a paucity of data to guide these decisions and priority should be given to higher risk tumors (H&N, Cervix, Lung, etc.), which are nicely referenced in the Hurricane Maria review.

Some of the actions taken by the scientists and the government under this extreme situation may have a long-term influence and shift our future research and funding paradigm. We anticipate that their perspectives will be valuable to the community. global lifethreatening concern in recent days. The war against COVID-19 there has now reached the most critical moment, as confirmed COVID-19 cases have peaked for several days, and almost all the people in Wuhan City have been screened for suspected case identification (as of late February). We cannot imagine how people there are sacrificing to control the spread of COVID-19. As alumni of Wuhan University that is located in the center of Wuhan city, we became deeply saddened and worried as we watched the entire city cope with an unprecedented emergency situation. We wanted to provide a glimpse of what chemical biologists have been working on, from the perspective of scientists in China. In the past 40 days, we have heard more stories of hope and resilience than of worry and grief in China, where 1.4 billion people are doing their best to bring this serious outbreak under control. Right now, the epidemic situation outside Hubei is gradually improving, and the situation inside Hubei has shown signs of stabilization. It is noteworthy that although it is mandated that most people have to stay at home as a quarantine procedure, scientists in China have been increasingly devoted to combating COVID-19, with several clinical trials currently underway. As for scientists throughout the world, researchers in China are making extraordinary efforts toward rapid advancement of diagnostic and treatment approaches, and are doing so under highly challenging personal circumstances with extensive restrictions on not only travel, but day-to-day activities. As mentioned by WHO officers, Chinese scientists have been extremely professional in the face of this epidemic and have made their findings rapidly available to researchers around the world to coordinate global efforts to characterize, treat, and mitigate the spread of COVID-19. One team led by Yongzhen Zhang from Fudan University completed the deep sequencing of COVID-19 and made its whole genome sequence publicly available on January 10, 2020. 1 Medical experts, virologists, structural biologists, and medicinal chemists have made significant contributions in areas such as epidemic prevention and control, patient treatment, virus classification and traceability, structure analysis, and clinical drug development. The current progress relied on the rapid development of science and technology, as well as the dedication of scientific researchers. During the epidemic, almost all industries not related to any antiepidemic efforts were halted due to the lock down of transportation and lack of manpower. It has been extremely difficult to complete highlevel scientific research under such an extreme situation.",34.35525089277747,13.513692962337265

At the national and international level, travel restrictions have been implemented for regions with the highest COVID-19 incidence currently, but these recommendations and polices are likely to rapidly change and warrant close monitoring. Patients with potential symptoms of COVID-19 with recent travel to areas of higher incidence (China, South Korea, Japan, Iran, and Italy based on the most recent CDC data) should be asked to wear a standard surgical mask as soon as they are identified and be placed in a private room with the door closed, ideally an airborne isolation room (negative-pressure room). 3, 7 It is important to note that travel history criteria for testing for COVID-19 will change as community-based spread is emerging within the United States and patients living in or with recent travel to areas where COVID-19 has been confirmed should be considered for testing as well. Any concern for possible COVID-19 should immediately prompt notification of institutional infection prevention and control as well as local or state health departments. Healthcare personnel entering the room should use standard precautions, contact precautions (gown and gloves), airborne precautions (with N95 respirator), and eye protection (goggles or a face shield). Testing has been performed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) but is now more widely available in state and city laboratories and is becoming available commercially. It is important that more common respiratory illnesses (influenza, etc.) are also ruled out. What should we tell our patients based on our current knowledge? First, this is a rapidly evolving area with new information emerging on a daily basis. Therefore periodically checking on recommendations from leading national and international health organizations, such as the CDC or the World Health Organization (WHO), is the most important way for both patients and physicians to stay informed with accurate information. Second, it is important to realize that the majority of cases (80+%) have been mild, the fatality rate for COVID-19 is lower than prior coronavirus outbreaks, and the proportion of severe/fatal cases may be an overestimate as milder or asymptomatic cases are likely under-reported. 15 Third, there are currently no specific recommendations for people on immunosuppression, such as IBD patients. Prior IBD research has found that viral infections are more likely among patients on immunomodulators (such as 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine) than those on biologics but it is unclear if this can be extended to COVID-19. 16 There are no data currently about the impact of immunosuppressive agents, although one of the largest case series from China did note that 2 patients with immunodeficiency (not further specified) had non-severe disease. 8 17 Last, the best measures to decrease the risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 are the same as standard practices against any viral illness. These include good hand hygiene with alcohol-based hand sanitizers or soap and water, covering your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing, limiting touching your face, avoiding close contact with anyone with influenza-like and/or upper respiratory symptoms, and staying home if you are sick.",29.50936440657397,13.984840740867325

Both cause major infection-related morbidity and mortality around the world. Tuberculosis was the leading cause of mortality from an infectious disease worldwide in 2018, causing 1·2 million deaths. 1 COVID-19 has infected more than 300 000 people and caused over 13 000 deaths in the first quarter of 2020 alone. 2 Both COVID-19 and tuberculosis can present with respiratory symptoms, and diagnosis and treatment of people with tuberculosis, or tuberculosis and COVID-19 co-infection, are likely to be compromised during the COVID-19 pandemic. Older people and those with comorbidities are at increased risk of severe disease and adverse outcomes in both diseases. 3, 4 And, as we are discovering for COVID-19, both diseases have considerable social impact-including stigma, discrimination, and isolation-in addition to the economic impact from country productivity losses and catastrophic costs to individuals and households. 5 There are also stark differences. While tuberculosis is a slow pandemic and has accompanied humankind for millennia, 6 the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19 is new and spreading rapidly around the world. Tuberculosis has been labelled a pandemic many times over the past three centuries, whereas this is the first COVID-19 pandemic. Children are less severely affected by COVID-19, whereas 1·1 million children had tuberculosis disease in 2018, of whom 200 000 died. 1 The vast majority of cases and deaths from tuberculosis occur in low-income and middle-income countries, whereas high-income countries have low rates. 1 By contrast, Europe became the second epicentre of COVID-19 after China, which might explain, in part, why COVID-19 can be expected to mobilise more global resources and person-power in a year than tuberculosis has in decades. However, underprepared and vulnerable countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Central and South America might soon see substantial rises in COVID-19 cases and deaths, and concerted, collective action must be taken now to avoid catastrophe. 7 There are many unknowns. The clinical and epidemiological interactions of COVID-19 with tuberculosis (with or without HIV) are likely to be highly complex. Simply put, tuberculosis transmission might rise because of increased respiratory symptoms associated with COVID-19, or decline owing to COVID-19-related self-isolation and quarantine. There is increasing recognition of the millions of people treated for tuberculosis who have residual, long-term lung damage 8 who are likely to be at a higher risk of severe disease and death from COVID-19. Because of extreme pressures on health systems, exacerbated by COVID-19, people with tuberculosis are likely to face decreased access to diagnostic and treatment services, which might also result in adverse outcomes.",45.73464844514262,18.502229456715444

First, collectively, Africa needs a unified continent-wide strategy for preparedness and response. The strategy must be comprehensive, and member states, donors, and partners should immediately commit to releasing financial resources to support country-customised implementation plans derived from the strategy. To help develop a common strategy that will allow for effective coordination, collaboration, and communication, the African Union Commission, Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), and WHO, in partnership with African countries, have established the Africa Taskforce for Coronavirus Preparedness and Response (AFTCOR). The partnership has six work streams: laboratory diagnosis and subtyping; surveillance, including screening at points of entry and cross-border activities; infection prevention and control in healthcare facilities; clinical management of people with severe COVID-19; risk communication; and supply-chain management and stockpiles. Because mitigating the potential spread of COVID-19 in Africa will require rapid detection and containment, the laboratory work streams of AFTCOR, Africa CDC, and WHO are working closely to expeditiously scale up diagnostic testing capacity linked to enhanced surveillance and monitoring-eg, at the beginning of February, only two countries in Africa had the diagnostic capacity to test for COVID-19. However, as of Feb 25, 2020, more than 40 countries would have been capacitated to accurately diagnose COVID-19 infection, thanks to the coordination efforts of AFTCOR. 6 As testing becomes more available, it is possible that more cases might be detected. Second, any effective preparedness and response strategy for COVID-19 requires a committed political will; as such, the African Union Commission, Africa CDC, and WHO convened, on Feb 22, 2020, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, an emergency meeting of all ministers of health of 55 member states to commit to acting fast and collectively to develop and implement a coordinated continent-wide strategy. AFTCOR taskforce was formed, and a continent-wide strategy was endorsed at the end of the emergency meeting, with a call for strong coordination of efforts. To prevent the occurrence of a social, health security, and economic tragedy, actions agreed at the emergency ministerial meeting will need to be acted on quickly, before any additional COVID-19 cases are introduced to the continent, and result in sustained human-tohuman transmission. The potential social, economic, and security devastation that COVID-19 could cause in Africa should be enough of an incentive for African governments to invest immediately in preparedness for the worst-case scenario. Third, commitment and release of financial resources from partners and donors before a crisis hits Africa will help anticipate demand and address supply chain management, mapping, and stockpiling of COVID-19 response needs, such as large quantities of personal protective equipment, gloves, surgical masks, coveralls, and hoods, and medical countermeasures like antiviral agents. Supplies of these items will be limited in Africa because of reduced manufacturing capacity.",36.05683710508613,14.992544766431788

COVID-19, like tuberculosis, will almost certainly be associated with the medical poverty trap, in which poorer people have a higher likelihood of infection, disease, and adverse outcomes. Moreover, unemployed populations and informal or so-called zero-hours contract workers will experience further impoverishment, which increases risk of tuberculosis. 5 Amid the expanding COVID-19 pandemic, our plea on World Tuberculosis Day is that we do not forget the tuberculosis pandemic, which, at present, is still the leading cause of infectious disease mortality. We need to continue to mobilise funding for research for better tuberculosis diagnostics, vaccine development, novel therapeutics, equitable access to care, and innovative social protection interventions for tuberculosis-affected households. 5 We should drastically increase and sustain investment in health systems that are responsive to the needs of the poor and resilient to the threat of infections, especially those that are air-borne and require isolation facilities.

Preventive measures for COVID-19, including case and contact tracing, quarantine and screening, as well as education to encourage good hand hygiene practices, should be in place. Additional and pre-emptive measures must be taken for malaria control in these countries, anticipating the potential challenge that would be faced by the public health system during an outbreak of COVID-19. In the case of Ebola, it was estimated that malaria cases in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone could have increased by up to 1 million in 2014 as a result of a cessation of distribution of insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs). 10 Governments and health leaders in malaria-endemic regions must ensure that such stresses to medical infrastructure are minimised in the event of an outbreak of COVID-19. Resource allocation should be optimised whenever possible to ensure minimal disruption to malaria control should COVID-19 management become necessary. Management of medical supplies and stockpiling of surgical masks and other protective equipment should be done in advance and medical staff should be adequately trained in their use. In cases of emergency, mass drug administration and the distribution of ITNs might be considered for short-term malaria relief in hyperendemic areas. Such measures would also aid efforts in COVID-19 management by reducing the strain on medical resources and minimising confounding factors in diagnosis.

Mass Casualty Incident Planning Coronavirus Outbreak, is Radiology Ready? Mass Casualty Incident Planning","In late December 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) was announced in Wuhan, China 3 . Although rigorous attempts were made to confine the disease, this infection has continued to spread throughout the world. At the date of this publication, there are confirmed COVID-19 cases in 162 countries worldwide with growing concern that the infection will quickly reach pandemic proportions. As per Bruce Aylward, head of a World Health Organization (WHO) expert mission to China, the world is ""simply not ready"" to contain this outbreak. 4 China's extraordinary measure of instituting a quarantine in Wuhan and surrounding areas afforded the world a few months of lead time to prepare. However, according to the Dr. Tom Frieden who is the former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a coronavirus pandemic is inevitable. 5 The number of confirmed cases and patient deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have already exceeded those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS). 6 Healthcare systems worldwide should be prepared for an unusually high volume of patients in the next few months. This will include patients with COVID-19 in addition to patients requiring emergent care for other illnesses. Rapid diagnosis is essential for efficient patient triage. The RT-PCR test kits disseminated by the CDC are considered the gold of standard for COVID-19 diagnosis 7 , but several studies have shown that a negative initial PCR does not exclude COVID-19 infection 8, 9 . Additionally, it may take up to 48 hours to receive the final results, which limits the utility of this diagnostic test during initial triage of these patients in the emergency setting. In a recent study published in Radiology, based on a retrospective study of 1014 patients, the diagnostic sensitivity of chest CT for COVID-19 is significantly greater than that of RT-PCR (98% vs 59%), but the specificity is limited (25%) 7 . Proposed explanations for the decreased sensitivity of RT-PCR include low viral load, immature development of RT-PCR technology, and suboptimal clinical sampling. This study concluded that chest CT can be used as a screening tool for COVID-19 in cases with a high pretest probability, as evidenced by patients demonstrating clinical manifestations compatible with COVID-19 infection. Therefore, it is expected that there will be a significant interest in increasing in the number of imaging studies ordered for suspected cases of COVID-19 from both Emergency Medicine Department and Inpatient services. Given the low specificity of CT for diagnosing COVID-19, the American College of Radiology (ACR) does not recommend the use of CT for screening or as a first-line test for diagnosing COVID-19. 10",30.43340193309909,12.49584618188425

It is mandatory, especially in a finite resource system, to balance the potential benefit of containment measures, such as postponing scheduled procedures, with negative health and social costs. Diverting the attention exclusively to the COVID-19 situation and overshadowing the everyday clinical practice may have substantial negative implications, especially for cancer patients. Re-allocating an excessive amount of health care personnel, both nurses and doctors, to the COVID-19 triage and management may stretch an already fragile system and potentially leave uncovered some vital activities, such as treatment administration, surgeries and inpatient assistance. It is well established that delayed oncologic surgery may lead to disease progressions and result in tumors no longer resectable, leading to worse survival outcomes. The same goes for neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy regimens administered with suboptimal timing. It should be emphasized that we are talking about patients potentially cured by oncologic treatments. Therefore, any delay of these fundamental procedures, either intentional or due to shortage of personnel, should be avoided. The same risk is present for the people who have scheduled screening activities (e.g. screening mammography for the early diagnosis of breast cancer). People should be advised to maintain their scheduled appointments, if the procedure is feasible safely, or at least to promptly reschedule their appointment when the epidemic is expected to slow its pace. For patients with advanced disease, as oncologists we know the enormous negative impact from disease progression in terms of both survival time and quality of life. The inability to deliver palliative care to patients unable to move from their homes and the management of treatment side-effects are other significant concerns from a forced quarantine. 5 Patients with advanced disease, and no suggestive symptoms of COVID-19, should keep receiving planned chemotherapy or radiotherapy treatment, without unnecessary delays.

Some studies suggest a high rate of AKI events upon COVID-19 infection, whereas a recent study from Wuhan, China, reported that AKI happened in <5% of the hospitalized patients with this viral infection. 11 As more studies are underway, it is prudent that during an active COVID-19 we ensure the mitigation of PEW risk and immediate correction of PEW in all patients with kidney diseases including transplant recipients. We encourage adequate protein and calorie intake, be it enterally or parenterally, so that any occurrence of hypokalemia or hypophosphatemia can be avoided and that PEW, sarcopenia and cachexia can be prevented or immediately corrected. 12 In the midst of this serious infection there is no role for delaying nutrition support or for low protein, low phosphorus, or low potassium regimens if the patient has COVID-19 infection. 13 Therefore, the need to supervise the nutrition regimens of patients with kidney diseases may be enhanced during this period and should not be ignored while focusing on other, seemingly more urgent, matters.

The challenge is even greater in patients with diabetic and hypertensive kidney disorders or proteinuric patients, since many of them have received ACE inhibitors or ARB agents.

This procedure might avoid the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation because it provides high concentrations of humidified oxygen, low levels of positive endexpiratory pressure, and can facilitate the elimination of carbon dioxide. 4 WHO guidelines support the use of high-flow nasal oxygen in some patients, but they urge close monitoring for clinical deterioration that could result in the need for emergent intubations because such procedures might increase the risk of infection to health-care workers. 5 For patients with COVID-19 who require endotracheal intubation, use of low tidal volume (6 mL/kg per predicted bodyweight) with a plateau airway pressure of less than 30 cm H 2 O, and increasing the respiratory rate to 35 breaths per min as needed, is the mainstay of lungprotective ventilation. If the hypoxaemia progresses to a PaO 2 :FiO 2 ratio of less than 100-150 mm Hg, there are several therapeutic options. The level of positive endexpiratory pressure can be increased by 2-3 cm H 2 O every 15-30 min to improve oxygen saturation to 88-90%, with the goal of maintaining a plateau airway pressure of less than 30 cm H 2 O. Lower driving pressures (plateau airway pressure minus positive end-expiratory pressure) with a target of 13-15 cm H 2 O can also be used. If the patient is not responding to adjustment of the level of positive end-expiratory pressure, additional strategies might stabilise them. Recruitment manoeuvres probably have little value, 6 prone positioning should be instituted, unless there is a specific contraindication, and can be initiated along with the interventions already described. For persistent refractory hypoxaemia even with prone positioning, neuromuscular blockade, and efforts to optimise positive end-expiratory pressure therapy, there are additional options. Inhaled 5-20 ppm NO might improve oxygenation. Insertion of an oesophageal balloon to measure transpulmonary pressures to set an optimal positive end-expiratory pressure can be considered in patients with moderate-to-severe obesity, although a 2019 trial in patients with ARDS did not show the benefit of this procedure in most patients. 7 Fluid management is important to consider as a measure to reduce pulmonary oedema. 8 In the absence of shock, fluid conservative therapy is recommended to achieve a negative fluid balance of 0·5 to 1·0 L per day. In the presence of shock, fluid balance might be achieved with renal replacement therapy, especially if there is associated acute kidney injury and oliguria. Antibiotics should be considered since secondary bacterial infections have been reported in patients with COVID-19. 9 Glucocorticoids should be avoided in view of the evidence that they can be harmful in cases of viral pneumonia and ARDS from influenza. 10 Rescue therapy with high-dose vitamin C can also be considered. 11 Finally, ECMO should be considered using the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the EOLIA trial. 3 Since treatment of severe ARDS from COVID-19 is an ongoing challenge, it is important to learn from the patients who have been treated to gain an understanding of the disease's epidemiology, biological mechanisms, and the effects of new pharmacological interventions. Currently, there are some research groups working to coordinate and disseminate key information, including information on patients who have been treated with ECMO for COVID-19, although an accurate estimate of the number of such patients is not currently available.

Unfortunately, multiple studies have shown that patients with underlying cardiovascular comorbidities, such as hypertension and coronary artery disease, are more likely to suffer from a severe COVID-19 infection that requires ICU care, have complications like ARDS, which in turn may result in death [27] [28] [29] 32, 40] . One study showed that patients infected with COVID-19 who had underlying hypertension had increased odds of death (OR 3.05 [95% CI 1.57-5.92, p b .001]) compared to those without hypertension. Similarly, coronary artery disease was associated with increased odds (OR 21.4 [95% CI 4.64-98.7, p b .0001]) of death [40] . In one meta-analysis, COVID-19 patients with hypertension had a relative risk ratio of 2.03 (95% CI 1.54-2.68, p b .00001) of having severe disease/ requiring ICU care compared to those without hypertension. Patients with coronary artery disease/cerebrovascular disease had a relative risk ratio of 3.3 (95% CI 2.03-5.36, p b .00001) of having severe disease/requiring ICU care compared to those without cardiovascular disease [41] . When analyzing the largest case series to date (44,672 confirmed COVID-19 cases), the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that patients with cardiovascular disease had a case fatality rate of 10.5% and those with hypertension had a case fatality rate of 6%, both of which were higher than the overall case fatality rate of 2.3% [39] (Fig. 2) . Patients with hypertension accounted for 13% of the COVID-19 cases but they comprised 32% of the COVID-19 deaths. Patients with cardiovascular disease made up 4.2% of the COVID-19 cases, but were responsible for 18.3% of the COVID-19 deaths ( [42] , Fig. 2 ). This may be due to the fact that patients with history of coronary artery disease or acute coronary syndromes may have reduced or impaired cardiovascular functional reserve, and the COVID-19 infection may either precipitate a myocardial infarction (type 1 myocardial infarction), increase myocardial demand leading to worsening ischemia and necrosis (type 2 myocardial infarction), or increase metabolic demand that leads to heart failure and death [43] .",29.146359924133158,11.714559826780793

Results: We included six articles (one narrative letter, one in-vitro study, one editorial, expert consensus paper, two national guideline documents) and 23 ongoing clinical trials in China. Chloroquine seems to be effective in limiting the replication of SARS-CoV-2 (virus causing COVID-19) in vitro. Conclusions: There is rationale, pre-clinical evidence of effectiveness and evidence of safety from long-time clinical use for other indications to justify clinical research on chloroquine in patients with COVID-19.

This preference might be due to the ease of access to CT in China and the lack of requirement for intravenous contrast agent for the examination.

Infectious disease outbreaks such as COVID-19, as well as other public health events, can cause emotional distress and anxiety. These feelings of distress and anxiety can occur even in people not at high risk of getting sick, in the face of a virus with which the common people may be unfamiliar. I read publications on ""Vicarious traumatization in the general public, members, and non-members of medical teams aiding in COVID-19 control"" and on ""Traumatization in medical staff helping with COVID-19 control"" with a great interest (Li et al., 2020; Joob and Wiwanitkit, 2020) . Li et al. reported how much people and medical staff suffer from vicarious traumatization and how this vicarious traumatization of non-front-line medical staff is more serious than that of front-line medical staff (Li et al., 2020) . As in South and Southeast Asia countries, also in Italy, there are similar problems in medical staff due to high workload and intermittent lack of protective devices. In addition, some slight form of racism is demonstrated against health care professionals who potentially have a higher risk of being infected and between non-front-line medical staff towards front-line medical staff. We don't have to forget the many doctors and nurses were infected and many of them died due to COVID-19 infection. Also in Italy, local people also have high levels of stress due to no firm estimate of how long pandemic will last and how long our lives will be disrupted or whether or not we or our loved ones will be infected. Previous research has revealed a profound and wide spectrum of psychological impact that outbreaks can inflict on people (Lima et al., 2020) . New psychiatric symptoms in people without mental illness can occur or aggravate the condition of those with pre-existing mental illness and cause distress to the caregivers of affected individuals (Kelvin and Rubino, 2020) . Most health professionals working in isolation units and hospitals very often do not receive any training for providing mental health care (Lima et al., 2020) . Barbisch et al. (2015) described how the confinement ""caused a sense of collective hysteria, leading the staff to desperate measures"". Suicidal cases were reported in India (Goyal et al., 2020) but also in other countries, Italy included, where two infected Italian nurses committed suicide in a period of a few days probably due to fear of spreading COVID-19 to patients. It is possible that fear and anxiety of falling sick or dying, helplessness will drive an increase in the 2020 suicide rates. In the United States (US), the COVID-19 Pandemic's New Epicenter, a dedicated Lifeline (the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline) was activated for emotional distress related to COVID-19 to prevent suicide.",31.125747855246814,12.049638387570045

Complications (eg, acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS] , arrhythmia, shock, acute cardiac injury, secondary infection, and acute kidney injury) and death may occur in severe cases. [2,5À7] The course of the COVID-19 is long, and COVID-19 is highly contagious even during the incubation period. [8] Furthermore, asymptomatic carrier of SARS-CoV-2, accounting for 1% of the laboratory confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-infection, [9] may potentially transmit the virus during incubation time, [10] which makes the identification and prevention of COVID-19 infection highly challenging. During the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak, we encountered a small number of asymptomatic patients who underwent elective surgeries during the incubation period of COVID-19 infection, but the clinical manifestations and prognosis of these patients were beyond our expectation. It is our belief that these represent a specific surgical patient population that deserves our attention.",29.90173093621813,9.897779771195937

At present we do not know if people with MS are at increased risk acquring SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 or developing severe COVID-19. Individuals with MS are not unique in their requirement to be treated with immunosuppressive therapies. We discussed the COVID-19 epidemic with our renal transplant team who informed us that at present they are not taking any specific action about the levels of immunosuppression for their transplant patients during the epidemic. Basic measures are recommended namely: to improve hand and home hygiene, to avoid highrisk travel and unnecessary contacts, to self-isolate if necessary and to reduce contact with the hospital and other medical institutions as much as possible, because they are more likely to be sources of COVID-19. It is business as usual. Nor are they necessarily halting their transplant programme.

For example, aggressive public health steps to contain the spread of the virus locally may make it relatively safe for a patient to start an immunosuppressive therapy. Our concern is that the COVID-19 pandemic may trigger a large number of neurologists and patients to reconsider treatment strategy and choice of initial DMT and to opt for less effective immunomodulatory DMTs. This change needs to be considered carefully. The COVID-19 pandemic in all likelihood will be short lived and it would be unfair to patients treated during the epidemic to be disadvantaged in the long term regarding the management of their MS. Neurologists have spent an extraordinary amount of time and effort to activate the MS community: to advance the principle that 'time is brain', to treat MS proactively to a target of no evident disease activity (NEDA) and more recently, to flip the pyramid and use higher efficacy treatments first line.

Most transplant patients are on triple immunotherapy, compared to pwMS who are on monotherapy and even then, the level of immunosuppression is generally low. Hence, the mortality/morbidity risk to an individual on a DMT, infected with COVID-19, may be actually quite moderate to low. Another hypothesis being considered is that moderate immunosuppression may prevent severe complications associated with COVID-19 infection. The severe pulmonary complications of COVID-19 infection are consistent with ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) caused by an over-exuberant immune response to the virus (Ramanathan et al., 2020) . As a result, several exploratory trials are currently being undertaken in China and elsewhere using immunosuppressants to try and dampen the immune response to the virus. Interestingly, fingolimod, a S1P modulator licensed for MS, is being tested as a treatment for COVID-19 associated ARDS (continued on next page) G. Giovannoni, et al. Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders xxx (xxxx) xxxx (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04280588). Interferon beta is also being trialled in COVID-19 based on its antiviral properties (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04276688). Then there is the virology to take into account. SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, is a new human pathogen that is likely to have recently crossed species (Andersen et al., 2020) . COVID-19 will eventually become endemic and hence pose a seasonal risk to patients on immunosuppressive therapies. As it is a small RNA virus with low fidelity it is likely to mutate rapidly making a one-off vaccine only a partial solution. Vaccines take time to be developed, tested and introduced at a population level. Delaying treatment, de-escalating therapy by switching to immunomodulatory DMTs, such as interferonbeta, glatiramer acetate or teriflunomide, or interrupting dosing of DMTs to wait for a vaccine will delay the adequate treatment of MS, especially as it may take 12-18 months to develop a vaccine. We, therefore, need a pragmatic response on management of the potential threat of COVID-19 in individuals with MS. If patients have active MS they need to be treated based on the clinical evidence at hand and hence may need to be treated with higher efficacy DMTs. This should be implemented in conjunction with appropriate behavioural modifications to reduce or ideally prevent exposure to the virus.",28.89366367994814,13.047813475516183

Considering the speed of transmission of COVID-19, individuals from vulnerable health systems are at particular risk. An example is the Eastern European countries that in recent years faced health system vulnerabilities due to post-communism delayed reforms, corruption, and the emigration of physicians [3] . Romania is a concerning example of a vulnerable health system [3] with the highest governmental instability within the EU [4] , the leadership of the Romanian Ministry of Health changed 25 times in 27 years, a turnover three times higher than in other EU countries [4] . In its recent history, Romania experienced a series of economic crises (in the 1990s, and in late 2000s) which forced an estimated~5 million people to emigrate, including in countries where currently COVID-19 was identified (especially in Italy, Spain, Germany and United Kingdom). Many of these migrants regularly travel back to Romania which increases the likelihood for COVID-19 to spread [1] to Romania. Rising public awareness among migrant travelers and providing hygiene products is highly suggested to limit the spread of COVID-19. After the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Romanian Ministry of Health released late January a set of recommendations and proceeded to the acquisition of medical equipment with the purpose of initial identification of travelers that show COVID-19 symptoms [5] . As the Romanian government collapsed on February 5th, 2020, public auctions were suspended and the confusion among population is very high combined with the political instability. As this unstable situation continues how will Romania cope with the spread of the COVID-19 by incoming travelers? Romania has 14 international (out of 16) airports that are highly connected with airports across all EU (in 2019, over 23 million passengers used these airports), including from countries where COVID-19 was already identified in the EU. The vulnerability is even higher considering the high potential of false-negative rate of diagnostic of COVID-19 that already has been documented [6] and the lack of personnel. As such, public awareness, widespread public health measures, and close collaboration with countries from which incoming travelers are arriving in Romania is a key to limit the spread of COVID-19 and promote the wellbeing of travelers and the members of the community (resident or diaspora).",30.864292226395033,13.997394363836802

The ICU capacity increased up to 65 beds in the same time by mobilizing the three ICUs of our centre, as well as surgery theatres. We thus had to discharge all the patients who were not infected with SARS-CoV-2 or to transfer them to other hospitals. As previously reported by some Italian and Chinese colleague, many activities that are not related to COVID-19 had to be stopped in the midst of the epidemic. 8, 9 Despite this, medical staff in the ID department had to be doubled and then tripled night and day to cope with the increase of work and three teams were created: one to manage external calls, one to organise the testing of cases and one to take care of the infected patients. They first managed all the COVID-19 patients of the hospital but then had to let the other departments take care of their infected patients under the supervision of the IPC team.

As of 00:00 on March 6, 2020, approximately 98,332 persons have been infected across the world(NHC, 2020), the figure that has already far exceeded the numbers for SARS in 2003 and MERS in 2012 (Huang et al., 2020; Wong et al., 2015) . Moreover, other than a certain degree of progress in the control and prevention of the epidemic in China, the situations in other countries have deteriorated. Without proper protective measures, COVID-19 may be transmitted through airborne droplets from coughing and sneezing, as well as close contact. Furthermore, air transmission and feces-mouth transmission have not yet been verified, though there are signs that such transmission means are possible (WHO, 2020). As people gain more knowledge about the disease, the prognosis for the majority of patients infected by COVID-19 has been relatively promising, but the prognosis for a small number of patients in critical conditions, especially seniors and patients with chronic diseases, are less optimal (Zhu et al.,2020) . The enclosed management model employed at most psychiatric hospitals represents a daunting challenge for effective control of infectious disease and thwarting outbreaks within institutions. The Fourth People's Hospital of Chengdu is the ninth most influential hospital in terms of scientific research and one of the largest psychiatric medical care centres in southwest China. We propose the following suggestions and strategies for psychiatric hospitals during the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic. At present, COVID-19 symptoms mainly include fever, dry cough, and fatigue, but some infected patients may not show any symptoms. Therefore, preliminary screening, pre-examination and triage, and fever clinic management at psychiatric hospitals are particularly crucial. Medical care staff should earnestly document patient information such as name, gender, age, job, home address details and phone number. In case of possible violent behaviors exhibited by psychiatric patients, security personnel should be garrisoned at clinic zones to maintain order. All staff at the clinic should be equipped with the appropriate protective equipment. Signs should be posted to remind patients to protect their respiratory system and frequently wash hands. During the epidemic period, patients who match critical psychiatric illness standards and who are considered as potential carriers of COVID-19 shall be kept within the infection quarantine ward to receive treatment according to potential virus carrier protocol. For patients who match critical psychiatric illness standards but are not considered as potential carriers of COVID-19, they should be kept within the psychiatric transition and observation ward for 14 days, as per clinic and emergency room protocol, before being transferred to a regular ward when relevant conditions are met.",28.271009794227034,12.218384250971786

The National Health Commission of China revised the diagnostic criteria in the Hubei province, where a severe epidemic occurred (5). A new diagnostic type called “Clinical diagnosis” was set according to the presence of pneumonia on chest CT, regardless of rRT-PCR results. To some extent, CT features and rRT-PCR results were complimentary in the diagnosis of COVID-19. From a clinical perspective, CT features could be utilized as the first and immediate reference for doctors to screen the highly suspected cases and to take necessary actions while rRT-PCR serves as a confirmation tool, the results of which could be utilized later to decide the subsequent action of continuing isolated treatment or discharge. Notably, our hospital was facilitated with a DL-based computer-aided diagnostic system (InferRead CT Pneumonia, Infervision, Beijing, China) for pneumonia, which greatly improved the detection efficiency for patients highly suspected with COVID-19 by alarming the technician within 2 minutes when any suspected cases was found after CT examination. The automatic lesion segmentation on CT was also helpful to evaluate the progression of COVID-19 quantitatively.

The team conducted a series of risk assessments following the report of “unknown causes” of pneumonia clusters in Wuhan, China. Their risk assessments included the likelihood of the virus being carried into the country and the impact of transmission of the disease in Korea. The evolution of risk showed how and when to use risk assessments for this kind of emerging infectious disease. The article provides basic information to decision makers to evaluate developing situations [5].",17.369610366237247,10.304058333192497
