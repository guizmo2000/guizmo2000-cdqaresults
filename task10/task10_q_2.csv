Multipartite viruses have genomes segmented in pieces enclosed in different capsids that are independently transmitted. Since all segments have to meet in the host for complementation and completion of the viral cycle, multipartite viruses are bound to fight the loss of genomic information. While this is an obvious disadvantage of this strategy, no consensus on its actual advantages has been reached. In this review we present an exhaustive summary of all multipartite viruses described to date. Based on evidence, we discuss possible mechanistic and evolutionary origins of different groups, as well as their mutual relationships. We argue that the ubiquitous interactions of viruses with other unrelated viruses and with subviral elements might be regarded as a plausible first step towards multipartitism. In agreement with the view of the Virosphere as a deeply entangled network of gene sharing, we contend that the power of multipartitism relies on its dynamical and opportunistic nature, because it enables immediate adaptive responses to environmental changes. As such, perhaps the reasons for its success should be shought in multipartitism itself as an adaptive mechanism, to which its evolutionarily short-lived products (that is, the extant ensemble of multipartite viral species) are subordinated. We close by discussing how our understanding of multipartitism would improve by using concepts and tools from systems biology.",11.199792131091217,6.470690137651335

This suggests that pandemic planning needs to take into account the possibility that staff may be absent for reasons beyond those currently anticipated in UK planning documents. In particular, staff who are physically able to attend work may nonetheless be unwilling to do so. Although there are some barriers that cannot be mitigated by employers (such as illness, transport infrastructure etc.), there are a number of remedial steps that can be taken to lesson the impact of others (providing accommodation, building reciprocity, provision of information and guidance etc).

Standards such as SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry Specification) and InChi (International Chemical Identifier) have been adopted in chemical biology and cheminformatics, while IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) remains the gold reference in biochemistry. Glycobiology has developed a series of encoding formats that were attempts in a variety of ways to account for the branched structures. In the end, the multiplicity is such that toolboxes of converters have been developed over the years [53, 54] . Nonetheless, the (glyco-)bioinformatics community has opted for GlycoCT as a structure encoding format [55] shared by the majority of databases. Furthermore, it seems that SNFG [41] is spreading as a unique code for representing glycans. Despite growing consensus in each community for relying on shared standards, cross-talk is not established between disciplines, and requires the bridging tasks we have undertaken.",11.712760257926089,8.48029454238442

The DAA enshrines a code of conduct between providers and users of data which protects the ownership of the data while making it freely available on the proviso that users acknowledge the source of the data and, as appropriate, engage with the originators of the data in the collaborative spirit of GISRS, in a manner consistent with its original intent. 37 Its effectiveness is demonstrated by the prompt release of genetic sequences from the first cases of H7N9 zoonotic infection in China in 2013, which enabled the rapid production by synthetic biology of a candidate vaccine virus within a few weeks, 38 and in ensuring availability of the latest data for the biannual WHO vaccine consultation meetings (VCMs). 39 The close alignment of the principles underlying GISAID's sharing mechanism with the seven key principles for data sharing in a public health emergency enunciated recently by the Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness (GloPID-R) 40 illustrates once again how GISRS can lead the way in implementing innovative mechanisms and procedures. GISAID, also a trust-based system, integrates GSD with other clinical, virological and epidemiological data, and takes advantage of the latest advances in rapid gene sequencing technologies.

The APACHE score of patients admitted to ITU was signifi cantly lower than refused patients (P = 0.039). Patient age did not aff ect admission status (P = 0.15). See Table 1 . Introduction This Six Sigma project was initiated to evaluate and improve the transfer of care of patients from the OR to the ICU. Medical errors are responsible for billions of dollars in increased healthcare spending. Miscommunication among healthcare providers is a major contributor to these errors, with handoff s a particularly vulnerable period in the care process. At our institution, surgical patients with scheduled admissions to the ICU are fi rst recovered in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU). With this process, multiple, unstructured, and individual handoff s occur in parallel between providers, which may lead to communication errors, diff erential information sharing, content variability, care delays, and ineffi ciency. Methods A multidisciplinary QI project was initiated with input from the ICU, anesthesia and surgical services. A series of PDSA cycles were conducted, which began by defi ning the current process via direct observation and value stream mapping of orthopedic and neurosurgical patients. A new process was then introduced, including direct transfer of the patient to the ICU and a single, structured, bedside report between all care providers. A standardized handoff tool was implemented. We used process times, wait times and information content as process measures and handoff errors as outcome measures. A 10-point satisfaction score was also measured. Results Following implementation of the new transfer process, the average wait time decreased by 58 minutes, process time decreased by 9 minutes, and lead time decreased by 66.5 minutes. The handoff error rate decreased by 1.3 errors/patient and fi rst-time quality rate increased by 67%. Staff satisfaction improved from 48% to 73%. By elimination of the PACU stay, the costs involved in admission to the PACU were deferred. Conclusion A single, multidisciplinary bedside handoff process between the OR and ICU leads to cost and time savings. By elimination of redundant, nonvalue-added processes, less opportunity for medical errors occurred, with substantial improvements in fi rst-time quality. Such a process can be successfully attained while aff ecting staff satisfaction positively.",11.98360200228517,6.94584857449709

Funding support for training and fellowships can promote explicit scientific input into decision-making and encourage open sharing of data with other researchers and health officials. Researchers and research institutions should aim to shift the culture of data sharing by promoting the open sharing of data with public health practitioners as an academic product on par with publications, decreasing the potential for politicization or biased use of data [70] . Data sharing has been raised with H5N1 influenza A virus, Ebola virus, and Zika virus [89] , and informed by efforts to promote equitable benefit of results from the sharing of data and samples from emerging outbreaks [90, 91] .

This was accomplished because the outbreak was local, relevant expertise could be found locally and in the nearby region, and others were able to rapidly converge on the area from elsewhere in the United States. As observed in the recent Ebola outbreak in 2014, global connectivity makes it increasingly likely that infectious outbreaks are not confined to a single locality and easy access to relevant expertise is not assured. A core ideal of CBEPs is one of transparency and collaboration that builds trust between partner countries to facilitate data and information sharing to allow each partner to better respond to infectious disease threats. Transparency and trust are key attributes of successful collaborations that are not easily generated between individuals or organizations (14, 15) . Distance effects are very real despite global communications (16) . Studies of science teams identified the importance of face-to-face interactions early in a collaborative group (17, 18) .

(5, 6) . The GDD Operations Center has a team of six staff and a Director with professionally diverse backgrounds, e.g., human and veterinary medicine, microbiology, and epidemiology, and is situated within dedicated space located within CDC's Emergency Operations Center (EOC), with which we liaise both during GDD Operations Center supported international deployments of CDC teams and also when the EOC is activated to respond to an international disease event. Both official information sources, e.g., ministries of health or agriculture and WHO, as well as unofficial and unverified reports from media sources are reviewed. The latter are verified through a global network of public health professionals. Information sharing is built on trust and an understanding of how to appropriately handle information, particularly when it is not in the public domain and disclosure could harm relationships with partners. Information about disease events also comes from CDC subject matter experts in both the United States and those assigned to programs abroad. We also utilize disease-specific sources, which are particularly useful with regard to pathogens that typically are laboratoryconfirmed prior to reporting (e.g., influenza, polio), and although laboratory confirmation may result in delays, such etiology-specific sources typically are rapid in reporting verified cases. We monitor outbreaks from infectious and non-infectious causes including those attributable to disasters, intoxications, and chemical, radiological, or nuclear releases. We also monitor outbreaks of unknown etiology, many of which are later determined to have an infectious cause. Outbreaks among animals may also come under surveillance for known zoonotic diseases and to assess signals that may herald emerging or re-emerging outbreaks of human disease. Regardless of the type of outbreak or public health event, increased awareness of such an occurrence is critical for rapid public health response. Finally, the GDD Operations Center's outbreak response contingency fund provides financial support to CDC programs that makes possible a prompt response to international requests for assistance.",14.45971907229239,8.134145639020751

First, key informant interviews are particularly vulnerable to social desirability biases, especially when informants represent institutions and government departments. In our study, whenever possible, we tried to encourage personal and critical engagement with the given topics. At times, however, this was difficult to achieve, particularly in group interviews at government departments, where meetings were more formal and provided less opportunities for questioning and probing. Second, given the exploratory nature of this study, we could generate insights on the socio-technical complexity of health data and information sharing, but in-depth exploration of emerging issues would require additional work and specific methodologies. For example, network analysis could be used to chart structural patterns in the flow of data and information within and across countries, including centrality of nodes, reciprocity in information exchange, clustering, and, importantly, brokerage dynamics. In addition, participant observation at regional meetings, informed by interactionist perspectives [63] , would provide a deeper understanding of ways in which imbalances in access to resources may affect, in practice, knowledge exchange between country partners.

By way of conclusion, we can extend this argument a step further and speculate that data and information sharing works better if supported by strong multilateral arrangements, since these typically involve a third-party organisation with responsibilities for budget administration, data management, and overall coordination. By contrast, a bilateral cooperation agreement is likely to have a weaker brokering orientation and is generally thought to be a less effective mechanisms to address collective good problems, as documented in studies of aid relationships [64] ; this is even more apparent in contexts where transnational issues have a wide regional dimension and require harmonisation, coordination, and integration between more than two parties.

These are: population sizes at origin and destination locations, within country migration effect, and great circle distances which are identified as strong predictors of migration with high (>50 Bayes factor, BF) albeit not categorical support (Fig. 5) . Four other migration predictors for the GP dataset have support >5 BF and <15 BF which are international and national border sharing, Liberia-Guinea asymmetry, and index of temperature seasonality at origin. Of these Liberia-Guinea asymmetry and international border sharing are also found to be good predictors of migration in genomic data though The inferred ancestral branch location is logged at time points along the path from selected tips to the root of the tree across the posterior distribution of trees. The smoothed trajectories are an indication of where and when a lineage that gave rise to a particular tip is inferred to have existed. Maps on the right show migration events that are inferred to have taken place coloured by their posterior probability with migrations with <0.05 posterior support are shown as dotted white lines. All lineages share a common ancestor in Guéckédou prefecture of Guinea (white outline in the map) where the original zoonotic transmission event occurred near the Guinean border with Sierra Leone and Liberia. Some lineages are also descended from an early spillover event into Sierra Leone confusingly Liberia-Guinea asymmetry has the opposite correlation sign with GP sequence data. Apart from this deviation predictors for both genome and GP gene datasets mostly have the same sign and very similar effect sizes. As mentioned previously (Figs. 1 and 4) this suggests substantial amounts of information being derived from collection dates and locations of tips rather than genetic information. The reduction in total numbers of sequences as well as reduced phylogenetic information in the GP dataset appears to enable the migration model to explore combinations of predictors that would otherwise be confidently excluded with complete genomes and thus a larger number of predictor matrices is included in the migration model with low probabilities. The differences between genomic and GP data though seemingly small (e.g. Fig. 3 ) is more pronounced when looking at total entropy of inclusion probabilities: 1.285 nats for genome data, and 2.688 for GP sequences.",10.484186072444139,5.18054236248466

The synthesis of this information will be vital in determining the locations to be prioritized in restoration efforts; however, other local aspects, such as the willingness of the local population to participate in restoration and to not hunt primates must also be considered.

Of particular importance if the restoration project is to involve active replanting of trees is detailed information on the diet of the primates.

The revised IHR outline specific minimum core public health capacities and implementation processes that nations need to adequately address acute public health threats. Although 194 states parties signed onto this legally binding treaty, progress toward implementation of the IHR has been very slow. The initial target for full IHR implementation was 2012; however, even by 2014, only 33% of nations indicated that they had successfully implemented these minimum requirements. 4 To jumpstart stalled progress toward implementation of the IHR, the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) was established in 2014 with the goal of increasing national government support for IHR implementation and fostering a multilateral and multisectoral approach to developing health security capacity. Currently consisting of more than 50 countries, and with support from intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), the GHSA provides support for nations to assess their existing health security capabilities, identify gaps, and formulate plans to fully implement the IHR to ensure domestic and international capacity to detect, prevent, and respond to health security threats. One of the driving principles of the GHSA is building interagency coordination at the national level, and particularly improving the links between health and security authorities, to facilitate information sharing and improve response to a wide range of biological events, including the deliberate use of dangerous pathogens.",11.838508621149487,7.2809821599251325

In 2013, when clustered migrant employees returned from Ghana to Shanglin County of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, about 1000 imported malaria cases found from migrants, significantly lifting the nationwide reported malaria numbers that year [48, 49] . To deal with this situation, a risk assessment should be well conducted, particularly in areas that harbour the An. sinensis. Information sharing among sectors and departments should be established. In the areas where imported cases are clustered, CDC staff can carry out health education programmes in the villages and townships where returning workers reside, at airports, and at hospitals, through TV, radio, mobile phone messages, and the delivery of educational information materials. Furthermore, there is an urgent need to improve the effectiveness of the different interventions to decrease the costs of imported cases management [50] . Surveillance and response system should be maintained to be effective in the elimination and post-elimination stages, focusing on hotspots and risk populations, to avoid any transmission and prevent re-establishment. China's 1-3-7 strategy is one of the methods to practice reactive surveillance and reaction, and it has been proven to be efficient in lowering transmission, even on the China-Myanmar border of Yunnan Province [51] .

Diagnostic tests using conventional assays that appear to be negative, even when undertaken late in the disease and despite the clinical diagnosis, have a tendency, at times, to be unreliable. These tests are rarely optimal and entirely dependent on the nature and quality of the sample supplied. In the course of the past three decades, the application of molecular biology has aided in the development of tests that result in a more rapid detection of rabies virus. These tests enable viral strain identification from clinical specimens. Currently, there are a number of molecular tests that can be used to complement conventional tests in rabies diagnosis. Indeed the challenges in the 21st century for the development of rabies diagnostics are not of a technical nature; these tests are available now. The challenges in the 21st century for diagnostic test developers are two-fold: firstly, to achieve internationally accepted validation of a test that will then lead to its acceptance by organisations globally. Secondly, the areas of the world where such tests are needed are mainly in developing regions where financial and logistical barriers prevent their implementation. Although developing countries with a poor healthcare infrastructure recognise that molecularbased diagnostic assays will be unaffordable for routine use, the cost/benefit ratio should still be measured. Adoption of rapid and affordable rabies diagnostic tests for use in developing countries highlights the importance of sharing and transferring technology through laboratory twinning between the developed and the developing countries. Importantly for developing countries, the benefit of molecular methods as tools is the capability for a differential diagnosis of human diseases that present with similar clinical symptoms. Antemortem testing for human rabies is now possible using molecular techniques. These barriers are not insurmountable and it is our expectation that if such tests are accepted and implemented where they are most needed, they will provide substantial improvements for rabies diagnosis and surveillance. The advent of molecular biology and new technological initiatives that combine advances in biology with other disciplines will support the development of techniques capable of high throughput testing with a low turnaround time for rabies diagnosis.",11.538670220658057,6.95600649867426

Parties to the IHR. Communication between WHO and countries through the NFPs is the cornerstone of timely detection of public health risks and effective response to health emergencies. Countries are required to notify WHO of all events that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) through their NFPs. Strengthening the functions of NFPs is one of the strategic actions to enhance public health emergency preparedness through the implementation of the Asia Pacific Strategy for Emerging Diseases and Public Health Emergencies (APSED III). 2 IHR event communication refers to official communication between NFPs and WHO IHR contact points (CPs) at regional and global levels, as well as communication between NFPs in different countries, and between the NFP and relevant departments or agencies within the country to notify public health events; share and verify information; determine whether an event constitutes a PHEIC; and coordinate emergency responses. 1 Email has been the main mechanism of communication between WHO CPs and NFPs. In addition to email communication, WHO has developed a password-protected website, the Event Information Site (EIS), to facilitate information sharing with all NFPs. Events posted on EIS, which are often potential PHEICs or public hazards with international impact, are accessible to all NFPs. 3 IHR Exercise Crystal, a simulation exercise organized by the WHO Western Pacific Regional Office (WPRO) to test and strengthen event communication between the IHR CP of WPRO (WPRO IHR CP) and NFPs in the Region, has been conducted in the Western Pacific Region annually since 2008, 4 except that in 2009 NFPs communicated frequently with the WPRO IHR CP during After removing duplicates, a total of 34 438 emails were recovered from the archives of WPRO IHR mailbox from 11 September 2006 to 12 January 2017, of which 2944 (8.5%) were IHR exercise messages.

Pulmonary delivery is a promising approach of delivering RNAi therapeutics directly to the airways for treating local conditions and minimizing systemic side effects. It is a non-invasive route of administration that is generally well accepted by patients. However, pulmonary drug delivery is a challenge as the lungs pose a series of anatomical, physiological and immunological barriers to drug delivery.

Objective: To describe and analyse Ebola preparedness activities within the Icelandic healthcare system, and to explore the perspectives and experiences of managers and frontline health workers. Methods: A qualitative case study, based on semi-structured interviews with 21 staff members in the national Ebola Treatment Team, Emergency Room at Landspitali University Hospital, and managers of the response team. Results: Contextual factors such as culture and demography influenced preparedness, and contributed to the positive state of mind of participants, and ingenuity in using available resources for preparedness. While participants believed they were ready to take on the task of Ebola, they also had doubts about the chances of Ebola ever reaching Iceland. Yet, factors such as fear of Ebola and the perceived stigma associated with caring for a potentially infected Ebola patient, influenced the preparation process and resulted in plans for specific precautions by staff to secure the safety of their families. There were also concerns about the teamwork and lack of commitment by some during training. Being a 'tiny' nation was seen as both an asset and a weakness in the preparation process. Honest information sharing and scenario-based training contributed to increased confidence amongst participants in the response plans. Conclusions: Communication and training were important for preparedness of health staff in Iceland, in order to receive, admit, and treat a patient suspected of having Ebola, while doubts prevailed on staff capacity to properly do so.

With such an approach, it would be easier to share urban health data across geographies to better monitor emerging health threats in order to provide more economic stability, thereby ensuring no disruptions on such sectors like tourism and travel industries, amongst others. This is possible by ensuring collaborative, proactive measures to control outbreak spread and thus, human movements.

The XB managers were asked to indicate whether they implement a number of specific activities that are relevant to XB sites, i.e., linked to the first six key strategies in the MBDS Action Plan for 2011-2016. (In contrast, the seventh strategy, policy research, does not specifically involve activities at all XB sites.) All respondents reported that they maintain a list of contact information for their XB counterparts (Table 6 ). Nearly all have a basic package of activities for their site and share surveillance information as required (for agreed-upon diseases at specified frequencies). More than three-fourths have ever participated in a joint XB outbreak investigation; slightly more than half have participated in at least one meeting with their XB counterpart or had a supervisory visit during the preceding six months. Of the six MBDS strategies reflected in the table, implementation of specific activities associated with epidemiology capacity (present all sites) and XB cooperation (average 5.3 of 7 different XB-specific activities implemented) was most common. Activities associated with information and communications technology capacity (average 3.6 of 4 different activities in this area), animal-human health interface and community surveillance (average 4.5 of 7 different activities), risk communications (average 1.1 of 2 activities), or laboratory capacity (average 1.6 of 3 different activities) were less common.

Respondents commented on the first activities needed to start up an XB site, which XB activities have been most valuable, and lessons they have learned about XB cooperation. Nearly all reported that initial activities included meetings with national or provincial authorities as well as their XB counterparts, orientation and training, and sharing surveillance information with XB partners. Nearly all also reported that the most valuable activities were sharing information, meeting regularly, and conducting joint outbreak investigations with XB counterparts. Most reported positive lessons learned about local cooperation, information sharing and joint problem solving, all based on trust, mutual respect and good relationships with XB counterparts. Respondents also offered advice to future MBDS XB sites or to other countries or networks that may establish similar sites. They recognized the importance of initial local and cross-border orientation, regular meetings with XB counterparts to maintain good relationships, an established agreement at the XB site, and openness and timeliness in sharing surveillance information across borders.

However, collection of data by itself has no value unless it is analyzed to bring knowledge and wisdom to improve speed and quality of decisions (30) . Here, the value of sharing, aggregating data, and creating knowledge has been demonstrated with the use of multidisciplinary analytic tools that helped to maintain producer's interest in a voluntary data sharing project. In the absence of a regulatory framework, data sharing is a prerequisite for increasing disease awareness and, ultimately, supporting its control. Lessons learnt from the systematic analysis of the MSHMP relate to the repetitive time and time-space patterns associated with PRRS incidence in the U.S. and the regional variation, and the influence that changes on epidemiological conditions, may have in those patterns. In addition, quantitative evidence was collected on how phylogenetic analysis may support investigations on the most likely mechanisms of spread of the virus, and how collaboration and data sharing may contribute to the control of the disease at the regional level in the absence of a regulatory framework. A negative association between sharing PRRS status and incidence was found. It is unknown if this relationship is because negative farms are more inclined to share the data or if the increase in awareness has an effect on the incidence of the disease. However, in that specific study, the participation of farms, as well as PRRS status sharing, increased in the time frame studied suggesting that farmers and veterinarians may perceive collaboration as an advantage (25) .",17.474683469753003,9.432894831078437

The students received support in the field from staff and students at MakSPH. They also volunteered in on-going partnership activities in Uganda such as workshops, seminars and conferences. In addition, members of NTU have made several presentations over the period of the partnership at the Makerere University Environmental Health Students' Association (MUEHSA) conference organized annually by students of Environmental Health at MakSPH. This has increased the opportunities for transferring knowledge and sharing research findings between the two countries. The participation of UK partners in MUEHSA conferences plays a major role in enhancing inter-disciplinary knowledge about global public health issues for the Ugandan students. NTU and MakSPH staff have also made several guest seminar presentations during their respective visits to host institutions. Staff members of MakSPH have also participated in guest class lectures at NTU on Masters programmes, two of which were conducted via Skype to discuss issues of community participation from the field experience of the researchers. Our partnership base has been broadened by working with a Nottingham based health promotion practitioner with extensive experience in community development, monitoring and evaluation.

In the past 10 years there have been important global incidents that emphasise the tension between countries and international organisations when commercial and political interests are perceived to have an undue eff ect on global pandemic preparedness policy. 4, 16 This eff ect is further exacerbated when inequity in access to tech nology, expertise, and the best diagnostic, prophylactic, and treatment methods are prevalent. An example is Indonesia's refusal in 2006-07 to share samples of infl uenza H5N1 isolates with WHO in direct protest to the inequitable sharing of virus samples and vaccine development technology. 43 Lack of trust in WHO's response was evident following the H1N1 pandemic in 2009 too, including from the Council of Europe which highlighted potential confl icts of interest of individual members of the emergency committee convened by WHO to respond to the pandemic-linking them to industry, and noting WHO's policy on keeping the membership of the committee secret. Substantial shortfalls and delay in distribution of vaccine supplies to low-income and middle-income countries were also emphasised by subsequent reviews of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic response. 4, 16, 45 The Indonesian Government's call for more equity and developments since the H1N1 2009 pandemic have led to several positive initiatives. 46 Within WHO's PIP Framework, discussions have evolved to improve virus sharing in the context of recognising the need for shared benefi ts. Indonesia is now one of several low-to-middle income countries that are developing or have already developed in-country vaccine manufacturing capacityothers in the WHO-supported programme of technology transfer include Brazil, China, Egypt, India, Kazakhstan, Mexico, South Korea, Romania, Serbia, South Africa, Thailand, and Vietnam. Initiatives such as the creation of a technology transfer programme at the Netherlands Vaccine Institute (RIVM) to provide training in the embryonated egg production of inactivated infl uenza vaccine are helping to achieve this aim. 47, 48 There are still barriers to eff ective international cooperation and benefi t sharing despite the number of reports emphasising the importance of this key facet of pandemic preparedness. Substantial agreement exists across the public health community about how global collaboration should work, there is greater political acceptance of the value of such collaboration, but there are still barriers arising from commercial and academic drivers. China, with its direct experience of SARS and the economic and political consequences of not being ready to respond, has shown a good example by facing the economic challenges of H7N9. 31 The experience of Saudi Arabia with MERS-CoV highlights other barriers, such as ineff ective international collaboration and partnerships. 44 Despite a declared willingness to collaborate and share, and the publication of substantial epidemiological and microbiological information about early coronavirus cases and outbreaks, there appeared to be delays at times Series in sharing information between public health authorities before it was accepted for peer-reviewed publication, and in sharing clinical and viral samples for public health use without prejudice to subsequent commercial development of products derived from that material. Confl icts of interest that are barriers to trust will probably continue as long as academic and research organisations are judged primarily by their publication record or there is an associated commercial imperative. An urgent need exists for suffi cient global public health capacity that is free from these constraints to allow free and rapid sharing of information and samples. Politicians are beginning to understand the importance of tackling these issues. The Global Health Security Action Group (GHSAG) has initiated work to develop sample sharing protocols and arrangements that build on the WHO PIP Framework but that move on from infl uenza viruses to include any organism that might lead to a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC under the IHRs). The GHSAG initiative is initially intended to focus on sample sharing between the countries in the GHSAG but it will be open to other countries to use the GHSAG-agreed protocols for sharing, and these protocols should encourage and help with sharing without compromising the commercial rights of the sending countries and without prejudicing future benefi t sharing. 49 Specifi c capacity building activity could help to increase trust and engender a true spirit of global cooperation. The positive global experience gained from the development of the Supranational Reference Laboratory (SRL) Network for the surveillance of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis under the Stop TB partnership could serve as a template for the development of a more integrated global laboratory surveillance, diagnostic, and vaccine development and manufacture network working across a series of high priority EID pathogens. 50 The eventual aim of such an initiative would be to ensure that suffi cient numbers of biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) and BSL-3 (adapted for animals) reference laboratories exist in every WHO region to serve the needs of its member countries and peoples. 51 Benefi ts of a global network would include a greater capacity of regions to respond to local and international EID threats more quickly and effi ciently, and, importantly, to retain human resources and expertise within those regions. The latter could have an additional benefi t in aiding eff orts to curtail the brain drain of scientists and technical experts from low-to-middle income countries to more developed regions of the world.",16.83955472275492,11.43502990154134

Companies are incentivised by profit, and are rightly beholden to national regulatory frameworks and the public with respect to the data they collect. Ministries of health have complex relationships with both the companies that have access to personal data and with the public. They face many competing health priorities and complex political choices when it comes to open sharing of epidemiological data. Disease control programmes are often hampered by limited capacity and high turnover of personnel, and health workers on the ground during an epidemic have their hands full responding to the immediate crisis and might not be trained or incentivised to report epidemiological data accurately.

This is achieved by using a level of mathematical abstraction that needs a minimum of biological information to capture all physiologically relevant features of a cellular network. For example, ideally, for in silico modeling of a molecular network, knowledge of the network structure, all reaction rates, concentrations, and spatial distributions of molecules at any time point is needed. Unfortunately, such information is unavailable even for the best-studied systems. In silico simulations thus always have to use a level of mathematical abstraction, which is dictated by the extent of our biological knowledge, by molecular details of the network, and by the specific questions that are addressed. Understanding the complexity of the disease and its biological significance in health can be achieved by integrating data from the different functional genomics experiments with medical, physiological, and environmental factor information, and computing mathematically. The advantage of mathematical modeling of disease lies in the fact that such models not only shed light on how a complex process works, which could be very difficult for inferring an understanding of each component of this process, but also predict what may follow as time evolves or as the characteristics of particular system components are modified.

Initial recommendations for control are therefore, out of necessity, precautionary-based on evidence from past and present outbreaks that have similar epidemiological patterns, and for which the cause is known-and these precautionary measures can cause severe negative economic eff ects. Although modern methods such as genetic sequencing off er solutions for the identifi cation of potential pathogens, predicting their emergence and their behaviour in human populations is still very diffi cult. A better understanding of the prevailing disease ecology and investigations into the dynamics of infectious agents in wildlife could act as a better means of preventing outbreaks in livestock and people at source. 54 Global eff orts to control EIDs might be better served by directing greater attention and resources to prevention of emergence at the source by learning from past emergence events and by understanding and mitigating the factors, or determinants, that aff ect animal infection. These determinants include human-induced changes in natural environments, urban areas, and agricultural systems; raising and processing animal-based foods; and the roles of worldwide trade, migration, and climate change. Many evidence-based policies encounter political barriers, especially when commercial benefi ts are at stake. With agriculture, primarily a profi t-driven industry, prevention and mitigation strategies that are most easily accepted voluntarily are those that are cost eff ective and have no negative eff ect on profi t. For more costly policy options, enforceable legislation might be Series the only way they can be implemented.

Recent advances in genomics-based tools have allowed more sophisticated understanding of interactions among genes and genetic pathways, the environment, and the host and its pathogens. Already, it is apparent that genomics tools have started to change the practice of medicine. For example, they have been used to assess prognosis and guide therapy in several forms of cancer, to stratify patients according to risk of long-QT syndrome, and to shed light on the response to certain drugs, such as antiepileptic agents (Priori et al., 2003; Siddiqui et al., 2003; Van de Vijver et al., 2002) . Our understanding of how living organisms and systems within organisms interact with each other and respond to the environment all changes dramatically in this genomic era. Full benefit from genomics tools in combating viral diseases requires understanding the dynamics of infection with regard to viral diversity, evolution, and epidemiology, in combination with a better understanding of the pathogenesis of the infection and the molecular basis of the host response to infection. In this chapter, we describe how genomics may aid in mitigating viral threats, by highlighting potential roles and limitations of genomics approaches in surveillance and diagnostics, and development of vaccines and antivirals (Figure 97 .2).

This concern arises especially because metabolism is central to host homeostasis and viability. The identification of lipid molecules that are required for viral replication but dispensable for the host, may present the best option for mitigating the risk of toxicity at the cellular or organismal level. Untargeted lipidomic profiling experiments and metabolomic flux studies are critical tools for this effort. The tools and approaches used to advance our understanding of how specific lipid molecules function in viral processes may also facilitate rational targeting of specific lipid molecules rather than wholesale blockade of entire biosynthetic pathways.

This will require a comprehensive list of immunity and cofactor genes relevant to a particular virus, a catalogue of the major alleles of each, and an understanding of which genes are the most potent barriers to, or facilitators of, infection. Next, different host alleles of each gene will each need to be characterized for their viral specificity. Viral escape from restrictive alleles will also need to be characterized, either empirically or using computational models of the protein-protein interaction interfaces between host and viral proteins. Finally, all of this information has to be combined. Once such models exist, if a new genotypic environment presents to a virus one major genetic incompatibility in a known cofactor or immunity factor, and viral response to that block has been well characterized, prediction of viral evolution will be possible.

Research methods that group multiple barriers or integrate data over space and time may not capture these dynamics. For example, ecological niche models are often used to study zoonotic risk by assessing the distribution of reservoir hosts or vectors 85 , but this approach overlooks variation in downstream barriers that might drive risk. Alternatively, niche models that are based on the documented occurrence of spillover may capture the accumulated distribution of all conditions that enabled barriers to be breached over time (FIG. 1) , but they cannot isolate the precise barriers that affect spillover risk (for example, see REF. 86 ). Therefore, niche models tend to overestimate the spatial range of spillover risk and do not readily enable extrapolation to novel conditions 87 . Examples of this include Hendra virus and Marburg virus, which can be excreted in discrete temporal and spatial pulses from their bat reservoir hosts 20, 88, 89 . However, for spillover, shedding must align with environmental and bat population conditions that generate levels of pathogen pressure that are sufficient to produce an infectious dose (FIG. 2) , and with exposure behaviours and susceptibility of the recipient hosts. As some of these conditions vary among seasons and years, the pattern of outbreaks in livestock or humans has high spatial and temporal variability 20, 89 .

Improving Epidemiological Surveillance: Using Ecophylogenetics to Estimate Host Breadth Epidemiological surveillance aims to identify and monitor disease-causative agents and to use this information to inform public health policy. However, how can we possibly achieve these goals when we do not know which areas or host species should be targeted for surveillance? Ecophylogenetics provide a basis to disentangle the relative contributions of host relatedness (phylogeny) and host ecology (e.g., interaction networks, demography) to parasite-sharing patterns among different host populations ( Figure 3C [78] ). Integrating phylogenetics with community ecology could help in understanding patterns of host phylogenetic clustering and overdispersion across spatiotemporal scales. This holds great potential for the development of new tools to predict parasite host breadths (H P and H O in our proposed framework), a key component of understanding disease transmission dynamics at the landscape level [56, 77] . Additionally, ecophylogenetics may provide insights on potential spillover events that could result in disease emergence, a highly relevant topic under global change and increased international movement of species leading to shifts in host communities and translocation of parasites to new areas and hosts [79, 80] . Adoption of the host-space framework under ecophylogenetics could improve epidemiological surveillance, allowing early targeting of potentially suitable hosts (HP) [62, 63] .",11.67183495446988,8.014694324232458

Our review also articulates the factors that might influence the integration of such surveillance activities into official systems. The usefulness of new information sources via event-based surveillance depends on whether the information can enhance the data collection from existing surveillance methods and also on several factors related to the challenges for all systems' acquisition of data on infectious disease surveillance. 29, 30 For most epidemiologists, the process of gathering data from the Internet is complex, as it includes text mining (searching for health-related content from websites or social media), preparation (extracting and filtering relevant health-related information), and presentation of only the most relevant content (disseminating the information). In general, data are acquired and processed either automatically or by people, often relying on individual technologies for users' interaction with the data to tag (mark or catalog) the information for future use, and to comment on the information (for sharing and collaboration with other scientists), which can also be used to inform machine-learning algorithms (eg, statistical filters for data retrieval, such as Bayesian models). Systems often use automatic programming interfaces (APIs), a type of filter through which the data are passed in order to extract specific information. This is a good way of managing large sources of data from the Internet, which can be cumbersome and contain much content not related to health. These APIs process, extract, augment, and compile the epidemiological attributes in the data (ie, metadata) from multiple sources. For example, healthrelated attributes could include the data source, a relevant health term, the location, and the time of transmission. Natural language-processing systems extract from the feeds such relevant concepts as disease names and references to a geographic location. The information is then often assigned a dissemination format based on the information type (ie, epidemiological attribute) retrieved, through a network (eg, GPHIN), the Internet, email (ProMED-mail), or SMS (EWRS), or it is plotted on a geographic information system (GIS) published on the web (eg, HealthMap). The time needed to get from a potential data source to extracting and presenting epidemiological information that can be used as quickly as possible for preparedness or responses is critical. The results vary widely, depending on the combination of technologies used and whether or not human mediation is involved.",14.52651253202664,7.99254689614661

Part must come from mutations of the pre-existing genetic program, but the likeliness that it will often produce valuable information cannot be high [29, 30] . Interestingly, exactly as Maxwell's demons would behave, the active component of the accumulation process put in action ""myopic"" functions. Indeed, they can only measure whether a component susceptible to be degraded or not is somehow functional. Many features can be used to this aim, including physico-chemical properties of the amino-acids of the protein build up (such as isomerisation of aspartate and asparagine, a ubiquitous and fast ageing process in proteins), association with specific substrates or changes in the rigidity of active enzyme complexes or simply recent expression [28] . Furthermore, nothing precludes that information coming from outside, such as that resulting from horizontal gene transfer, can be retained in the accumulation process. And as a matter of fact, beside the paleome the genetic program contains another set of genes, often highly specific to a given organism and resulting from horizontal gene transfer [31] , the cenome (named after the concept of biocenose, community of organisms sharing a particular niche, proposed in 1877 by Karl Möbius).",10.796978098441134,7.658369636338094

Our principal contact at the time was Dr. Z. Matyáš, who was then the Food Hygienist in VPH. In September of 1969, I was invited to chair a small informal consultation on virus transmission via foods at the WHO in Geneva; most of those present studied animal viruses that might occur in foods, rather than viral pathogens of humans. I was appointed a WHO consultant on virus transmission through foods on that occasion-a designation that may still survive, but is not active. Further informal consultations were held in Geneva and in Brno, Czechoslovakia, over the next few years. In addition to nominal support for our research in food virology, WHO wanted an international system of information sharing, based eventually in our group. We were the Data Collection Centre for Food-borne Virus Disease and Research on Viruses in Foods, World Health Organization Food Virology Programme, from 1971 to 1975, after which we were designated the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre on Food Virology. What evolved was a three-part program: (1) the Data Collection comprised edge-punch cards, preprinted in the UK, on which bibliographic information and abstracts of pertinent publications were recorded with a typewriter; (2) a Request for Specific Information form was designed and made available to investigators worldwide, to be completed and mailed to Madison for response from the Data Collection; and (3) a List of Food Virologists, compiled largely from authors of articles in the Data Collection. Authors were contacted by mail at their address of record and asked to provide complete contact information and a brief (B25 words) description of their study. When as many responses had been received as seemed likely to come, a List was compiled and mailed to everyone on it. New Lists were undertaken at roughly 2-year intervals.

On the other hand, the threedimensional structure information about the proteins, DNA, and RNAis much more difficult and expensive to obtain, and presents a separate set of analysis challenges. Currently, only about 75,000 three-dimensional structures of biological macromolecules are known. 9 These models are incredibly valuable resources, however, because an understanding of structure often yields detailed insights about biological function. As an example, the structure of the ribosome has been determined for several species and contains more atoms than any other structure to date. This structure, because of its size, took two decades to solve, and presents a formidable challenge for functional annotation (Cech 2000 ) . Yet, the functional information for a single structure is dwarfed by the potential for comparative genomics analysis between the structures from several organisms and from varied forms of the functional complex. Since the ribosome is ubiquitously required for all forms of life these types of comparisons are possible. Thus a wealth of infor-mation comes from relatively few structures. To address the problem of limited structure information, the publicly funded structural genomics initiative aims to identify all of the common structural scaffolds found in nature and to increase the number of known structures considerably. In the end, it is the physical interactions between molecules that determine what happens within a cell; thus the more complete the picture, the better the functional understanding. In particular, understanding the physical properties of therapeutic agents is the key to understanding how agents interact with their targets within the cell (or within an invading organism).

Array annotation could include a fi le that identifi es the sequence of each individual spot on the array, or it could simply name a standard commercial microarray chip for which annotation is readily available from the manufacturer. Either of these methods would be MIAME compliant for the array annotation component in that it would enable someone looking at the data to understand what each spot represents. One could argue that these guidelines do not go far enough-without specifying semantics or format, the information cannot be computed over and is therefore less useful than it could be. But some feel that the standards are already too onerous and represent a barrier to data sharing (Galbraith 2006 ) .",11.427483986273469,4.7664360097639475

Stakeholders need to negotiate intellectual property contracts and agree ments to facilitate the sharing of pathogen sequences, 15 clinical samples, and diagnostic platforms before outbreaks occur. 16 For example, the Pandemic Influenza Pre paredness Framework 17 was negotiated over 4 years and resulted in a cooperative approach to benefit sharing, as well as substantial cost sharing of the laboratorybased surveillance system.

It is frequently the primary trigger for information-sharing practices in academic communities, and it forms ""the seeds of all relationships among researchers"" (Latour, 1999, p. 103) .",27.558961562216354,12.428428125545407

Actors change the role from intermediaries-simply transporting information-to mediators, because they are ""endowed with the capacity to translate what they transport, to redefine it, redeploy it, and also to betray it"" (Latour, 1993, p. 81) . They change from intermediaries that are shaped by heavy layers of context to mediators that also shape the context, and ""information changes from brick to clay, moved and shaped in unique ways by each perceiver"" (Dervin, 1983, p. 169) . Järvelin and Wilson (2003) suggest that one of the most important principles for judging the merits of conceptual models is their ability to generate hypotheses for testing and problems for solving.

In such a situation, this loop will be a major trigger for the circulation of all other loops. In an opposite situation, there will be nothing to share, the circulation will stop, and the whole system will collapse. In most cases, however, academics do not share all of their data, they select only certain information to be shared. Avoiding information sharing can be a result of negotiation within the alliances loop when ""certain data sets funded by private commercial interests may carry usage and confidentiality restrictions that prohibit them from being shared"" (Birnholtz & Bietz, 2003, p. 340) .

Public concerns can also define the object of academic activities. Finding solutions for public concerns is frequently a major motive for the activities of academic communities. For example, the global threat of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) motivated collaboration among scientists around the world and resulted in finding causes of the disease in only five weeks (Sonnenwald, 2007) . Thus, public representation can be both an enabler of and a barrier to information sharing in academic communities. Public representation also adjusts when a political environment changes. Havemann (2001) showed how information sharing between academics from East and West Germany has changed since the fall of the Berlin Wall, and Williams (1998) described how the peace process in Northern Ireland opened the door for information exchange across borders.

Then, in order to address these limitations, ANT and Latour's circulatory system of scientific facts are introduced. An alternate non-linear model of information-sharing practices in academic communities is outlined, and the main elements of the model and its relation to information-sharing practices in academic communities explained. Finally, possible applications of this model, and future research directions are discussed. Foster's (2004) non-linear model of information-seeking behavior introduced a new perspective to the conceptualization of information practices, one in which ""the unit of observation expands from the study of individual tasks, individual search sessions, and the study of activities in relative isolation, and becomes the study of activities within a mesh of complex interactions"" (Foster, 2006, p. 165 ). However, ANT provides a more effective means to capture the non-linear movements of complex social, political, cognitive, and technological negotiations involved in information-sharing practices in academic communities. Latour's (1999) circulatory system of scientific facts is used as a foundation for building a non-linear model of informationsharing practices in academic communities. The main proposition of this model is that although information-sharing practices are shaped by contextual elements, they simultaneously shape the contextual elements. The main difference between this model and other IB models, including Foster's model, is this focus on the interdependence between context and information practices. Instead of a priori placing actors in a context, this model follows the actors in information-sharing practices, as they create context for themselves. As such, the model may contribute to understanding information-sharing practices from the actors' point of view.",29.611820609961256,11.400337178069359

One village has a closely clustered pattern of households, but the other has a linearly pattern such that households disperse along the road. The researchers expected that different spatial arrangement of each particular village might result in dissimilar social interaction and food-sharing patterns. Questionnaires consisted of two phases; the first phase was designed for O. viverrini community-level intervention, and the second phase had a supplementary SNA questionnaire that exclusively focused on questions about fish dish sharing. Partial network analysis was carried out using nodes defined as households and ties defined as food-sharing relationships based on four types of raw fish dishes Koi-pla, Pla-som, Pla-ra and Pla-jom. Household locations were determined by a handheld global positioning system receiver (Garmin Ltd.; Olathe, KS, USA), and household maps were created using Quantum GIS, version 1.8.0 (http://www.qgis.org/en/site/). This information was then used to visually characterize the spatial pattern of households in each village. Statistical analysis of raw fish sharing and O. viverrini infection risk associated with exposure to raw fish dishes were performed using R statistical package, version 3.0.3 (R Core Team, 2013). Raw fish-sharing networks were constructed, and the degree of food sharing (DFS), which is defined as the number of the household members who share food together regardless of providing or receiving food, was measured using the igraph R package. These networks were complex and showed an apparent association between household food sharing and O. viverrini infection prevalence. Information from the network analysis demonstrated that a household's members who were positive for O. viverrini infection also tended to consume a greater variety of raw fish dishes. The direction of the ties showed that providers were household members who fished and prepared fish dishes, whereas the recipients were household members who did not fish, mainly elderly or disabled individuals. A statistically significant association was showed between DFS and O. viverrini infection and other risk factors such as raw fish consumption and types of raw fish dishes. However, the result revealed the different networks that share raw fish dishes which illustrate more complexity or greater number of sharing in a clustered pattern village than in a linear pattern village. In addition, social determinants of raw fish dish sharing were observed. Three factors associated with these behaviours were expressed: enjoyment of raw fish dishes among relatives and friends, alcohol drinking and access to the fish used in raw fish dishes (Saenna et al., 2017) .",12.69788112534486,7.531877722369542

They reused needles hundreds of times and shared needles with other drug abusers. HIV infection was first recognized in January 2014; there were 71 cases by December and 135 by April 2015 [25] . The transmission rate was estimated at 80%, meaning that infection occurred in 8 of every 10 individuals sharing needles with an infected person [26] . Other factors that might have contributed to the size of the epidemic are the misperception that only homosexuals could become infected by HIV and the general reluctance to undergo testing and treatment because of the stigma attached to the disease [27] . To overcome these barriers, Indiana officials instituted a program of needle exchange, offered free HIV testing, and provided clinic facilities for treatment. It is still unclear whether these measures will be effective in limiting this outbreak.",11.551568180283535,6.415813694880624

WHO has limited access to the WTO meetings at which trade issues that could directly aff ect health are discussed. Thus, WHO has observer status in the committees on sanitary and phytosanitary measures and technical barriers to trade, and ad-hoc observer status in the TRIPS and trade in services councils. Observer status allows WHO to contribute to discussions but not be offi cially involved in making decisions. Since 2000, there has been political deadlock over the issue of observer status, and several WTO bodies have granted this status ad hoc to international organisations, such as WHO, in the interim. Importantly, there are few trade issues deemed to directly aff ect health, and thus representation by WHO is restricted.

Therefore, while there is acknowledged need for ICT in the coordination and monitoring of treatment, surveillance, response, education, and communication in health care, in reality there are significant barriers in the application of ICT that slow progress. These barriers are in no way restricted to the developing world. The United States and other more technologically advanced nations have their own sets of challenges. Cost, misalignment of incentives, resistance, an unskilled workforce, concerns about impact on productivity, lack of standards and interoperability, and other issues contribute to a poor level of healthcare ICT adoption in the industrialized world. 16 The digital divide has resulted in large segments of low income and/or other underserved groups being excluded from online health resources. 16 Economic hardships and difficult tradeoff decisions in the US healthcare industry have further inhibited healthcare information technology growth. 17 In developing nations, the problem of ICT uptake is even further compounded. A lack of local expertise and decades of well-meaning but non-sustainable ICT projects in the developing world have left a legacy of skepticism in their wake. Systems built for Westernized health care delivery often do not match the local context, resulting in a misalignment between need and technology. Poverty and illiteracy in developing nations stand as major barriers to the adoption and sustainability of information technologies, and many believe it is difficult to make the case for ICT when basic needs for survival are barely being met. 18 The ""e-health paradox,"" a term coined by Liaw and Humphries, refers to this seeming conundrum; populations that may have the most to gain from ICT in health are those who are thwarted in their use due to barriers of untrained personnel, poor infrastructure, and lack of resources. 19 Issues such as these have fueled technological apartheid and continue to subvert the delivery of knowledge to areas of the globe that most desperately need it.",12.867783749735896,8.717696809393953

The abundance of Twitter accounts providing official information made it difficult to synchronize and follow the flow of information. Many organizations posted simultaneously, by their manager and by the organization itself. Creating situational awareness was facilitated by information tweeted by the public. Threat assessment was updated through the information posted on social media. Security breaches led to the relay of sensitive data. At times, misinformation was only corrected after two days. The authors recommend development of a standard operating procedure to enable multiple responders to observe and unite their social media feeds in emergency situations. 37 Southwell et al. 2016 (continued on next page) The relationships between news coverage, online search behaviour, and social media mentions related to the Zika virus were analyzed in early 2016. Results suggest that official public health authority announcements offer small windows for information sharing, engagement, and online searching that offer opportunities through education. Outside of these announcements, sharing and searching are less apparent. These findings suggest the potential benefit in paring announcements with the provision of information resources. 38 Thomas et al. 2013 Health care personnel respondents had a high knowledge of social media, and were favorably disposed to the use of social media in healthcare delivery.

Many health care personnel in Oyo state they have a robust knowledge of social media and think it can be very useful for healthcare delivery, they still do not use it or even see the feasibility of its implementation in Nigeria.

This perspective proposes situations in and conditions under which cooperation appears beneficial to actors [16, 56] .

Opinion leaders are the few individuals who have the largest number of social ties in a diffusion network (Valente, 1995) . People are inclined to monitor information sent by opinion leaders as well as emulate their behavior as opinion leaders are in an advantaged position for access to information and scanning the environment in the community (Valente, 1995) . In other words, opinion leaders represent the norm of the community and are respected as influential. According to the two-step flow model of communication (Katz & Lazarsfeld, 1955) , opinion leaders act as intermediaries between mass media and the majority of people in a community. Therefore, the mechanism that opinion leaders facilitate information diffusion is that they stimulate adoption behavior (e.g., retweet a message) of their followers. Followers' information sharing help create multiple generations of adopters and extend the diffusion chain. Previous studies have showed that opinion leaders were more important than average individuals in diffusing public opinions (Watts & Dodds, 2007) , and opinion leaders were critical in accelerating behavioral diffusion (Valente, 1995) .

While the finding is consistent with health information sharing literature on Twitter (McLaughlin et al., 2016) , it contradicts sharing health news via email and Facebook (Kim, 2015) . Different media platforms can affect what people talk about and share (Berger & Iyengar, 2013) and thus may explain the discrepancies in those findings. Email and Facebook networks involve a great number of pre-existing social relations (Ellison, Steinfield, & Lampe, 2011) , while Twitter network may involve a larger number of strangers or very weak ties as following a Twitter user typically does not require a mutual agreement from both relational parties (Hansen, Arvidsson, Nielsen, Colleoni, & Etter, 2011) . Social bonding is an important motivation when sharing information with pre-existing social relations (Berger, 2014) . Sharing positive emotions helps build a positive self-image and maintain positive interpersonal relationships. However, when communicating with very weak ties, it may be less important to be a positive or a nice person. Instead, sharing negative-tone messages may attract more attentions from others. Information that arouses negative emotion may signal danger and thus are more urgent and useful (McLaughlin et al., 2016) . In addition, passing along negative tweets may show a person's discriminating judgement and heightened cynical sophistication (Cappella et al., 2015) , just like we tend to perceive book review writers as more intelligent and competent when they provide negative as opposed to positive reviews (Amabile, 1983) .

However, detection of an unusual increase in cases of a disease imported from specifi c countries generally requires several patients, which for tropical diseases may be feasible only by combining surveillance data from several sentinel units [9] . Sentinel networks enable rapid inquiry regarding additional cases among affi liated sites, so if one member site sees an unusual case, they can immediately notify the rest of the network and quickly determine if a pattern can be established. If a suspicious cluster is revealed, an outbreak may or may not be occurring, but it signals that additional examination of disease activity may be warranted. Facilitation of a collegial approach to information sharing between clinical sites is a fundamental aspect of these networks. Additionally, the establishment of communication links between network members provides a structured, effi cient mechanism for early dissemination of alerts regarding suspected changes in disease activity. Recognized clusters of events may then be posted onto ProMed (www.promedmail.org) or similar alert systems for wider dissemination of information.",15.445755057190183,8.408661944100274

The probability that agent i in layer α adopts the strategy of a neighboring node j in the same layer depends here on the difference between their payoff functions and on the fact that the corresponding partner of i in layer β has the same or a different strategy. If the strategies of both the node i and its partner i ′ are the same, the probability of changing is decreased with respect to the usual one when the network layers are isolated. This coupling is seen not only to enhance cooperation in both PDG and PGG, but also to sustain the spontaneous emergence of correlated behaviors between the two networks.

The Maquiladora Program was established in 1965 to help relieve high unemployment in the northern region of Mexico. Foreign-owned firms were granted the right to set up production in the region and to import materials and equipment duty-free under the proviso that the goods would be re-exported. Not all maquiladoras are majority owned by US corporations, so these data complement the information in Table 1 based on US multinational data only. The maquiladoras are an important source of employment and export-oriented growth for Mexico, with their exports accounting for half of all non-oil exports from Mexico and one-third of manufacturing employment. 13 The US is the predominant trading partner with maquiladoras, accounting for roughly 90% of total maquiladora exports in 1998 (Bendesky et al., 2003) . Table 1 shows that including maquiladoras trade significantly increases the measures of production sharing between US and Mexico described above. For example, in Panel C we observe that the production-sharing intensity of trade increases from roughly 25% to 55% when maquiladoras are included. 14 To quantify the operations of maquiladoras, Panel A in Fig. 1 displays the ratio of imports by maquiladoras as a fraction of their exports, for the period 1993-2005.

So-called digital epidemiology has enabled practitioners and researchers to use electronic databases and information to enhance traditional surveillance methods. 5 In 2012, HHS launched its Now Trending developer challenge to create programmes for health departments to monitor social media during an outbreak. The challenge resulted in MappyHealth, a Twitter monitoring programme now being piloted for digital health surveillance around the country, helping offi cials examine real-time events. Digital surveillance was used by public health workers during the infl uenza A H7N9 outbreak to monitor Chinese social media for events, myths, and concerns. 6 Improvements in digital surveillance have also improved public communication. Local health departments that can monitor Twitter can give immediate feedback to correct dangerous mistruths that are contagious on social media. 7 CDC's @CDCEmergency Twitter feed, fi rst established during the infl uenza A H1N1 response, now reaches more than 1·5 million people with emergency health information. During the Japan nuclear disaster response, Twitter was used to correct the dangerous myth that healthy people in the USA should take potassium iodide to prevent harm from radiation. 8 These technological advances have been developed in parallel with diplomatic information sharing advances. WHO's International Health Regulations and multilateral collaborations, such as the Global Health Security Initiative, have provided a framework for international cooperation during public health disasters. Improved capacity and the high priority placed on rapid information sharing led to China's timely reporting in 2013 of clinical and genetic information about infl uenza A H7N9 and early sharing of isolates, by contrast with the response to sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) a decade earlier, when information was slower to emerge. 9,10 Cloud computing allowed for distribution of validated epidemiological and analytical programmes to the global community, while allowing China to share genomic sequences, providing the opportunity for immediate actions to analyse the viral genome and develop vaccine candidates. 6 The Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasure Enterprise was established by HHS to coordinate federal eff orts and build new ways to respond to 21st century health threats-from discovery to deployment.

Integrated programs and collaboration, on the other hand, facilitate the efficient management of the complex, varied, and proliferating issues and information sources that exist today. The nature of public health surveillance also lends itself to multiple-purpose approaches in that strategies for preventing and controlling diseases, such as West Nile virus, are to a great extent the same as for an influenza epidemic, a foodborne disease outbreak, or a bioterrorist attack. 31 Technology that enhances communication and data sharing across disease programs, surveillance systems, and even across jurisdictions increases the ease of obtaining and disseminating useful information to a broad audience, including public health agencies, healthcare providers, policymakers, and the general public. 6, 32 This rapid information exchange not only facilitates timely response, but can also reduce emergency room visits, hospital admissions, and even costs of care. 33 However, many health departments currently have systems that are not flexible enough to respond to changing health IT needs, which makes it difficult to deliver information when and where it is needed. 4 Disease or program-specific funding also exacerbates program vulnerability to funding and budgetary cuts. For example, when funding is earmarked for specific purposes (e.g., emergency preparedness and associated surveillance systems), and then is reduced, such as has occurred for public health emergency preparedness cooperative agreement funding through CDC in the past seven years, 34 it can undermine and reverse efforts to establish sustainable systems that serve multiple crosscutting purposes throughout public health.

Understanding reasons for nonadherence to crisis guidelines is needed to improve crisis management. We identified and measured barriers and conditions for optimal adherence as perceived by 4 categories of health care professionals. Methods: In-depth interviews were performed (n 5 26) to develop a questionnaire for a cross-sectional survey of microbiologists (100% response), infection preventionists (74% response), public health physicians (96% response), and public health nurses (82% response). The groups were asked to appraise barriers encountered during 4 outbreaks (severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], Clostridium difficile ribotype 027, rubella, and avian influenza) according to a 5-point Likert scale. When at least 33% of the participants responded ''strongly agree,'' ''agree,'' or ''rather agree than disagree,'' a barrier was defined as ''often experienced.'' The common (''generic'') barriers were included in a univariate and multivariate model. Barriers specific to the various groups were studied as well. Results: Crisis guidelines were found to have 4 generic barriers to adherence: (1) lack of imperative or precise wording, (2) lack of easily identifiable instructions specific to each profession, (3) lack of concrete performance targets, and (4) lack of timely and adequate guidance on personal protective equipment and other safety measures. The cross-sectional study also yielded profession-specific sets of often-experienced barriers. Conclusion: To improve adherence to crisis guidelines, the generic barriers should be addressed when developing guidelines, irrespective of the infectious agent.

In veterinary medicine, zoonoses present a risk to practitioners, yet little is known about how these risks are understood and how this translates into health protective behaviour. This study aimed to explore risk perceptions within the British veterinary profession and identify motivators and barriers to compliance with IPCs. A cross-sectional study was conducted using veterinary practices registered with the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons. Here we demonstrate that compliance with IPCs is influenced by more than just knowledge and experience, and understanding of risk is complex and multifactorial. Out of 252 respondents, the majority were not concerned about the risk of zoonoses (57.5%); however, a considerable proportion (34.9%) was. Overall, 44.0% of respondents reported contracting a confirmed or suspected zoonoses, most frequently dermatophytosis (58.6%). In veterinary professionals who had previous experience of managing zoonotic cases, time or financial constraints and a concern for adverse animal reactions were not perceived as barriers to use of personal protective equipment (PPE). For those working in large animal practice, the most significant motivator for using PPE was concerns over liability. When assessing responses to a range of different ""infection control attitudes"", veterinary nurses tended to have a more positive perspective, compared with veterinary surgeons. Our results demonstrate that IPCs are not always adhered to, and factors influencing motivators and barriers to compliance are not simply based on knowledge and experience. Educating veterinary professionals may help improve compliance to a certain extent, however increased knowledge does not necessarily equate to an increase in risk-mitigating behaviour. This highlights that the construction of risk is complex and circumstance-specific and to get a real grasp on compliance with IPCs, this construction needs to be explored in more depth.",13.723327769807895,7.614965366214685

Secondly, we explore the interplay between perceptions of human-environmental ''tipping points,'' international institutions, and collaboration patterns here operationalized as global networks. This perspective allows for a more cohesive view that combines both exogenous (i.e., perceived ''tipping point'' dynamics) and endogenous (i.e., information sharing mechanisms) factors (sensu Young 2010).

While the selection of cases does not provide the generalizability of larger-N studies, it does allow us to examine how the theoretically derived propositions play out in the three different cases, and also provides an opportunity to explore around the potential interplay between variables and causal mechanisms. Our ambition in the longer term is that the analysis presented here can underpin more systematic cross-case comparisons (cf. Gerring 2004) .

As noted in Gutteling and Wiegman (1996) , to some risk communication researchers, especially those who hold an implicit technical view of risk communication, there is no problem in trying to reach agreement between the source and the receiver by applying persuasive tools. Other researchers, however, argue that using persuasion communication strategies is not acceptable and contradicts the goals of fairness. More recently, there has been a shift in the understanding of risk communication from merely a one-way communication flow to an emphasis on a two-way communication process involving sharing of information and promoting dialogue between technical experts and stakeholders. This approach acknowledges the concerns of stakeholders. Properly applied dialogue-based risk communication can help stakeholders and experts to share knowledge and understanding of the risk issue. Dialogue is aimed at ensuring that a diverse range of people share a common understanding of the risk issue with the organizations/ individuals in charge of managing the risk concerned. Sandman (1989) argues that the principle of involving the public in risk issues, whether it is risk assessment, decision-making, management or communication, is crucial. The aim of dialogue-based risk communication is to bring together diverse stakeholders in risk knowledge creation and sharing. This approach recognizes that certain risks are complex and multidisciplinary and hence need to be addressed through dialogue with, and participation by, diverse stakeholders. Increasing stakeholder participation raises the likelihood of the message being credible. There is a growing realization by risk researchers that for risk communication to be effective, it should have a stakeholder perspective. Dialogue-based perspectives are captured in the definition of risk communication by Lang, Fewtrell, and Bartram (2001) : ""[R]isk communication is any purposeful exchange of information about risks between interested parties."" In their 'General Principles of Food Safety Risk Management', the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) hold that ""risk management should include clear, interactive communication with consumers and other interested parties in all aspects of the process"". In its project to investigate what type of communication would improve the public understanding of flood risk and encourage people to take action, the British Environment Agency (2015) carried out a major public dialogue project on flood risk communication. In its project evaluation it found that ""getting people and communities involved in talking about flood risks increases people's understanding of local flood risk and can help them on a journey towards making preparations to protect themselves against flooding"" (Environment Agency, 2015).",13.830979894995739,8.066481972724215

WHO has also produced outbreak communication guidelines to aid in the dissemination of information to the public, recognizing that 'expertise [in communications] has become as essential to outbreak control as epidemiological training and laboratory analysis'. 2 The boundaries between risk communication and management are not, however, sharply delineated, as illustrated by the controversy surrounding H5N1 influenza virus sharing. Indonesia is one of the countries hardest hit by outbreaks of H5N1. Virus sharing with the international community is the mechanism by which, first, viruses developing pandemic potential can be tracked (risk communication), and second, vaccines can be developed to meet global need (risk management). Indonesia refused to virus share, not because it was opposed to the sharing of technical information to better understand the threat posed by H5N1 avian influenza, but because it felt excluded from equitable access to the resulting vaccine, meaning that its management of a subsequent pandemic would be constrained. 3 It could be argued that Indonesian authorities currently view virus sharing as an important element in risk management and thus a sovereign issue, although the international community, by contrast, views virus sharing as a critical element of risk communication and, by extension, a global risk management issue. Differing interpretations of international treaties are possible and resolution is proving challenging. 4 Ultimately, the debate is centred on the boundary between the governance of risk communication and risk management, the former now being mandated through international laws, with the latter remaining, to a large degree, a national sovereignty responsibility.",14.692791448378566,6.916519657989741

For example, no one could foresee all public health, political, social and economic consequences of the 2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa. With complex risks such as a pandemic (caused intentionally or not) there is likely to be a degree of failure in mitigating some risks. A more comprehensive systems approach that assesses: risk, resilience and adaptation in an integrated way will likely result in a holistic treatment and mitigation of many complex and potentially emerging bio-risks. Resilience or the ability to plan, absorb and recover and adapt from adverse events is important in understanding complex bio-risks as there is a need to understand the vulnerabilities to a range of sectors in a locality, region, nation or globally. The intelligence community needs to understand what are specific vulnerabilities in particular sectors such as transport, city buildings, food and water supply or airports?

SA is crucial for recognizing, responding to, and tempering threats. It helps in the formulation of response plans, execution of rapid decisions in dynamic situations, proper allocation and utilization of resources, and improves outcomes [23] . SA relies heavily on the correct information and good communication of the information among multiple event respondents [24] . Incorrect or insufficient information may lead to endangering rescuers and poor outcomes [24] . There is also shared SA, which entails communicating and relaying information about the event to authorities and other responders and promoting teamwork and cooperation [24] . An established flow of communication among disaster responders and the transmission of important information in a timely fashion is crucial. Awareness of cultural norms is also part of SA. Electronic surveillance and wireless communication systems help facilitate information flow and distribution [24, 25] . Barriers to satisfactory SA include (1) lack of universal operational models; (2) poor communication; (3) incorrect, insufficient, or outdated information; and (4) undefined information-sharing plans and routes [24] . Norri-Sederholm and colleagues [24] surveyed emergency paramedics to determine what information was crucial to successfully respond and manage emergency medical situations. There were 5 important information categories identified: mission status, area status, incident data, safety at work, and tactics. Incident data was the most important category, as this provides basic information about the event, number of victims, nature of the event, ages of the victims, and other details about the event (eg, are there victims trapped somewhere, are there any obstacles preventing responders from getting to the victims). Mission status includes the number and type of personnel assigned to respond to the event, the number of respondents required for that particular event, estimated time, and confirmation of a completed mission. Area status refers to the number of responding units available, the type of units that are available, the location of the units, and urgency of the missions. Safety information is obtained from police or authorities at the scene to let responders know if there are any safety risks to personnel (eg, active shooter, biochemical exposure, unexploded ordinance). Finally, tactical details include coordinating response and obtaining instructions from the police, devising a response plan, and communicating said plan to other authorities involved (ie, police) [24] .",20.193223352261462,8.82295108860714

Berg and Appelbaum 101 have outlined four main standards for determining decision-making competence based on a framework developed by Appelbaum and Grisso. 102 The first standard, most widely used by courts and legislatures, is the ability to communicate a choice. Many potential subjects fail to reach this standard because they are unable to coherently communicate, whether due to chronic schizophrenia, various levels of consciousness due to psychotic episodes, or other disorders. The ability to communicate choice does not necessarily translate into the capacity to make a choice autonomously. Comatose, mute, catatonic, or severely depressed persons, individuals with manic or catatonic excitements, and persons with severe psychotic thought disorders or severe dementia will fall under this category. A second standard used is the ability to understand relevant information. This understanding means that the potential subjects have the ability to comprehend the concepts involved in the informed consent disclosure. Understanding itself is not enough; if a person understands the information, but is not able to retain the information long enough to make a decision, they are not competent enough to consent. Impairments of intelligence, attention, and memory can all affect this ability. A third standard is the ability to appreciate the nature of the situation and its likely consequences. The subject must be able to apply the information to his or her own situation. Denial, delusions, and psychotic levels of distortion can all impair this ability. The final standard is the ability to manipulate information rationally. It is necessary that a potential subject possess reasoning capacity and the ability to employ logic to compare the risks and benefits of the treatment options.",10.499870684715718,7.2576264773214

Nevertheless, the Chinese government assigned responsibility for censorship of the media, including the Internet, to local agencies. 5 In the new media age, in which social media (including the Internet, short message services, and mobile applications) are centralized, the government restricts freedom of expression in the same way as it has restricted such freedom among traditional media sources, such as newspapers, radio, and television. 6 The control of the acquisition of information is more difficult in this new age because social media are tools not only for the dissemination, sharing, and seeking of health information but also for the expression of feelings and the sharing of personal experiences and opinions. 7, 8 Therefore, organizations need to build effective communication tools to respond to emerging infectious disease (EID) outbreaks because the public may express scientific skepticism about scientific topics and participation in decision-making. 9 During epidemics, people usually require guidance on how to behave from a trusted source. The government and public institutions are the ideal sources because people tend to rely on the national administration. For this reason, trust in these institutions plays a main role in the public's acceptance of policies and actions. 10 The World Health Organization suggested that outbreak communication should incorporate the following 5 key factors: (1) building, maintaining, or restoring trust; (2) announcing early; (3) maintaining transparency; (4) understanding the public; and (5) planning of all aspects of the response to an outbreak. 11 Therefore, risk communication enhances the decision-making ability of laypeople, and can be examined by assessing risk perception. 12 Trust in not only the government and public agencies but also in the media and other institutions may be associated with risk perception.

Kunin et al. recently reported on how primary care physicians helped pass on important pandemic-related information to out-patients during the 2009 pandemic in Israel. This, they concluded, helped enhance the success of the national pre-pandemic preparedness plans. 188 Indeed, during public health disasters, the speed at which information is needed by policymakers may be faster than is usually possible through traditional mechanisms of research dissemination. This scenario makes information sharing a norm; even possibly those provided by preliminary research findings. 189 Humans instinctively show care to other humans in need. While this caring instinct has been socially modified and conditioned in some parts of the world where individualistic tendencies run rife, some communal-oriented cultures give room for a freer expression of the instinct of care. The instinct of care may, however, be counterproductive in the context of PHDs. For instance, during pandemic influenza, sick and dying patients remain active carriers of infection, 190 as such, will infect susceptible friends and relations who feel obligated to show care in relation to helping them. In other words, ""unbridled"" caring may increase the vulnerabilities elicited during pandemic influenza.

These, and other recent public health events, provide an opportunity for us to review and reflect on the evolution of Canada's public health emergency response over the past 15 years-from SARS, to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza, to Ebola virus and Zika virus disease. Key lessons have been learned and milestones achieved that have shaped and sharpened our response approach and structures. While SARS was a wake-up-call to strengthen infection prevention and control capacity in health care settings and led to the formation of the Public Health Agency of Canada, it also strengthened our Federal/Provincial/Territorial (FPT) senior-level governance and led to agreements for pan-Canadian mutual aid and infectious disease information sharing. As well, our collective public health laboratory capacity has been strengthened through ongoing response and sharing of advanced diagnostics and research. As we move forward, it will be important to explore the design of scalable or modular emergency response strategies and structures that are socio-culturally appropriate and employ evidence-based strategic risk communications that continue to be critical, especially given the volume and spread of misinformation. With the current global reality, we must recognize that public health threats that go unchecked anywhere in the world have the potential to very rapidly become a public health threat in Canada.

Our experience with swine influenza databases indicates that populating the database and sharing the information is most successful when the information is used for a specific and important purpose. Testing for swine influenza virus is a regular activity at veterinary diagnostic laboratories. Serology results are generally used for making decisions on vaccine timing and are not typically collated into common databases. Virus detection by PCR and virus isolation is used to determine the role of influenza virus in clinical disease. Viruses isolated from clinical cases are often used for the production of autogenous vaccines based on the results of virus sequencing information. Virus sequencing information is often assembled into dendrograms to follow virus trends over time and geography. Each piece of the collective diagnostic information has a role in influenza diagnosis and control on a herd or production system basis.

Timeliness. After initial diagnosis, how quickly the cases are entered into the surveillance system or the time that elapses between onset of infection, diagnosis, case report, information sharing, and action, is often regarded as key to a surveillance system's success (Jajosky and Groseclose 2004) . While timeliness is of critical importance, it is often very difficult to measure (Jajosky and Groseclose 2004 ). E. Completeness. Completeness is the attribute of a surveillance system that is most directly linked to the true discipline of epidemiology. Completeness is reflected by the proportion of all cases of disease in a specified population that are detected by the surveillance system and is affected by the likelihood that: (a) animals with infection or disease are tested; (b) the condition is correctly diagnosed (skill of animal health provider, accuracy of diagnostic tests); and (c) the case is reported to the surveillance system once it has been diagnosed. The factors that may affect completeness of a surveillance system are addressed in more detail in Sect. 1.3. F. Representativeness. A surveillance system that accurately describes the occurrence of disease over time and its distribution in the study population by location, group, and severity can be referred to as representative. Consideration of this attribute is especially important for large populations with variable prevalence because most systems simply cannot detect every single case of infection or disease. The common idiom ''tip of the iceberg'' is a popular way of referring to how the documented and described cases of a disease that are evident as the result of a surveillance program truly represent the largely undetected/unseen cases in the vast population.",14.136296579757921,6.803261998625454

Hypothesis generation and subsequent analysis requires careful assembly, overlay, and comparison of data from divergent sources. Importance of database-driven information sharing in drug discovery can be demonstrated by large-scale production of taxol ( Fig. 2.8) . In 1962, a team of researchers in National Cancer Institute in US discovered that extracts of Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia) contained cytotoxic activity. In 1977, the team confirmed the bioactive component of the extract as paclitaxel, also known by its trade name taxol. After starting clinical phase I in 1984 against number of cancer types, taxol was approved by the FDA for the treatment of ovarian cancer and breast cancer. However, supply of paclitaxel was a major challenge as this compound is found in the thin bark of Taxus in extremely low concentration. The bark from a single tree could provide only a single dose for clinical trial leading to the destruction of whole plant. Large-scale production of taxol was made by developing several pathways to derive 10-deactyl-baccatin III, a non-cytotoxic precursor of taxol. This precursor was initially isolated in France (Institute de Chimie des Substances Naturelles, Gif-sur-Yvette) from the needles of European yew Taxus baccata by the French scientists (Raviña, 2011) . One kilogram of fresh needles can provide 1 g of precursor, making it possible for large-scale supply of taxol.

If one particular database could not provide a complete picture of a medicinal plant, data mining and sharing from different resources may be utilized. Such items need unique identification number for a particular plant or a particular entity. These databases are required to provide phytochemical and pharmacological information on medicinal plants.

Three relationships were considered: financial resources flows, cooperation (joint planning and implementation), and information sharing. Strengths of the three relationships were measured by asking respondents to assign individual qualitative scores using grouped ordinal and interval approaches. They were asked to describe frequency (as high, medium, low, or not applicable) and intensity (as high, medium, low, or not applicable) of the relationships and based on both, they scored each as either non-existent, weak, medium, strong, or very strong. Often, as noted in (29), respondents experienced difficulties scoring each relation independently and were allowed to collapse the three and use one score instead. To construct some true interval-level measure, we converted the qualitative scores into quantitative values using a scale of 0–8 as in no linkage (0), weak (1 or 2), medium (3 or 4), strong (5 or 6), and very strong (7 or 8). The decision to assign a lower or higher score for, let us say, medium was based on described frequency and intensity of interactions. The approach to an extent balanced the predispositions of the researcher and the respondent's descriptions, whereas the continuous measure of the relationships allowed estimation of statistical measures. The quantitative scores were plotted in a matrix. UCINET software (30) generated SNA sociograms and statistical measures (density, clustering coefficients, degree of closeness, and between-ness) of relationship strength. The statistical measures were estimated to understand the extent of relationships, and stakeholder power and influence within the OH network. Centrality statistics of actor degree, closeness (or farness), and between-ness reflect power and influence within the network. Degree measures describe the way an actor is embedded in a network while closeness refers to how close they are to others. High in-degree values for a stakeholder reflect a position where others want to influence it, for example, through information sharing. High out-degree measure for a stakeholder reflects a position of where it wants to influence those linked to them. Between-ness refers to a position of an actor in a network as in between several pairs of actors, or no other actors lie between them and other actors.

animals and bulk tank milk testing for bovine viral diarrhea in Japan","In this study, it was observed that lower BVDV prevalence resulted in smaller gaps in
vaccination coverages with respect to both the number of detected and missed animals (Fig. 3). Ultimately, under very low BVDV prevalence,
the monitoring effectiveness at 0% of vaccination coverage was not apparently different from
that at 100%. These findings may trigger suggestions for reviewing implementation of
compulsory testing to introduced non-vaccinated animals because, under very low BVDV
prevalence, the efficacy of compulsory testing would be rarely affected by vaccination
coverage. It indicates, if efficacy of monitoring programs were not different, many of
stakeholders might select the cheaper program to decrease financial burdens. However, this
change would require intensive discussion with convincing scientific evidence because it
should be implemented under the hypothesis that the very low prevalence of BVDV is
maintained by proper biosecurity measures with different stakeholders in outside of the
target area. Otherwise, BVDV would spread rapidly among sensitive cattle in outside of the
target area that has not been conferred enough immunity to prevent its re-infection by
vaccination, and then might be introduced to the target area by animal movement. This would
be supported by the model analysis that low compliance with the eradication program owing to
lack of proper epidemiological information sharing due to revising the program during its
implementation may accelerate BVDV re-infection [38].
Indeed, it is not practical to abolish BVD vaccination in Japan because BVD vaccines, both
attenuated or inactivated, are widely used in Japan together with several major virus
antigens in cattle as mixed vaccine; hence we cannot quit BVD vaccination easily only due to
decrease of BVD prevalence.",11.338730247120854,6.438072662507771

In diseases of mucosal-associated tissues such as cystic fibrosis (CF), successful delivery of gene and drug therapies remains a significant challenge due to an abnormally concentrated viscoelastic mucus, which prevents ~99% of all drugs and particles from penetrating the mucus barrier and the underlying epithelia for effective therapy, resulting in decreased survival. We used combinatorial peptide-presenting phage libraries and nextgeneration sequencing to identify hydrophilic, close to net-neutral charged peptides that penetrate the mucus barrier ex vivo in sputum from CF patients with ~600-fold better penetration than a positively charged control. After mucus penetration, nanoparticles conjugated with our selected peptides successfully translocated into lung epithelial cells derived from CF patients and demonstrated up to three-fold improved cell uptake compared to non-modified carboxylated-and gold standard PEGylated-nanoparticles. The selected peptides act as surface chemistries with synergistic functions to significantly improve the ability of drug delivery systems to overcome the human mucosal barriers and provide efficient cellular internalization. Our screening strategy provides a biologically-based discovery assay that directly addresses transport through mucus and cell barriers and has the potential to advance drug and gene delivery to multiple mucosal barriers.",9.738191583356256,8.092891339967993

For instance, we note that data being disseminated to the public are often for purposes of information sharing and education rather than to guide detailed decision making. Moreover, with increasing incidence, less information is provided publicly about cases at the individual-level, leading to lack of information on sex, age, and status (importation versus local transmission) for the majority of cases in South Africa, for instance.

How can a membrane structure access the state of local energy minimum between two energy barriers? How does the system transition from a single energy barrier for homogeneous boundaries (Figs. 3 and 4) to two barriers when a gradient in spontaneous curvature at the boundaries is imposed? To answer these questions, we next investigated how the aligned and anti-aligned switches are controlled by the spontaneous curvature gradient at the exterior boundary. To do so, we compute the spontaneous curvature at the top and bottom of the inner ramp for various C 1 /C 0 ratios and fixed helicoid pitch (P/(2πL) = 0.05). As shown in Fig. 6 , the aligned and anti-aligned switches vanish at a distinct value of the boundary gradient in spontaneous curvature. This mechanism can be understood using simple symmetry arguments: for C 1 = C 0 no variation in spontaneous curvature in the z-direction can exist, implying that the anti-aligned switch must vanish ( Fig. 5 and Fig. 6f ). On the contrary, for C 1 = −C 0 , the boundary condition imposes the spontaneous curvature along the z-axis to be symmetric with respect to the mid-plane of the helicoid. This therefore requires the aligned switch to vanish (Fig. 6b) . Every time the inner ramp radius passes a critical value, the limits in spontaneous curvature associated with the vanishing switch take opposite signs.",8.91118109617731,6.6468840076320905
