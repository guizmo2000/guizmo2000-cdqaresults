For example, disease prevention behavior including vaccination may be promoted if information accessibility is heightened and an individual's health information-seeking capacity is strengthened in populations with serious health inequality, especially for those with low income [16, 25] . Previous studies have mainly focused on determining risk factors for health inequality. Studies on protective factors have been insufficient. This study reveals how health communication variables are linked to vaccination status. Consequently, it is critical to consider policies that will reduce health disparities stemming from communication inequality by providing useful information on new infectious diseases or vaccination in an easily accessible manner to n.s. not significant *: p < 0.05, **: p < 0.01, ***: p < 0.001 vulnerable groups often excluded from valuable healthrelated information. From the perspective of health communication, it cannot be stated with certainty that the use of media or exposure to specific health information will lead to respondents' behavior only in a positive direction (e.g., vaccination uptake). This is because while content of news is thoroughly verified for network television, information on the Internet includes inaccurate and misleading news and anti-vaccine information as well. Such organizations create closed or secret websites and exchange information among themselves to avoid social controversy. Our study used searches only on Internet news, excluding social networking services (SNS) and blogs to preserve integrity and reliability. To understand how specific health information through certain media is distributed about people's health behavior, content analysis and small-scale qualitative research are critical. Before exploring this stage, our study sought to understand vaccination behavior from the viewpoint of population-based behavioral medicine. Future studies should explain how diverse communication choices affect being vaccinated. In a small country with outstanding media environment including South Korea, it is difficult to understand ultimate health results from the selection of communication channels.

A Case Study of Qatar Experience in Emergency Risk Communication during the MERS-CoV Outbreak,"Abstract: This case study is the first to be developed in the Middle East region to document what happened during the response to the 2013 MERS outbreak in Qatar. It provides a description of key epidemiologic events and news released from a prime daily newspaper and main Emergency Risk Communication (ERC) actions that were undertaken by public health authorities. Using the Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) theoretical framework, the study analyzes how the performed ERC strategies during the first days of the outbreak might have contributed to the outbreak management. Methods: MERS-CoV related events were chronologically tracked, together with the relevant stories that were published in a major newspaper over the course of three distinct phases of the epidemic. The collected media stories were then assessed against the practiced emergency risk communication (ERC) activities during the same time frame. Results: The Crisis & Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) framework was partially followed during the early days of the MERS-CoV epidemic, which were characterized by overwhelming uncertainty. The SCH's commitment to a proactive and open risk communication strategy since day one, contributed to creating the SCH's image as a credible source of information and allowed for the quick initiation of the overall response efforts. Yet, conflicting messages and over reassurance were among the observed pitfalls of the implemented ERC strategy. Conclusion: The adoption of CERC principles can help restore and maintain the credibility of responding agencies. Further work is needed to develop more rigorous and comprehensive research strategies that address sharing of information by mainstream as well as social media for a more accurate assessment of the impact of the ERC strategy.",30.26224718915261,11.669651866449843

The success or failure of vector control rests mainly on the nature and scale of the behavioural response of exposed populations. Large-scale adoption of recommended protective behaviour represents a critical challenge that cannot be addressed without a better understanding of how individuals perceive and react to the risk of infection. Recently, French overseas territories faced large-scale outbreaks: an epidemic of chikungunya fever in La Réunion and Mayotte (2005)(2006) and four successive outbreaks of dengue fever in one Caribbean island, Martinique (1995Martinique ( -2007. To assess how these populations perceived and responded to the risk, and how the nature and scale of protection affected their clinical status, socioepidemiological surveys were conducted on each island during the outbreaks. These surveys address three crucial and interconnected questions relevant to the period after persons infected by the virus were identified: which factors shape the risk of acquiring disease? Which sociodemographic characteristics and living conditions induce a higher likelihood of infection? What is the impact of risk perception on protective behaviours adopted against mosquito bites? Grounded on the results of these surveys, a general framework is proposed to help draw out the knowledge needed to reveal the factors associated with higher probability of infection as an outbreak emerges. The lessons learnt can inform health authorities' efforts to improve risk communication programmes, both in terms of the target and content of messages, so as to explore new strategies for ensuring sustainable protective behaviour. The authors compare three epidemics of vector-borne diseases to elucidate psychosocial factors that determine how populations perceive and respond to the risk of infectious disease.

Development of a pandemic vaccine was a scientific success, but limited availability until after the autumn/winter wave had nearly peaked in the Northern Hemisphere contributed to lower coverage than anticipated [33] . Vaccination coverage depended on many factors, including availability, preordering, licensing and bureaucratic hurdles, logistics, convenience, and, most crucially, public and professional perceptions. This pandemic presented a particular risk communication challenge, since while infection usually results in mild illness, occasionally it is lethal, even in the young and previously healthy despite optimal treatment [34] [35] [36] . In the absence of any excess risk of serious side effects compared to annual seasonal vaccines [37] (despite the intensive effort to look for such) the benefits of immunisation far outweighed any potential down-sides at the individual level, particularly for those at higher risk for complications. Notwithstanding such evidence, the cost of pandemic vaccines was considerable and a loss of public confidence has sometimes been triggered by unsubstantiated media reports of serious side effects with a ''new vaccine'' that utilised the same manufacturing technology as for years of seasonal vaccines. Uptake among health care providers as role models has been mixed, as has their expression of the need for vaccination at all. This sometimes cast doubt in the minds of the public. Conversely, pandemic deaths in young healthy people abruptly changed public perception (such as in Canada, Romania, and Finland); supply and organisational issues then became crucial.",19.616560787132354,6.256329051371504

These assessments would require microbial analysis of wildlife carcasses and investigations of the wild meat production chain to examine environmental conditions and hygienic practices (Gill 2007; for producing a final risk estimate (CAC 1999) . Some interview-based surveys of wildlife hunters and consumers in Southeast Asia have investigated the social and cultural factors driving wild meat consumption (Drury 2011; Scheffers et al. 2012) , and this methodology could be applied in Malaysia to examine how people's behaviour influences their risk of zoonoses. Such information may contribute to public health initiatives that focus on the health and safety of people involved in the wild meat trade.",22.420908759880476,10.359310895996236

The timely launch of our multi-channel risk communication program to all Taipei citizens on Friday, October 12, allowed us to provide clear instructions to families on how to prevent the infection at home over the course of weekend, when infection rates would normally increase. These direct communication methods successfully convinced parents to keep their symptomatic children at home (from 10% to 60% in Table 3 ). With contagious students confined to their homes, school transmissions decreased dramatically and public health officials were able to contain the Taipei outbreak quickly. The effectiveness of these innovative methods in the heavily populated metropolitan area of Taipei City was evidenced by how quickly the epidemic, which had infected 5414 students, subsided after 2 weeks. This can be compared with the two months that were needed to control Taipei's previous CV-24 epidemic in 1987 [28] .

These results again confirmed our hypothesis that the Chinese online community reacted more strongly to an outbreak that happened in China than one outside China. Drawing on the social amplification of risk model [31] , public risk perception is shaped by a process of interplays between psychological, cultural, social, and institutional factors that may result in amplifying or attenuating the public attention to risk. Mass communication is among the list of factors. Public health officials have long recognised the role of the mass media in disseminating risk and emergency information before, during, and after a catastrophe [32] . The World Health Organization establishes guidelines for ""effective media communication"", through which the authorities are able to disseminate information to the public [33] . Communication during crisis was traditionally understood to be a one-way and top-down process, in which the public are assumed to be ""deficient"" in knowledge, while the scientists, public health experts, and emergency managers, are ""sufficient"" [34] . But this presumption was profoundly challenged by the emergence of social media. For instance, Leung and Nicoll argued that the 2009 H1N1 pandemic was the first pandemic in which social media ""challenged conventional public health communication"" [35] . In China, online messages were published ahead of the official statement in the 2008 Sichuan Earthquake [36] . Social media enabled people under crisis to share information and experience and to seek message credibility and confirmation via multiple media platforms and social networks [34] . Our study demonstrated that official data released by health authorities, whether in Beijing or Geneva, received strong reactions in the Chinese online community. With such knowledge, social media should be incorporated in the best practices for risk and crisis communication [37] . Social media data can also provide health authorities, researchers and the media a quantifiable measure of public attention towards a particular disease outbreak [11] .",23.082412066354475,7.1604493529130435

The increased circulation of RSV that coincided with the peak of SARI cases may be informative for clinicians to predict an epidemic due to RSV and to choose the most appropriate care for patients in order to avoid overuse of antibiotics.

Overlaying risk perception and epidemic curves suggests that when agents made decisions in isolation (M1: In-I), the dynamics of risk perception were hardly realistic (Fig 5a) . Namely, when the epidemic was at its peak, household agents in M1 responded very slowly, with BN1 delivering a wrong evaluation of risk perception (Fig 5a) . They became aware of the risks very late, so when the epidemic vanished, the number of agents with risk perception = 1 kept increasing. In the absence of communication and experience sharing among peers (In-I), the information about disease spread slowly and there was a significant time-lag between the occurrence of the disease and people's awareness.

It is difficult to invoke direct anti-inflammatory macrolide effects as responsible for large clinical benefits persisting to 9 months after treatment completion. Antimicrobial effects, against specific respiratory pathogens or against the general lung microbiome, remain likely possibilities. Circumstantial evidence suggests that macrolide treatment effects may, at least in part, be attributable to antimicrobial actions against chronic atypical infections [9, 87] . This issue is by no means settled and requires further research that may be challenging given the selection biases noted above coupled with likely low sensitivity of lung sampling leading to false negative diagnosis of, for example, chronic CP lung infection [20] . Fig. 2 Azithromycin improves asthma symptoms and patient quality of life. Subjects with severe refractory asthma treated with azithromycin (Open Label) had fewer persisting asthma symptoms a and greater asthma quality of life b than groups with lesser asthma severity randomized to azithromycin or to placebo [44] Azithromycin is generally well tolerated and is widely used for a variety of acute respiratory illnesses. Concerns about adverse effects of azithromycin include development of antibiotic resistance, sudden cardiac death, hearing loss and effects on the host mcrobiome. Development of resistance is a possibility whenever antibiotics are used; azithromycin is no exception. However, there are no reports of patient harm from resistant organisms in any cardiorespiratory trial performed to date [89] . Rather, the only detectable clinical effects of azithromycin in these trials were decreased incidences of sinusitis, acute bronchitis and pneumonia, and less use of other antibiotics [88, 89] . Sudden cardiac death attributable to azithromycin (1 in 4000 prescriptions in high cardiac risk patients) was plausibly documented in an epidemiologic study of a Medicaid population in Tennessee [91] . The same risk was also present for a quinolone (levofloxacin). Subsequent population-based studies in average risk populations showed no increased risk of sudden death [92, 93] . Mild hearing loss was reported in an excess of <1% of heart disease subjects randomized to 600 mg azithromycin once weekly for 12 months [88, 90] . Hearing test changes leading to discontinuation of azithromycin occurred in 2.8% of 1142 severe COPD subjects randomized to 250 mg azithromycin daily for 1 year [90] . The clinical significance of these hearing test changes is unclear. Notably, it is likely that daily azithromycin dosing is unnecessary [94] and may lead to increased adverse events [91] .

Elderly people have a significantly higher risk of influenza-associated death compared with non-elderly people. 48 Additionally, the 2009 pandemic in NZ revealed that the risk of hospitalization and death was markedly higher for Maori and Pacific people, and those from the most deprived socioeconomic groups. 3, 42, 49 However, it is not clear whether these sociodemographic factors are independent risk factors for influenza. Furthermore, some chronic health conditions (high body mass index, asthma and pregnancy) have been shown to increase the risk of having a poor outcome from influenza infection.

Through the increasing use of molecular techniques for the study of the ARDS disease process, we have gained a great deal of knowledge related to the development, progression, and resolution of this devastating condition. One major hope for the application of this knowledge is to further characterize subpopulations within what is widely regarded as an extremely heterogeneous disease, which may then lead to the development of specific therapies tailored toward the pathophysiological changes found in each subpopulation. Preliminary steps in this process were realized recently with the description of a biomarker ""panel"" for ARDS (83) and the publication of a latent class analysis of two ARDS clinical trials by Calfee et al. who described two subphenotypes, hyper-and hypo-inflammatory, with differential clinical responses to the trial interventions (189) . These findings were based on the analysis of clinical characteristics and multiple biomarkers and hold promise that further subphenotyping might be used to guide the design of future clinical trials, such as those targeting Th2 high vs. Th2 low populations in asthma (190) . Though no clear ARDS subphenotypes have yet been identified in pediatric patients, it would seem that the same principles could reasonably be applied. It is also important to recognize that information from biomarkers in pARDS may provide value both in terms of their ability to improve risk stratification and also to better define the pathophysiology of this heterogeneous condition. Better risk stratification will allow for well-designed trials of pARDS therapies and improved prognostication for families. In counterpoint, improved understanding of the pathological mechanisms that lead to pARDS and regulate its resolution may form the bases for the development of novel therapies.",17.425767577424818,7.526256983833821

However, the scarcity of the data at the animal-human interface impedes the use of data-driven models like the stratified (animal-human) SEIR models, contact networks models, etc. Moreover, in order to analyze and simulate the complete pattern of the disease, there is also a need to capture the behaviors of animals and people (63) . The individual-based model built on multi-agents systems is a computerized system combining multiple interacting agents (e.g., humans, animals) within a given environment (64) . Such a model could be built in close interaction with stakeholders (farmers, camel workers, etc. (65)) and could drive toward more precise hypotheses about initial transmissions to humans (66) . This EOE study has several limitations but it is a preliminary step for implementing a more comprehensive risk assessment. Risk assessment is a time-consuming and iterative process that needs to be fed by several sources of data, lab experiments and field observations (see Table 3 for a summary of recommended studies). Risk communication, which is part of the risk analysis and closely linked to the risk assessment, is essential, especially considering that MERS is a major public health issue and could have indirect economic and social impacts on the ""dromedary world.

Once limited local transmission has begun, arrival screening could still have merit as a means to restrict the number of parallel chains of transmission present in a country. Once there is generalized spread which has outpaced contact tracing, departure screening to prevent export of cases to new areas will be more valuable than arrival screening to identify additional incoming cases. Altogether, screening should not be viewed as a definitive barrier to case importation, but used alongside on-the-ground response strategies that help reduce the probability that any single imported case spreads to cause a self-sustaining local epidemic.

In case of an emerging infectious disease, as Influenza A (H1N1), it is very difficult to predict the further course of the outbreak. It is important that health authorities present a range of scenarios, not only worst-case but also other, more positive, scenarios. In the beginning of an outbreak, there are many uncertainties about the infectiousness and case fatality rate of the disease. Health authorities should not only communicate with the public about 'what is known' (the certainties), but they should also communicate about 'what is not known' (the uncertainties). In course of the outbreak, when more information becomes available, public health authorities should update their messages to achieve effective risk communication. This is essential not only to instruct and motivate the public to take preventive measures, but also to build trust in public health authorities and prevent misconceptions. Besides rational arguments (such as perceived severity and efficacy of measures), emotional aspects like anxiety play a role in decision making concerning preventive behaviour. Health authorities should acknowledge these emotional aspects and take these arguments into account in their risk communication with the general public.",25.027635821180414,9.442625562441254

It is surely not necessary to include all 26 items listed as ''essential information for prospective research subjects'' in the CIOMS International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research [4] . It is important, however, for investigators to ensure that individuals understand that what they are consenting to is research, and not routine activities carried out by public health practitioners during a disease outbreak. Nevertheless, ensuring a participant's understanding of the difference between public health practice and research may be complicated by the emotional distress that potential participants can experience during an outbreak situation. Although appropriate steps are needed when participants become vulnerable in such situations, that would not change the level of risk from minimal to more than minimal risk. The level of risk is determined by the procedures in the research proposal and not by the characteristics of the population. When populations are vulnerable for whatever reason, the approach to participants in research requires establishing safeguards or added protections. Such safeguards can range from specifying exclusion criteria for potential subjects in great distress to taking steps to work sensitively to protect the rights and interests of marginalized populations.

We found that the perceived level of risk was low to moderate, the use of responsive actions that required little extra effort was fairly adequate, and the association between responsive behavior and risk perception was not stable. The perceived risk of infection increased over the course of the emergency. This increase in perceived risk was consistent with the increase in the number of new cases of H1N1 (Fig 1) . The perceived risk of being unable to obtain the necessary medicine and medical care increased first and then decreased over time. This may be explained by the characteristics of the flu outbreak. When the H1N1 influenza first broke out, vaccines were not available, and people knew little about the curability of the disease. As time passed, the H1N1 influenza became familiar, a vaccine was available, and the virus was shown to be mild, which made the respondents less worried. Most respondents took hygiene and personal protective measures that could be practiced in their daily lives even without a public health emergency, such as ventilating rooms and washing hands.

Therefore, providing accurate information and data to the public will be important in managing future crises. Song et al.

While most studies on infectious disease ecology focus on the dynamics of a single host species and single pathogen, we acknowledge that more research is needed to address the complexities of multi host-pathogen dynamics [148] . Community ecology, with its emphasis on the composition of and interconnections between ecological communities, allows one to understand infectious disease dynamics in multi-pathogen, multi-host disease systems that occur across diverse scales (e.g., from within a single host, to between species, to between regions) [148] . Other topics of importance deserving further study in bat species of Western Asia include: effects of extreme weather (e.g., heat waves) on bat survival, including changes in the distribution of bat species (and associated pathogens) and changes in prey abundance or food resources that could alter reproductive patterns and disease transmission [149, 150] . For example, increased prevalence of Marburg virus (MARV) in Rousettus aegyptiacus colonies corresponded with defined periods of synchronized parturition (which resulted in an influx of immunologically-naive, juvenile bats), as well as an increased incidence of spillover into human populations [77] . If such virus-host associations exist in regional bat species, climatic changes may affect reproductive phenology in bats, and therefore the timing of peak viral spillover into human populations.

The challenge for the regulatory agencies such as FDA or USDA is to balance the risks of a new technology against the benefits of that technology. There is an extensive framework already in place with the FDA for conducting the assessment of the functional risks, and a framework is continuing to evolve within the USDA for assessment of production risks for PMVs.

How members of the public and investors come to their estimates is a complex area, which is difficult to elucidate. For instance, there may be an element of herd behaviour, in which individuals partly base their decisions on the behaviour of others (Edmunds & Gay, 2006; McInnes, 2005) . This would tend to result in behaviour that is sensitive to random events and dependent on the choices of those that first react, but is also sensitive to new information and thus easily reversed (Bikchandani & Sharma, 2001) . Alternatively, the rapid and widespread reduction in travel and tourism, for instance, in SARS affected areas may simply have been the result of large numbers of people making similar decisions given roughly similar data sets. This behaviour is less sensitive to new information and less easily reversed. The reasons behind observed actions are therefore important as they can affect the likely impact of different risk communication strategies and the rapidity by which demand recovers following an outbreak.",27.041206870916305,8.958655458743358

In considering this, it is important to locate the analysis with respect to the two broad models of risk used in the social sciences. The first is the 'realist' approach, where risk is seen as an objective threat or danger that can be measured independently of the social context within which it occurs (Kahneman, Slovic, & Tversky, 1982) . The second is the 'social constructionist' approach, which sees risk as a threat or danger that is constructed through social and cultural processes, and cannot be demonstrated to be independent of such processes (Joffe, 2003; Lupton, 1999; Washer, 2006) . The latter is increasingly seen as a key conceptualisation; indeed, the term 'risk society' has been coined to describe the apparent perception of the postindustrial post-modern society as being at constant 'risk' of something, from credit-card fraud to terrorist attack (Beck, 1992) . Although this has been challenged in some cases (e.g. Kitzinger & Reilly, 1997) , what is important in this conceptualisation is not necessarily that populations are in permanently heightened states of anxiety, but how populations develop defence mechanisms to control their anxiety (Joffe, 1999) . In this paper a more 'material-discursive' position is adopted that views both conceptualisations as having some validity; that a 'risk' contains both a materially measurable element of the probability of an event, and a socially constructed element of how that probability/event is perceived by the individual and society (Yardley, 1997) . In this way a contrast can be seen through the examination of the impact of SARS between what is understood from a realist perspective (the materially measurable probability of, for instance, infection with SARS, various outcomes of infection and the effectiveness of different strategies to prevent infection) versus the social constructed perception of those probabilities as 'risk'.",21.611187750447613,8.511869574235963

The applicability of such events to bioterrorism, however, may be limited because of bioterrorism's intentional nature and the relative unfamiliarity of both the public and medical community with the likely agents. It is important to understand how risk communication strategies can best address sociocultural differences.

Vaccination of one-humped camel herds could be feasible as these animals are often kept/raised/sold by humans, and wild animals could be identified relatively easily. However, some adult one-humped camels tested positive for MERS-CoV despite the presence of anti-MERS-CoV antibodies [38, 39] , and pre-existing neutralizing anti-MERS-CoV antibodies do not necessarily protect against re-infection with MERS-CoV [39] . This observation suggests that camel vaccination may have to Review Papaneri, Johnson, Wada, Bollinger, Jahrling & Kuhn be repeated regularly or may not be effective at all. Probably even more unrealistic is the vaccination of bats due to sheer number of these relatively small and (dependent on species) often quite abundant animals. The absence of a clearly defined zoonotic virus ecology prompts researchers to contemplate development of human vaccines. As MERS tends to be acute and is not yet widespread, targeting specific human populations at high risk of infection for vaccination is a logical strategy for prevention or limitation of infections. Development and distribution of vaccines should, therefore, be expedited for one-humped camel handlers and herders, healthcare workers and veterinarians, and travelers to areas where MERS-CoV infection is prevalent.

The previous models assume that risk managers base their view of the public risk perception on some kind of direct observation-for example, through clamour, media activity, surveys and so on. In practice, the managerial view is at least partly based on the public's consumption of the amenity that is risk, for example the consumption of beef during the BSE crisis, or flight bookings and hotel reservations during the SARS outbreak. The problem is that when a foodstuff like beef becomes a risk object it may be easy for many people to stop consuming it, and such a response from the consumer's perspective can be proportionate to even a mild risk assessment. Reducing beef consumption is an easy precaution for most of the population to take (Frewer, 2003) , so rational even when there is little empirical evidence that there is a risk at all (Rip, 2006) . Yet this easy response of boycotting beef may be disastrous for the beef industry, and therefore seem highly disproportionate to the industry, to related industries and to government agencies supporting the industry. Unfortunately there is considerable difficulty in quantifying this effect in general terms. Recent work (Mehers, 2011) looking at the effect of heightened risk perceptions around the avian influenza outbreak at a meat processing plant suggests that the influence on the demand for the associated meat products was very mixed. Different regions and different demographic groups showed quite different reactions, for example, and the effect was confounded by actions (particularly price changes) taken by manufacturer and retailers. Our approach is to represent the disproportionality effect with a single exogenous factorthe relative substitutability of the amenity for similar amenities on the supply and demand side. The risk manager interprets any change in public demand for the amenity multiplied by this factor as being the change in public risk perception. If the change in this inferred public risk perception exceeds that observed directly (for example by opinion survey), then it becomes the determinant of how risk managers think the public are viewing the risk in question. This relative substitutability is entirely a function of the specific industry (and so risk manager) in question: there is no 'societal' value for such a parameter, and the effects of a given risk perception on amenity demand will always be case specific. For example, Brahmbhatt and Dutta (2008) reported that the SARS outbreak led to revenue losses in Beijing of 80% in tourist attractions, exhibitions and hotels, but of 10-50% in travel agencies, airlines, railways and so on. The effects are substantial but a long way from being constant.",19.66314430381633,7.909532712608795

The idea that in a society the perception of a risk becomes exaggerated to the point where it bears no relation to our best expert assessments of the risk is an attractive one for policymakers having to deal with what seem to be grossly inflated or grossly under-played public reactions to major events. But this idea has always been vulnerable to the criticism that we cannot know objectively if a risk is being exaggerated, and that expert assessments are as much a product of social processes as lay opinion. The question we posed at the start of the paper was whether, in dropping a commitment to the idea of an objective risk amplification, there is anything left to model and anything left to say to policymakers. Our work suggests that there is, and that modelling risk amplification as something that one social actor thinks another is doing is a useful thing to do. There were some simple policy implications emerging from this modelling. For example, once you accept that there is no objective standard to indicate when risk amplification is occurring, actors are likely to correct for other actors' apparent risk amplifications and attenuation, instead of simple-mindedly correcting their own risk beliefs. This can have a strongly polarising effect on risk beliefs, and can produce residual worry and loss of demand for associated products and services after a crisis has passed. The limitations of the work point to further developments in several directions. First, there is a need to explore various aspects of how risk managers experience risk amplification. For example, the modelling, as it stands, concentrates on the interactions of actors in the context of a single event or issue-such as a specific zoonotic outbreak. In reality, actors generally have a long history of interaction around earlier events. We take account of history within an event, but not between events. A future step should therefore be to expand the timescale, moving from intra-event interaction to inter-event interaction. The superposition of a longer term process is likely to produce a model in which processes acting over different timescales interact and cannot simply be treated additively (Forrester, 1987) . It also introduces the strong possibility of discontinuities, particularly when modelling organisational or institutional actors like governments whose doctrines can change radically following elections-rather like the discontinuities that have to be modelled to represent personnel changes and consequences like scapegoating (Howick and Eden, 2004) .",21.144176080829656,7.517322932931148

Examining the relationship between pandemic communication and awareness and knowledge of MERS in the USA,"Public health practitioners face unique challenges when developing and implementing risk communication in times of emergencies, as there is limited information on the nature of the threat (including limited data regarding mortality and morbidity, transmission modes, and prevention measures), limited response time, the potential for severe health and economic consequences, media hype and public concern. All of these factors coalesce and intertwine with the diverse social and individual characteristics of the audience when developing emergency risk communication strategy. 1 -5 The need for effective communication plans that enable coherent, credible and timely communication and community engagement during public health emergencies is increasingly being seen as integral to emergency response and planning. 6, 7 One area where emergency response and planning is key is with large-scale disease outbreaks. Over the last decade, there has been a succession of large-scale outbreaks of influenza, including the SARS, Avian Flu (H5N1), new bird flu (H7N9) and H1N1 pandemics. These outbreaks raised fears among both scientists and laypeople that an emerging influenza outbreak could repeat the devastation of the Spanish flu of 1918. Governments and public health agencies recognize the importance of emergency risk communication and have invested significant resources in the development and implementation of public health and communication responses to these outbreaks. The stakes of conducting emergency risk communication are even higher during the early stages of an outbreak, as a treatment and/or vaccine is unlikely to be available for at least several weeks or months after the start of a pandemic. Emergency risk communication, such as raising awareness of the disease and promoting health prevention behaviors like hand washing, social distancing and cautioning vigilance among others, plays a vital role in controlling disease transmission. 2, 6, 7 One key importance is to study the association between social and individual factors and communication inequalities-differences among people from different socioeconomic positions (SEPs), racial, ethnic and geographical backgrounds, to understand how individuals access, interpret and act on messages they have received 1,5,8 -13 and to identify the best ways to quickly and effectively reach diverse populations with important preventive information. For example, low SEP individuals have been found to have lower levels of awareness and knowledge regarding pandemics, leading to poorer behavioral responses when dealing with an outbreak. 2,14 -17 However, as pandemic outbreaks are relatively infrequent, there has been a lack of evidence assessing whether the efforts and resources invested in the strategic risk communication during past pandemic outbreaks yielded public health benefits that improved preparedness. Gaining an understanding of whether or not the messages emphasized during the response to previous pandemics helped the public, particularly members of low SEP populations, become more aware and better prepared is invaluable. Therefore, the question that remains to be answered is: Does an awareness of past epidemic risk communication help people become more health aware of an emerging epidemic, or, on the contrary, have the past few pandemic communication experiences created a 'boy cries wolf ' effect, making people less attentive to information provided concerning pandemic outbreaks? 18, 19 In late 2012, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), a viral illness caused by a coronavirus, was first reported in Saudi Arabia. Although this particular virus had a very low probability of impacting the USA, major media outlets followed it closely, providing the American general public with an opportunity to become familiar with the outbreak. In this study, we assessed people's awareness of previous pandemic outbreaks and how that awareness affected their awareness and knowledge of MERS. We identified other predictors of MERS awareness and knowledge and investigated the information sources from which people who had heard of MERS first learned about it. We also identified a subgroup of people who had have not heard of most or all risk communication messages regarding five pandemics (i.e. SARS, Avian Flu (H5N1), new bird flu (H7N9), H1N1, and MERS) which have erupted in the past decade. The analyses in this paper will help inform and calibrate strategic risk communication during a future pandemic.",32.04149943549233,11.649798146026372

Customizing messages about risk to one's intended audience and communicating these messages to them via appropriate information channels are instrumental to running an effective communication campaign. 38 -44 It is notable that minority participants had both lower awareness of and less correct knowledge about MERS and that individuals with lower education and lower income were less likely to have an awareness of any pandemic, indicating the presence of communication inequalities in pandemic awareness among these subgroups. More research is needed on the awareness and knowledge of future pandemics in a diverse low SEP sample to best understand the impact of communication inequalities and how to address them through targeted campaigns. The current findings indicate a need to pay attention to segments that may not be actively seeking out information and to deliver it via channels that they use. Given the fact that few people reported that they had first learned about MERS through social media, our data suggested that national media such as TV are still important and social media, at least in times of pandemics, appear to be less effective.

Appropriate risk communication should provide sufficient, credible information to help the entire community accurately assess the risks in crisis situations. Effective risk communication can also enhance health care workers' participation during a pandemic or other risk-prone disaster. The audiences are the media (who can then more accurately disseminate information), health care professionals, staff, and the public. Although national health agencies have developed plans for risk communication at the national, regional, and local levels, few communities, hospitals, or local EMS agencies have such plans. [39] [40] [41] People naturally exaggerate the risk of phenomena that are unknown or ""dreaded,"" such as those with delayed, irreversible or manmade effects; that have new, unknown, or unobservable risks; or that are global. They also exaggerate the risks of phenomena ""hyped"" by the media. Conversely, people tend to play down risks with which they are familiar. In crises, risk communication helps health care workers and the public identify the actual risks to themselves and their loved ones and understand what others are doing and what they can do to avoid risk. 42 Specific risk communication methods help fearful populations to hear, understand, and remember messages better, including delivering no more than 3 brief, clear messages in their order of importance; repeating key messages; and using clear visual aids or demonstrations to help clarify the information (video is available online at http://www. annemergmed.com). 43 Senior clinicians in the ED and EMS can use risk communication strategies and also model behavior at the bedside, for example, demonstrating their belief that the protective measures in place are effective. They can also articulate the essential role that members of the health care team play in responding to a disaster. Many nonprofessionals in Toronto's SARS epidemic failed to show up to work because they believed that they were not valued or given important information (S. H. Gray, oral communication, 2005) . 44 This is paralleled by a recent study in Maryland, which found that 46% of the public health workers surveyed would be unlikely to report for work during a pandemic: one third said it was because they would not play an important role. 45 Crisis leaders should emphasize the vital role of all health care workers so that health care facilities and systems will have enough people available to function effectively.",39.666062795046955,13.879102893693641

Scientific knowledge about these topics in the area of infectious disease control is scarce. Neither is there knowledge if the theories and measures developed for risk perception research on, for example chronic diseases, can be applied in the area of infectious diseases. However, such knowledge is vital for effective control of newly emerging infectious diseases, because our ability to promote health protective behavioural change depends on our knowledge of important determinants of such behaviour [15] . For people to voluntarily engage in precautionary actions, they first of all need to be aware of the risk. Risk perception is a central feature in many health behaviour theories.

Once a tick gets on someone's body or cloths, they are likely to be there for many days if not checked properly. When they are in a desirable spot, they bite into the skin and begin to draw blood and remain attached to human body. After feeding, ticks may move to another body and bite or produce infected offspring by laying eggs. In this way ticks spread virus in urban areas also, even though they are far away from the forest areas. So, the humans or localities in vicinity of any infected person is also considered under the high risk prone zones which should be identified as soon as possible to control the spread of the virus. So instead of considering residential address only, the current geographic location of an infected user has been used here to distinguish and isolate the risk-prone areas. The objective of this module is to provide the real time information regarding the identification of infected population which can be a tough job for the government health authorities. After identifying the risk-prone zones, alert messages and infection control guidelines will be sent to the people close to those locations to control the spread of KFDV infection. The infected users will be diagnosed and monitored meticulously until their infection is fully recovered. In order to identify a newly infected user and risk-prone zone, the fog server has been committed to acquire continuous data from the user. Google Maps Javascript API [45] has been used to locate the infectious regions according to their GPS locations. The Google map represents and updates the risk-prone zones automatically to help the uninfected users and government healthcare agencies in controlling the spread of infection. Algorithm 2 has been developed to precisely locate the infected users and the risk-prone zones in real time scenario. Figure 6 shows the Google map based visualization of the KFD infected user along with the risk-prone zones. The highly suspicious infected users have been denoted by a red coloured pin whereas a probable case has been represented by a yellow star. Moreover, the risk-prone zones have been represented with shaded circles. Here, the Cachar district, Assam, India and its surrounding regions have been taken as references to show the Google map based alert service.

In addition, an alert will be sent to all the registered users who fall within the risk-prone areas to avoid from the contact of KFDV infection. Furthermore, an alert message with a list of guidelines will also be sent to all the registered users within the risk-prone areas. This alert system warns the users to follow the guidelines to control the further spreading of the infection. The prevention suggestions have been structured as shown in Table 5 .

The selection of a credible spokesperson facilitates effective information dissemination as the public receive information from diverse sources during the uncertain and chaotic situation of a health crisis. A study of public perceptions of information sources concerning bioterrorism, before and after anthrax attacks, indicated the importance of national and regional health officials as spokespersons in this event. 17 In response to the anthrax attacks of 2001, selecting credible spokespersons was found to be one of the challenges for the CDC, 18 and the use of multiple spokespersons and poor message control were found to result in the loss of CDC credibility. 19 A recent study regarding public health officials as potential spokespeople revealed that news stories containing interviews with public health officials were 15.2 times more likely to report quality information, after controlling for station affiliate or geographic location. 20 The characteristics and performance of official spokespersons would influence the public's actions and their perception and trust during crisis communication. 7, 13 In 2003, the first serious newly emerging infectious disease of the 21st century, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), struck Taiwan and spread through the health care system. 21, 22 Taiwan was added to the travel alert list by the World Health Organization from May 21 to July 5 of that year. Taiwan's number of SARS cases was the third highest in the world, after China and Hong Kong. 23 An increase of international media coverage due to the uncertain nature and rapid spread of the SARS pandemic was observed. 24 The SARS pandemic had a major impact on Taiwan, with the Taipei Municipal Hoping Hospital shutting down due to the occurrence of a mass infection, and largescale community quarantine. 21, 25, 26 The demand for news from the government was huge and the media scrutiny was strict. Influenced by media reporting, there was widespread fear and panic among the public. 26 The spokespersons' performance in front of a television camera and with reporters would have great impacts on delivering needed and correct information for disease prevention and control. 15 It is noted that, as a newly emerging infectious disease, the public understanding of the SARS pandemic was shaped in large part by the performance of public health officials as spokespersons for the national and local health departments as well as by the medical institutions through the daily press conference during the crisis period.",20.647440625681845,7.7828923912932755

It is specifically constructed by two dimensions: susceptibility and severity (Pask & Rawlins, 2016) . Susceptibility reflects one's perception of the likelihood of contracting a disease, whereas severity refers to one's perception of the seriousness or harmfulness of a disease (El-Toukhy, 2015; Rimal & Real, 2003) . In particular, when people perceive health-related risks, they not only rely on the cognitive aspects of the likelihood and severity of a healthrelated disease, but also use affective aspects of the worry, concern, or dread that a person feels about a health-related disease (e.g., Freimuth & Hovick, 2012; Oh, Paek, & Hove, 2015) .",22.681686160191877,8.383033121157432

Although this study focused not on the influence of exposure to a specific message but exposure to social media message, the different sources and types of news and information might result in different exposure effects. For instance, the perceived trustworthiness of information sources, such as media, government, and general public, is a significant factor determining the level of perceived risk and control over an infectious disease outbreak (Pickles & Goodwin, 2006) . Thus, future research needs to explore the role of social media information in terms of the sources and types of information in risk communication contexts.",19.353106897668017,8.046654739537427

The villagers' low perception of risk as well as their pro-voting in many cases can be considered to be a ""distorted"" action because the voters may be subject to economic temptation (such as the instant gain from mining). With this in mind, the agents of risk analysis and policymaking should be aware of the unique role that interest groups (such as mine owners) play in shaping policy choices. Apart from the involvement of an interest group, risk communication and risk management is understandable and people's responses are predictable. Once an interest group becomes involved in practicing, planning, or managing risk, the perceived risk as well as the interest-group's pro-voting becomes distorted, as revealed in the present study. Therefore, policy makers and managers involved in risk management should think twice about the desires of different interest groups before they act.",30.00100951006435,12.433341191347916

Through acting upon these behaviors and habits, we could lower this type of emerging risk. Currently EcoHealth Alliance has research sites in Uganda, Malaysia and Brazil; they are investigating the role played by habitat changes such as deforestation, human interaction with biodiversity through behavior and use. In Manaus in Brazil for example, the maximum risk of new infection is not in the heart of the city where the major markets are located, but in the peri-urban areas where agriculture and ranching are developing. These zones which ecologists call ''ecotones'', or transition zones, are located near strongly species-rich regions, with high concentrations of livestock which can come into contact with wild fauna, and which are furthermore inhabited by ranchers and farmers. These regions which are now located everywhere in the intertropical world for the purpose of feeding urban populations, are generally those where new infections appear, and where future pandemics will also most likely appear. At the heart of this research is the priority of understanding behaviors, habits and practices of populations with the goal of changing these factors. This is a long-term endeavor which requires developing approaches in the field for communicating with local populations, and for developing community participation in our own research, which we also consider an excellent means of education. O. Borraz recalled the fact that we live in a society of risk. It is not that the dangers surrounding us are more numerous or more fearsome than before, but simply that the notion of risk plays a central role in public policies, in public and private organizational management, and in the controversies around new technologies. Genetically modified organisms, mobile phones, nuclear waste, urban sanitation sludge; the activities now considered health or environmental risks are countless. This categorization puts public authorities in a position of having to ensure the safety of populations, even as the State itself sometimes represents a risk factor. It is therefore essential to understand how an activity becomes a risk, and how it is then managed by public authorities as well as by companies, associations and local conglomerates. Risk from its identification to its management, from its highlighting to its instrumentalization becomes a tool linked to the emergence and expansion of a welfare state. It is used by politicians to justify on the one hand its lack of involvement in risk management, on the other the seizing of power over sectors from which they had previously disengaged.

Those using voluntary quarantines may be individuals from epicenters, members of high-risk populations, or people highly concerned about possibly spreading the diseases through social or professional contacts. These people may employ measures such as home confinement for a certain period of time, avoidance of all unnecessary travel outside their homes, or self-imposed restricted movement for risk reduction purposes. Three medical professionals in Singapore voluntarily quarantined themselves either after developing fever symptoms or after learning that their patients were infected with SARS (Chia, 2003) .

As a limited regional risk-reduction effort, this trend of online debates signifies the metamorphosis of individuals into social beings as college students who pondered their social responsibility to the larger groups of families, communities, and the nation. These debates helped students create small initiatives that facilitated official attempts to compartmentalize and control a wide variety of high-risk spaces in Beijing. Such discussions clearly demonstrate students' sense of interdependence and interconnectedness that ""interfused biological, social, and political belongings,"" which foregrounds the notion of ""responsible citizens"" as their master trope of identity (Wald 2008, 79) . These debates also suggested the importance of emotions and values in people's experiences of and responses to health risks, as Katz and Miller (1996) stress in their affective-value model of risk communication.

In this case, taking into account such features as metaphorical attractiveness for readers and their ability to draw attention [67, 68] more easily than other linguistic devices, metaphors prove to be an efficient tool in risk communication. One way is to look at risks through the perspective of Pending Danger (Damocles' Sword) that is characterized by the artificiality of risk source, visible catastrophic potentiality and the threat of randomness as far as victims are concerned. The next perspective is the one called Slow Killers (Pandora's Box) that entail artificial elements in food, water or air that have delayed effects on one's health; they are determined by information coverage and are easy to blame. The third one can be named Cost-Benefit Ratio (Athena's Scale) and it is strictly related to monetary gains and losses, characterized by an asymmetry between risks and gains, directed at a variance of distribution and dominated by probabilistic thinking.

Another issue important in risk communication is called disaster fatigue and it concerns situations when the general public is faced with information on different diseases [41] . Taking into account the multitude of data on health-related risks in the media, the aim of information creators is to use such linguistic resources to communicate food-borne diseases that draw stakeholders' attention to important issues. Their proper selection is important since the way food-borne diseases are pictured shapes an attitude towards them. For example, the events that are quickly perceived in one's mind are rated as more probable than the ones that require more effort as far as perception and comprehension are concerned [38] .

Communications with external audiences provide updates and direction for the audience. 29, 30 In most cases, external communication is handled by a public information officer (PIO) in HICS to maintain consistency of message and centralized knowledge of information and resources shared or requested. 6 The facility should anticipate and plan for follow-up questions on background, implications of the outbreak, and speculations. 4 The CDC's CERC combines elements of crisis communication (informing or alerting the community of an emerging pathogen) and risk communication (providing the community with information about the expected type and magnitude of an outcome), giving a set of principles that teach effective communication before, during, and after an emergency. 31 CERC also addresses how to communicate effectively in situations of evolving guidance and findings, and addresses the imperfect nature of choices made during a crisis. 31 The principles of CERC have been defined as follows:",25.031123352049416,9.222832514792204

As asymptomatic people are capable of transmitting the infetion, these asymptomatic, low risk population is vital in playing a role to curb the uprising of HIV infection. This study aim to provide preliminary data on HIV prevalence among perceived low risk patient in a specialist center in Malaysia. A retrospective study was done where data of 6,963 patients that were screened for HIV antibody/antigen by chemiluminescence imunoassay (CLIA) during the year 2013 until 2016 were examined. These patients undergo HIV screening as a routine either before cardiac procedure or as part of antenatal checkup. There were no high risk behaviour recorded. Those reactive by CLIA were then confirmed by particle agglutination test. There were 22 (0.3%) new cases detected during the screning. Ninety six percent of them were male. Majority of them (90%) in the age range of 35-60 year. This study showed that screening detects small but significant percentage of new HIV cases among perceived low risk patients and this provides an oppoturnity for early diagnosis and management.",19.558366257228162,9.844996723927256

Drought causes plants to die, which leads to a decrease in rodent populations. Conversely, heavy snowfall and spring rains allow plants to flourish and rodent populations to surge. These surges in the rodent population cause rodents to compete for food and protection in the dryer months that follow. The competition puts pressure on some infected rodents, forcing them into peridomestic environments, putting more people at risk for infection. HPS is most common in spring and summer months, when rodents are most active. Although the overall risk for HPS in endemic areas is relatively low, infections are associated with an increased population of rodents in and around the house. Activities that put people in contact with rodent droppings, urine, or nesting materials place the individual at higher risk for infection. Indoor exposures have been linked to rodents in the home or near dwellings, especially in colder months. Cleaning buildings that have been closed up for a period of time, such as cabins, barns, and storage facilities, also increases the risk of exposure.",20.301980833881103,6.982945450380992

As mentioned, the surveillance of populations for explicit 'risk factors' affecting health indicates a shift in conceptualizations of illness as a phenomenon that transpires within the individual body to one that inhabits a novel 'extracorporal space' (Armstrong, 1995b, p. 395) . One outcome of this adjustment has historically been (and arguably, continues to be) that disease is attributed to specific populations and related spaces within society. The epidemiological understanding of 'risk groups' as neutral and empirical descriptions can inadvertently/intentionally result in the identification of these risk groups as responsible for the spread of disease. The presentation of 'risk groups' as arising from objective value-free criteria leads to the treatment of individuals as consumers who have unrestricted choice in their exposure to risks. Furthermore, the role of discrimination and marginalization within the construction of dominant understandings of risk groups and the reality that these risk groups often overlap with social groups is frequently overlooked. For example, the history of conflating AIDS risk groups with the gay population in the U.S. has not only reinforced existing attitudes of discrimination, but has also led to inadequate understandings of the disease (Fee and Krieger, 1993) . Simultaneously, the representation of disease in populations based on potential 'risk groups' versus social groupings, based on race, class or gender, effectively functions to depoliticize potentially contentious understandings and realities of health experiences.",18.7122786180384,6.163304744553811

Therefore, the influenza vaccine is recommended for all women who will be pregnant during influenza season, regardless of gestational age (57) . Varicella vaccination is recommended for susceptible women considering pregnancy at 1-3 months before pregnancy or post-partum. Vaccination may reduce the risk of congenital varicella syndrome and decrease morbidity from adult complications of varicella. The varicella vaccine is not recommended for use during pregnancy because it is a live-attenuated vaccine (78) . The current pneumococcal vaccine contains the purified capsular polysaccharide from the 23 serotypes that cause 85-90% of the infections. The vaccine is effective in decreasing the prevalence of pneumococcal pneumonia and is recommended to women with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, asplenia, sickle cell disease, diabetes, or chronic cardiopulmonary disease (44) . It may be given during pregnancy in women with the listed risk factors (79) . For women with children at home at the time of pregnancy, it may be useful to be sure that the children have received the new pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, since it can prevent disease in the children, which in turn may reduce the risk of maternal disease and of maternal infection with DRSP.",21.522298476854267,11.315636123831824

At the global level, international policies regulate trade in goods. As this partially predicts income distribution, governance, trade, and income are closely intertwined. At the national level, income mediates the effect of global governance on population health. A classic example is the debate over generic pharmaceutical production in developing countries that arose over the need for antiretroviral (ARV) medication for HIV. Under the TRIPS agreement created by the WTO, the production of patented medications was prohibited at the global level. The result was that national access to expensive medications was determined by national income; rich countries could afford to buy life-saving medication for their populations and poor countries could not. To pursue this example to the community level, countries with enough income to purchase limited supplies of ARVs might offer better health outcomes to high income communities that could afford the high prices. Alternatively, these nations might choose other distribution criteria, offering the medications to government employees or to those seeking care at a certain health facility. It is easy to understand how, in a community with high HIV prevalence, differential access to ARVs might erode social cohesion and trust (Bennett & Chanfreau, 2005) .

Much of this research has sought to understand the apparent acceptance or acquiescence displayed by local populations towards established hazards of the kind that are typically resisted when the subject of siting proposals. However, recent theoretical contributions, produced largely outside the field of risk research, have problematised the objective distinction between proximity and distance. In this paper we explore the potential of some of these ideas for furthering our understanding of the relationship between place and the constitution of risk subjectivities. To do this we re-examine a number of existing sociocultural studies that are predicated on a localised approach and conceptualise the relationship of physically proximate sources of risk to everyday experience in terms of practices of 'presencing' and 'absencing'. We conclude with some thoughts on the methodological and substantive implications of this reworking of proximity for future research into risk subjectivities.",20.733834428361607,9.203774416416927

Resource planning models can then assist to identify some of the resources necessary such as staffing and associated costs. Additional resources necessary for PODs include supplies and logistics, communications, outside partners, and political influences. Many of these planning considerations and identification of resources can be done pre-event, while others may occur during real time after the incident begins. Throughout step 2, it is necessary to assess funding at each stage of the process. For example, during an annual influenza vaccination campaign, funding may be limited. To have the largest community impact, planners may decide to use limited resources for PODs at elementary schools to target young children, an at-risk population that can spread disease quickly within the community, along with a few selected small public PODs targeting other at-risk populations.

Other lessons, while still having moral bases, may at first seem considerably more straightforward as they pertain to particular tools considered necessary for effective outbreak management (e.g., community engagement and risk communication). What is important to note, though, is the centrality of trust to these lessons and the effectiveness of these tools. For instance, the WHO leadership statement on the Ebola response and WHO reforms stated that a 'significant obstacle to an effective response has been the inadequate engagement with affected communities and families. This is not simply about getting the right messages across; we must learn to listen if we want to be heard' (World Health Organization, 2015c) . Similarly, the UN, UNDP, World Bank, EU and the African Development Bank, in its Recovery from the Ebola Crisis, stated that '[t]he low levels of trust in state institutions that existed before the epidemic hampered the response. Trust in public institutions could be strengthened through inclusive dialogue, efforts to enhance accountability, and equitable and harmonized service delivery ' (p. 11) . The acknowledgement of the importance of community engagement and fostering trust in outbreak management (Theme 3) should be celebrated. Yet, the ethical imperatives to engage communities, build trust and increase accountability have long been recognized as important moral obligations for pandemic planning, and have even been incorporated into pandemic plans as guiding ethical values (Kass, 2005; Thompson et al., 2006; World Health Organization, 2007a; US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2008; Baum et al., 2009; Institute of Medicine, 2009; Nigeria Integrated National Avian ad Pandemic Influenza Response Plan, 2009; Thomas et al., 2009) . For instance, the World Health Organization's (2007a) Ethical Considerations in Developing a Public Health Response to Pandemic Influenza specifically states that '[p]ublic engagement and involvement of relevant stakeholders should be part of all aspects of planning' (p. 3), and goes on to address its application in the context of communication: 'In order for public engagement in preparedness planning to be meaningful, effective modes of communicating with and educating the public about the issues involved are essential ' (p. 4) . This relationship between public trust, risk communications and community engagement has also been recognized for some time. Following the 2003 SARS outbreak in Toronto, researchers from the University of Toronto argued that '[t]rust is an essential component of the relationships among clinicians and patients, staff and their organizations, the public and health care providers or organizations, and among organizations within a health system. Decision makers will be confronted with the challenge of maintaining stakeholder trust while simultaneously implementing various control measures during an evolving health crisis' (University of Toronto Joint Centre for Bioethics, 2005, p. 7). Indeed, one of the major obstacles experienced during the SARS crisis, which was acknowledged in two major Canadian public health reports following the outbreak, was inadequate risk communication (Theme 4). The SARS Commission, authored by the Honourable Mr. Justice Archie Campbell following the outbreak, asserted that '[b]ad communication is a steel thread throughout the story of SARS. Poor communication exacerbated a confusing and terrible time' (Campbell, 2006 (Campbell, : 1149 . In a similar vein, the final report of the WHO conference on SARS concluded that 'information should be communicated in a transparent, accurate, and timely manner. SARS has demonstrated the need for better risk communication as a component of outbreak control' (World Health Organization, 2003b) . Trust and transparency are even articulated as guiding principles in the World Health Organization's Outbreak Communications Planning Guide (World Health Organization, 2008 ). Yet, 12 years later, the same lessons emerge anew in the context of Ebola, as if they have been wiped from our collective memory.",21.576759266754333,11.054137812818208

Based on psychometric studies of risk perception, Paul Slovic et al. evolved a basic model of risk perception, listing several factors that caused people to perceive events as high risk, even when experts judged them to be low risk. Hazards that were new, uncontrollable and catastrophic in consequences were perceived as high risk, even when experts judged a low statistical probability of these risks occurring. In contrast, hazards or dangers that were familiar and controllable were perceived as low risk, even though statistically they had a high probability. In contrast to lay perceptions, expert perceptions of risk were based on expected annual mortality from a hazard or danger. 4 Risk communication consultants such as Vincent Covello et al. and Peter Sandman used the findings of Slovic and others to develop strategies that helped experts and managers to communicate to the public in a way so that their perceptions of risk more closely approximated those of experts. 5, 6 Communication tool kits were devised to help communicators to either calm public anxieties, if experts felt that these anxieties were inappropriate, or to increase risk perceptions if experts Special theme -Public health communication Risk and outbreak communication Thomas Abraham felt that the public was insufficiently concerned about grave risks. Thus Peter Sandman's tool kits for precaution advocacy and outrage management are designed to help communicators to raise or lower public risk perceptions to match the level of the experts. Precaution advocacy is used to alert people who are insufficiently concerned by hazards that experts feel to be serious, and outrage management is used to calm down people who are judged to be over-concerned about minor risks. In the event of a social crisis, crisis communication is designed to help people resist their emotions and act wisely in difficult situations. 7",26.271495614995207,9.657097400071597

Most of these studies were based on theories of risk and crisis communication. (For a summary, see Table 4 .) All 5 articles on organizations' social media messages about EIDs used manual content analysis. Among them, only 3 reported the types of social media used and the types of messages posted by organizations. For instance, Biswas 3 studied how the CDC and WHO used Twitter and Facebook in communicating about H1N1 and identified the following 4 types of messages: investigation or diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and update. He also concluded that Facebook facilitated more interactivity because of its technical features, but both the CDC and WHO focused on 1-way communication instead of interacting with the public.

The following types of messages were identified in descending frequencies: updates, policies and guidelines, prevention topics, official actions and efforts, general information, and scientific research, in descending frequencies.

B19 is prevalent worldwide, with seroprevalence in blood donors varying from between 0.2-1.3% in the USA, Europe and Africa and 25-40% in Asia [37] . The risk of parvovirus transmission is higher when units of blood are pooled (e.g. to create batches of clotting factor concentrates, albumin etc.) and so individuals with bleeding disorders are at a higher risk of infection. B19 DNA was detected in 26% of clotting factor concentrates in a recent German study [38] , and another study found that populations receiving blood-derived products were 1.7 times more likely to display antibodies to B19 than populations who had not received blood products [39] . B19 lacks a lipid envelope, which renders it highly resistant to some methods of pathogen inactivation [40] . Screening of blood donations for B19 DNA is not currently routine, but many manufacturers only process plasma that has been screened for the absence of B19 DNA in order to reduce the risk of transmission [41] . Given the prevalence of B19 in different populations, it is difficult to define the residual TTI risk of this virus. However, it is clear that a transmission risk does exist.

For instance, projects such as Gapminder [38] have developed animations of world income distribution and global health that are easy to understand. However, to our knowledge, this work is the first to experimentally evaluate visualization strategies to communicate infectious disease prevalence to the general public. Numerous studies have evaluated the impact of graphics on risk communication [24, 25] . However, this prior work has primarily focused on communicating to individual patients-particularly the risks and benefits individuals would receive as a result of a medical procedure. While epidemiologists have long used graphical displays to illustrate the spread of disease [39, 40] , that work has focused on delivering information to highly trained public health specialists. In contrast, this study assesses graphics that communicate disease prevalence to the general population, simulating that their country is at the epicenter of an infectious disease outbreak. This type of communi-cation is especially relevant to public health and government officials seeking to provide broadly accessible health information. As the lay public receives more of its health information multidimensionally, from healthcare experts, news, and social media, it is critically important to evaluate the most appropriate graphics used to communicate disease prevalence, spread, and risk. Understanding optimal communication strategies is of particular importance in relation to influenza, where vaccination greatly reduces the risk of contracting disease [41, 42] ; yet, vaccination rates remain suboptimal [43] . Prior research related to public health communication and influenza has demonstrated that the general public prefers brief, balanced, and evidence-based messages [44] [45] [46] . However, there is currently no standard method for the graphical communication of epidemiological data to the lay public. The WHO and the CDC used a combination of dot and heat maps during the recent Ebola outbreak to depict prevalence [30, 31] . Dot maps appear most often in the literature [32, [47] [48] [49] . However, heat maps have been discussed infrequently in the literature. In one study of Europeans interested in weather forecasts, a color contour map featuring hypothetical forecasts was preferred over six other more typical formats of graphical presentation of data, such as bar graphs, pie charts, and line graphs [50] . Yet, we found that while both heat maps and pictotrendlines were preferred over dot maps, the use of heat maps to demonstrate the spread of disease increased interest in vaccination compared to the use of picto-trendlines and no differently than dot maps. Furthermore, dot maps appeared to be the worst method to convey information, as respondents with dot maps had less knowledge gained from the graphic compared to those with heat maps and picto-trendlines. Thus, unlike dot maps and picto-trendlines, heat maps achieved the trifecta-greater respondent preference, increased interest in vaccination, and better translation of knowledge. Graphics must also be carefully examined to assess both their potential positive and negative impact. Visuals can produce a wide variety of emotional responses that may be difficult to predict [23, 27] . Furthermore, it is often difficult to adequately illustrate uncertainty in risk communication [51] ; however, this becomes even more imperative when presenting graphics at the population level, since risk may vary greatly between individuals and across locations. Experimental evidence remains limited as to how different graphics are processed and understood [51] ; therefore, additional research is necessary to evaluate the impact of public health graphics aimed at the general population. In particular, it is unclear how other modes of communication, such as animations and videos, impact public health communication. Our prior work using animation in the context of cancer treatment options suggests that animated graphics may result in suboptimal risk communication [52] .",29.623949230667847,13.235116914247387

Risk factors for early-onset GBS disease include delivery before 37 weeks' gestation, rupture of membranes for longer than 18 hours before delivery, intrapartum fever, heavy maternal colonization with GBS, or low concentrations of anti-GBS capsular antibody in maternal sera. 62, 63 The common occurrence of severe GBS disease before 24 hours of age in the neonate has lead to prevention strategies. Revised guidelines developed by the AAP Committees on Infectious Diseases and on the Fetus and Newborn 63 have tried to combine various variables for increased risk of GBS infection (prenatal colonization with GBS, obstetric and neonatal risk factors for early-onset disease) and provide intrapartum prophylaxis to those at high risk ( Fig. 17-3) .",18.29857806926121,8.17822445430162

Synovial Intracellular Citrullinated Proteins Colocalizing with Peptidyl Arginine Deiminase Are Pathophysiologically Relevant Antigenic Determinants of Rheumatoid Arthritis-Specific Humoral Autoimmunity,"Aims: The incidence of both type 1 (T1D) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is increasing in children. Although T1D and T2D are classically thought to have separate pathogeneses and presentations, often an admixture of T1D and T2D features are present at diagnosis. Our aim was to examine the relationship between autoimmune measures, HLA, and clinical course. Methods: 28 subjects with atypical T1D (presenting with features such as obesity, acanthosis nigricans, absence of DKA and/or absence of weight loss), and 15 subjects with a clinical diagnosis of T2D were studied at time of diagnosis. Diabetes-associated autoantibodies (DAA) including islet cell, GAD65, IA-2, and insulin autoantibodies were measured. 23 subjects underwent HLA genotyping and were classified as having a high risk (DR4/DQ3; DR3/DQ2), protective (DR15/DQ6), or low risk (other HLA) haplotypes. Subjects were 8-18 years of age at diagnosis, and clinical course was followed in 84% of subjects for a mean period of 47.9 F 18.7 months. Results: Atypical T1D: 25/28 (89%) atypical T1D subjects were positive for at least one DAA. 14/16 (88%) with HLA typing had one or more high risk HLA alleles. 24/28 (86%) were prescribed insulin at diagnosis and remained on insulin throughout the follow-up period (3 insulin-requiring subjects were lost to follow-up). All 24 insulin-requiring subjects were DAA positive at diagnosis. 12/13 HLA-typed insulin-requiring subjects had a high risk HLA genotype, 1 had a low risk HLA genotype. 2/4 initially non-insulin-requiring subjects remained on oral agents. Both of these were DAA negative, and the one typed subject was HLA low risk. The other 2 subjects initially treated with oral agents subsequently required insulin for glucose control. Both of these subjects had high risk HLA, and one was DAA positive. T2D: 5/15 (33%) T2D subjects were DAA positive at diagnosis. 1/7 HLAtyped subjects had a high risk HLA genotype, 2 had a combination of high risk and protective alleles, and the remaining 4 had low risk or protective alleles. At diagnosis, 14 subjects were treated with oral agents and one with insulin. Follow-up information was obtained on 11 subjects. The subject initially treated with insulin remained on insulin. This individual was DAA negative, but was not HLA typed. 7/10 subjects initially treated with oral agents remained on oral agents during follow-up. Three were DAA positive, and one had high risk HLA, but no subject in this group was positive for both DAA and high risk HLA. Two of the three subjects initially treated with oral agents who subsequently required insulin for glucose control were DAA positive, and both had high risk HLA. Conclusions: Children clinically classified with T2D or with an atypical presentation for T1D have a high frequency of autoimmune markers and T1D-associated HLA haplotypes. In addition, these autoimmune markers in children with clinical features of T2D appear to be indicators of a more aggressive diabetes disease process, as has been previously shown in children with typical T1D.",17.94222425808388,7.2225285106545405

These donors have been defi ned by the OPTN and US Public Health Services (PHS) as donors at increased risk of disease transmission, termed increased risk donors. The PHS updated their guidance related to increased risk donors in 2013, and this guidance has been adopted as the standard for most transplant systems globally [ 20 ] . This updated guideline refi ned prior guidance taking into account current knowledge of the epidemiology of HIV, HBV, and HCV in the community and the limitations of our contemporary screening practices ( aatb.org/DRAI-Documents ). Although living and deceased donors are considered to be equal risk in the guidelines, living donors are able to provide their own history, while histories from deceased donors are obtained from friends and relatives. These individuals may not know the fi ne details of the donor's social situation (e.g., the mother of a college student who does not live at home). As such, the guideline recognizes these limitations and places donors with incomplete donor histories in the increased risk category as risks may be present but unrecognized. (b) The 2013 guidelines newly recommend that all donors be screened with serology and nucleic acid testing (NAT) for hepatitis C, regardless of risk factors, and that all increased risk donors be screened with HIV NAT in addition to routine serology. At the present time, only serology is mandated for hepatitis B screening, although this serologic assessment includes hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) which allows for direct detection of the virus. The addition of NAT screening to serology will allow increased detection of acute infections as NAT decreases the length of time between initial infection and the ability of the test to detect the infection, referred to as the window period (Figure 8-1 ). (c) The guideline also recognizes that living donors may continue to engage in behaviors that place them at increased risk of disease transmission between screening and donation. As such, the guidelines recommend that living donors are screened as close to the donation procedure as possible, not to exceed 28 days. The feasibility of this recommendation has been demonstrated clinically [ 21 ] . 2.

Later in infection the serological markers present are far easier to demonstrate and the assays significantly less expensive than molecular assays. The important question is then to determine the increased value provided by including molecular screening in addition to serological screening. Although molecular screening does theoretically offer earlier detection of infection, its actual value is very much related to the biology of the individual infectious agents, the overall performance of the serological screening and the incidence of infection in the population. Where antigen assays are available, there is generally only limited additional value to be had from molecular screening, unless the incidence of infection is high enough to indicate that significant number of donors may have been exposed to the agent. However, in low-risk populations this is rarely the case. However, where only antibody assays are available and where the window period of infection is relatively long, molecular screening may have more value. However, again it is the incidence of the infection in the donor population that determines how many donors would be likely to be detected by molecular and not by serological screening. In low risk populations the actual numbers of donors who would be detectable by molecular screening and not by serological screening is extremely low. Currently, for HCV in blood donations collected within the NBS, the number of HCV RNA positive but serology negative donations is approximately 1 in 55.4 million donations, i.e. one donation per 28 years at the current donation level.",19.581204056096176,10.781782239450251

In particular, SNSs function as alternative information sources when full disclosure of information to the public is delayed or prohibited. In addition to these roles, this study highlights the effects of SNS conversations on public risk perceptions and preventive behaviors. In light of these results, public health officials and communication professionals need to use SNSs in order to effectively manage the social and economic disruptions caused by an infectious disease outbreak. Specifically, SNSs monitoring tools can enable public health organizations to understand more about what diverse social groups are saying about an infectious disease outbreak, to identify information needs, and to adjust their messages accordingly. In order to strategically optimize these tools, the application of theory-grounded models deserves careful consideration. For example, the blog-mediated crisis communication model (Jin & Liu, 2010) and the social-mediated crisis communication model (Austin, Liu, & Jin, 2012) can help to better understand how people provide, receive, and/or share crisis information via SNSs.",17.84601878083299,6.909387118466621

In addition to invasive disease, which is the most common clinical manifestation of human listeriosis, outbreaks of febrile gastroenteritis in otherwise healthy people indicate that L. monocytogenes can also cause typical foodborne gastroenteritis. The incubation period in this type of L. monocytogenes infection has been reported to range from 6 h to 10 days, and the infectious dose is also likely to be high. Although the exact relationship between invasive and noninvasive infection remains to be ascertained, it has been assumed that febrile gastroenteritis may be responsible for a significant proportion of foodborne listeriosis in the general population.

The decision to provide broader coverage is based on health care exposure risk factures, a history of structural lung disease, or other specific conditions (eg, known MRSA colonization). 18 For outpatients without coexisting illnesses or recent antibiotic use, the IDSA recommends a macrolide (azithromycin, clarithromycin) or doxycycline. 1, 24 If coexisting illness is present or the patient has recently used antibiotics, a respiratory fluoroquinolone (moxifloxacin, levofloxacin) is recommended; a beta-lactam (eg, amoxicillin) plus Community-Acquired Pneumonia macrolide may also be used. Risk factors for drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae include comorbidities such as heart disease, liver disease, renal disease, diabetes, alcoholism, immunosuppression, or antimicrobial use within the previous 3 months (see Table 2 ). For these patients, a respiratory fluoroquinolone should be prescribed or a beta-lactam plus a macrolide. 24 In 1 cohort of patients treated for CAP in the ED, approximately one-half had 1 risk factor for drug-resistant S pneumonia, raising concern for potential overuse of fluoroquinolones. 45 In areas such as Louisiana with a large percentage (48%) of macrolide-resistant S pneumoniae (defined as a minimum inhibitory concentration of 16), a respiratory fluoroquinolone or betalactam plus macrolide can be used. 24 See Tables 5 for treatment guidelines. For hospitalized patients, the IDSA guidelines recommends a beta-lactam plus a macrolide (eg, ceftriaxone plus azithromycin). There is increasing evidence that patients do better with a combination of antibiotics rather than fluoroquinolone monotherapy, possibly related to immunomodulation. 3 During high local influenza activity, hospitalized patients generally should also be treated with oseltamivir.

Further compounding the challenges of risk communication was the unknown and potentially lethal nature of the risk itself, features that would contribute to risk aversion among house staff. 18 Reports from the SARS experience and other infectious diseases outbreaks have emphasized the importance of coordination, collaboration, and communication in the effective management of public health crises. 2, 19 Given the probable emergence of similar infectious risks in the future, it is imperative that health care institutions develop strategies to effectively communicate risk to house staff (Table 1) .

Risk Assessment and Containment: The process of risk assessment begins with the investigator's initial assignment of a biosafety level appropriate for the research that will be performed. The NIH Guidelines provide tools to aid the investigator in the initial risk assessment by classifying biological agents into risk groups according to their potential to cause disease in a healthy adult (Appendix B) [16] . Biological agents are assigned to risk groups 1 through 4, with agents that are not associated with disease in healthy adults assigned to risk group 1, and with each successive risk group 2-4 posing a greater risk to human health. It is important to note that the listing of biological agents in the NIH Guidelines is not comprehensive, and that an investigator should not assume that biological agents not specifically listed are properly classified as a risk group 1 agent. Once an initial risk group assignment has been made by the investigator, the NIH Guidelines describe appropriate containment levels for: -In vitro work in the laboratory and work in small animals that are of a size that is conducive to housing in cages that provide containment of biological agents, most often laboratory rodents (Appendix G) [16] , -Work with large animals that are of a size at which caging to provide containment of biological agents is not available and where the room itself provides containment (Appendix N) [16] , -Work with plants (Appendix P) [16] , and -Work with large volumes of biological agents in production facilities (Appendix K) [16] . b. Each containment level, defined as a BL, consists of a combination of appropriate microbiological work practices, containment equipment, and facility design features. Each BL, a combination of the above risk-mitigation strategies, is developed to ensure safe research with biological agents that pose a greater risk to human health requiring progressively more complex containment practices and facilities (e.g., BL1 through BL4, BL1N-BLN4, BL1P-BL4P, good large-scale practice (GLSP), BL1-LS-BL3-LS) [16] . 5. The NIH Guidelines require each institution to establish an IBC, which is responsible for reviewing research with recombinant and synthetic nucleic acids at the institution and ensuring that all such research is performed in compliance with the NIH Guidelines (Section IV-B-2) [16] . The composition of the IBC is specified in the NIH Guidelines to ensure that the committee includes members with adequate expertise to fully evaluate all research with recombinant and synthetic nucleic acids performed at an institution. For example, institutions performing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid work in plants, animals, or human subjects are required to have at least one plant, animal, or human subject research expert as a committee member (Sections IV-B-4, IV-B-5, and IV-B-6, respectively) [16] . Similarly, any institution performing large-scale research or research at BL3 or BL4 must appoint a biological safety officer (BSO) who must serve as a member of the committee (Section IV-B-2(a-(1)) [16] . The NIH Guidelines also require at least two members of the IBC to be unaffiliated with the institution to represent the interest of the surrounding community (Section IV-B-2(a-(1)) [16] . Other recommendations for committee membership may be found in the NIH Guidelines, Section IV-B-2-a [16] . The specific review of functions of the IBC and the BSO shall be discussed later in this chapter. [22, 26, 27] . h.

However, this situation is no different to that which pertains with the types of conceptual models that more generally underlie the development, testing, and potential predictive power of scientific hypotheses. Mathematical models in this context are neither intrinsically no better nor no worse than any other used in science, as long as they are equally supported by data; though they do have some very particular and useful properties. Mathematical models do, nevertheless, often have a vocabulary and notation that is not necessarily easily accessible; and may also come with an air of precision that some might find difficult to accept. It is key then that the (simplifying) assumptions that mathematical models make are made explicit and understandable to more general audiences. This is often best achieved in a collaborative and multidisciplinary environment, including not only the mathematics, but also, for example, the epidemiology, disease and public health expertise. It is also often beneficial to engage with all the constituencies that might come to be dependent on the modelling, including those involved in risk management and risk communication.

Many countries, particularly in the developing world, may not find it easy to define their own health-based targets for drinking water based on a risk of infection or burden of disease as recommended.

This type of communication is especially relevant to public health and government officials seeking to provide broadly accessible health information.

The list of behavioral risk factors includes some conditions that could be considered symptoms of disease or diseases, and not merely risk factors. Thus, a clear dividing line between risk factors for disease, symptoms of disease, and disease cannot always be drawn. Consider a few examples. Obesity is a risk factor for several serious diseases, but it is sometimes considered a disease in itself, especially in the extreme form labeled morbid obesity. Hypertension is always considered a disease, even if it is asymptomatic, but it is also considered a risk factor for disease because of its close linkage with, and role as precursor to, other cardiovascular diseases. Persistent pain is a symptom of many diseases. Often, as in the case of arthritis, pain is a symptom of the disease and it is treated as a symptom.

RAGs 9 helps a healthy woman who has a family history of a disease, such as breast cancer, to systematically construct a family tree and record information about family members who are believed to have contracted the disease. For example, it will ask for information about the relationship between the woman and her affected relatives, what their approximate age was at diagnosis and so on. RAGs then uses a logical decision procedure to assess the risk that the woman is a ""gene carrier"" for the disease, assessing whether she is at population (""normal"") risk, moderately elevated risk or high risk. RAGs does this by applying if . . . then . . . rules such as ""If the person has two or more first-degree relatives diagnosed with breast cancer and both relatives were diagnosed under the age of 40 then this is a risk factor for genetic predisposition to the disease"" (Fig. 2) .

However, lasting behaviour change is a result of decisions made at the individual level. To facilitate voluntary behaviour change a campaign must appeal to the values and cost-benefit evaluation of each audience group targeted, emphasising near-term salient benefits rather than long-term, abstract, collective benefits. Likewise, veterinary public health messages must be customised in such a way that they are interesting, relevant and captivating to their audience. Messages should be clear, easy to understand and easy to act on. Unless it is easy for people to remember how, when and what to do it is unlikely that a veterinary public health communication campaign will be successful. Social marketing techniques applied to emerging zoonosis communication campaigns have been shown to be effective in crafting health messages that 'speak' to target audiences [6] . Successful communication campaigns are based on systematic planning efforts and on objectives that are attainable, measurable, clear and time-bound. Successful campaigns develop and deliver health messages that are tailored to specific target audiences. Disseminating generic veterinary public health messages widely and increasing knowledge about certain emerging zoonoses issues and healthy behaviours have been shown to be less effective than more targeted efforts. Audience-centred health communication efforts with a consumer perspective are much more effective in motivating target audiences to change their behaviour. This requires designing and delivering messages that are adapted to the needs, perceptions, preferences and situations of the intended audiences rather than the needs and goals of the message designers or institutions.

Visuals can produce a wide variety of emotional responses that may be difficult to predict. 23, 27 Furthermore, it is often difficult to adequately illustrate uncertainty in risk communication; 51 however, this becomes even more imperative when presenting graphics at the population level, since risk may vary greatly between individuals and across locations. Experimental evidence remains limited as to how different graphics are processed and understood; 51 therefore, additional research is necessary to evaluate the impact of public health graphics aimed at the general population. In particular, it is unclear how other modes of communication, such as animations and videos, impact public health communication. Our prior work using animation in the context of cancer treatment options suggests that animated graphics may result in suboptimal risk communication. 52 This study must be interpreted in the context of several limitations. First, we chose three graphics to present to participants, but other graphics not presented in this study could be better suited to communicate disease prevalence. However, these graphics were chosen based on a pilot study in which these three graphics were the most promising. In addition, this study used graphics to accompany text, which may have a different effect than graphics viewed in isolation. Second, each respondent viewed a single graphic; however, no single graphic may suit the communication needs of all individuals. Furthermore, in this study, the picto-trendline graphic contained data only on the participant's country, compared to heat maps and dot maps, which included data on surrounding countries. However, including additional data in the picto-trendline graphic may increase its complexity and decrease its efficacy. Third, while differences seen in this study were statistically significant, it is difficult to project whether they are clinically relevant. Fourth, preferences in this study were developed based on a hypothetical scenario, which may not correspond with preferences during an actual pandemic of influenza. For example, we examined interest in future vaccination, which may not be perfectly correlated with actual vaccination. However, vaccination intentions are strongly associated with subsequent vaccination. 53 Additional research is necessary to determine how these graphics affect actual vaccination rates.

In the context of Zambia and H5N1, at least, there were various technical and non-technical strands to the preparedness effort as it related to the management of H5N1 risk; the public health response, based on the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) framework; the animal health response, guided by a National Response Plan and also the omitted, but potentially important, trade response, based on their capacity to translate, support or implement trade agreements for the purpose of animal health, plant health or human health protection. 173 It would be unrealistic to expect that 'risk managers' in these different policy communities would have ""the appropriate level of technical background to communicate effectively with risk assessors."" 174 The risk analysis process should assist effective risk management by highlighting response system vulnerabilities across sectors in the process of characterizing the dynamics of zoonotic risk, and explain these vulnerabilities to the appropriate audience. Risk analysis' role in informing decision making would be enhanced if risk is considered across the entire policy spectrum and not just from one viewpoint. In this endeavor, a risk analyst should understand that in multi-sectoral settings, there are differences in priorities, norms and policy frameworks which can impact upon the development of a risk management policy. Such challenges include properly linking the risk management policy response to livestock trade and holistically addressing the various conceivable modes of disease introduction and routes for human exposure.

Risk analysis can benefit from social processes like policy making. Perceptions of H5N1 risk were framed differently across various sectors, including the poultry and allied industries, the media, health, agriculture and trade. This implies that different risk perceptions influence policy processes in different but significant ways. The OIE risk analysis framework, 126 is a science-based method for the assessment of infectious disease risk that is based on the system developed by Covello and Merkhofer. 127 It is a 'Red Book' model 128 heuristic device conceptualized to involve four interacting and iterative stages; hazard identification, risk assessment, risk management and risk communication. 129 This structure makes the framework amenable to a discussion on the policy considerations relevant to its application in different contexts. The OIE risk analysis framework's importance to policy is highlighted in the fact that, since the inception of the WTO in 1995, the OIE framework in general has achieved recognition within the WTO SPS agreement as the standard for facilitating trade in animal and animal products. 130 The framework has been, and continues to be, applied to assess animal disease risks for scenarios other than those that are trade-related 131 and has been successfully adapted to a human health setting. 132 It therefore provides a structured approach to risk assessment and is considered to be an iterative and transparent standard for quantifying risk and informing policy. 133 In the OIE framework, risk assessment is the most technical component of the process and can be a qualitative, semi-quantitative or quantitative assessment of risk on the basis of expert knowledge and/or empirical data. 134 The entire framework, however, is subject to the policy processes of the particular context in which the risk assessment is conducted. This is because the framing of risk, and therefore its assessment, involves the interplay of both contextual and social factors. A weakness of the framework therefore is that it primarily relies on the engagement of expert knowledge, and their presentation of the underlying assumptions and the steps followed in the determination of risk. 135 By relying primarily on the knowledge of scientific experts, the framework is blind to social influences, and, in the case of risk management policy development in resource-constrained countries, partial to the narratives on risk voiced by the international agencies holding the purse strings. This is a pertinent potential flaw. As noted with similar technocratic models, 136 funding agencies could select only experts whose viewpoints resonate with their policy agendas, making their assessments of risk highly contestable. Another concern is a lack of robustness in this approach's dealing with the ambiguities of scientific uncertainty and surprise 137 and, a failure to fully engage political processes and social choices in addressing risk. 138 One solution is ""to develop a more holistic perspective"" of risk ""that includes explicit consideration of the roles of policy, disease management, and feedbacks between ecosystems and societies."" 139 There are novel approaches that suggest ways of better combining science and policy making such as Millstone's 140 'co-evolutionary model'. But the preceding critique is not a basis to reject the OIE framework. It is important to suggest how it can be made more amenable to social processes. Part of its appeal, as argued by Hueston, 141 is that the framework holds promise for the consideration of policy processes in the assessment of risk.

Because of these different approaches to and perspectives of risk, breakdowns in risk communication occur frequently, which has prompted a fair amount of study into i m p r o v i n g the risk communication process. In this regard, the 'co-orientation' factor has become increasingly important. This refers to the degree to which individuals' or groups' perceptions are similar or differ and to the degree to which these perceptions are correct. Building on early work by Newcomb (1953) Risk communication, in essence, is therefore defined as an iterative coorientation process among scientists and non-scientists about risk assessment, risk characterization, risk management and risk policy. This holds true for a range of topics: from discussing the risks and benefits of new and emerging technologies, such as nanotechnology, to providing guidelines for preventing exposure to recent health risks, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, to implementing international health campaigns to reduce the transmission of infectious diseases, such as AIDS or tuberculosis. Risk communication encompasses characteristics of the sender and receiver, and it entails both purposeful and unintentional messages about risk. It is multidirectional, and it occurs at individual, group, organizational, community and societal levels. The next few paragraphs address the nature of risk communication, including some of the challenges facing risk communicators today, and review some common and other, more promising, risk-communication strategies. F irst and foremost, risk communication is a matter of building trust. One problem of modern societies is that we are not quick to accept risks, neither as individuals nor as societies, which has led to our complex systems of risk management. Instead of feeling more at ease, however, our society has been growing more concerned about risks in recent decades (Slovic, 1993) . We can see a corollary in a widely documented decrease in the public's confidence in institutions that are responsible for risk management (Laird, 1989) . The reversal of this trend may lie in the revival of trust. Common sense tells us that trust is essential, yet some argue that its role has been largely under-appreciated in risk management efforts (Slovic, 1993) .",38.36928740412366,15.314664235161045

A related concept is the 'deficit model', which is a common and traditional way of looking at communication between scientists and nonscientists (Durant et al, 1992; Ziman, 1984) . This model essentially argues that the public lacks adequate scientific information on which to base their judgments, which is why public perceptions of risk are often at odds with scientific assessments. To remedy this, proponents argue that we need to educate lay people to think more like scientists, so that they will become more receptive to the scientists' arguments. Although few people would argue against having greater scientific literacy or a general understanding of scientific concepts among the public, focusing entirely on 'fixing' a deficit diminishes the role that nonscientists can play in risk characterizations. Being acutely aware of risks in the context of their everyday lives, non-scientists often provide unique insight into risk assessments, which at times may even lead to better risk characterizations (Stern & Fineberg, 1996 (Scherer, 1991) . Proactive risk communication calls attention to a potential or existing issue, suggests an agenda for discussion, and recommends a format for information exchange. Advantages of proactive communication include its potential to allow for more balanced and meaningful discussions. By its very nature, it can also alert people to a risk they did not know existed, which can help them to take precautionary measures to avoid exposure. Some might also consider this a disadvantage, particularly when the experts think that the risk in question does not pose a significant danger to human health or the environment. Reactive risk communication, in comparison, occurs only after the public or the media draw attention to a specific issue, or in response to a crisis. A considerable difference exists, however, between reactive risk communication following a crisis situation and reactive risk communication after an organization has been viewed as 'stonewalling' or avoiding public comment, with the latter incurring much more damage to that organization's perceived trust and Pre-1979 Asian poster promoting youth vaccination for smallpox and measles. © Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA special issue S64 credibility. Other disadvantages of reactive risk communication are the danger that science can become less relevant when issues become emotionally charged, the tendency of people to disbelieve or discredit delayed information and the fact that communicators are placed in defensive positions. Reactive risk communication can also sometimes come too late to help or protect individuals or their families from harm, such as when US postal workers died in 2001 after exposure to anthrax spores in the mailroom. Unfortunately, not all risks can be avoided or detected. Generally speaking, however, proactive risk communication yields greater potential for building trust among individuals and risk management, as well as for satisfying legal and ethical obligations. For example, controlling antimicrobial resistance will require ongoing proactive risk communication with, among others, healthcare professionals, patients, pharmaceutical companies, food producers and consumers. While proactive risk communication can work to reduce the need for antibiotics and the spread of resistant strains of bacteria, reactive risk communication will probably be necessary as the inevitable cases of illness arise.",39.31806976259246,15.295948343785335

Face-to-face risk communication can entail holding a single public hearing during an environmental permitting process or conducting a series of intense, deliberative workshops with targeted audiences. Massmediated risk communication can involve scientists or government agencies issuing press statements, holding press conferences or giving interviews. Just as the specific avenues of risk communication vary, so too do the reasons behind them. Some efforts are used primarily to inform and educate, others actively seek public input, and still others seek consensus. The main concern here is matching objectives with methods and ensuring that participants understand their part in the overall process. A final consideration relates to the degree of control over the message. Senders of risk communication information have much less control over the ultimate messages when they rely on news media to propagate them, although the potential reach is much greater. By contrast, control is much greater in face-to-face settings or other direct forms of communication. Table 1 provides an overview of some common methods of risk communication and lists some advantages and disadvantages of each. With these considerations in mind, the next section examines four approaches towards providing risk information: persuasive, balanced, dialectical and narrative. F irst, conventional risk communication efforts that are used to educate lay audiences resemble persuasive models. Typically these models are one-sided approaches that try to convince audiences to change their attitudes or behaviours about a particular issue or set of issues in a particular direction (Krimsky & Plough, 1988) . Because of their explicit intent to change people's attitudes and behaviours, persuasive approaches are sometimes also referred to as advocacy approaches. Just as countless studies have examined the factors mitigating the impact of persuasive messages, numerous studies have also shown that conventional approaches to risk communication need to account for psychological factors (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974; Slovic, 2000; Weinstein, 1989 ), sociological influences (Kasperson, 1992 Freudenberg, 1993) and cultural determinants (Douglas, 1985) .",37.63475373053639,13.27625148850114

Telling stories to convey meaning is arguably as old as human communication; however, research examining the use of narratives as a risk communication tactic is relatively new. The narrative approach is a reflective strategy that attests to the power that stories, anecdotes and case studies hold in helping individuals relate to or 'see themselves' in a situation. Carefully selected narratives can provide useful illustrations or personal examples that are potentially easier to recall than impersonal facts or numbers. Research on the effectiveness of narratives when compared to other approaches is mixed, however, with some studies suggesting that narratives enhance knowledge and memory and other studies failing to show clear differences between narrative strategies and more traditional fact sheets (Golding et al, 1992; Kearney & DeYoung, 1995) . T he advent of new technologies, and their risks and benefits, continue to stimulate scientific, public and political debate, as they arguably have for many centuries. Among the main challenges facing risk managers today is distrust of or scepticism towards individuals and institutions that manage risk. Building trust is difficult, but not impossible, and will require long-term commitment towards openness and honesty, as well as a sensitivity towards, and appreciation of, public values and opinions. Traditional risk communication efforts were often too quick to 'talk down' non-scientists or dismiss their arguments as 'irrational' when they disagreed with the scientists' conclusions. By contrast, today's more enlightened efforts seek to engage the public in the creation, dissemination and evaluation of risk messages. Rather than viewing risk communication as simply a one-time event, effective risk communicators understand the likelihood that additional interactions will be required; consequently, today's efforts to improve relationships and increase trust will help to lay the groundwork for positive future interactions.",32.405399584385236,12.85510628746387

It derives its name from dialectics, a mode of argument that uses a series of questions and answers to probe through possibilities and weigh contradictory facts and opinions with a view to their resolution. Rather than merely presenting many sides of the issue as with using the balanced approach, the dialectical approach to risk communication helps stakeholders evaluate the scientific and technical merits of the information. It encourages lay audiences to probe the broader questions related to risk to gain a greater understanding of the complexity of the issues and to put the risks into perspective with the costs, benefits and tradeoffs. For example, dialectical messages related to the risks of vaccinating children would explicitly encourage parents and caregivers to weigh the benefits and drawbacks of vaccinating their children in relation to the benefits and drawbacks of not vaccinating their children. To assist in their evaluation and help them consider alternatives, messages would suggest questions that parents and caregivers should ask themselves, as well as their doctors or other medical experts. In this fashion, the dialectical approach seeks to engage audiences in the content, while equipping them with the tools to understand and evaluate the information so that they can make informed judgements (Yankelovich, 1991) . Recent research on value-focused thinking in risk communication represents a similar rationale in terms of eliciting informed judgements about risk, rather than cursory responses (Arvai et al, 2001) .",29.378517952974683,11.376431902344638

E ffective risk communication as a cognitive fix is not a matter of simply passing information on to the public, however. In fact, such simple risk messages that are used to meet the information needs of nontechnical or lay audiences face several challenges. The intended audience may have a limited understanding of science and technology (National Science Board, 2002), it may not take the time to read or process the content of the message and instead fall back on heuristics or 'rules of thumb' (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) , or it may be exposed to competing messages or other sources that give contradictory information about risk (Krimsky & Plough, 1988) .

Scientists and engineers are abuzz with excitement about the substantial promise of nanotechnology to improve food, agricultural, medical and security systems; yet we already see growing public concern about the real and potential ethical implications associated with this new technology, the possibilities of its misuse and other unforeseen risks or consequences. Popular media accounts and bestselling novels do their part in fuelling the public's perceptions of risks and hazards, but, as with any emerging technology, a shortage of public knowledge and a great deal of uncertainty about the science also exists. It is equally likely, however, that scientists are as much 'in the dark' about how individuals, groups and other stakeholders will respond to the new and emerging risks of nanotechnology and other technologies, as the public is ignorant about the science. T oday, it is essentially a truism in risk communication that pushing technological advances without considering public input runs the risk of triggering backlash or opposition.

Risk communication can be defined as ""any public or private communication that informs individuals about the existence, nature, severity, or acceptability of risks"" (Plough & Krimsky, 1987, p. 6) . The perspective on stakeholders (audiences) is embedded in definitions of risk communication, be they source-or sender-oriented definitions focusing on conveying or transmitting information, from the risk assessors to the stakeholders, or interactive process definitions focusing on the exchange of scientific information between interested parties (Covello, Winterfeldt, & Slovic, 1987; Infanti et al., 2013) . Exchange of information is understood as an attempt to define risk communication as an audience-oriented activity in which the source customizes scientific information to the questions and needs of target groups in the public (Gutteling & Wiegman, 1996) . Risk communication can be understood as a dynamic and interactive process involving exchanges between different stakeholders. It can either be a planned or unplanned communication with stakeholders, or what has been referred to as 'interested parties', about the nature, possible consequence and management of risks.",36.36433020546575,14.33514091630865

For risk communication to succeed, it is imperative that the communicator understands the stakeholders and how they perceive the potential risk. Identifying, assessing and segmenting the stakeholders, understanding their concerns and perceptions, would enable the communicator to design better risk communication strategies. It would enable the communicator to design better risk messages, customize messages for specific target groups and ensure that stakeholders receive relevant messages. It is equally important for the communicator that the stakeholders want to be involved. One-way forms of communication, in which the stakeholders are mainly seen as receivers of information from experts, are no longer considered acceptable. Risk communication is now a two-way form of communication, with emphasis on interaction and dialogue between an organization and its stakeholders. Hence communications that enhance interactions, elicit responses and generate dialogue are preferable. Openness (e.g. involving representatives from affected stakeholders) enables an organization to get input from outside the organization, thereby improving the quality of interactions. A dynamic, flexible risk communication approach that involves stakeholders at every possible stage can enhance the effectiveness and credibility of risk communication throughout the crisis management cycle.",35.93104226502342,14.281707564884394

New approaches to risk communication advocate a more inclusive two-way process of communication, placing more emphasis on the interaction between the communicator and the audience. The new perspectives focus on risk communication as a dialogue or as a dynamic exchange of information. The interactive perspective on health risk communication moves beyond the old view of a passive receiver and instead focuses on how health risk messages can elicit different responses depending on (a) who communicates them, (b) how they are communicated and (c) how the public actively processes the information (Lemal & Merrick, 2013) .

The formulation of risk messages depends on the senders' intentions, be it persuasion or a desire to generate dialogue. The stakeholders, the risk information (message), the channels and the customizing of risk information to the audiences' needs are necessary for more adequate risk communication (Gutteling & Wiegman, 1996) . Blanchard-Boehm (1998) proposes a model that presupposes that the process of risk communication is one whereby individuals (1) hear a warning message; (2) understand its content; (3) internalize or believe the salience of its message; (4) confirm their interpretation with others and (5) act or respond to its message to save their life and property. Morgan and Lave (1990) argue that risk messages must be understood by the recipients, and their impacts and effectiveness must be understood by the communicator. A persuasive message is more likely to be effective if the communicator is credible, trusted (depends on qualification and identification), and knowledgeable (expertise). Atwood and Major (1998) argue that individuals who have experienced predictions of disasters that do not materialize will discount the validity of subsequent disaster warnings. The trustworthiness of the sender of a risk message, that is, using trusted sources of information, will enhance the public's compliance with risk messages. Important components of trust include openness, honesty, responsiveness, accuracy, fairness and concern. In addition, the risk message should be tailored to intended audiences, taking into consideration their linguistic skills. The readability of the risk messages should match the target audience's comprehension levels. The choice of message delivery modes should be informed by the target audience's communication habits.",34.98810565408302,13.912012904660717

As noted in Gutteling and Wiegman (1996) , to some risk communication researchers, especially those who hold an implicit technical view of risk communication, there is no problem in trying to reach agreement between the source and the receiver by applying persuasive tools. Other researchers, however, argue that using persuasion communication strategies is not acceptable and contradicts the goals of fairness. More recently, there has been a shift in the understanding of risk communication from merely a one-way communication flow to an emphasis on a two-way communication process involving sharing of information and promoting dialogue between technical experts and stakeholders. This approach acknowledges the concerns of stakeholders. Properly applied dialogue-based risk communication can help stakeholders and experts to share knowledge and understanding of the risk issue. Dialogue is aimed at ensuring that a diverse range of people share a common understanding of the risk issue with the organizations/ individuals in charge of managing the risk concerned. Sandman (1989) argues that the principle of involving the public in risk issues, whether it is risk assessment, decision-making, management or communication, is crucial. The aim of dialogue-based risk communication is to bring together diverse stakeholders in risk knowledge creation and sharing. This approach recognizes that certain risks are complex and multidisciplinary and hence need to be addressed through dialogue with, and participation by, diverse stakeholders. Increasing stakeholder participation raises the likelihood of the message being credible. There is a growing realization by risk researchers that for risk communication to be effective, it should have a stakeholder perspective. Dialogue-based perspectives are captured in the definition of risk communication by Lang, Fewtrell, and Bartram (2001) : ""[R]isk communication is any purposeful exchange of information about risks between interested parties."" In their 'General Principles of Food Safety Risk Management', the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) hold that ""risk management should include clear, interactive communication with consumers and other interested parties in all aspects of the process"". In its project to investigate what type of communication would improve the public understanding of flood risk and encourage people to take action, the British Environment Agency (2015) carried out a major public dialogue project on flood risk communication. In its project evaluation it found that ""getting people and communities involved in talking about flood risks increases people's understanding of local flood risk and can help them on a journey towards making preparations to protect themselves against flooding"" (Environment Agency, 2015).",37.481072204524935,13.767533104891708

Indonesia is one of the countries hardest hit by outbreaks of H5N1. Virus sharing with the international community is the mechanism by which, first, viruses developing pandemic potential can be tracked (risk communication), and second, vaccines can be developed to meet global need (risk management). Indonesia refused to virus share, not because it was opposed to the sharing of technical information to better understand the threat posed by H5N1 avian influenza, but because it felt excluded from equitable access to the resulting vaccine, meaning that its management of a subsequent pandemic would be constrained. 3 It could be argued that Indonesian authorities currently view virus sharing as an important element in risk management and thus a sovereign issue, although the international community, by contrast, views virus sharing as a critical element of risk communication and, by extension, a global risk management issue. Differing interpretations of international treaties are possible and resolution is proving challenging. 4 Ultimately, the debate is centred on the boundary between the governance of risk communication and risk management, the former now being mandated through international laws, with the latter remaining, to a large degree, a national sovereignty responsibility.",39.15632980952539,12.850857434783947

The worst consequences were felt in New Orleans, Louisiana, where the levee system was breached and billions of dollars of damage occurred. The storm also caused significant loss of life and many people were displaced from their homes. The magnitude of the hurricane was anticipated, the risk having been communicated at both local and national level. However, this risk warning was not heeded appropriately. For example, although mandatory evacuation was eventually ordered, there was little provision for the large numbers involved or for those citizens who could not evacuate themselves. The aftermath of the storm, with many people left living in squalid conditions, also revealed a risk management process that left much to be desired. 5 One notable example was in the coordination of a bi-partisan emergency federal health policy response, attempts at which were blocked by the White House, citing multiple concerns including relevance and cost. The subsequent delay resulted in profound health, economic and political consequences. 6 Several lessons may be drawn for the risk management of disease outbreaks. Firstly, although risk communication may occur, it does not automatically result in a co-ordinated risk management response. Second, this occurred in the USA, a country which clearly has the public health and disaster management resources to deal with such a problem. However, these resources were not mobilized effectively, efficiently or in a timely manner. At the heart of many of the problems were fractured communication systems. Among operational problems, there were failures in communication technologies subsequent to the weather conditions and, whilst some decisions required extensive information, others were made on the basis of unverified rumours reported by the media, leading to incoherent responses. 5 Communication failures occurred between the local, state and federal agencies, and there was a lack of clear roles and responsibilities.

In addition, while responsiveness to an emergency was associated directly with overreaction and compliance with self-quarantine, willingness to sacrifice was associated only with compliance with self-quarantine. Personal characteristics were associated with responsive behaviors; however, the reasons for these associations could not be determined. One possibility is nationalism. Individuals who regard nations as abstract communities with shared emotional bonds governed by rules and/or norms tend to be altruistic. 32 Therefore, people in Table 5 Associations of risk perception, knowledge, and personal characteristics with overreaction in one's own behavior societies governed by established, systematic rules are less likely to exhibit unusual behaviors that may lead to social panic. Moreover, inaccurate information is disseminated through social media platforms, such as Twitter, Facebook, and Google. The enormous influence of social media during the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa has led to exaggerated concerns even among the population in the United States with negligible risks. 33 Indeed, the mass media can also incite panic, which is related to fear and antisocial behavior 34 ; however, when they do their job properly, they can inform the public accurately about current conditions. Two studies in which a mobile health communication tool was used demonstrated the effectiveness of a social media-based approach in terms of changing vaccination behavior. 35, 36 Furthermore, the provision of appropriate and timely public health information by social media and the mobile health tool could accelerate the detection of disease outbreaks and enhance the public's response, 37 thereby minimizing adverse health and economic effects. 38 The findings of our study are depicted in schematic form in Figure 2 . In this model, risk perception was related to various factors such as sex, trust, and other personal characteristics. There was a notable aspect of risk perception: it was directly associated with overreaction, but not with compliance to self-quarantine. This suggests that risk perception motivates self-protective behavior, possibly resulting in overreaction. However, it does not automatically result in compliance to quarantine, which is generally perceived as protecting others, rather than oneself. In this sense, risk perception is a double-edged sword: at an optimal level, it helps the public protect themselves from infection and thereby deter the spread of epidemic; however, when excessive and characterized by fear, it can lead to other social problems, such as overreaction and discrimination. Sandman reported that risk perception is comprised of hazard and outrage. 39 The MERS outbreak caused fear and anxiety among the population, which might have resulted in an overreaction to both the response of the government and the behaviors of themselves and others. 40 Our model also points to the importance of trust in medical experts and proper knowledge. These 2 factors demonstrate the potential to maximize the benefit by promoting compliance and reducing overreaction. Therefore, risk communication should not just scare people, but should create a context in which there is trust and a flow of knowledge and clear information between the authorities and the public. These conditions should prevent adverse effects, particularly in democratic states. The existing literature emphasizes these essential components of risk management and risk communication. 41, 42 To date, there are a limited number of studies on risk perception of infectious diseases (including MERS); therefore, this work makes an important contribution to the field. Several factors affecting perceived risk were evaluated (eg, trust in the media or health policy, personal characteristics), which were not assessed in previous studies. Although knowledge and trust have been previously reported to be associated with perceived risk, 17, 18 this study further explored possible effects of risk perception and their implications in responding to an epidemic. EIDs are unfamiliar to the general public and are likely to be overestimated in the risk, 31 possibly leading to social panic. To prevent this, it is important to boost the risk communication with fostering trust and relevant knowledge, which requires transparency.",24.684375758214525,8.677391968503898

Women and those with low levels of trust in central government, the medical field, and health policy were more likely to overreact. On the other hand, people with high levels of trust in the media, local government, and NGOs may be hypersensitive when an EID outbreak occurs. Furthermore, the higher risk perception was associated with only overreaction, not compliance to self-quarantine. Hypersensitivity that leads to overreaction can be explained by perceived media dependency 26 ; however, this may have been related only to television in this research. Moreover, differences in the effects of trust in central and local governments on risk perception may be explained by South Koreans' perceptions of the roles of these government bodies. Central and local governments do not always appear to smoothly coordinate the emergency response, and this may be related to ongoing challenges about decentralization from the central governmental system. 27 Another important finding is related to the role of the media during a crisis. In this study, trust in the media positively affected risk perception and overreaction, supporting that the mass media influence perceptions of disasters and risks; however, they cannot change an epidemic event itself. 4 Restrictions on the availability of information by the government can exacerbate the impact of a disaster, especially in the new media age, in which person-centered media is emphasized; this was the case in the 2003 SARS outbreak in China and the 2015 MERS outbreak in South Korea.

Nevertheless, the Chinese government assigned responsibility for censorship of the media, including the Internet, to local agencies. 5 In the new media age, in which social media (including the Internet, short message services, and mobile applications) are centralized, the government restricts freedom of expression in the same way as it has restricted such freedom among traditional media sources, such as newspapers, radio, and television. 6 The control of the acquisition of information is more difficult in this new age because social media are tools not only for the dissemination, sharing, and seeking of health information but also for the expression of feelings and the sharing of personal experiences and opinions. 7, 8 Therefore, organizations need to build effective communication tools to respond to emerging infectious disease (EID) outbreaks because the public may express scientific skepticism about scientific topics and participation in decision-making. 9 During epidemics, people usually require guidance on how to behave from a trusted source. The government and public institutions are the ideal sources because people tend to rely on the national administration. For this reason, trust in these institutions plays a main role in the public's acceptance of policies and actions. 10 The World Health Organization suggested that outbreak communication should incorporate the following 5 key factors: (1) building, maintaining, or restoring trust; (2) announcing early; (3) maintaining transparency; (4) understanding the public; and (5) planning of all aspects of the response to an outbreak. 11 Therefore, risk communication enhances the decision-making ability of laypeople, and can be examined by assessing risk perception. 12 Trust in not only the government and public agencies but also in the media and other institutions may be associated with risk perception.

High risk is not the same as HTR, although there appears to be substantial overlap; whereas not all at high risk are hard-to-reach, many in the HTR population are at high risk. While no uniform definition of HTR populations exists, HTR populations have typically been defined from the perspective of linkage with the health care system, i.e., persons who do not seek treatment in traditional care settings such as provider offices or clinics. The size of hard-to-reach populations, whereas hard to estimate, is not trivial; some examples of constituent groups are as follows: 11.5-12 million undocumented immigrants nationwide, 18 1.5 million injection drug users in 96 large U.S. metropolitan areas 19 and 744,000 homeless persons nationwide, 20 as well as a proportion of the elderly and minorities. Overall, the percentage of U.S. residents at high risk for influenza but who are not immunized has been estimated to be as high as 65%. 3 Failure to be immunized is related to lack of health insurance and to having a regular provider; 21 this may be a particular concern for specific HTR groups. For example, mobile elderly differ from the majority of the other population groups in that they are covered by Medicare and generally frequent a health care provider. Thus, whereas the elderly as a high-risk group may differ from other groups in terms of access to health care as an entitlement, a proportion is not connected to care and is therefore HTR. The lack of a regular health care provider is correlated with race and ethnicity. 7 While 80% of White adults have a primary care provider, the percentage is closer to 70% for Asian-Americans and Blacks, and only 57% for Hispanics. 22 As reviewed elsewhere, other barriers to accessing care include culturally derived attitudes and belief systems, negative experiences with past treatment, language and other barriers in patient-provider relationships, and legal status (e.g., undocumented immigrants). [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] Some groups harbor substantial myths about and distrust of the medical system; previous research has shown that their attitudes appear to be strong predictors of being immunized. 28 VLAHOV ET AL. 616",22.81120732804269,11.406659167836564

Although personalized treatments can help save the lives of sick people, prevention applies to all. ""Precision prevention"" may be helpful in using both science and limited resources for targeting prevention strategies. For example, recent data suggest that knowing the speed with which people metabolize nicotine, based on genetic and other factors, could lead to personalized smoking-cessation interventions. Another approach to precision prevention is increased screening of people at greater risk for cancer. Family health history is an inexpensive tool for identifying individuals and families that require earlier and more intensive screening for breast and ovarian cancer. 5 Although whole genome sequencing in healthy populations will require more evidence for its utility, there is an emerging list of genomic applications that merit a targeted public health approach to find people with selected genetic conditions (e.g., hereditary breast/ovarian and colorectal cancers and familial hypercholesterolemia). Collectively, these conditions affect around 2 million people in the U.S., with evidence-based interventions that are poorly implemented in health care. 6 In addition, new biomarkers promise to improve the understanding of disease natural history. For example, epigenetics 7 is providing insights into the impact of the environment on gene expression throughout life with the possibility of targeted interventions. There is also strong suspicion that cumulative epigenetic changes due to environmental stressors may explain population health disparities in the burden of various diseases among disadvantaged populations. 8 Measuring neighborhood-specific epigenetic alterations can potentially be used to investigate causes for health disparities. However, although the field of epigenetics is promising for public health, much more work is needed in developing, validating, and using the right platforms in population studies. 8 Biomarkers are only one of many avenues for identifying high-risk populations for intervention. Public health programs already use targeted approaches, for example, by recommending screening for hepatitis C in people born from 1945 through 1965, and identifying people with prediabetes. Public health policies that will enhance lower sugar intake, weight control, and increased activity levels across the population could be accompanied, but not replaced, by more-targeted efforts to find people with prediabetes based on age, family history, and BMI.

For primarily inland aquatic species (loons and grebes), the threats include the draining of wetland areas, human disturbance, pollution (specifically heavy metals and pesticides), and exposure to coastal oil spills during overwintering in marine environments. Marine seabirds are threatened by overharvesting for food, feathers, and oil; accidental bycatch during fishing operations; habitat disturbance of nesting grounds (including guano harvesting); pollution; and predation by introduced species (rats, cats, pigs, mongoose). Introduced predators may destroy or eat the eggs, the chicks, and the adults sitting on nesting sites, causing a significant impact on the populations in a relatively short timespan. Large-scale harvesting of fish by indiscriminate use of explosives, an illegal practice in many countries, may have a significant impact by affecting large groups of birds during feeding congregations. In addition, long-line fishing operations present a specific risk to many Procellariformes, as the birds get accidentally entangled in lines and die by drowning.

Because vaccine stockpiles are limited, months will likely pass before supply can be increased to meet the demand. As priorities must be established in advance, the Health and Human Services Pandemic Influenza Plan and the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza are beginning to address prioritization issues. 63, 64 Although advance planning and training for distribution are critical, not every contingency can be anticipated on a theoretical basis. A number of lessons have been learned from preparedness exercises and from previous epidemics. First, at the individual level, the long wait time required for the large number of persons that will need to be vaccinated in the shortest period poses a major challenge (Table  3) . 65 Second, personnel dedicated to this effort are needed; identifying and locating HTR populations in this situation becomes more difficult if staff are diverted to other venues. Third, at the provider level, long wait times may necessitate the expansion of the provider pool to include additional nurses and pharmacists. 63, 66 And finally, reports have shown that maintaining adequate documentation under crisis conditions, especially for research purposes, may be challenging. 63, 67 Challenges at the structural level are even more pronounced. The domestic supply of influenza vaccine for A (H5N1) strain of concern is limited; the current annual capacity in the U.S. could manufacture enough vaccine for only 15 million Americans, leaving the vast majority vulnerable to disease. 63 Preparedness drills have shown that special consideration should be given to first responders (e.g., health care workers, emergency medical volunteers). In preparedness exercises, providers and their families have requested that they be given prophylactic vaccination ahead of time to increase their ability to participate after an outbreak (Gebbie, K., Columbia University School of Nursing, personal communication). Other high-priority groups include those at risk for severe disease: elderly, children, those with chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes, and immunosuppressed individuals. Points of distribution should be determined in advance based on their ability to handle large numbers of people (Table 3) . 63 These locations, which will most likely have to be flexible based on the exigencies of the situation and which, of necessity, have to favor access for the easy-to-reach masses, may be challenging for some HTR populations to access, especially those with limited mobility, distrust of government, or other constraints.",17.851670088004685,8.472615394563542

Further, the public in general has not been viewed as a partner, something that can improve the public's response to risk messaging. 5 Increasing coordination among government agencies and involving the public as a partner can result in improvements to emergency response. This process to improve risk communication also includes understanding some of the common misconceptions about disasters, including fears of mass panic, concerns with motivating people to act (such as for an evacuation), and understating the resiliency of those affected by a disaster, all of which can negatively influence risk communication efforts. 11 Emergency planners must recognize the nature of risk perception and how populations actually respond during an emergency. Evidence shows that when people are treated as partners in the process (with fairness, honesty, and respect), those people are more likely to appropriately react and respond to the risk messages being communicated. 12 The Fukushima nuclear crisis in 2011 provides a stark reminder of how important it is to understand and engage your audience when attempting to communicate risk. The majority of the Japanese public was only expected to be exposed to very low doses of radiation, but that did not change the fact that accurate information should still have been provided. 13 In the days after the crisis a lack of accurate information made the situation worse, providing further evidence that adequate planning is required to provide effective risk communications during an emergency. 13 Public perception can also change over time or after a significant event, as supported by research in China before and after the Fukushima nuclear crisis. Surveys administered to residents living near a nuclear power plant before and after the Fukushima nuclear crisis showed significant changes in the perception of risk with regard to nuclear power, demonstrating the need to continually assess and understand the target audience and to make appropriate changes to risk communication messaging. 14 A previous assessment in China demonstrated that the public responded better to messages that were crafted by public health workers trained in risk communication and that contained risk communication principles. 15 These findings provided justification to continue enhancing risk communication in China and routinely evaluate those efforts.",37.835028929172566,14.114454720100277

The guidelines were adopted and published by HCSP on March 14, 2020. The preparation of these guidelines is justified by data 1 suggesting patients with cancer are at high risk of respiratory complications related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The susceptibility of patients with cancer to influenza was described 2 before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. For patients with cancer infected with influenza, the risk of hospital admission for respiratory distress is four times higher, and the risk of death ten times higher than patients without cancer. This exacerbation seems to be particularly marked in those with neutropenia or lymphopenia, a feature commonly seen in patients with cancer treated with multiple therapies. 2 A Comment 1 from Wenhua Liang and colleagues, published in The Lancet Oncology, on the situation in China suggests that patients with cancer are at higher risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 than the general population (1% of patients with COVID-19 in the study had cancer, whereas the incidence of cancer in the Chinese population is 0·29%), which could be related to the closer medical follow-up of these patients. More concerning is the increased risk of severe respiratory complications requiring time in the intensive care unit in patients with cancer, as compared with patients without cancer (39% vs 8%, respectively; p=0·0003). A covariate signifi cantly associated with this risk was a history of chemotherapy or surgery in the month preceding infection (odds ratio 5·34, 95% CI 1·80-16·18; p=0·0026), a factor that includes the majority of patients with cancer. Finally, patients with cancer deteriorated more rapidly than those without cancer (median time to severe events 13 days vs 43 days; p<0·0001; hazard ratio 3·56, 95% CI 1·65-7·69).",18.726963595341992,8.790325250751748

A paradox in global policy can be observed by reviewing the differences in how the same country adheres to various OIE guidelines. The OIE has guidelines for trade established for both FMD and BSE; however, while countries may strictly adhere to these guidelines for FMD, the guidelines are widely overlooked by those countries in the case of BSE (Clayton, 2004) . As the OIE only provides guidelines, no enforcement measures exist that allow flexibility in interpretation. Organizations such as the OIE and CODEX attempt to implement scientific guidelines for the global community; however, the efficacy of these organizations is challenged by a lack of influence on government decisions in many cases.",20.993615892888574,8.066150555587324

But no matter what form they take, visualizing the spatial pattern of disease -be it at a global, national or local scale -is fundamental for informing risk-based disease surveillance and control strategies in several ways. Simple visualizations allow the extent of the disease to be delineated and disease frequency monitored, and when combined with maps of environmental factors or those highlighting the spatially heterogeneous distribution of at-risk populations, they can also be used to estimate disease burden (Hay et al., 2010; Robinson et al., 2002) and identify target populations for intervention (Tatem et al., 2011; Guerra et al., 2010 Guerra et al., , 2008 Guerra et al., , 2006 . Visualizing disease distribution can also be fundamental in directing control and elimination efforts. Clements et al. (2013) describe how measures to eliminate malaria from endemic countries have generally adopted a spatially progressive elimination approach referred to as shrinking the malaria map in which eradication efforts initially focus on the geographical perimeter of endemic areas and work inwards, effectively localizing disease distribution which allows for more efficient treatment and control (Feachem et al., 2010) Apart from the key role maps play in informing risk-led decision making, they also serve a more practical purpose such as facilitating integration and synthesis of data from a wide range of diverse sources, each possibly capturing information about disease and relevant risk factors at different scales (Bergquist and Tanner, 2012; Bennema et al., 2014) . As a result, cartographers need to decide on the most appropriate scale at which to present the data for it to be useful; data presented at administrative level 1 (province or region) inevitably cannot capture the fine-scale heterogeneity of most infection patterns and so estimates of numbers of individuals requiring treatment tend to be incorrect (Brooker et al., 2010) .",17.190793489194647,7.284099708668249

The risk communication systems in Taiwan were established and reformed after the SARS outbreak. A closer relationship with the media has been developed according to the WHO principles of building trust, making timely announcements, maintaining transparency, informing but not inflaming the public, and planning in advance. The toll-free hotline has also become a critical component of the national communicable diseases surveillance systems for early detection and timely response to the threat of emerging infectious diseases. Several countries, such as Australia,15 China,16 and Singapore,17 have launched similar call centers. While their call centers cover all healthcare-related emergencies, they are not an integral part of the national surveillance systems to detect and respond to emerging infectious disease outbreaks. Furthermore, the risk communication systems in Taiwan have capitalized on new media platforms to communicate with the public since 2009.

In spite of this fact, the public’s perceived threat (subjective component of risk) caused by MERS was much more serious than those of other infectious diseases. The MERS epidemic was not a simple public health problem to Koreans at that time, but showed implications for the state of the overall economy and society beyond the health sector in Korea. One cause of this difference in perception was that the KCDC did not follow the outbreak communication guidelines proposed by the WHO. The guidelines emphasize the importance of winning the public’s trust, making announcements as early as possible, providing information transparently, and promoting understanding among the civil society [6]. The failure in risk communication during this outbreak resulted in the public’s overreaction to the outbreak [7,8]. At the outbreak’s peak, thousands of schools and kindergartens were temporarily closed and many public events were cancelled or suspended. The WHO recommended the Korean government to reopen schools, as there has been no linkage of MERS transmission with school attendance in Korea or elsewhere [5]. The number of foreign tourists decreased by 41% compared with the same month of the previous year. Korea lost US$10 billion, which is expected to cut 0.1% off the gross domestic product growth rate in 2015.

However, under-utilisation and lack of transparency of information outside certain authorised channels are possibly the greatest hindrances to optimal use of the current system. Since accessibility to health data in China is largely limited to a small group of authorised personnel at the top of the administrative hierarchy, it often requires extensive bargaining and bureaucratic procedures to obtain epidemiological and behavioural indicators that are commonly accessibly in other countries. Hence, large amount of surveillance data remains in CISDCP and cannot be utilised widely for the purpose of HIV public health research, broader program evaluation and planning of control strategies. A transparent HIV surveillance system across all stakeholders, including policy makers, health officials, community health organisation leaders and HIV researchers, is beneficial for the entire HIV sector in the evaluation and implementation of HIV prevention and intervention strategies [34]. To understand barriers to optimal utilisation of available systems it is essential to first understand the political structure in China and its influences on surveillance. Although HIV surveillance is considered as a purely public health issue in many countries, issues related to HIV in China are highly sensitive and politically motivated [13, 35, 36].",17.788352822417146,8.740239969197853

Laboratory results are not significant as a mortality predictor in the high-risk group because they are included in the classification criterion or they include abnormal results since patients are at high risk for mortality. On the other hand, in case of the low-risk group, laboratory results are likely to indicate normal conditions so the change in such laboratory results could have a significant influence over the mortality risk rate.

Complementing this passive reporting, active surveillance for HIV was adopted in 1995 and further expanded in 2003 to include second generation behavioral surveillance in China according to WHO recommendations [24, 25]. While the existing hospital-based diagnosis system provides HIV diagnosis and treatment data, sentinel surveillance collects information on HIV prevalence, incidence and the risk behaviours of at-risk populations. In China, HIV sentinel surveillance is collaboratively supervised by the Chinese MOH and WHO. In 2000, surveillance pilot sites targeting IDU, FSW, male clients and the general female population were established in Fujian, Xinjiang, Guangxi, Shanxi, Yunnan and Sichuan. The approach utilised 21 surveillance points in these provinces and from every surveillance point 400 people are sampled twice each year to estimate the prevalence, incidence rate and risk behaviours of the targeted population [26]. The sampling and reporting for each round is completed within 4 weeks. In 2002, China issued “Standards for HIV Surveillance and HIV/AIDS” and “STD Comprehensive Surveillance Guideline” to provide guidelines to standardise the practice of HIV surveillance. In 2009, the number of sentinel sites in China increased to 1318, covering 14 at-risk population groups [2, 14, 27]. Since the establishment of the web-based HIV reporting system in 2004, sentinel surveillance data is integrated with disease information reported from hospitals. This approach established a comprehensive database for data collection, analysis and sharing and enables high-level comparison and integration of epidemiological and behavioural surveillance data [14].

To our knowledge, only a few, if any, public agencies provide specific guidelines pertaining to empirical treatment of severe infections for their local HCWs in the event of hospitalization. Local resistance patterns of pathogens in each hospital may assert the necessity of such a guideline [32]. The potential of Brucella for human infection and illness, as well as the intensity, duration, and expense of the follow-up recommended for Brucella exposure, highlights the need for developing standard protocols by facilities to prevent exposures during the handling of marine mammals, particularly during aerosol-generating procedures [35].

Our study expands the current knowledge of the in vivo mechanisms of complement-mediated antiviral immunity, and in particular suggests that activation of complement by distinct pathways may control pathogens by triggering different effector arms of antiviral immunity. A limitation of our study is that it does not address the precise mechanism by which the three complement activation pathways stimulate different adaptive immune responses; the differences could be because of quantitative or qualitative variation in the generation of C3 or C5 activation fragments. Regardless, a fully functional complement cascade is clearly important for controlling and clearing WNV given that antibody and CD8+ T cells both are essential for protection (14, 16, 17). It is intriguing to consider that severe WNV infection in humans, which occurs infrequently (∼1/150), could be more common in patients with dysfunctional complement responses. Although complete deficiencies of complement proteins are rare, heterozygous deficiencies of C4 and MBL are common (59) and have been associated with an increased risk of viral diseases (30, 49, 51, 60). As therapies against WNV become available, it will be important to target high-risk populations. Depressed levels of complement proteins or reduced complement activity could explain why some seemingly healthy patients develop severe disease after WNV infection.

This is because emergency victims often face geographical isolation as a result of damage to local infrastructure such as energy, road and communication facilities.5 Consequently, the arrival of external rescue support may experience two or more days of delay.6 But rescue efforts in the first couple of days in disastrous events are critical.7 Community and household preparedness in self-rescue efforts prior to the arrival of external assistance may result in the difference between the chance of survival and death.8 Empirical evidence shows that sufficient household preparedness can significantly mitigate the negative consequences of emergency events.9

By controlling which 2/3rds of the population become infected we may avoid overtaxing the healthcare system and thus minimise mortality. We consider a strategy in which initially all of society (bar essential service workers) are locked down for two to four weeks so as to brake the initial uncontrolled epidemic spread. At the end of this time, rather then reduce quarantine measures uniformly over all society, a government could instead engage in a program of 'targeted quarantine'; those individuals with no risk factors would be encouraged to return to work and socialize, while at risk individuals would be asked to remain at home under strict quarantine. The infection would be allowed to pass through the large, low risk population, resulting in a small number of ICU admissions due to occasional unexpected complications. Once the epidemic has passed through the low risk population, quarantine measures can be lowered in stages, with each stage exposing successively higher risk populations. Despite the increased risk on the individual level, the reduced susceptible population for each subsequent stage would lead to a natural 'flattening of the curve', 3 .
