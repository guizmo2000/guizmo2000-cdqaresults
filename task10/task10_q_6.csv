Since the purpose of effective training is to change the behavior of healthcare workers in a pandemic situation, we also proposed, based on the theory of social learning [21] , that enhancing self-efficacy (expectations about personal ability to respond adaptively to pandemic-related stresses) should be a goal of training because it is expected to be a proximal predictor of behavior [22] . Finally, since many stressful aspects of an infectious disease outbreak are directly or indirectly of an interpersonal nature (e.g. concern for family health, interpersonal job stresses, interpersonal isolation and perceived stigma) and because interpersonal problems are associated with job stress in healthcare workers [23] , reducing interpersonal problems was a goal. These pandemic related stressors could be expected to amplify the stress and strain which is commonly experienced by health care workers in the contemporary health care environment [24] .",28.096726325633192,11.76454601051283

This problem is particularly severe in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries because of shortages in certain medical disciplines, due to a lack of nationallytrained professionals and a less developed educational system compared to other high income countries. Consequently, GCC countries are heavily dependent on an expatriate health care workforce; a problem exacerbated by high turnover. We discuss challenges and potential strategies for improving and strengthening capacity building efforts in health care professions in the GCC. Main text: In the GCC, there are 139 schools providing professional health education in medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, nursing, midwifery, and other specialties. Health education school density reported for the GCC countries ranges between 2.2 and 2.8 schools per one million inhabitants, except in Oman where it is 4.0 per one million inhabitants. The GCC countries rely heavily on expatriate health professionals. The number of physicians and nurses in the GCC countries are 2.1 and 4.5 per 1000 respectively, compared to 2.8 and 7.9 among member countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Interestingly, the number of dentists and pharmacists is higher in the GCC countries compared to OECD countries. A nationally trained health care workforce is essential for the GCC countries. Physiotherapy and occupational therapy are two identified areas where growth and development are recommended. Custom-tailored continuing medical education and continuing professional development (CPD) programs can augment the skills of health practitioners, and allow for the expansion of their scope of practice when warranted. Conclusion: Capacity building can play an essential role in addressing the major health challenges and improving the overall quality of health care in the region. Efforts aimed at increasing the number of locally-trained graduates and developing and implementing need-based CPD programs are vital for capacity building and lifelong learning in health care professions.",29.346108479878026,10.874703016383698

The eyes are at particular risk from floating particles, which are considered serious hazards for DHCW, because they can transmit various microorganisms, e.g., cytomegalovirus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses (HBV and HCV), Herpes simplex virus type 1, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), streptococci, transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (including variant CJD), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus transmitted through direct and indirect contact [1] , [2] , [3] , [4] , [5] , [ [12] , [13] , [14] , [15] , [16] , [17] . The majority of infections are subclinical and almost 80% of all HBV infections are undiagnosed. Therefore, DHCW are at risk every day, because at normal working distances, there is no zone of safety for the risk of cross-infection. The danger is enhanced by the fact that some hazardous microorganisms remain in the air for up to 30 minutes after cavity excavation, and the fact that most human microbial pathogens have been isolated from oral secretions [7], [8], [18] , [19] , [20] . In 1946, Humphrey [21] described how three dental staff members developed different infections including syphilis, diphtheria and actinomycosis during the treatment of infected patients. The protection of health workers became imperative, especially with the rise of of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s [22] . Routine infection control procedures and recommendations have been available since the 1970s, but were neglected and ignored even by highly educated groups. In 1996, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) adopted the term ""standard precautions"" to generate broader understanding and awareness of prevention and transmission of infection. In 2003, the CDC published ""Guidelines for Infection Control in Dental Health-Care Settings"", which included standard precautions to ensure safe working environments and prevent cross-infection among DHCW and their patients, and in 2016 the CDC published ""Summary of Infection Prevention Practices in Dental Settings: Basic Expectations for Safe Care"" [22] , [23] , [24] , [25] .

Interestingly, higher DALYs estimates were identified in economically less-developed provinces in China including Guangxi in Region A and Guizhou and Sichuan in Region B. Guangxi and Guizhou are known to have low Gross Regional Product among provinces in China [18] . High burden estimates in school-aged children may probably be associated with lack of parental supervision because of parental migration from rural to the cities that happened during the last three decades. Lack of parental supervision on preventing their children from unhealthy behaviors and environment may likely increase the risk of pathogenic exposure and children's health [37] . Additionally, rural migration has shifted labor allocation and participation in families in farming activities, where children, women, and elderly become more active in farming [38, 39] and, therefore, they are more likely to be exposed to Leptospira-contaminated environments. It has been indicated in our findings that 5% of the total cases among farmers were attributed to young farmers (aged under 20 years). Health education and awareness amongst this population group, especially in rural communities is, therefore essential to further reduce the risk in this demographic group. These findings highlight the importance of improving current local surveillance for leptospirosis and health care services for the high-risk populations living in the high-risk areas identified in our study. We also found that disease transmission might have emerged in some counties located in temperate regions to the north of the country although at the very low rate. This may partly be due to change in environmental conditions (i.e., climate variation and changes in land use/land cover) or the translocation of potential reservoirs from adjoining endemic regions. Climate variation notably the increase in temperatures may have driven the spread of Leptospira towards temperate regions in China through its impact on rodent population growth in these areas [40] . Several outbreaks in China have been thought to be associated with high rainfall intensity [26] . However, we suggest that further investigation should be performed to determine whether the emerging incidence may correlate with changes in climate and other environmental and social conditions (e.g., human migration).",30.95273344788945,8.903876486181206

The initial clinical trials will test whether the vaccine is safe in humans, and whether it can cause the immune system to produce an immune response that is specific for the Ebola virus. Assuming that the outcomes of these trials are positive, the next question is whether the vaccine can protect humans against Ebola disease. Because Ebola is so dangerous and outbreaks are relatively rare, the vaccine will likely be tested only during an actual outbreak. At that time, an experimental vaccine might be given to people at immediate risk of becoming infected, especially health-care workers who, because they take care of infected patients, are themselves at very high risk of becoming infected. In addition to trials in humans, the scientists will also explore whether this vaccine, which was developed based on the GP component of the Zaire strain, can protect monkeys against infections with other strains of the Ebola virus.

In North America, Toronto experienced the bulk of cases that largely affected health care workers [1] . The Ontario health authorities alerted health care personnel on March 14, 2003 about 4 family members with atypical pneumonia that resulted in two deaths. A province-wide emergency was declared on March 26 th , 2003 when it became evident that these cases were the epidemiological link to SARS. The government and health care providers took steps to contain the spread of SARS by enacting infection control procedures, screening and isolating those people who were exposed, and admitting affected personnel, many of whom were health care workers, to special hospital SARS units. The public health precautions proved effective enough that by June 12, 2003 there were no more new cases. During those 3 months 273 people were identified as being confirmed SARS [2] cases. 44 [3] died. Because identification of victims and containment were the orders of the time, medical attention focused upon the features of the acute phase of the illness. They were identified as having new onset of fever, documented elevated temperature, and were likely to have nonproductive cough, myalgia, and dyspnea. Such individuals may have been exposed to patients who had traveled to a location known to harbour such cases, i.e., South China, South East Asia, or may have acquired these symptoms as the result of direct contact or exposure [1, 4] .

Some viruses are thought to cause disease by dysregulating the immune response, whereby destruction of infected cells or secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators leads to immunopathology, as in the case of hantaviruses (18) . Conversely, pathogenesis caused by some viruses correlates with deficiencies, or inefficiencies of the immune response, such as in the case of pathogenic viruses affecting the very young and elderly, or immune compromised individuals, as in the case of influenza virus (19) . The mechanisms by which the recently emerged MERS-CoV causes disease in humans, and what host factors are associated with either resistance or a poor outcome are not known (15) . These questions are important for the development of countermeasures that either directly target the virus to inhibit its replication or modulate the immune response to limit immunopathogenesis. Early epidemiologic studies of MERS suggested that patients with comorbidities fared worse than healthy patients upon infection, and the number of comorbidities correlated with a worse outcome (20) . In addition, a few patients with lethal infections were reported to be immunosuppressed (21) (22) (23) . These reports were from cases where diagnoses were primarily in patients already in hospitals, including a relatively large number of nosocomial infections affecting 23 patients in a hospital outbreak in Al-Hasa (24) .

The scope of the influences of the infectious diseases such as SARS and influenza extend far beyond the costs that were mentioned above, especially in the health-care and tourism sectors. The total costs in terms of lost production of the SARS epidemic to Toronto's economy had been estimated to be $1 billion, and the estimate for the economic cost for all of Canada was around $1.5 billion [17] . Within the health care sector, the indirect costs borne by non-SARS patients were enormous. SARS affected all health-care workers -especially those on the front line -and delayed ""non-emergency surgeries"" such as organ transplants and cancer radiation [18] . According to Ontario Health Minister Tony Clement, as of June 27, 2003, SARS had cost Ontario's health-care system $945 million, which was spent mostly on special supplies and added health-care workers needed to protect health-care workers, as well as on constructing specialized SARS clinics and isolation rooms [17] . This in turn had a huge impact on non-SARS related health care system utilization, both due to diversion of resources as well as severe stress amongst the health care providers. For instance, a study comparing the periods before and during the SARS outbreak in the GTA and non-GTA areas by Woodward et al. found the greatest impact of SARS on reduction in the utilization of inpatient and outpatient hospitalization, diagnostic testing, physician and emergency department visits, use of prescription drugs, intensive care bed availability, and cardiac care during April 2003 to May 2003 [19] .

During the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, many health care workers contracted Ebola, some fatally. However, no members of the Chinese Anti-Ebola medical team, deployed to provide vital medical care in Liberia were infected. This study aims to understand how this zero infection rate was achieved. Methods: Data was collected through 15 in-depth interviews with participants from the People's Liberation Army of China medical team which operated the Chinese Ebola Treatment Center from October 2014 to January 2015 in Liberia. Data were analysed using systematic framework analysis. Results: This study found numerous bio-psycho-socio-behavioural risk factors that directly or indirectly threatened the health of the medical team working in the Chinese Ebola Treatment Center. These factors included social and emotional stress caused by: (1) the disruption of family and social networks; (2) adapting to a different culture; (3) and anxiety over social and political unrest in Liberia. Exposure to Ebola from patients and local co-workers, and the incorrect use of personal protective equipment due to fatigue was another major risk factor. Other risk factors identified were: (1) shortage of supplies; (2) lack of trained health personnel; (3) exposure to contaminated food and water; (4) and long working hours. Comprehensive efforts were taken throughout the mission to mitigate these factors. Every measure was taken to prevent the medical team's exposure to the Ebola virus, and to provide the medical team with safe, comfortable working and living environments. There were many challenges in maintaining the health safety of the team, such as the limited capability of the emergency command system (the standardized approach to the command, control, and coordination of an emergency response), and the lack of comprehensive international protocols for dealing with emerging infectious disease pandemics. Conclusions: The comprehensive and multidisciplinary measures employed to protect the health of the medical team proved successful even in Liberia's resource-limited setting. The global health community can learn valuable lessons from this experience which could improve the safety of health care workers in future emergencies. These lessons include: establishing capable command systems; implementing effective coordination mechanisms; providing adequate equipment; providing training for medical teams; investing in the development of global health professionals; and improving research on ways to protect health care workers.",39.45165721373483,14.160271560935712

This was the largest outbreak of MERS outside of the Middle East. The large number of health care facilities involved in this event could be explained by the fact that many patients had visited multiple health care facilities before being isolated, and thus these exposures happened before MERS-CoV was suspected or diagnosed. The practice of seeking care at a number of medical facilities (""doctor shopping"") may have been a contributing factor [1] . Meanwhile, the average number of doctor consultations per person has increased in many OECD countries since 2000.

Interpersonal contact patterns play a large role in infectious disease spread, but little is known about the relationship between health care workers' (HCW) movements and contact patterns within a heath care facility and HAI. Quantitatively capturing these patterns will aid in understanding the dynamics of HAI and may lead to more targeted and effective control strategies in the hospital setting. Methods: Staff at 3 urban university-based tertiary care hospitals in Canada completed a detailed questionnaire on demographics, interpersonal contacts, in-hospital movement, and infection prevention and control practices. Staff were divided into categories of administrative/support, nurses, physicians, and ""Other HCWs"" -a fourth distinct category, which excludes physicians and nurses. Using quantitative network modeling tools, we constructed the resulting HCW ""co-location network"" to illustrate contacts among different occupations and with locations in hospital settings. Results: Among 3048 respondents (response rate 38%) an average of 3.79, 3.69 and 3.88 floors were visited by each HCW each week in the 3 hospitals, with a standard deviation of 2.63, 1.74 and 2.08, respectively. Physicians reported the highest rate of direct patient contacts (> 20 patients/day) but the lowest rate of contacts with other HCWs; nurses had the most extended (> 20 min) periods of direct patient contact. ""Other HCWs"" had the most direct daily contact with all other HCWs. Physicians also reported significantly more locations visited per week than nurses, other HCW, or administrators; nurses visited the fewest. Public spaces such as the cafeteria had the most staff visits per week, but the least mean hours spent per visit. Inpatient settings had significantly more HCW interactions per week than outpatient settings. Conclusions: HCW contact patterns and spatial movement demonstrate significant heterogeneity by occupation. Control strategies that address this diversity among health care workers may be more effective than ""one-strategy-fitsall"" HAI prevention and control programs.",27.902885440065063,11.229010928745824

Thanks to the worldwide spread of diseases coupled with the easy access to network information, communicable diseases such as Ebola, did not only affect the locations of the outbreak but also could cause panic or even major public health events in non-endemic areas. In the public health field, increased Internet searching implied the tremendous need of Ebola-related preventive knowledge to the public. That is to say, high attention areas could be more susceptible to rumors or false online information if public health authorities did not address the emerging public concerns in a timely manner. To handle the demand warranted by this emerging situation, traditional epidemiological methods and public health education modes were obviously inadequate. Online surveillance, with the aid of opinion indices, may have sensitively detected the emergence of serious infectious diseases at their initial stage via the Big Data platform in previous studies, which could buy time for controlling outbreaks of these diseases and reducing the risk of transmission to humans [28, 38, 39] . That is to say, this modality, different from classic epidemiology questionnaires and telephone interviews developed to know the public reaction after the disease outbreak, enables surveillance beforehand and saves health resources. More importantly, online surveillance can reflect public reactions to emergency public health events and disease outbreaks in a timely manner so that public health interventions can be implemented during epidemic crises to avoid deterioration. Additionally, compared to the classical health education mode aimed at high-risk populations in high morbidity regions, our results implied a need for a shift in health education methods to a public-attention-based mode, especially in non-epidemic areas, to identify the regions of high attention. This new mode should be based on the findings of opinion monitoring through public reaction indices like BDI and SMI. Different interventions, in the future, should be adopted for areas with different indices, more attention being targeted at high-index areas in terms of public propaganda and education.",25.550170344248386,10.224198490130146

Before the Ebola virus disease outbreak that occurred in 2014, the country had not yet adopted or implemented the revised IDSR guidelines (2010). Thus, public health surveillance was weak in Sierra Leone and may have contributed to the delayed case detection of the first Ebola cases [9] . The situation was aggravated by the infection of 328 health care workers with Ebola virus disease and the death of at least 152 [10] . Many volunteer health care workers, who constitute a considerable proportion of health workforce in Sierra Leone, resigned during the outbreak further worsening the shortage of health care workers. This led to the closure of health facilities thus interfering with collection and transmission of surveillance data. A rapid assessment conducted in 2015 showed that less than half of the health facilities were submitting weekly reports of priority diseases and often, the reports were submitted late.

Obgyn clinics are run by obstetrics-gynecology specialists and provide medical care for women, including low-risk child deliveries. In Taiwan, low-risk pregnant women are allowed to seek services from medical centers without restrictions. During the 2003 SARS epidemic in Taiwan, the general population avoided seeking health care due to a combination of factors, including the vulnerability of health-care workers, and the rapid transmission of and limited knowledge about the disease [16] . In particular, people avoided seeking care from advanced hospitals (i.e., regional hospitals and medical centers) because SARS patients were being treated there. Therefore, expectant mothers began seeking maternity services at local community hospitals instead of at advanced hospitals to avoid becoming exposed to SARS [17] . This change in expectant mothers' preference of healthcare providers led to an increase of 7.1 % and 2.1% of the market share of total childbirth deliveries in clinics and in district hospitals, respectively [17] . Due to inconclusive evidence surrounding birth outcomes in local community hospitals, this large shift in childbirth services to local community hospitals has led to serious concerns about quality of care [17] .

The majority of European hospitals are not equipped with isolation units for patients and high security containments for sample management in the event of emerging or re-emerging infectious diseases with high risk potential. Specific challenges in a hospital environment are patient care, the handling of infectious samples for diagnostics and the work with dead bodies. Various protective suit systems for different applications are commercially available and the selection of the most appropriate PPE (optimal protection, best ergonomic features and best tolerance by wearers) should be based on evidence. Performing hazardous laboratory or clinical work while wearing PPE involves various constrictions compared to the same work without PPE. For example, multiple layers of gloves limit dexterity, long-term work in PPE may cause heat stress, viewing foils of face shields (dependent on the suit system) reflect and refract the light making observation stressful and leading to eye fatigue. Therefore, health care professionals wearing chemical, biological, radiation and nuclear personal protective equipment (CBRN-PPE) and performing intubation and intravenous cannulation are significantly slower or even unsuccessful compared to personnel with the same skills performing the same work under standard conditions as shown by a UK study mimicking time critical emergency casualties caused by a CBRN incident [1] . Apart from the information provided by the suit manufacturers, not many systematic studies exist on the requirements of CBRN-PPE, particularly for HCWs. Consequently, there is a need to test various types of PPE for material compatibility, determination of protection factors, wearer comfort and additional adaptations to specific needs [2, 3] . So far, tests mimicking the event of a biological threat have been performed in different contexts, for example, the assessment of whole hospitals by the French ""Biotox-Pirotox"" Network [4] , performance of resuscitation skills wearing PPE [5, 6] , and evaluation of PPE protection factors [7, 8] .

During the most recent outbreak of SARS, HCWs suffered considerable stress, partly from an overstretched health-care system [17, 18] . A similar scenario is expected should a MERS outbreak occur in Saudi Arabia. Our results show that the attitude of a sample of HCWs in Saudi Arabia toward MERS-CoV infection is in the negative range, with an overall average concern score of 40 out of a maximum possible score of 93 points, indicating a moderate level of concern. In a study conducted in a tertiary teaching hospital in Greece, more than half of the surveyed HCWs experienced moderately high levels of worry about the A/H1N1 influenza pandemic [19] . In our study, one-fourth of HCWs had high levels of concern regarding the MERS outbreak. This finding is in accordance with the results of a similar study, published in 2015, of HCWs at Makkah hospitals, Saudi Arabia [10] . High levels of concern have also been demonstrated in the Saudi public [20] . These negative attitudes and high levels of concern could be attributed to the novelty of MERS-CoV infection and the lack of previous experience with, or exposure to, MERS. However, perceptions are not always negative, and results published in 2014 from a study in the Al Qassim region of Saudi Arabia demonstrated positive attitudes in HCWs towards MERS [11] . There has been possibility that media coverage may be influencing HCWs' attitudes to MERS-CoV. When comparing our findings with those from other studies, other factors that might contribute to any observed differences should be taken into consideration. Prominent among these are the variability in definition of high Table 4 Predictors of high concern scores among health-care workers in Saudi Arabia Overall concern Self-satisfaction domain concern (cut-off point beyond which the high level of concern is considered), age difference between studied subjects and time of the study. Lack of standardization in methodology between different studies creates difficulties for making proper comparisons between different populations. An important finding in our study was that high level of concern was prevalent among HCWs, although it took different forms. Concern was mainly observed when respondents replied negatively to questions regarding fears of infection of a family member, risk of infection if one of the colleagues gets infected, risks associated with dealing with a febrile patient, or obligation of care provision for patients infected with MERS-CoV and lack of faith in standard precautions. Similar responses have been recorded in relation to MERS and other diseases. More than half (55%) of surveyed HCWs in Japan indicated a high level of fear and anxiety of SARS-CoV infection, even in the absence of an epidemic, and a high proportion (92%) preferred to avoid patients with SARS [21] . Approximately 90% of surveyed HCWs in Thailand accepted the personal risk of caring for patients with H5N1 infections [22] , and approximately 78% of the Saudi public who were surveyed agreed that schools should close in case of an H1N1 influenza epidemic [7] . However, this finding was not in agreement with the finding of the present study where only 19% of HCWs agreed that schools and shopping markets need to be closed.",28.20650132578985,10.35852715910804

As our study showed, none of the patients with influenza associated deaths were vaccinated. Influenza vaccine is available at the vaccination centers throughout the country, but it is underutilized and only small proportion of the population is usually vaccinated. No systematic approach is used to vaccinate high risk groups and health care workers.

At pandemic onset, the population is fully susceptible S to infection upon contact with an infectious individual. Individuals then enter an exposed class (infected but not yet infectious) where they can receive prophylaxis (E p ) or not (E np ). Infectious individuals can either present for healthcare (I) or not (A), and those who present can either receive treatment (I np,t ) or not (I np,nt ). Once recovered from infection (R Inp , R Anp , R Ip , R Ap ), individuals are assumed to be fully resistant to reinfection. The model also incorporates a dynamic ""contact"" label, applied to a fixed number of individuals drawn from the whole population each time a new infectious case appears. This allows simulation of targeted post-exposure antiviral prophylaxis (PEP). The Australian population was stratified into five distinct risk groups (young children, elderly, high-risk, health care workers, and the general adult population), to allow for differential risks of severe outcomes, differential benefits conferred by antiviral treatment, and targeted treatment and prophylaxis strategies. It was assumed that these groups mixed homogeneously. All simulations were performed as described by Moss and colleagues [1] .

The incubation period of influenza ranges from 1 to 5 days. Viral shedding occurs 1 day before clinical symptoms appear through the duration of the symptomatic period (Gelber and Ratner, 2002) . Protection and treatment are limited in neonates and especially preterm infants (Whitley and Monto, 2006) as current influenza vaccines are not effective in infants under 6 month of age (Principi and Esposito, 2004 ). An important prevention method is annual vaccination against influenza of parents, other caregivers and health care workers. However, low compliance, particularly in health care workers, has been repeatedly reported (Kassianos et al., 2018) also among health care workers in the NICU (Milupi et al., 2012; Tsagris et al., 2012) . Thus, infected NICU staff may be the source of nosocomial outbreaks, particularly during the early onset phase of the infection and when pressure to present at work is high during critically staffed periods. Despite the obviously possible vicious circle of low immunization rate among healthcare workers-increased likelihood of influenza infection-decreased staffing-increased pressure to present at work even when prodromal symptoms start, we did not identify epidemiological work focusing on the effect of these interconnections.",29.839068895292865,8.871507348616326

These additional interventions include the use of household protection kits, designed to reduce transmission in the community; improvements in infection control protocols in health care settings that reduce transmission among health care workers; and the impact of rapid diagnostic kits in Ebola treatment centers, which reduce the time to isolation for infectious individuals seeking hospitalization. Increasing awareness and education of the population about the disease could have also yielded further reductions in case incidence by reducing the size of the at-risk susceptible population (Fig. 3) [27] . Nevertheless, some of these effects could have been indirectly captured implicitly by the time-dependent safe burial rate parameter in their model. Importantly, prior models of EVD transmission [23, 28, 29] and the model by Drake and colleagues have not incorporated spatial heterogeneity in the transmission dynamics. In particular, the EVD epidemic in West Africa can be characterized as a set of asynchronous local (e.g., Figure 5 . Epidemic growth in two populations characterized by two different underlying contact networks. Random mixing leads to a rapidly disseminating infectious disease that spreads exponentially fast. By contrast, disease spread is significantly slower in a highly clustered contact network because the contacts of recently infected individuals are likely to be already infected by other infectious individuals. The contact networks are shown for illustration and are composed of a set of nodes (individuals) denoted by red dots while blue lines (links) between nodes denote static contacts.

The development of transmission models that incorporate spatial heterogeneity (e.g., by modeling spatial coupling or human migration) is currently limited by the shortage of detailed datasets from the EVD-affected areas about the geographic distribution of households, health care settings, reporting and hospitalization rates across urban and rural areas, and patterns of population mobility in the region. Some of these limitations may be overcome in the near future.

Therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend contact and airborne precautions for any initial suspected case of avian influenza in a human. In late October 2006, the CDC released an updated interim guidance on the use of masks and respirators in the health care setting (Table 3 ). In certain high risk procedures, additional protection with an N-95 particulate respirator may be considered given the likelihood of generating aerosol particles that may enhance transmission (Table  4 ). Respiratory protection should be worn along with an impermeable gown, face shield, and gloves. Initial cases should be placed in a negative pressure isolation room with 6-12 air changes per hour. Hand hygiene with antibacterial soap or alcohol based washless gel should be standard, with appropriate basins at each patient room. Seasonal vaccination of all health care workers should be preformed and emphasized to reduce spread. Visitors and family members should be strictly monitored and limited to reduce the likelihood of spread.

In 1984, the ACIP expanded recommendations to include infants born to mothers who were hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive. Recognition of the difficulty in identifying mothers infected with hepatitis B led to a recommendation in 1988 to test all women for HBsAg during the prenatal period. Vaccinating high-risk groups continued to be difficult because no foundation existed to vaccinate adolescents and adults who already were participating in high-risk activities. In 1991, a universal infant vaccination strategy was instituted to achieve the goal of reducing transmission of hepatitis B virus [46] . It is recommended that the first dose be given at or before 2 months of age with a preference for all infants to receive the first dose at birth. Neonatal vaccination works by protecting the infant from contracting hepatitis after vertical or horizontal exposure. Giving all infants the birth dose protects infants whose mothers were not tested for HBsAg during pregnancy. Infant vaccination eventually will provide protection against hepatitis B virus to adolescents who may engage in high-risk activities before exposure.

SARS is highly contagious, specifically to health care workers and in particular where the index case is not immediately identified as having the disease. At the Prince of Wales Hospital, a patient was admitted on the 4/3/03 with ""pneumonia"" and was discharged well on the 11/3/03. On the 10/3/03 however, 18 health care workers became ill and a further 50 potential cases were identified on that day. By March 156 patients had been admitted to Prince of Wales Hospital with SARS, all traceable to this index patient (96). In Singapore similarly, initial transmission occurred from an index case to 12 patients, 10 of whom were primary contacts and 5 of whom were health care workers (97). In this latter case, Singaporean media labeled this patient a super-spreader, a concept that, although as yet inadequately defined may possibly be correct (98,99). Some patients do appear to spread the disease more readily and this may be related to the rate of shedding of viral particles. In Toronto amongst 144 cases 73 (51%) were health care workers and the subsequent outbreak of at least 90 patients occurred as a consequence of a cluster of unrecognized patients that had been admitted to North York Hospital in Toronto (90).",33.60508725760538,12.32387987839163

Appropriate risk communication should provide sufficient, credible information to help the entire community accurately assess the risks in crisis situations. Effective risk communication can also enhance health care workers' participation during a pandemic or other risk-prone disaster. The audiences are the media (who can then more accurately disseminate information), health care professionals, staff, and the public. Although national health agencies have developed plans for risk communication at the national, regional, and local levels, few communities, hospitals, or local EMS agencies have such plans. [39] [40] [41] People naturally exaggerate the risk of phenomena that are unknown or ""dreaded,"" such as those with delayed, irreversible or manmade effects; that have new, unknown, or unobservable risks; or that are global. They also exaggerate the risks of phenomena ""hyped"" by the media. Conversely, people tend to play down risks with which they are familiar. In crises, risk communication helps health care workers and the public identify the actual risks to themselves and their loved ones and understand what others are doing and what they can do to avoid risk. 42 Specific risk communication methods help fearful populations to hear, understand, and remember messages better, including delivering no more than 3 brief, clear messages in their order of importance; repeating key messages; and using clear visual aids or demonstrations to help clarify the information (video is available online at http://www. annemergmed.com). 43 Senior clinicians in the ED and EMS can use risk communication strategies and also model behavior at the bedside, for example, demonstrating their belief that the protective measures in place are effective. They can also articulate the essential role that members of the health care team play in responding to a disaster. Many nonprofessionals in Toronto's SARS epidemic failed to show up to work because they believed that they were not valued or given important information (S. H. Gray, oral communication, 2005) . 44 This is paralleled by a recent study in Maryland, which found that 46% of the public health workers surveyed would be unlikely to report for work during a pandemic: one third said it was because they would not play an important role. 45 Crisis leaders should emphasize the vital role of all health care workers so that health care facilities and systems will have enough people available to function effectively.",38.119653077632506,14.730680366455129

This risk is considered to be low but not zero. 5 In a policy decision model presented to ACIP, investigators assessed different release scenarios and probability of release thresholds above which the policy should be to vaccinate public health and medical care teams. 10 In their conclusions, they endorsed ""a policy of vaccinating all eligible health care workers and first responders before an attack."" They assumed that these workers would accept the ""risk of personal harm for the public good"" and would volunteer to get vaccinated, which has turned out not to be the case. Fortunately, however, although we cannot quantify with confidence the probability of smallpox release, it is very likely that should a smallpox release and outbreak occur anywhere in the world, we would discover the outbreak within 2 to 3 weeks of the initial clinical cases as was the case with monkeypox. 11 Given a confirmed outbreak of smallpox, vaccination of targeted health care workers followed by mass vaccination would occur. In addition, individuals exposed to a case Close contacts to infectious vaccinees are at risk of unintentional infection and the development of contact vaccinia. 13 For these contacts, there is only risk and no immediate benefit. For those who are uninformed of their exposure, the risk is involuntary. This poses an ethical dilemma in the health care setting. In general, patients accept the risks of medical care because there is an expected benefit from this care. However, if a patient experiences an exposure to vaccinia and has not been informed, we have subjected the patient to potential harm with no clear benefit. It is unethical to submit a patient to a preventable exposure without their knowledge and/or consent. On ethical grounds, we agree with Thorne et al 1 that health care workers who were recently vaccinated should not have close and continuous contact with patients until they are noninfectious.",37.45316880819007,14.173107897806977

The most effective mitigation strategies to prepare for the consequences of an outbreak would be to plan for the home quarantine of patients, establish public information strategies to reduce public concern, close affected facilities until conditions permit their safe reopening, plan for a coordinated information and command and control center, and have preestablished protocols and procedures in place to protect the health of health care workers and first responders. 24 Vaccination is an essential component of hospital and community mitigation planning. During the fall of 2002, the U.S. government requested that all states prepare for a smallpox attack. The preparations called for each state to present plans to vaccinate all persons within the state, within a 10-day period, starting with health care workers. 25 Each facility and community needs to look at the risk of a disease, the effect of vaccination on health care workers, and the ability to maintain continuity of care. One outcome of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic was that several organizations, including the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA), the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC), and the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) recommended that health care workers be mandated to receive yearly influenza vaccinations, which helps to minimize the risk that they will transmit influenza to high-and low-risk patients and bring influenza home to their families. If properly informed and vaccinated, health care workers could respond and treat patients without risk to themselves or their families. The availability of a vaccine and the ability to mass-vaccinate the majority of the population should be considered in all community response plans. The plans for both SARS and pan-influenza now need to address the availability and possible stockpiling of antiviral agents as well as procedures for mass vaccination of the population, if a vaccine were to become available.",40.0247527459653,15.453370419620187

Responses from unit and hospital managers indicated a high level of knowledge of this policy (93.3% and 85.4%, respectively). Health care workers from those units overwhelming (95.5%) stated they would select an N95 respirator or a more protective PAPR when caring for a patient with suspected or confirmed pH1N1, demonstrating a high level of knowledge of the policy even if it may not have been consistently followed in practice. We did not assess awareness of the Cal/OSHA ATD standard; thus it is not possible to determine whether or not having an applicable new state regulation was a key factor in promoting the implementation of these policies in California. In contrast, a survey of medical students and residents at a Washington, DC, hospital (November-December 2009) showed that only 13% of medical students and 21% of residents would wear an N95 respirator when caring for a patient with influenza symptoms. 15 Another study conducted at a New York City hospital identified 277 unprotected health care worker exposures related to 44 patients with pH1N1 infection (May-July 2009), explained by suboptimal adherence to PPE recommendations in addition to other factors. 16 In general, the basic elements required with respirator use (eg, medical clearance, fit testing, and employee training) were in place in all hospitals, as demonstrated by consistent responses across health care workers, unit managers, and hospital managers. Because onsite evaluation visits were conducted in January-February 2010, we are unable to report on the extent of N95 respirator readiness in these facilities at the start of the pandemic. Jaeger et al 14 found that 52% of health care workers exposed to the earliest California patients with pH1N1 infections after admission to the hospital were ""N95 ready,"" defined as having been fit tested within the past year and knowing the appropriate size and location of N95 respirators. Data collected from 22 states on 48 health care workers with clinical care duties who had been infected with pH1N1 showed that 69% had ever been fit tested, another assessment of respirator readiness. 17 A National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health survey of internal medicine residents and fellows at 4 Utah hospitals conducted August-September 2009 showed a lower level of training on N95 respirator use (43%) and lower level of fit testing (22% between the beginning of their training and June 2009) than found among this California health care worker sample. 18 Interviewed health care workers overwhelmingly (94%) believed that N95 respirators would be more effective than surgical/ medical masks at protecting them from pH1N1 infection. Given that clearly understanding the differences in protection and appropriate use between respirators versus surgical/facemasks had been cited as a potential challenge for the health care field in pandemic influenza preparedness, 2 our results may reflect progress made in this area. In contrast, 24% of respondents in the Utah study believed that surgical masks and N95 respirators provided equal protection. 18 The heightened awareness among California health care workers about the role of respiratory protection against pH1N1 may have been due to publicity regarding the new ATD standard, and/or employer or union-based educational efforts. Thirty-five percent of health care workers reported experiencing no problems while wearing respirators, and of those who did experience problems, feeling uncomfortably warm was the most frequent issue mentioned (49%), followed by interference with eyeglasses (21%).",34.194811508467374,13.450452692204419

Indeed, in Vietnam the outbreak was terminated without negative pressure isolation rooms, and with only the use of surgical masks. A second observation is that large outbreaks occurred only where infection was already established before the global alert. In the United States, Europe, and even Vancouver, despite multiple importations, outbreaks did not occur. The basic recommendations for screening and prompt isolation of all suspect patients, together with quarantine of contacts, prevented health care worker and patient acquisition at the facility level, as well as regional outbreaks in all parts of the world where outbreaks were not already established.

The focus on intubation as a risk in Toronto lead to guidelines recommending powered air purifying respirators (PAPR) for intubation, as noted in the article by Peng et al. 10 Again, other professionals across the country interpreted these as being generally applicable, without consideration of local risk. A full evaluation of risks of infection acquisition with intubation relative to other procedures is still pending at the time of this writing. However, initial evaluation does not clearly support a risk for transmission with intubation when appropriate precautions are used. The few cases which have occurred are characterized by non-compliance with appropriate precautions, including use of eyewear, or uncontrolled situations characterized by multiple opportunities for extensive contamination and staff exposure prior to the intubation event. Preliminary analysis of transmission in emergency rooms and other hospital areas does support a concern that any procedure which creates aerosols -high flow nasal oxygen, medications, noninvasive positive pressure respiration -facilitates transmission. Not surprisingly, health care workers with the greatest risk of infection acquisition before personal protective equipment was used routinely were those with greatest exposure to patients in time and proximity. 11 The most widely publicized Toronto transmission episode, where most cases of health care work illness acquisition despite apparent infection control precautions occurred, 5 provided opportunities for transmission over several hours, and both intubators and non-intubators became infected. On the other hand, a hospital in Hong Kong with over 300 SARS cases reported only two health care workers who became infected following institution of uniform precautions of single gloves, surgical mask, eye protection, and gowns. Neither of these workers had exposure through intubation, although many intubations were performed in SARS patients in this hospital.

First, the high viral load during the early phase of illness suggests that patients could be most infectious during this period, and it might account for the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the high viral load on presentation suggests that SARS-CoV-2 could be susceptible to emergence of antiviral resistance. Second, age was associated with viral load in this study, which could explain the high degree of severe disease in older patients with SARS-CoV-2. 5, 6 The high viral load in elderly patients is associated not only with low immunity but also with high expression of the ACE2 receptor (the cellentry receptor for SARS-CoV-2) in older adults. 7 The timing of antibody seroconversion is crucial for determining the optimum timepoints for collecting serum specimens for antibody testing for diagnosis. Furthermore, this information is important for immunologists to choose the best timepoints for obtaining peripheral blood B cells for development of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. 8 The major strength of the study by To and colleagues is the systematic analysis of the serial viral load and antibody profile for up to 4 weeks, which provides insights into viral and host interactions during the acute and convalescent phases. Another notable aspect is that self-collected posterior oro pharyngeal saliva samples were used, instead of nasopharyngeal specimens, for viral load monitoring. Collection of nasopharyngeal specimens is an invasive procedure, and it is uncomfortable for the patient and poses an infection risk to health-care workers. Self-collected saliva is much more acceptable to patients and is safer for health-care workers. This study clearly shows the feasibility of using saliva for viral load monitoring.",31.478819426545144,11.918588582006121

Since its initial identification in June 2012 in Saudi Arabia, MERS has caused 2090 infections and 730 deaths (case fatality rate: ∼35%) in 27 countries as of November 2017 (WHO, 2017) . MERS is caused by the MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) , and belongs to the family of Coronaviridae, the genus ß-coronavirus. Like SARS-CoV that belongs in the same genus, MERS-CoV is a zoonotic disease that originates from bats, suggesting that bats are the most likely natural reservoir of MERS-CoV (Annan et al., 2013; Memish et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2014) . Studies have confirmed the presence of MERS-CoV in dromedaries in the Arabian Peninsula and North Africa (Hemida et al., 2017; Kayali and Peiris, 2015; Reusken et al., 2013) . Dromedaries are thought to be the main reservoir of MERS-CoV. Although transmission of MERS-CoV from camels to humans has not been reported to date, it has been postulated that primary human infection could result from close contact with camels, which shed the virus (Azhar et al., 2014) . Of note, a major MERS outbreak in South Korea resulted in 186 cases, including 36 deaths in 2015. The majority of these cases were health care workers who were in close contact with infected patients (Korea Ministry of Health and Welfare, 2015) .

Therefore, the target populations for a vaccine when available is not the general population, but groups at high risk of exposure to animal reservoirs, health care workers in endemic regions, and possibly at-risk travelers. With this relatively small market, it will be difficult for commercial organizations to invest in MERS CoV vaccine development.

Most of these patients (82%) survived, largely because they received high-quality, supportive critical care. 7 Planning and delivering care to these patients was labor and resource intensive and took place in a few specialized centers. The cost to establish an Ebola treatment center in the United States has been estimated to be $1,200,000, whereas the cost to care for a single patient in this setting may be as high as $30,000 per day. 69, 70 Secondary transmission of EBOV to health care workers in a community hospital in Texas served as a stark reminder of the risks associated with caring for patients with EVD and the need for adequate resources, planning, and training to mitigate risk. 71 Although EVD is the most recent example of a highly infectious disease necessitating ICU care, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV serve as other important examples. The 2003 to 2004 SARS-CoV epidemic resulted in more than 8000 infections and 700 deaths worldwide. In Toronto, Canada, 375 probable and suspected cases of SARS-CoV occurred, with 72% related to a health care exposure. 72, 73 Similarly, MERS-CoV has resulted in large nosocomial outbreaks in Saudi Arabia and Korea.

It is one of the most frequent infectious diseases worldwide, and its transmission is airborne. The disease can be extremely contagious. During an occupational outbreak, a single patient working in a shipyard (with an eight-month delay in diagnosis) was the source of a huge outbreak in a small town in Maine (Allos et al. 1996) . Those at highest risk were the ones working closest to the infected person (Allos et al. 1996) . Unfortunately, tuberculosis infections may not be recognized early (de Vries, Sebek & Lambregts-van Weezenbeek 2006) . The infection usually involves the lung parenchyma, but can also present in extra-pulmonary forms such as lymphadenopathy, bone and joint infections, and serious meningoencephalitis. Occupations at risk include health care workers and correctional workers. Nurses are among the professions at highest risk (Tzeng 2005) . Rates of latent infection in health care workers may be extremely high, especially in endemic areas with poor quality of protection (Kayanja, Debanne, King & Whalen 2005) . Transmission, however, has been found to be strongly associated with health care work, even in settings with low incidence of tuberculosis (Diel, Seidler, Nienhaus, Rusch-Gerdes & Niemann 2005) . From 2510 reported cases of tuberculosis during a 10-year study in San Fransisco (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) , 31 (1.2%) occurred in healthcare workers (Ong et al. 2006 ).

The main principles are promotion of hand disinfection, identification of MRSA risk patients (carriers and contacts of known MRSA cases), rapid microbiological identification of MRSA, contact isolation of MRSA cases, and treatment of MRSA infections. Emphasis is placed on trying to target preventive measures at the very first steps of possible MRSA transmission. According to the guidelines, every patient who has been treated in a hospital outside of Finland during the previous year and is transferred to a Finnish hospital is screened for MRSA colonisation at the time of hospital admission. Patient records of each MRSA case are labelled accordingly, and an ""MRSA alert"" is also added to electronic patient records in many institutions.

Thus, professions with such exposure (and especially healthcare workers) comprise the main risk groups. Hepatitis B has been associated with a higher risk for transmission to health care workers in comparison with HIV or Hepatitis C. The risk of transmission relates to the degree of contact, the Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) status of the source patient, and the serological conversion, which is estimated around 30 percent (Werner & Grady 1982) . The risk appears to be higher during the first five years of employment (Snydman et al. 1984) . Prevaccination with HBV vaccine, and the application of universal precautions in dealing with blood or other potentially infectious material, is paramount in preventive efforts against HBV. Recommendations for postexposure measures have been published, and HBV vaccine (if unvaccinated or with low serological titers), Hepatitis B immunoglobulin, or both, must be started as soon as possible (within 1-7 days) (Puro et al. 2005 Hepatitis C Hepatitis C is also acquired through exposure to blood or other potentially infectious material. Health care workers are again the primary risk group for exposure. The risk of transmission after a percutaneous exposure is in between that of Hepatitis B and HIV, and estimated around 1.8 percent (Range: 0%-7%)(Updated U.S. Public Health Service Guidelines for the Management of Occupational Exposures to HBV, HCV, and HIV and Recommendations for Postexposure Prophylaxis 2001). The risk depends on the type of procedure and the prevalence of the disease in the general population. For emergent thoracotomy and a prevalence in the population of 17 percent, a probability of 0.0027 for chronic Hepatitis C seroconversion has been calculated (Sikka et al. 2004) .

Epidemiological investigations during the WHO-China Joint Mission on COVID-19 found many infections clustered around households. 34 Extreme physical distancing measures, including school closures, workplace closures, and avoidance of any public gatherings all at once can push the transmission to households, leading to increased clustering of household cases. 5 As households are not explicitly included in the model, we did not consider heterogeneity and clustering of household transmission. Distinguishing between repeated and new contacts is important for disease propagation in contact network models; 35,36 more sophisticated methods that account for temporal presence within the household 37 would be needed to characterise higher degrees of contact. Looking at limitations of our study, our compartmental model does not capture individual-level heterogeneity in contacts, which could be important in super-spreading events, particularly early in an epidemic. Combined with nosocomial infections, the risk of COVID-19 infection is potentially amplified with close contact between confirmed cases and health-care workers. However, the compartmental model we present is not equipped to explicitly consider transmission within health-care institutions and households. More complex models, such as individual-based models with familial and health-care structures, should be explored. No socomial infection risk among health-care workers and patients has been identified as a research gap to be prioritised in the next few months by WHO.",29.928471800841148,9.762120757008631

However, policy makers need to be aware of the equivocal evidence when proposing or implementing national or regional school closures for COVID-19, given the very high costs of lengthy school closures during pandemics. Decisions about closures and their timing and length involve a series of trade-offs between conflicting factors, and a substantial loss of health-care staff to childcare duties during closures might substantially reduce any benefit to health systems and populations brought by closures of schools. 50 Nonetheless, in a context of high rates of staff absence through disease, school systems will be under strain and schools remaining open only for the children of health-care and other essential workers might be a better strategy than a haphazard process of schools closing and therefore providing no childcare for any essential workers.",27.1754000198187,8.422727868355269

To analyze whether the status of being a health care worker may have an impact on susceptibility, we performed a similar analysis separately in the non-health care worker population and health care worker populations.

Therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend contact and airborne precautions for any initial suspected case of avian influenza in a human. In late October 2006, the CDC released an updated interim guidance on the use of masks and respirators in the health care setting (Table 3 ). In certain high risk procedures, additional protection with an N-95 particulate respirator may be considered given the likelihood of generating aerosol particles that may enhance transmission (Table  4 ). Respiratory protection should be worn along with an impermeable gown, face shield, and gloves. Initial cases should be placed in a negative pressure isolation room with 6-12 air changes per hour. Hand hygiene with antibacterial soap or alcohol based washless gel should be standard, with appropriate basins at each patient room. Seasonal vaccination of all health care workers should be preformed and emphasized to reduce spread. Visitors and family members should be strictly monitored and limited to reduce the likelihood of spread. Finally, antiviral chemoprophylaxis should be available to any health care workers with exposure to an infected individual. Any symptomatic worker should be taken off duty and workplace surveillance should occur.

Would intensive care treatment offer any benefit to patients with Ebola infection? At the time of a UK national policy meeting in late 2014, many felt that interventions such as mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy would pose a risk to staff without making any difference to the patient's eventual death. There were a few dissenting opinions, including those expressed by staff at the Royal Free Hospital. Not long after the UK meeting, a report was published of successful ventilation and dialysis of a patient in the USA, suggesting that the policy of not offering advanced treatment in the UK was unnecessarily nihilistic. 11 On this background, one of the biggest worries for doctors, nurses, and other workers travelling to assist in West Africa was whether we would be repatriated to the UK if we contracted the disease we were treating. It was clear that although in our tented facility in the jungle south of Freetown we were able to provide a higher level of care than that available elsewhere in Sierra Leone, we did not have the equipment for respiratory or renal support. 12 One of the factors in whether health-care workers volunteer is probably how they think they will be treated if they develop an infection that has a 70% patient fatality rate in Africa but a 95% survival rate in Europe or the USA. One could argue on ethical grounds that volunteers who were encouraged to travel to West Africa by the NHS to assist in the epidemic should be supported to the full extent possible by the UK, including evacuation for care in a specialist unit. By the end of the outbreak, two UK civilian nurses and one military nurse had contracted Ebola infection in the course of their work.

The results of this study are also consistent with previous reports that attachment anxiety is associated with reports of physical symptoms [3, 32] . The finding that attachment avoidance is not related to perceived general health or sick days is consistent with previous research showing the associations between attachment avoidance and aspects of physical health to be weaker and less consistent than is found for attachment anxiety. There are several aspects of the three-way relationship among attachment, sleep and health that require further discussion. First, the distribution of adult attachment patterns in this study was unusual since attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance were strongly correlated. Since the independence of these dimensions when measured by the ECR-R has been confirmed in several studies [33] , their relationship in this study is likely a characteristic of the study sample. A higher than expected intercorrelation suggests that hospital workers who are higher in one dimension of attachment insecurity tend to also be higher the other dimension. Shaver and Mikulincer [34] understand the co-occurrence of attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance (also called ""fearful attachment"") as the result of a failure of avoidant defenses in the face of overwhelming stress. In other words, the cooccurrence of these dimensions of attachment insecurity is found in individuals who are predisposed to an avoidant response to attachment stressors (rather than an anxiouspreoccupied response), who then experience circumstances in which the avoidant response fails to protect them from underlying attachment-related anxiety. This formulation might help to explain the strong relationship between the dimensions of insecurity in this study, particularly if healthcare workers differ from other cohorts in being more prone to avoidant and less prone to anxious-preoccupied responses to attachment stressors. In that case, health-care workers who express attachment insecurity would tend to vary along a single dimension from secure to fearful (combined attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance) because it would be relatively unusual for them to express attachment anxiety alone. Although this speculation conforms to the common sense assumption that anxious attachment styles are not adaptive for those who work in hospitals and thus are underrepresented in a group of veteran (median years of experience=20) hospital workers, there is no evidence from other research that the attachment patterns of health-care workers differ from those found in the general population.

Infection can also be transmitted indirectly by contact with contaminated surfaces followed by selfinoculation of ocular, nasal, or oral mucosa. Adults are typically infectious to others from 1 day before developing symptoms to approximately 5 days after symptom onset. Young children and immunocompromised persons may shed virus for even longer, with shedding reported for 10 or more days after symptom onset. [1] [2] [3] [4] Surveillance studies have identified health care setting-acquired influenza outbreaks. 5 Influenza A and B viruses can spread rapidly between patients and health care workers (HCWs) in health care settings and may have serious and devastating consequences to high-risk populations. In particular, the elderly, critically ill, young children, and immunosuppressed patients including those receiving antineoplastic chemotherapy and/or solid organ or bone marrow transplant are at highest risk of developing serious influenza complications. The risks of infection-driven complications coupled with the clustering of these susceptible patients in the health care setting emphasize the need to minimize both patient and provider influenza virus exposures. 1, [6] [7] [8] The overall burden of health care facility-acquired influenza is unknown, but the potential economic and clinical impact is significant. 3, 5, 7 A simple approach to prevent close contact in the health care setting and decrease unnecessary utilization of health care services during influenza season is to have select patient groups (eg, previously healthy adults with no underlying medical conditions) collect their own nasal swab and deliver it to a convenient drop-off location for testing. This could be facilitated by a well-designed telephone or online triage system that would obviate the need for a health care visit in selected patients. Use of this strategy would require that patient-collected samples have similar sample quality and test efficacy for detection of influenza A and B virus RNA compared with those collected by a trained HCW.",41.08741094238739,14.368976386870079

Widmer, M. Lang, R. Frei (Basel, CH) Introduction: S. aureus (MSSA) carriage is common among health care workers (HCWs)and might be associated with type of care provided and other potential risk factors. Transmission of MSSA has been observed by ''cloud adults''. Objectives: To determine risk factors for MSSA carriage in HCWs, and the percentage of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in a tertiary care centre. Methods: Retrospective review of all data of staff health department and the microbiology laboratory. All HCWs who were working in a high MRSA prevalence country were routinely screened at the time they were hired by the institution. In addition, data were generated from MRSA screenings of HCWs if there was evidence for nosocomial transmission of MRSA in patients. MRSA was defined as S. aureus being oxacillin-resistant and expressing the PBP2' and/or being positive for the mecA gene by PCR. Data of HCWs were collected by chart review in a case-report form that included demographic data, work place, skin diseases and other variables. Data were compared by univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses. Results: A total of 3474 swabs were taken from 1217 HCWs between Jan 1997 and Dec.2001. Data were available from 1182 HCWs:50% originated from Switzerland, 27% from Germany, 4% from France, and 19% from other countries. The overall prevalence of MSSA and MRSA was 53% and 1%, respectively. More than one sample was available from 332 individuals: Of the repeat samples, 38% were negative, 32% were negative, but had one single positive culture, and 30% were consistently positive. Sex, profession, work place, number of years at the institution was not associated with S. aureus carriage (p > 0.2). The only significant risk factor for S. aureus carriage was young age, defined <35years (p = 0.02). The prevalence of MSSA increased from 51% (1997) to 63% (2001) . Eight HCWs were carriers of MRSA: they were young and half of the them reported skin diseases. Conclusion: S. aureus carriage among HCWs is common: Only young age remained a risk factor even after adjusting for other variables. MRSA was rare among HCWs.",27.67092962277738,11.077384261533444

Such uncertainty and unpredictability of pandemic outbreak of infectious disease from its clinical presentation, infectious causes, epidemiological features, fast transmission pattern, seriousness of public health impact, novelty, scale, implication for international public health, and underprepared health facilities to address the pandemic outbreak of COVID-19 have considerably high potential for psychological fear contagion as well and often result in prevalent multitude of psychological problems such as fear, anxiety, stigma, prejudice, marginalization towards the disease and its relation of all people ranging from healthy to at-risk individuals to care-workers (Mak et al., 2010) . Mass quarantine could cause a sense of collective hysteria, fear, and anxiety in health workers working in hospitals, inpatient and outpatient care, large tertiary care centers, community based hospitals, primary care settings, nursing homes, assisted living facilities and all isolation units. The medical health-care workers who are exposed and in direct contact with the confirmed and suspected coronavirus cases are vulnerable to both high risk infection and mental health problemsworried, scared, experiencing bereavement and trauma. With the advent of COVID-19 in Pakistan, medical workers have been under physical and psychological pressure including high risk of infection, inadequate equipment for safety from contagion, isolation, exhaustion, and lack of contact with family. The severity is causing further mental health problems which not only effect medical workers' decision making ability but could also have long term detrimental effect on their overall well-being. The unremitting stress medical health-care workers is experiencing could trigger psychological issues of anxiety, fear, panic attacks, posttraumatic stress symptoms, psychological distress, stigma and avoidance of contact, depressive tendencies, sleep disturbances, helplessness, interpersonal social isolation from family social support and concern regarding contagion exposure to their friends and family. The sudden role reversal from a J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f healthcare provider to the COVID-19 confirmed or suspected patient potentially lead to sense of frustration, helplessness, and adjustment challenges in healthcare professionals. Fear of labeling, stigmatization and discrimination potentially impede healthcare workers intent to seek counselling and psychotherapeutic interventions (Zheng, 2020) . Despite the common mental health problems and psychosocial issues among healthcare workers in such settings, most health professionals do not often seek or receive a systematic mental health care (Xiang et al., 2020).",45.936398622945376,16.675003140314818

The description and levels of personal protective equipment are presented in Tables 9.2 and 9.3. For effective implementation of these protective guidelines, the role of health-care facilities is essential. To safeguard health-care workers while taking care of Ebola virus disease patients, rigorous safety methods needed to be followed while putting on and taking off personal protective equipment.

Methods: All patients with the diagnosis of probable SARS admitted to a regional hospital in Hong Kong from March 9 to April 28, 2003, and who had SARS-related respiratory distress complications were recruited for NIPPV usage. The health status of all health-care workers working in the NIPPV wards was closely monitored, and consent was obtained to check serum for coronavirus serology.

In April 2003, SARS was added to the list of diseases for which quarantine is authorized (other diseases included are cholera, diphtheria, TB, plague, smallpox, yellow fever, and viral hemorrhagic fever). A lesson from SARS quarantines in Singapore is the capacity of a highly contagious infection to cause a rapid pandemic. The implications of quarantining a population or individuals for the length of the incubation time (or the length of the illness if patient is infected) are numerous. Quarantining a large population involves significant commitment of resources. To overcome the legal obstacles of a major quarantine, a plan must be in place well in advance of an outbreak. As part of the public health infrastructure, ED health care workers may be called on to participate in various infection containment strategies, including quarantining of individuals or vaccinating large segments of the population.

However, the lack of HCV transmission in both the study and control groups did not support the routine use of PEP in health-care workers after HCV exposure (Corey et al., 2009) . It is likely that the new polymerase and protease inhibitors used in the treatment of HCV infection will result in new strategies for PEP of HCV exposures. Blood-borne viruses can also be transmitted from healthcare workers to patients, especially during exposure-prone procedures in dental and cardiothoracic operations. The most well-known example involved an HIV-positive dentist working in Florida, USA, who infected five of his patients after performing invasive dental procedures on them . Sequencing of the HIV proviral envelope gene showed that the viruses infecting the dentist and the five patients were closely related . However, the overall risk for transmission of HIV from a health-care worker to a patient is very small. In a study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of 22 171 patients being cared by 51 HIV-positive health-care workers, 113 (0.5%) patients became HIV positive. Epidemiologic investigation did not implicate health-care workers as the source of infection in any of these patients (Robert et al., 1995) . In contrast, transmission of HBV and HCV from health-care workers to patients was more frequently documented. Between August 1991 and July 1992, 19 of 144 (13%) patients who were operated on by a thoracic surgeon with acute HBV infection became HBVinfected. Sequencing of 160 bases in the core region of HBV showed an indistinguishable pattern among the strains of the surgeon and nine infected patients (Harpaz et al., 1996) . Subsequently, numerous health-care worker-to-patient transmissions of HBV and HCV were reported. Among all these reported cases, the viral loads of the index health-care workers were more than 10 6 genome copies per ml (Buster et al., 2003; Gunson et al., 2003) . In this connection, the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) issued a guideline for the management of health-care workers who are infected with HIV, HBV, and HCV to impose restriction on different categories of exposure-prone procedures according to the viral load (Henderson et al., 2010) .",37.284560864023646,15.945474569696483

As was the case with the SARS protocol, this process can be daunting. Focusing an organization's finite resources to assure that attention is paid to the most critical and potentially riskiest care processes is a challenge for most organizations. A variety of tools exist to guide the objective prioritization of what may ultimately be a very long list of critical issues that must be addressed. FMEA is a powerful risk assessment tool that provides a systems-based, human-factors-focused, and objective methodology for identifying and prioritizing risk, with the ultimate aim of reducing patient harm and enhancing clinical research. 19,21e28 Historically, FMEA has been used in the engineering environment to assess high-risk processes associated with power generation in the commercial nuclear power industry; in aviation to assess the acceptability of aircraft designs; and in the automotive industry to establish manufacturing requirements for cars and trucks. 19, 22, 24 DeRosier and colleagues at the Veteran's Administration's Center for Patient Safety are credited with moving the techniques of FMEA to the bedside, applying the concept of prospective risk analysis to health-care processes. 29, 30 In 2002, the use of FMEA in health care further expanded with the issuance of a Joint Commission requirement that all health-care organizations seeking accreditation conduct at least one proactive risk assessment on a high-risk clinical process every 18 months. 31 Clinical care practitioners as well as clinical research professionals can use FMEAs to identify risk and to avert adverse events, errors, and other system failures in a variety of health-care settings. 19, 20, 22, 23, 27, 28 In a complex care environment, where risk is compounded by the interplay of clinical medicine and clinical research, FMEA is a useful tool to guide risk mitigation by identifying critical risk points in clinical care and clinical research processes. In 2016, investigators at the National Institute of Mental Health initiated a clinical research protocol at the NIH CC to study the neurobiology of suicide and to identify risk factors for short and long-term suicidality. One of the study phases involved admitting actively suicidal patients. In response to this research protocol, the NIH CC set in motion a rigorous risk mitigation initiative. An interdisciplinary team comprised of patient safety professionals, research investigators, nurses, social workers, and hospital leadership used FMEA to evaluate potential risk points throughout the clinical research and patient care processes. The analysis was facilitated using QI Path, an FMEA software package.

Local health authorities have since stepped up various prevention and intervention activities against further spread of the disease [4] . At the community level, health authorities have launched large-scale public health education programs about the disease, issued preventive health guidelines to health care workers and the general public, suspension of classes for schools and universities, prompt isolation of infected individuals, and ordering of probable infected individuals to quarantine themselves at home for 10 days. At the individual level, health advice is given on ways to prevent contracting and spreading of SARS. The suggested SARS preventive behaviors include (1) maintaining good personal hygiene (covering nose and mouth with a tissue when sneezing or coughing and washing hands immediately afterward with liquid soap), (2) developing a healthy lifestyle with proper diet, regular exercises, adequate rest, and no smoking, (3) ensuring good ventilation at home and in the office, and (4) wearing facemasks, especially for those with respiratory tract infections or those caring for them.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health developed a hierarchy of controls designed to prevent injury and illness in the workplace (Fig. 2) . The hierarchy can be used to guide the development of protocols aimed at protecting health care workers from occupational hazards and exposure. It suggests a ranking of effectiveness with elimination and substitution described as the most effective because they direct removal or replacement of the hazard. This is followed by engineering controls, to isolate people from the hazard, and administration controls, which change the way people work through training or protocol development. PPE is at the bottom of the hierarchy and described as the least effective control. This is not because PPE is ineffective but as a control measure it means the hazard has not been eliminated or replaced, and protection is required. 10 PPE guidelines have been in place in the realm of health careassociated infection and isolation care with little modification for over a decade. 11 Despite this guidance, the lack of standards for design and performance of gowns in particular came to light after the experience of treating patients with EVD in 2014. 12 The Nebraska Biocontainment Unit has described the protocols used for protection of health care workers for EVD care in the literature. 13 The initial standards and procedures set by the hospitals that cared for patients with Ebola in the United States eventually became a guidance resource for managing patients with EVD worldwide. 14 ",31.74396184943554,10.361761546153355

Infection can also be transmitted indirectly by contact with contaminated surfaces followed by selfinoculation of ocular, nasal, or oral mucosa. Adults are typically infectious to others from 1 day before developing symptoms to approximately 5 days after symptom onset. Young children and immunocompromised persons may shed virus for even longer, with shedding reported for 10 or more days after symptom onset. [1] [2] [3] [4] Surveillance studies have identified health care setting-acquired influenza outbreaks. 5 Influenza A and B viruses can spread rapidly between patients and health care workers (HCWs) in health care settings and may have serious and devastating consequences to high-risk populations. In particular, the elderly, critically ill, young children, and immunosuppressed patients including those receiving antineoplastic chemotherapy and/or solid organ or bone marrow transplant are at highest risk of developing serious influenza complications. The risks of infection-driven complications coupled with the clustering of these susceptible patients in the health care setting emphasize the need to minimize both patient and provider influenza virus exposures. 1, [6] [7] [8] The overall burden of health care facility-acquired influenza is unknown, but the potential economic and clinical impact is significant. 3, 5, 7 A simple approach to prevent close contact in the health care setting and decrease unnecessary utilization of health care services during influenza season is to have select patient groups (eg, previously healthy adults with no underlying medical conditions) collect their own nasal swab and deliver it to a convenient drop-off location for testing. This could be facilitated by a well-designed telephone or online triage system that would obviate the need for a health care visit in selected patients.

Responses from unit and hospital managers indicated a high level of knowledge of this policy (93.3% and 85.4%, respectively). Health care workers from those units overwhelming (95.5%) stated they would select an N95 respirator or a more protective PAPR when caring for a patient with suspected or confirmed pH1N1, demonstrating a high level of knowledge of the policy even if it may not have been consistently followed in practice. We did not assess awareness of the Cal/OSHA ATD standard; thus it is not possible to determine whether or not having an applicable new state regulation was a key factor in promoting the implementation of these policies in California. In contrast, a survey of medical students and residents at a Washington, DC, hospital (November-December 2009) showed that only 13% of medical students and 21% of residents would wear an N95 respirator when caring for a patient with influenza symptoms. 15 Another study conducted at a New York City hospital identified 277 unprotected health care worker exposures related to 44 patients with pH1N1 infection (May-July 2009), explained by suboptimal adherence to PPE recommendations in addition to other factors. 16 In general, the basic elements required with respirator use (eg, medical clearance, fit testing, and employee training) were in place in all hospitals, as demonstrated by consistent responses across health care workers, unit managers, and hospital managers. Because onsite evaluation visits were conducted in January-February 2010, we are unable to report on the extent of N95 respirator readiness in these facilities at the start of the pandemic. Jaeger et al 14 found that 52% of health care workers exposed to the earliest California patients with pH1N1 infections after admission to the hospital were ""N95 ready,"" defined as having been fit tested within the past year and knowing the appropriate size and location of N95 respirators. Data collected from 22 states on 48 health care workers with clinical care duties who had been infected with pH1N1 showed that 69% had ever been fit tested, another assessment of respirator readiness. 17 A National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health survey of internal medicine residents and fellows at 4 Utah hospitals conducted August-September 2009 showed a lower level of training on N95 respirator use (43%) and lower level of fit testing (22% between the beginning of their training and June 2009) than found among this California health care worker sample. 18 Interviewed health care workers overwhelmingly (94%) believed that N95 respirators would be more effective than surgical/medical masks at protecting them from pH1N1 infection. Given that clearly understanding the differences in protection and appropriate use between respirators versus surgical/facemasks had been cited as a potential challenge for the health care field in pandemic influenza preparedness, 2 our results may reflect progress made in this area. In contrast, 24% of respondents in the Utah study believed that surgical masks and N95 respirators provided equal protection. 18 The heightened awareness among California health care workers about the role of respiratory protection against pH1N1 may have been due to publicity regarding the new ATD standard, and/or employer or union-based educational efforts. Thirty-five percent of health care workers reported experiencing no problems while wearing respirators, and of those who did experience problems, feeling uncomfortably warm was the most frequent issue mentioned (49%), followed by interference with eyeglasses (21%).",34.77887403252351,13.654874575624065

Risk analysis of inner output cases was implemented by software OpenGeoDa, and local spatial autocorrelation and risk levels were explored respectively according to typical attributes (gender/age/occupation) corresponding to significant global spatial autocorrelation. From Moran scatterplot of inner output cases in various districts of Beijing ( Figure  9 (a)) and distribution of risk types (Figure 9 (b)), high-risk regions of inner output cases were concentrated primarily in urban centers including Haidian, Chaoyang, Dongcheng, Xicheng and Fengtai districts, secondary high-risk regions were located in such urban areas as Chongwen, Xuanwu, Shijingshan districts as well as Changping in the northwest, and relatively safe region with low-risk was Miyun in the suburb northeast whereas other regions had no significant local spatial autocorrelation due to too small number of cases. The primary and secondary high-risk regions were located in the city center and formed a significant cluster, and only few suburbs in the northwest suffered from the virus high-risk spread while the northeast suburbs were low-risk and relatively safe. Above results showed that the overall prevention and control measures were remarkably effective.

New technologies such as electronic health and mobile health have shown to be effective in this respect, for instance, in maintaining adherence to antiretroviral therapy, 133 but also in maintaining a healthy diet 147 and diabetes prevention, 148 as shown in randomised clinical trials in Latin America and India, respectively. New technologies might also alleviate the burden on health services by simplifying diabetes diagnosis, these developments are underway for infectious diseases for example, through smartphone applications that replace laboratory-quality immunoassays, 131 through innovative mosquito traps and digital images that can replace skilled entomologists in monitoring the spread of malariacarrying mosquitoes, 132 or with depot medication that simplifies chronic treatment, such as is being developed for HIV treatment. 134 As far as we are aware, there are no nascent technologies for diabetes diagnosis or monitoring. Finally, practical solutions should be implemented to diminish the increasing burden of diabetes on health services. Solutions include shifting care of diabetes from senior health-care workers towards nurses, 135, 136 involvement of community health-care workers, 149 and introduction of peer support for patients with diabetes in low-resource settings, 137,138 all of which have been shown to be effective in the management of diabetes or cardiovascular risk.

High patient volume in acute care limits the ability to place patients suspected of requiring single rooms in these until a diagnosis is confirmed. This creates a potential reservoir of infection for both patients and healthcare workers alike. It has also been shown that health care workers can be reluctant to implement transmission based precautions until a diagnosis is confirmed due to perceived and real imposts on time and resources, plus administrative patient flow pressure. Human factors may lead to a situation where the healthcare workers are cognitively overloaded and as their regular practice may be less than 100%, small breaches can occur that they themselves do not identify as breaches. The 'To Err is Human' report in 2000 identified the gap between what is recommended practice and actual practice [9] . Consistently this gap is identified in the application of transmission based precautions as well as other infection prevention strategies potentially leading to health care acquired infections in patients and health care workers [10] . The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Dr Tom Frieden was recently quoted as saying ''There are 75,000 deaths each year from infections spread in hospitals in the U.S. We know no matter how good our recommendations for hand washing and personal protective equipment are, we have to have a large margin of safety for how they will actually be implemented in the field'' [11] suggesting that the CDC acknowledges that clinicians are not always going to follow IPC guidelines, and this is largely unintentional. Yet, accepting standards that put patients, staff and visitors at risk goes against legal and ethical responsibilities of health care staff. This reinforces the need for practices to be second nature for health care workers to ensure that as the potential for harm increases small errors do not have fatal consequences. The practice of infection prevention and control is not an optional extra for clinical practice and patient management, it is essential to both patient and healthcare worker safety. The ability to recognise infectious conditions and implement the appropriate TBP at all times and not only at times of heightened awareness is therefore particularly relevant in the ED context.",34.557193537390816,12.294178029341305

Multivariate analyses suggest that emergency department staff had 12.3 greater odds of wanting a new respirator (P 5 .031) as compared with their referent group. Males were more likely to indicate that the N95 respirator was comfortable to wear versus females (P 5 .003). Conclusion: To increase substantially the acceptance of respiratory protective equipment and improve compliance rates, respirators should be modified to meet the specific needs of health care workers.",36.76906598429116,13.931037035456113

Nurses and other health care providers have a moral and professional obligation to care for patients even in the face of difficult circumstances and some risk to themselves, but this obligation is not absolute.

The use of gloves, gowns, goggles, and caps was significantly associated with a reduced risk for acquiring SARS, but the high degree of collinearity in the use of these precautions made it difficult to ascertain which measure was most important.

To date there has been no published literature on the prevalence of psychiatric disorders among health care workers in Singapore. However, a survey carried out by the authors in June 2002 in this same hospital showed a similar prevalence of between 28 and 35% for psychiatric disorders among doctors and nurses using the 28-item GHQ (unpublished data). From this survey, although it was perceived that the SARS situation had greatly impacted on the emotional state of health care workers, there was no significant change in the prevalence of psychiatric disorders among health care workers (35% of doctors and 25% of nurses) in this hospital who responded. However, doctors were more likely than nurses to suffer from a psychiatric disorder and health care workers who were single were at higher risk. Interestingly, there was no significant difference between those who were or were not exposed to SARS patients and those working in high-risk areas or those in the general wards. Although this result was rather unexpected, it could be explained. In Singapore all suspect or probable cases of SARS are transferred immediately upon diagnosis to the SARS-designated hospital. The hospital in this study was not the SARSdesignated hospital and only a small number of SARS patients were identified here. Perhaps this limited contact with SARS patients in the study hospital may have resulted in this unexpected outcome. Whatever the reason, the SARS situation did affect health care workers, regardless of exposure to SARS patients or work areas.

Reasonable efforts should be made to mitigate this additional risk through the provision of appropriate personal protective equipment, while recognizing that it will not be possible to prevent all transmissions to health care workers.

Over the past 15 years, pandemic planning has evolved with the adoption of a whole-of-society approach to disaster risk reduction. There is recognition of the social gradient of risk, which emerges from the interaction between social determinants of health, risk of exposure, and adverse impacts from a pandemic. Additionally, there is better understanding of the benefits of planning according to functional needs, rather than deficit-oriented labelling. In this paper, we reflect on how the framing of vulnerable or high-risk populations has evolved since SARS. Looking to the future, we present the imperative for the creation of institutional space for engagement of high-risk populations in pandemic planning processes, including participatory governance. Innovative consultation strategies are needed to enhance collective asset literacy and ensure planning is adaptive to the changing social fabric.

In 2004, the creation of the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) was an important investment and commitment to public health at the federal level. Following SARS, avian influenza virus (H5N1) provoked tremendous concern in 2006 given its high human mortality rate and disproportionate impacts for health care workers (PHAC 2015) . By 2006, pandemic planning was in full swing and a revised Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan for the Health Care Sector (CPIP) was published. CPIP was created as a guidance document to inform and support the health care sector in the management of pandemics (PHAC 2015) . It outlines the roles, responsibilities and strategies to be used by the federal government to mitigate, prepare for, and respond to large-scale outbreaks of influenza. In 2009, a psychosocial annex was developed to supplement the plan (PHAC 2009). Acknowledgement of occupational risks to health care workers and risks to socially vulnerable groups in society was an important advancement in pandemic planning at that time. Resilience of the broader community is dependent on health care workers and responders being able (and willing) to work during an outbreak; without them health and social systems would collapse and put other people at further risk of adverse outcomes (O'Sullivan et al. 2007) .",41.35008301511627,15.227512641363614

It was expected that those who had been exposed to SARS patients would be more traumatized, but interestingly there was no significant difference between the two groups. This implied that the SARS situation was perceived by all to be an equally traumatic experience regardless of exposure experience to SARS patients. Many health care workers in Singapore had friends and/or family who were also health care workers. Forty-two per cent of those diagnosed to be infected by SARS were health care workers and five of them eventually died. Maunder et al. [6] highlighted the emotional effects on health care workers whenever other health care workers were admitted with an unclear infection and the strong emotional identification with these colleagues who later became patients.

However, much is not understood about the behavior of these aerosols and the risks they pose. We used a coughing patient simulator and a breathing worker simulator to investigate the exposure of health care workers to cough aerosol droplets, and to examine the efficacy of face shields in reducing this exposure. Our results showed that 0.9% of the initial burst of aerosol from a cough can be inhaled by a worker 46 cm (18 inches) from the patient. During testing of an influenza-laden cough aerosol with a volume median diameter (VMD) of 8.5 μm, wearing a face shield reduced the inhalational exposure of the worker by 96% in the period immediately after a cough. The face shield also reduced the surface contamination of a respirator by 97%. When a smaller cough aerosol was used (VMD = 3.4 μm), the face shield was less effective, blocking only 68% of the cough and 76% of the surface contamination. In the period from 1 to 30 minutes after a cough, during which the aerosol had dispersed throughout the room and larger particles had settled, the face shield reduced aerosol inhalation by only 23%. Increasing the distance between the patient and worker to 183 cm (72 inches) reduced the exposure to influenza that occurred immediately after a cough by 92%. Our results show that health care workers can inhale infectious airborne particles while treating a coughing patient. Face shields can substantially reduce the short-term exposure of health care workers to large infectious aerosol particles, but smaller particles can remain airborne longer and flow around the face shield more easily to be inhaled. Thus, face shields provide a useful adjunct to respiratory protection for workers caring for patients with respiratory infections.

Our observation is consistent with previous studies that have been unable to show that N95 masks were superior to surgical masks for preventing influenza infection in health care workers (5) .

Competencies for hospital-based health care workers related to infection prevention have been developed 54 but do not currently exist for other worker groups. These competencies should be used for education development for hospital-based health care workers and may serve as a starting point for creating training for other worker groups. Competency domains for hospital-based health care workers include basic microbiology, modes/mechanisms of infection transmission, standard and transmission-based precautions, occupational health, patient safety, critical thinking, and emergency preparedness. 54 Within the emergency preparedness domain, additional education topics have been identified. Education topics that IPs need to cover when developing training materials for staff, patients, and visitors are outlined in Table 4 . Examples of such topics include how and when to perform hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette, isolation precautions, PPE use, safely reuse respiratory protection, and screening procedures. Most of these topics are applicable for routine practice; differences between day-to-day activities and disaster situations need to be incorporated into the training. For instance, routine PPE use and procedures for safely reusing respiratory protection when resources are insufficient or depleted because of a disaster need to be included in staff education. 16 In addition, educational material needs to be targeted to each group. Previous research indicates that there are disciplinespecific competencies related to infection prevention. 54 IPs should take these differences into account when education is created for various groups of individuals. During response to a mass casualty incident, all responding staff will require some level of training that is specific to the event. Whenever possible, IPs should have ''just in time'' training materials on hand to distribute during disaster response. 6 ",28.60000953554139,14.388107380446382

The hands of health care workers (HCWs) are the primary mode of transmission of multidrug-resistant pathogens and infections to patients. 3 Proper hand hygiene is the single most important, simplest, and least expensive means of preventing health careassociated infections and the spread of antimicrobial resistance. Nevertheless, in most health care institutions, adherence to recommended hand-washing practices remains unacceptably low, rarely exceeding 40% of situations in which hand hygiene is indicated. 4 Why do HCWs consistently fail to perform this simple and inexpensive procedure, thereby compromising patient safety and the quality Health care-associated infections constitute one of the greatest challenges of modern medicine. Despite compelling evidence that proper hand washing can reduce the transmission of pathogens to patients and the spread of antimicrobial resistance, the adherence of health care workers to recommended hand-hygiene practices has remained unacceptably low. One of the key elements in improving hand-hygiene practice is the use of an alcoholbased hand rub instead of washing with soap and water. An alcohol-based hand rub requires less time, is microbiologically more effective, and is less irritating to skin than traditional hand washing with soap and water. Therefore, alcohol-based hand rubs should replace hand washing as the standard for hand hygiene in health care settings in all situations in which the hands are not visibly soiled. It is also important to change gloves between each patient contact and to use hand-hygiene procedures after glove removal. Reducing health care-associated infections requires that health care workers take responsibility for ensuring that hand hygiene becomes an everyday part of patient care.",31.030076329323805,12.482248203500712

In addition to maintaining contact, droplet, and standard precautions among the health-care workers when providing routine care to patients infected with H5N1 influenza, the World Health Organization recommends airborne precautions in health-care facilities including placing patients with suspected and confirmed H5N1 influenza in isolation rooms with at least 12 air exchanges per hour (if available) during aerosol-generating procedures due to the high lethality of the disease and the uncertainty about the mode of human-to-human transmission. 36 While other investigators have examined the filtration capacity of different surgical and N95 masks in protecting health-care workers from viral infection, [37] [38] [39] further studies are needed to examine the dispersion of exhaled air from common respiratory therapy devices in relation to the air exchange rate and airflow patterns on the medical ward in the control of airborne viral infections.",34.23969649446274,12.451671852273671

The CDC described the new standard approach to manage patients with febrile respiratory illness as ""respiratory hygiene"" or ""cough etiquette"". 54 Patients with cough and fever should be encouraged to report symptoms at admission and should be encouraged or asked to wear a surgical mask and wash their hands after contact with respiratory secretions. These patients should be separated from other patients in the waiting area, and should be examined and assessed as soon as possible by the emergency staff in a single room. 54 Signs should be displayed in the waiting areas to promote these measures and to educate patients and health-care workers, and emergency staff should comply with droplet precautions.",32.87205568696872,12.07377129083907

High risk is not the same as HTR, although there appears to be substantial overlap; whereas not all at high risk are hard-to-reach, many in the HTR population are at high risk. While no uniform definition of HTR populations exists, HTR populations have typically been defined from the perspective of linkage with the health care system, i.e., persons who do not seek treatment in traditional care settings such as provider offices or clinics. The size of hard-to-reach populations, whereas hard to estimate, is not trivial; some examples of constituent groups are as follows: 11.5-12 million undocumented immigrants nationwide, 18 1.5 million injection drug users in 96 large U.S. metropolitan areas 19 and 744,000 homeless persons nationwide, 20 as well as a proportion of the elderly and minorities. Overall, the percentage of U.S. residents at high risk for influenza but who are not immunized has been estimated to be as high as 65%. 3 Failure to be immunized is related to lack of health insurance and to having a regular provider; 21 this may be a particular concern for specific HTR groups. For example, mobile elderly differ from the majority of the other population groups in that they are covered by Medicare and generally frequent a health care provider. Thus, whereas the elderly as a high-risk group may differ from other groups in terms of access to health care as an entitlement, a proportion is not connected to care and is therefore HTR. The lack of a regular health care provider is correlated with race and ethnicity. 7 While 80% of White adults have a primary care provider, the percentage is closer to 70% for Asian-Americans and Blacks, and only 57% for Hispanics. 22 As reviewed elsewhere, other barriers to accessing care include culturally derived attitudes and belief systems, negative experiences with past treatment, language and other barriers in patient-provider relationships, and legal status (e.g., undocumented immigrants). [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] Some groups harbor substantial myths about and distrust of the medical system; previous research has shown that their attitudes appear to be strong predictors of being immunized. 28 VLAHOV ET AL. 616",48.95812249497053,19.11389248778837

Principles of familycentered care also include liberal NICU visitation for relatives, siblings, and family friends and the involvement of parents in the development of nursery policies and programs that promote parenting skills [238] . The benefits of family-centered care can be undermined by an increased risk of infection for the neonatal patient. Mothers can transmit infections to neonates postpartum, although separation of mother and newborn rarely is indicated. To ensure the risk of postpartum transmission is minimal, all mothers should wash their hands before handing their infants. For mothers with postpartum fever, care should be taken to ensure that the infant does not come into contact with contaminated dressings, linen, clothing, or pads [234] .",34.320465954697745,13.71551603614769

Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen that can persist in relatively harsh environments, frequently has been associated with HAIs and outbreaks in NICUs. Nosocomial P. aeruginosa infections vary in their clinical presentation, but the most common manifestations are respiratory; ear, nose, or throat; and bloodstream infections [18] . P. aeruginosa infections, particularly bloodstream infections, have been associated with a very high mortality rate [80] . Risk factors for infection include feeding intolerance, prolonged parenteral alimentation, and long-term intravenous antimicrobial therapy [80] .

In a Korean study, 64 591 healthcare workers who cared for patients with MERS using proper personal protective equipment were screened for MERS-CoV after finishing the patient care.

A followup study 65 of a nurse with an asymptomatic MERS-CoV infection in South Korea showed that she did not transmit the infection to the 82 people they had been in contact with, whereas another study 46 speculated that a family cluster of MERS-CoV infections in Saudi Arabia was probably related to exposure to an unrecognised individual with asymptomatic or subclinically mild MERS-CoV in a hospital setting. Four generations of transmission among health-care workers in hospital, shared housing, and home environments were observed in Saudi Arabia after investigation of an outbreak of MERS-CoV caused by an index patient (a nurse with MERS-CoV and pulmonary tuberculosis) who had contact with 73 people.

In the event of even a single smallpox case or a credible imminent threat, the benefits of smallpox vaccination would become clearer. Performing a rigorous scientific analysis of the risks and benefits for smallpox vaccination is impossible, because the true risk of a smallpox attack is unknown. The probability that any individual physician would be among those to see the first few cases of a smallpox outbreak is extremely low. Because smallpox vaccine can provide protection up to several days after exposure, a strategy to ensure timely vaccination of exposed health care workers and the general public if a smallpox case is identified would avoid the risk for unnecessary adverse reactions to smallpox vaccine while smallpox does not exist.

They reported that 5.0% of COVID-19 infected patients had nausea or vomiting and 3.8% had diarrhea. 21 30 A recent meta-analysis of 4243 patients from China suggested that approximately 17.6% of patients had any gastrointestinal symptom, including 9.2% with pain, 12.5% with diarrhea, 10.2% with nausea/vomiting. 31 One of the concerns with many of the published studies is the possible duplicate inclusion of the patients across reports, thereby limiting valid performance of pooled estimates in a meta-analysis. 32 There is evidence for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool specimens independent of the presence of diarrhea. Some studies showed that stool continued to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA even after respiratory samples became negative. Chen et al reported a case of COVID-19 based on compatible symptoms and lung imaging in a patient with positive stool real-time RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 RNA but negative pharyngeal swabs and sputum samples. Furthermore, Wang et al reported confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 positive fecal samples in 2 patients without diarrhea. 12, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 What are the liver manifestations of COVID-19? Liver injury is estimated to occur in up to 20-30% of patients at the time of diagnosis with SARS-CoV-2 infection. 14 Severe hepatitis has been reported but liver failure appears to be rare. 39 The pattern of liver injury appears to be predominantly hepatocellular, and the etiology remains uncertain but may represent a secondary effect of the systemic inflammatory response observed with COVID-19 disease, although direct viral infection and drug-induced liver injury cannot be excluded. One study of liver biopsy specimens obtained from a patient with COVID-19 disease revealed microvesicular steatosis and mild lobular and portal activity, suggestive of either SARS-CoV-2 infection or drug-induced liver injury. 41 Abnormal liver enzymes may be observed in both adults and children with COVID-19, 42 and do not appear to be a major predictor of clinical outcomes. 15 Early studies have multiple methodologic limitations, with variable laboratory thresholds, limited longitudinal assessment of liver enzymes, heterogeneous evaluation for alternative etiologies, and limited information regarding baseline liver diseases and confounding variables. Additional studies are needed to further characterize the unique clinical considerations for SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with chronic liver disease and/or cirrhosis, 43 although preliminary guidance has been provided by the AASLD on March 23, 2020. 44 What are the potential risks to health care workers performing endoscopy? SARS-CoV-2 is presumed to spread primarily via respiratory droplets from talking, coughing, sneezing, and close contact with symptomatic individuals. However humanto-human transmission can occur from unknown infected persons (e.g. asymptomatic carriers or individuals with mild symptoms) as well as individuals with virus shedding during the pre-incubation period before symptoms develop. 45 Data related to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the early phase of the pandemic have confirmed that health care professionals are at higher risk of infection than the general population. The WHO and Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) reported infection of 2055 health care workers as of February 20, 2020 during the index outbreak in Hubei Province, with health care workers facing a rate of infection approximately three times the general population. 46 This prompted the Chinese Department of Health Reform to deploy more than 40,000 additional health-care workers to the region, preserve personal protective equipment (PPE), and implement surveillance measures and quarantine protocols. 46 Such measures appear to have slowed the spread to health care workers, with recent cases primarily attributable to household contacts rather than occupational exposure. Similar trends have been observed in Europe, with an estimated 20% of COVID-19 infections in Italy occurring in health care workers. 47 Preliminary reports in the US also suggest that health care workers are at risk of nosocomial infections, including infection of 20 health care workers among the first 67 COVID-19 positive individuals in Philadelphia, and additional health care workers cases in WA, NY, and MA. 48, 49, 50 The spread of disease via health care workers is concerning for several reasons: a) appropriate PPE may not be utilized effectively, especially when COVID-19 patients cannot be identified quickly, b) shortage of health care workers due to infection and/or quarantine, and c) the concern of the role of infected health care workers to act as a vector for transmission to patients.",36.9912107957683,14.82316842184948

Second, a systematic review from Tran et al revealed an increased risk of viral transmission in health care workers performing aerosol-generating procedures (mostly bronchoscopy or tracheal intubation). 59 (Supplemental Figure 3 ). Zamora and colleagues investigated the amount of contamination on the neck and face from individuals using a PAPR mask (in combination with N95) compared with a N95 mask alone 60 ; Individuals who used the PAPR-based strategy experienced a lower risk of face and neck contamination compared to N95 mask alone (RR = 0.08; 95% CI: 0.03-0.19).

Secondary goals are to reduce requirements for fluid and electrolyte replacement and prevent severe disease in health care workers and other contacts who become infected. Treating all patients consecutively would be the most straightforward approach, and results could be compared with those seen in historical controls. Clinical oncologists often use the same approach when they evaluate new treatments, and it can be highly efficient. For example, if the goal is to achieve a statistically significant (95% confidence interval) reduction in case fatality rates from 50% to 25%, only 52 patients would have to be treated. One problem with this method is uncertainty about mortality rates in historical controls in settings where better supportive care has already improved survival.

Somewhat higher acceptance levels of pandemic vaccine have been reported among health care workers in France (36.5%),16 UK hospitals (63.4%),17 and frontline healthcare workers in Shropshire County's general practices (83.9%),18 but lower as shown in another local study conducted among nurses in Hong Kong (13.3%).19 The relatively low acceptance rate in Hong Kong could be related to the high proportion (83.5%) of respondents perceiving that the viral strain may be different in the coming season, which makes the additional vaccine relatively redundant and not cost-effective. Several studies have reported that safety concerns about a new vaccine20 and the difficulty to reconcile conflicting evidence about the vaccine21–23 as important barriers. Turning to the factors associated with the intention to accept the additional vaccine, the Health Belief Model (HBM) could explain the relationship between vaccine acceptability and perceived risk of contracting influenza as well as perceived severity of influenza.24 Since the efficacy, safety profile, and cost-benefit of the additional vaccine has not been fully evaluated, recommendations to encourage healthcare workers to take the vaccine will need to be further consolidated. We found that primary care physicians had a significantly higher acceptance rate than physicians of other specialties, and thus could play a key role in mobilizing colleagues working in other specialties. Our results indicate that one could invest more resources to improve acceptance among healthcare workers as the majority of them believe that influenza vaccine saves lives (86.7%) and reduces medical expenses (76.3%). This study highlighted that 80% to 90% of healthcare workers supported vaccination for high-risk patients, in contrast to low level of personal acceptance even when perceived risk of infection and severity of impact were high. This study pointed out that such discordance that may be a reasonable target for further strategies to improving vaccination campaign acceptability. Protecting healthcare workers may be an important measure to prevent in-hospital spread of infection in the face of influenza outbreak. Therefore, improving vaccine acceptance among high-risk healthcare professionals should be a priority in enhancing update of vaccination program.",28.81465935245421,10.41546328502241

With these improvements, the safety of the influenza vaccine has been confirmed, domestic vaccine production has been successfully established, and high vaccination rates have been achieved among infants aged 6 months to <12 months and elderly adults aged ≥65 years. However, the main problems that are unique to the influenza virus and vaccine, such as vaccine mismatching and low vaccine effectiveness in elderly adults and children, remain. Support/funding for influenza risk groups other than infants (6–59 months) and elderly populations is also lacking, and a considerable influenza disease burden remains in Korea [2728]. As the target influenza vaccination rate among elderly adults has been achieved, the next step is to conduct further research to evaluate the most cost-effective type of vaccine (e.g., quadrivalent, adjuvanted, or high dose). The NIP for influenza has been operating for 20 years, with the primary objective of reducing the disease burden in high-risk groups. However, for high-risk groups, other than elderly adults and children aged ≤59 months, there has been very little control of immunization, resulting in a blind spot.

The WHO has issued interim guidance for the management of suspected and confirmed MERS-CoV infection (13). Early supportive management includes supplemental oxygen to all patients with signs of hypoxemia or respiratory distress, conservative fluid management, early endotracheal intubation in patients with laboured breathing or persistent hypoxemia, and a lung-protective ventilation strategy (13). Other adjunctive hypoxemic rescue therapies, such as early prone positioning and neuromuscular blockade, may be considered in patients with moderate-to-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (14). In addition, systematic corticosteroids should generally be avoided unless there is another indication. High-flow oxygen and noninvasive ventilation should be used with caution because of the potential to generate aerosols (15). A systematic review to assess the risk for transmission of respiratory pathogens to health care workers through aerosol-generating procedures found that the following procedures were associated with an increased risk for pathogen transmission: endotracheal intubation, noninvasive ventilation, tracheotomy and manual ventilation (15).",19.247092072396196,8.272341434637756

Unfortunately, data on health care capacity is rel atively scarce and we have to rely on data from 2017,2018 or even older. Data availability is even worse for critical care beds, on which we rely on multicountry data from 2010. Remuzzi & Remuzzi report ICU capacity of 5200 beds for Italy as a whole, which is lower than the 7550 critical care beds reported by Rhodes et al. [1, 5] . It is likely that other EU countries have downsized their critical bed capacity too. In terms of curative beds per 100 000 population as reported by Eurostat, for most countries (all except Ireland, Bulgaria, Poland and Romania), we observed a downward trend in the past 10 years. Moreover, hospital capacity strain was recently found to be associated with increased mortality and decreased health outcomes [10] . Note that if we would assume the same extent of downsizing in Italy and other EU countries, our relative comparisons would not change. Note that we compare these countries by their base capacity, while clearly many countries have expanded their base capacity to differing degrees (eg, additional beds, mobilizing volunteers or retired Physicians x critical care beds (Physicians + nurses) x critical care beds health care workers). We therefore will track at which relative pressure individual countries can no langer handle the volume of critical patients and which pressure on their base capacity they experience at the peak. Note also that we do not account for health care workers' incapacitation from COVID-19 or other causes as the epidemic unfolds. Our analysis shows that many European countries are soon to be confronted with a health care pressure that will exceed current healthcare capacity. Based on the intensity-approach and the composite measures, we believe that the healthcare pressure in Spain is already at very high levels. For The Netherlands and France the pressure on healthcare systems will soon reach Italy's levels. Where this is not yet done, policymakers should urgently expand their health care capacities to avoid pressure as experienced in Italy. Our analysis informs policy makers on how far their country is removed from an overloaded healthcare system. As such, this information can be useful to plan ahead in order to relieve pressure on their national healthcare system. Moreover, the evolving healthcare pressure, especially the pressure experienced by each country at the peak, will be useful to plan future outbreaks and a timely expansion of health care capacity.",30.14690471069372,12.404373909351474

However, a major limitation is that the models presented here use data on physical infrastructure but do not account for staffing or ventilator supplies. Healthcare workers, especially those involved in critical care, are at high risk for COVID-19 infection and thus there may be staffing shortages that reduce the utility of the critical care beds that could be gained under surge responses. There have already been reports of hospitals being unable to accept patients, not because of lack of beds but due to lack of staff to cover those beds. Some states, like New York, are currently recruiting retired healthcare workers to assist with staffing shortfalls, an approach that might be generally applicable in alleviating shortfalls during the current epidemic. These retirees are, however, generally older and can be particularly vulnerable to poor outcomes from COVID-19. Our models also cannot account for the innovation, ingenuity and perseverance of medical staff, many of whom are trained to work in crisis situations. It is likely that medical staff will find solutions that are unanticipated by our models, that can subsequently be included as they become known and more widely applied across healthcare systems. Future analyses should also incorporate counts of ventilators in addition to critical care beds. Our models also did not account for heterogeneities arising from specific high-risk communities in different localities. For instance, places with large elderly populations or high levels of pre-existing respiratory, cardiovascular, or immunocompromised conditions would have even higher mortality rates. Future analyses could also account for underlying population risk factors such as these.",27.150095549096328,11.27739314477084

That is, in successive parts of the country (say provinces or municipal health services catchment areas) all stringent interventions are released, such that the epidemic can rage locally, while maintaining strict control in the remaining parts that wait for their turn. At the same time, Covid-19-related IC admissions should be distributed over the whole country such that the national health care system is not overburdened. After the lift of control in their area, its inhabitants can resume their normal daily activities as before Covid-19. Importantly, individuals most vulnerable to the virus need to be shielded until their area has achieved herd immunity. A further requirement is that their care providers (professionals or possibly family members) are absolutely free of the virus or immune. Obviously, this strategy will require a lot of ambulance transport of severe cases, but this should be feasible in small countries with good infrastructure, such as the Netherlands. Larger countries can consider implementing the strategy in specific geographic regions.

The 40 primary driver for the repeated evolution of division of labour is that it allows cells or group 41 members to specialize on few tasks, thus increase in efficiency and allowing for anatomic or 42 physiological adaptations [2] [3] [4] [5] . 43 The mechanistic underpinnings regulating specialization are complex and intensively 44 investigated on different levels of biological organisation. A highly developed example of 45 division of labour is found in the societies of ants, bees, wasps and termites. In these colonies 46 of social insects, reproduction is monopolized by a single or very few individuals, the queens 47 (and kings in termites), whereas the majority of the colony membersthe workers -remain 48 functionally sterile. All other colony chores are distributed among the workers, which specialize 49 on specific tasks such as brood care, nest defence and foraging [3] . 50 Whether a worker stays inside the nest and cares for the brood or leaves the nest and 51 forages is strongly influenced by age and physiology with brood carers being younger [3], more 52 corpulent [6-14] and more fertile [15, 16] than foragers. Due to high external mortality outside 53 the nest [17], this age-and physiology-based non-reproductive division of labour is beneficial, 54 because it ensures that young workers with longest residual life span, the largest amount of 55 stored resources and the highest reproductive potential stay inside the safety of the nest. 56 Although age and physiology are important regulators of worker task choice in many 57 social insects, few common mechanisms linking age and physiology to behaviour have been 58 found. For example, the switch from brood care to foraging is at least partly regulated by an 59 interaction between age and stable lipid loss [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] 18, 19] .

Furthermore, countries with residual circulating virus would have to be completely isolated to avoid reintroduction. Still, prolonged intensive control could be a means to gain time until the development and large-scale availability of a vaccine. However, the amount of time this will take is unpredictable. An alternative approach is to develop herd immunity through natural infection while keeping the number of cases within the limits of the health care system. Until recently, the UK has advocated this approach, 4 but it was heavily criticized for obvious reasons: it will be practically impossible to perfectly tune actual interventions without exceeding or undershooting health care capacity.
