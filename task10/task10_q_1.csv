Introduction This Six Sigma project was initiated to evaluate and improve the transfer of care of patients from the OR to the ICU. Medical errors are responsible for billions of dollars in increased healthcare spending. Miscommunication among healthcare providers is a major contributor to these errors, with handoff s a particularly vulnerable period in the care process. At our institution, surgical patients with scheduled admissions to the ICU are fi rst recovered in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU). With this process, multiple, unstructured, and individual handoff s occur in parallel between providers, which may lead to communication errors, diff erential information sharing, content variability, care delays, and ineffi ciency. Methods A multidisciplinary QI project was initiated with input from the ICU, anesthesia and surgical services. A series of PDSA cycles were conducted, which began by defi ning the current process via direct observation and value stream mapping of orthopedic and neurosurgical patients. A new process was then introduced, including direct transfer of the patient to the ICU and a single, structured, bedside report between all care providers. A standardized handoff tool was implemented. We used process times, wait times and information content as process measures and handoff errors as outcome measures. A 10-point satisfaction score was also measured. Results Following implementation of the new transfer process, the average wait time decreased by 58 minutes, process time decreased by 9 minutes, and lead time decreased by 66.5 minutes. The handoff error rate decreased by 1.3 errors/patient and fi rst-time quality rate increased by 67%. Staff satisfaction improved from 48% to 73%. By elimination of the PACU stay, the costs involved in admission to the PACU were deferred. Conclusion A single, multidisciplinary bedside handoff process between the OR and ICU leads to cost and time savings. By elimination of redundant, nonvalue-added processes, less opportunity for medical errors occurred, with substantial improvements in fi rst-time quality. Such a process can be successfully attained while aff ecting staff satisfaction positively.",14.780096267306625,7.539178505664404

This data repository, set up with financial support from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as a first attempt to share 'sensitive' data from affected countries, but was accessible only to those who were also providing H5N1 sequence data. This limitedaccess approach restricted wider sharing of data prior to publication, which was vital for broader understanding of the progress of the emergent public and animal health threat. The need for greater transparency in data sharing and for acknowledgement of those contributing samples from H5N1-infected patients and animals and related genetic sequence data was not satisfied by sharing data after formal publication via public-domain databases. Scientists charged with the day to day responsibilities of running WHO Collaborating Centres (CCs) for Influenza, National Influenza Centres and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE)/ Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) [8] reference laboratories, were therefore eager to play a key role and provide scientific oversight in the creation and development of GISAID's data sharing platform that soon became essential for our work.",12.1467557916518,5.199955895351031

Accordingly, we decided to develop a formal ontology. Over the years, the term ""ontology"" has been defined and utilized in many ways by the knowledge engineering community [4] . We will adopt the definition of ""ontology"" as ""the explicit formal specifications of the terms in a domain and the relationships among them"" [5] .

This division often results in DVOs being one step removed from livestock keepers and reliant on PAHSPs for information on any disease outbreak events. There can be significant barriers to this information flow, particularly when relationships between DVOs and PAHSPs are strained by service provision disputes (often relating to poorly applied legislative frameworks), the lack of sanitary mandates and limited recognition and support for frontline personnel by the higher public sector authorities.

First, the use of facemasks among health care providers on different social occasions and in media appearances was crucial for the construction of this new social norm and for normalizing the use of facemasks, because of their social power. Health care professionals, as a social institution, allowed them to exercise social control with respect to facemask use in the community, which motivated the participants to use a facemask during the SARS outbreak. Second, the participants used facemasks as a form of symbolic support for health care providers. Because facemasks were perceived as a tool for infection prevention, using a facemask did not simply prevent the participants from becoming infected, but by so doing, it also implied a show of support for health care providers in an attempt to reduce their workload and the burden on the health care system. Using a facemask was akin to a symbolic declaration that they were committed to reducing the burden on the health care system by preventing themselves from becoming infected.

(5, 6) . The GDD Operations Center has a team of six staff and a Director with professionally diverse backgrounds, e.g., human and veterinary medicine, microbiology, and epidemiology, and is situated within dedicated space located within CDC's Emergency Operations Center (EOC), with which we liaise both during GDD Operations Center supported international deployments of CDC teams and also when the EOC is activated to respond to an international disease event. Both official information sources, e.g., ministries of health or agriculture and WHO, as well as unofficial and unverified reports from media sources are reviewed. The latter are verified through a global network of public health professionals. Information sharing is built on trust and an understanding of how to appropriately handle information, particularly when it is not in the public domain and disclosure could harm relationships with partners. Information about disease events also comes from CDC subject matter experts in both the United States and those assigned to programs abroad. We also utilize disease-specific sources, which are particularly useful with regard to pathogens that typically are laboratoryconfirmed prior to reporting (e.g., influenza, polio), and although laboratory confirmation may result in delays, such etiology-specific sources typically are rapid in reporting verified cases. We monitor outbreaks from infectious and non-infectious causes including those attributable to disasters, intoxications, and chemical, radiological, or nuclear releases. We also monitor outbreaks of unknown etiology, many of which are later determined to have an infectious cause. Outbreaks among animals may also come under surveillance for known zoonotic diseases and to assess signals that may herald emerging or re-emerging outbreaks of human disease. Regardless of the type of outbreak or public health event, increased awareness of such an occurrence is critical for rapid public health response. Finally, the GDD Operations Center's outbreak response contingency fund provides financial support to CDC programs that makes possible a prompt response to international requests for assistance.",11.816272657494773,6.116479935728868

During the SARS outbreak, health care providers occupied an even more prestigious position, and they were portrayed as social heroes in the battle against SARS [21] . Thus, they held even more power in the construction of this new social norm. They used facemasks in media appearances [22] , and they encouraged the public to use facemasks in the community during the SARS outbreak [23] .

Although vaccine became available in the U.S. in 1995, vaccination was not routinely recommended for children in California until 1999, and across the U.S. in 2006. The incidence of HAV decreased from six cases per 100,000 in 1999 to 0.4 cases per 100,000 in 2011. 1 3 San Diego's public health officer declared a local health emergency on September 1, 2017, due to the ongoing outbreak of HAV. As of October 17, 2017 , the county has identified a total of 507 cases with 19 deaths and 351 (69%) hospitalizations related to the outbreak. 4 Between June and October 2016, Hawaii reported 292 confirmed cases of HAV with 74 patients requiring hospitalization. 5 This outbreak was linked to raw scallops served at a local sushi chain and a subsequent product recall was instated with no new cases reported as of July 11, 2017. 6 A 2016 multistate outbreak of HAV linked to contaminated frozen strawberries resulted in 143 recognized cases and 56 hospitalizations. 7 These HAV outbreaks pose a unique challenge for public health officials for several reasons: the prolonged incubation period (15-50 days) ; infected individuals can transmit the disease up to two weeks prior to symptom onset; many infected persons remain asymptomatic; and many patients affected in these outbreaks are homeless and/or illicit drug users (both injection and non-injection), causing difficulty in contacting and following up infected persons. 3, 4 Emergency Department (ED) providers in affected areas may encounter and treat a large number of these patients. Additionally, if the disease arises in other regions, it is likely that ED providers would be the first point of contact for many symptomatic patients.

Decisions made by patients, health care providers, and public health professionals about seeking and providing health care and about reporting cases to health authorities are all influenced by the information environment, which changes constantly. Biases are therefore imbedded in surveillance systems; these biases need to be characterized to provide better situational awareness for decision-making purposes. Our goal is to develop a statistical framework to characterize influenza surveillance systems, particularly their correlation with the information environment. Methods: We identified Hong Kong influenza surveillance data systems covering healthcare providers, laboratories, daycare centers and residential care homes for the elderly. A Bayesian hierarchical statistical model was developed to examine the statistical relationships between the influenza surveillance data and the information environment represented by alerts from HealthMap and web queries from Google. Different models were fitted for non-pandemic and pandemic periods and model goodness-of-fit was assessed using common model selection procedures. Results: Some surveillance systemsespecially ad hoc systems developed in response to the pandemic flu outbreakare more correlated with the information environment than others. General practitioner (percentage of influenza-like-illness related patient visits among all patient visits) and laboratory (percentage of specimen tested positive) seem to proportionally reflect the actual disease trends and are less representative of the information environment. Surveillance systems using influenza-specific code for reporting tend to reflect biases of both healthcare seekers and providers. Conclusions: This study shows certain influenza surveillance systems are less correlated with the information environment than others, and therefore, might represent more reliable indicators of disease activity in future outbreaks. Although the patterns identified in this study might change in future outbreaks, the potential susceptibility of surveillance data is likely to persist in the future, and should be considered when interpreting surveillance data.",13.843375929991034,7.604259482105443

Host factors are the third aspect that is equally critical and deserves more attention. If the host fails to mount an adequate immune response or refuses to get vaccinated, it is irrelevant no matter how good the influenza vaccine is. Immunosenescence that occurs during aging is believed to be a major host factor responsible for the impaired immune protection of influenza vaccination in older adults, further review of which is beyond the scope of this article. [21] [22] [23] Age-related conditions, such as frailty, as well as sex and gender are other important clinical, biological, and social host factors that have significant impact on influenza vaccine immune response and clinical protection. 15, 24, 25 Emerging evidence suggests that stem cell therapy may enhance immune response to influenza immunization in aging frailty. 26, 27 Innovation and research will help develop strategies to address these and other host factors. Cutting-edge geroscience research may pave the way for the development of such interventional strategies. 28, 29 Government agencies, health-care providers, academic institutions, and the vaccine manufacturing industry are key players in this proposed roadmap. Other entities, including philanthropic foundations, international organizations, and venture capitalists, may also play important roles.

However, once these data have been transformed into meaningful information, it may be immensely valuable to share that information with other countries in the region. Dissemination of this type of information may aid in the interpretation of regional events and helps foster better, lasting public health collaborations.

Objective: To describe and analyse Ebola preparedness activities within the Icelandic healthcare system, and to explore the perspectives and experiences of managers and frontline health workers. Methods: A qualitative case study, based on semi-structured interviews with 21 staff members in the national Ebola Treatment Team, Emergency Room at Landspitali University Hospital, and managers of the response team. Results: Contextual factors such as culture and demography influenced preparedness, and contributed to the positive state of mind of participants, and ingenuity in using available resources for preparedness. While participants believed they were ready to take on the task of Ebola, they also had doubts about the chances of Ebola ever reaching Iceland. Yet, factors such as fear of Ebola and the perceived stigma associated with caring for a potentially infected Ebola patient, influenced the preparation process and resulted in plans for specific precautions by staff to secure the safety of their families. There were also concerns about the teamwork and lack of commitment by some during training. Being a 'tiny' nation was seen as both an asset and a weakness in the preparation process. Honest information sharing and scenario-based training contributed to increased confidence amongst participants in the response plans. Conclusions: Communication and training were important for preparedness of health staff in Iceland, in order to receive, admit, and treat a patient suspected of having Ebola, while doubts prevailed on staff capacity to properly do so. For optimal preparedness, likely scenarios for future global security health threats need to be repeatedly enacted, and areas plagued by poverty and fragile healthcare systems require global support.",11.788011403037128,6.365843065483924

Activities associated with information and communications technology capacity (average 3.6 of 4 different activities in this area), animal-human health interface and community surveillance (average 4.5 of 7 different activities), risk communications (average 1.1 of 2 activities), or laboratory capacity (average 1.6 of 3 different activities) were less common. The fifteen sites implement an average 17.0 of the total 24 activities. The six Cambodian sites reported implementing more activities (average 18.7/24) than the four sites in Thailand (average 16.0/24) or the two sites reporting from Vietnam (average 15.0/24). Respondents commented on the first activities needed to start up an XB site, which XB activities have been most valuable, and lessons they have learned about XB cooperation. Nearly all reported that initial activities included meetings with national or provincial authorities as well as their XB counterparts, orientation and training, and sharing surveillance information with XB partners. Nearly all also reported that the most valuable activities were sharing information, meeting regularly, and conducting joint outbreak investigations with XB counterparts. Most reported positive lessons learned about local cooperation, information sharing and joint problem solving, all based on trust, mutual respect and good relationships with XB counterparts. Respondents also offered advice to future MBDS XB sites or to other countries or networks that may establish similar sites. They recognized the importance of initial local and cross-border orientation, regular meetings with XB counterparts to maintain good relationships, an established agreement at the XB site, and openness and timeliness in sharing surveillance information across borders. Based on their experiences, they recommend expansion of the XB model more broadly across MBDS and feel that it is a worthwhile model for other sub-regional networks to consider.",12.134187827590084,8.919681618143162

Thus, it infers that the effect of knowledge seems to vary according to the context. Therefore, better knowledge management strategies need to be implemented. This critical role of knowledge suggests that the government and other actors should mobilize risk communication during an epidemic to provide appropriate and precise information. In this regard, Yang and Cho [3] reported that risk perception was associated with the information delivered by the media. Therefore, providing accurate information and data to the public will be important in managing future crises. Song et al. [9] suggested that, in the case of a breakout of a novel and highly contagious disease such as MERS, the government must deploy a response system that includes the provision and dissemination of reliable information and inhibits the online diffusion of false information.

However, collection of data by itself has no value unless it is analyzed to bring knowledge and wisdom to improve speed and quality of decisions (30) . Here, the value of sharing, aggregating data, and creating knowledge has been demonstrated with the use of multidisciplinary analytic tools that helped to maintain producer's interest in a voluntary data sharing project. In the absence of a regulatory framework, data sharing is a prerequisite for increasing disease awareness and, ultimately, supporting its control. Lessons learnt from the systematic analysis of the MSHMP relate to the repetitive time and time-space patterns associated with PRRS incidence in the U.S. and the regional variation, and the influence that changes on epidemiological conditions, may have in those patterns. In addition, quantitative evidence was collected on how phylogenetic analysis may support investigations on the most likely mechanisms of spread of the virus, and how collaboration and data sharing may contribute to the control of the disease at the regional level in the absence of a regulatory framework. A negative association between sharing PRRS status and incidence was found. It is unknown if this relationship is because negative farms are more inclined to share the data or if the increase in awareness has an effect on the incidence of the disease. However, in that specific study, the participation of farms, as well as PRRS status sharing, increased in the time frame studied suggesting that farmers and veterinarians may perceive collaboration as an advantage (25) .",11.630252890365757,5.865922466319901

Availability of real time information on virtually all aspects of infections and diseases is required for timely action and response needed to ensure that public health events do not escalate to international concerns with grave consequences.

In the past 10 years there have been important global incidents that emphasise the tension between countries and international organisations when commercial and political interests are perceived to have an undue eff ect on global pandemic preparedness policy. 4, 16 This eff ect is further exacerbated when inequity in access to tech nology, expertise, and the best diagnostic, prophylactic, and treatment methods are prevalent. An example is Indonesia's refusal in 2006-07 to share samples of infl uenza H5N1 isolates with WHO in direct protest to the inequitable sharing of virus samples and vaccine development technology. 43 Lack of trust in WHO's response was evident following the H1N1 pandemic in 2009 too, including from the Council of Europe which highlighted potential confl icts of interest of individual members of the emergency committee convened by WHO to respond to the pandemic-linking them to industry, and noting WHO's policy on keeping the membership of the committee secret. Substantial shortfalls and delay in distribution of vaccine supplies to low-income and middle-income countries were also emphasised by subsequent reviews of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic response. 4, 16, 45 The Indonesian Government's call for more equity and developments since the H1N1 2009 pandemic have led to several positive initiatives. 46 Within WHO's PIP Framework, discussions have evolved to improve virus sharing in the context of recognising the need for shared benefi ts. Indonesia is now one of several low-to-middle income countries that are developing or have already developed in-country vaccine manufacturing capacityothers in the WHO-supported programme of technology transfer include Brazil, China, Egypt, India, Kazakhstan, Mexico, South Korea, Romania, Serbia, South Africa, Thailand, and Vietnam. Initiatives such as the creation of a technology transfer programme at the Netherlands Vaccine Institute (RIVM) to provide training in the embryonated egg production of inactivated infl uenza vaccine are helping to achieve this aim. 47, 48 There are still barriers to eff ective international cooperation and benefi t sharing despite the number of reports emphasising the importance of this key facet of pandemic preparedness. Substantial agreement exists across the public health community about how global collaboration should work, there is greater political acceptance of the value of such collaboration, but there are still barriers arising from commercial and academic drivers. China, with its direct experience of SARS and the economic and political consequences of not being ready to respond, has shown a good example by facing the economic challenges of H7N9. 31 The experience of Saudi Arabia with MERS-CoV highlights other barriers, such as ineff ective international collaboration and partnerships. 44 Despite a declared willingness to collaborate and share, and the publication of substantial epidemiological and microbiological information about early coronavirus cases and outbreaks, there appeared to be delays at times Series in sharing information between public health authorities before it was accepted for peer-reviewed publication, and in sharing clinical and viral samples for public health use without prejudice to subsequent commercial development of products derived from that material. Confl icts of interest that are barriers to trust will probably continue as long as academic and research organisations are judged primarily by their publication record or there is an associated commercial imperative. An urgent need exists for suffi cient global public health capacity that is free from these constraints to allow free and rapid sharing of information and samples. Politicians are beginning to understand the importance of tackling these issues. The Global Health Security Action Group (GHSAG) has initiated work to develop sample sharing protocols and arrangements that build on the WHO PIP Framework but that move on from infl uenza viruses to include any organism that might lead to a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC under the IHRs). The GHSAG initiative is initially intended to focus on sample sharing between the countries in the GHSAG but it will be open to other countries to use the GHSAG-agreed protocols for sharing, and these protocols should encourage and help with sharing without compromising the commercial rights of the sending countries and without prejudicing future benefi t sharing. 49 Specifi c capacity building activity could help to increase trust and engender a true spirit of global cooperation. The positive global experience gained from the development of the Supranational Reference Laboratory (SRL) Network for the surveillance of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis under the Stop TB partnership could serve as a template for the development of a more integrated global laboratory surveillance, diagnostic, and vaccine development and manufacture network working across a series of high priority EID pathogens. 50 The eventual aim of such an initiative would be to ensure that suffi cient numbers of biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) and BSL-3 (adapted for animals) reference laboratories exist in every WHO region to serve the needs of its member countries and peoples. 51 Benefi ts of a global network would include a greater capacity of regions to respond to local and international EID threats more quickly and effi ciently, and, importantly, to retain human resources and expertise within those regions. The latter could have an additional benefi t in aiding eff orts to curtail the brain drain of scientists and technical experts from low-to-middle income countries to more developed regions of the world.",13.288583884076454,9.525238642397188

Many samples were inadvertently discarded at the end of the RSV season and were not available for sequencing, including all employee samples. Possibilities for the inability to sequence the remainder of the samples include low viral loads and sample degradation. In the 2007-2008 outbreak in particular, only samples early in the outbreak were sequenced. It is therefore not possible to know whether the cases later in the season were due to continued transmission of the outbreak strain or to sporadic community cases. Additionally, no samples were collected from visitors or family members. These data may have provided additional information regarding the degree of clonal transmission by health care providers and family members in the outbreaks. We also acknowledge no clear epidemiologic data linking outbreak cases. However, in our center, there are multiple sites of potential interaction between patients and care providers, including radiology, phlebotomy, and waiting areas for clinics. Although not documented, we believe these interactions may provide potential exposures of patients to sick employees, and vice versa. It is also possible that the clustering of the RSV strains during the 2 outbreaks was a reflection of the dominant strain circulating during the season in the region. The molecular epidemiology of RSV usually involves 1 dominant strain that circulates over the course of a season [34, 35] . However, we found clustering of samples from both outbreaks distinct from co-circulating community strains collected during the same period, making this less likely. Increased sampling and detection during periods of the RSV outbreak may have been partially due to heightened awareness among providers, leading to potential sampling bias.

According to Waegemann [41] , when medical institutions attempt to accomplish EMR, they not only need to establish certification, access control, and an e-signature system, but also guarantee the completeness and safety in integrating medical data.

In other words, disaster was perceived as a field requiring scientific research, not as God's realm. Therefore, damage investigation was implemented to recover the destructed site, and disaster recovery based on urban planning was implemented under the leadership of Marquis Pombal. The modern concept of disaster management was formed in the wake of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. Since the nineteenth century, many countries had started to develop national relief systems, which laid the foundation of the establishment of specialized organizations on disaster management and the development of disaster insurance systems.

Luna-Reyes et al (2008), for example, applied system dynamics to investigate the role of knowledge sharing in building trust in complex projects. To make modelling tractable, the authors make several simplifying assumptions including the aggregation of various government agencies as a single actor and various service providers as another actor. Each actor accumulates the knowledge of the other actor's work, and the authors explore the dynamics that emerge from their interaction. Greer et al (2006) modelled similar interactions-this time between client and contractor-each having its own, accumulated understandings of a common or global quantity (in this case the 'baseline' of work a project). Martinez-Moyano and Samsa (2008) developed a system dynamics model to support a feedback theory of trust and confidence. This represented the mutual interaction between two actors (government and public) in a social system where each actor assesses the trustworthiness of the other actor over time, with both actors maintaining memories of the actions and outcomes of the other actor. Our approach draws from all these studies, modelling a system in which actors interact on the basis of remembered, past interactions as they make assessments of some common object. The actors are in fact groups of individuals who are presumed to be acting in some concerted way. Although this may seem questionable there are several justifications for doing so: (1) the aim is not to represent the diversity of the social world but to explore the consequences of specific ideas about phenomena like social risk amplification; (2) in some circumstances a 'risk manager' such as a private corporation or a government agency may act very much like a unit actor, especially when it is trying to coordinate its communications in the course of risk events; (3) equally in some circumstances it may be quite realistic to see a 'public' as acting in a relatively consensual way whose net, aggregate or average response is of more interest than the variance of response.",11.315642091217885,9.217971386913595

For example, behavioral surveillance among some risk groups began in 2004, active testing campaigns were launched in 2004 and 2005, improved methods of estimating the total number of PLWH in China (diagnosed and undiagnosed) were incorporated and made routine in 2005, and several large, special epidemiological surveys were conducted beginning in the latter half of the 2000s. Many international aid programs were also generating data during this time as well and all of these sources of partially overlapping and nonstandardized data gathered via disparate methods began to be overwhelming. The days of not having enough data were over, but the true nature of the epidemic was not clearer. Thus, in 2008, China launched its National HIV/AIDS Comprehensive Response Information Management System (CRIMS), which integrated eight smaller systems (i.e. case reporting, testing and counseling, sentinel surveillance, behavioral surveillance, antiretroviral therapy [ART] for adults, ART for children, high-risk group behavioral intervention, and methadone maintenance treatment [MMT] ) and one new system (i.e. county demographic information) into a single, unified, web-based, real-time monitoring and evaluation data system. From 2008 on, CRIMS has been the primary source of data informing policy development and implementation for China's HIV/ AIDS response (Mao et al. 2010 ) (see Chap. 24 for more information).",15.487819066113865,7.934724923633855

In this context, healthcare institutions must comply with myriad state and federal laws. In the event of an emergency, institutional personnel of all varieties will be called upon to perform various functions, both within and outside of their typical scope of duties. Preparing for and dealing with the aftermath of a crisis will involve an array of duties not only to the public and individual patients, but to the institution's employees as well. Although the laws and regulations discussed in this section apply specifically to the employment relationship between healthcare institutions and their employees, it is important to note that some providers and other personnel work as independent contractors rather than as employees. Institutions should consider the effects of independent-contractor status with respect to the ability to use certain personnel in the event of an emergency, particularly if such individuals have relationships with more than one institution. Moreover, public-sector healthcare institutions also must bear in mind liability issues that might arise under various civil-rights statutes. 25 1. General Considerations. In developing an emergency management plan, organizations should consider the following personnelrelated issues. a. Have the institution's employees received materials and training on the development of personal emergency plans for themselves and their families? Do employees' families understand that, in an emergency, their personal emergency plans may need to be initiated without the employees (or with them only calling into a designated contact), as they may be required to stay at the facility and assist in the facility's response? Do they have enough information about family emergency plans to feel confident that their family will be safe during the emergency so they can focus on their responsibilities? b. Has the institution identified multiple safe staging areas for groups of employees, outside of the primary emergency-response areas, so that they can be assigned as needed? Have the locations of the staging areas been communicated to employees? c. Does the institution have a mechanism that ensures that employees are only released to return home if they are not needed, and if the institution believes that the employee may safely leave the premises? Has the institution developed mechanisms that will enable it to learn of unsafe conditions that would interfere with employees and others 25 See generally 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (2004) . exiting the institution (e.g., closed roads, bridges, and mass-transit problems)? d. Has the institution made provision for emergency emotional, spiritual, psychological, and potentially psychiatric support to its employees who are dealing with the personal effects of the emergency? Does it have a plan to employ a triage or other mechanism in such a situation? e. Has the institution anticipated providing some long-term, post-response support to its employees in the event of a major disaster? Does it have the internal resources to do so, or would it need to go to another organization or agency? If it needs to go elsewhere, does it know where to go? f. If an independent contractor has any of its employees performing responsibilities onsite at the institution, has that contractor set up a mechanism to locate and safeguard its employees? Do such employees have a central place to gather and sign in? g. Does the institution know who the independent-contractor employees are, and where they would gather in an emergency in case it needs to call upon their expertise (e.g., a contractor providing routine onsite staffing and management for an institution's data center)? Does the institution know who to contact at the independent contractor's office to get those individuals resourced appropriately in an emergency? h. e. Does a ""no-fault"" compensation program apply? f. Has the organization identified the availability of workers' compensation and/or other forms of financial support for persons unable to return to work because of an isolation/quarantine order? g. How will the organization address any potential legal liability for implementing ""working"" quarantine policies for essential service personnel? h. If an employee is quarantined, but is asymptomatic, is the employee entitled to compensation for the time spent in quarantine? i.

When such events occur, how should, and will, clinicians respond? The moral backbone of medical professionals-a duty to put the needs of patients first-may be sorely tested. Discussion: It is incumbent on health care professionals to ask what we must do and what we should do if a dangerous health care situation threatens both ourselves and our community. Despite numerous medical ethical codes, nothing-either morally or legally-requires a response to risk-prone situations from civilian clinicians; it remains a personal decision. The most important questions are: What will encourage us to respond to these situations? And will we respond? These questions are necessary, not only for physicians and other direct health care providers, but also for vital health care system support personnel. Those who provide care in the face of perceived risk demonstrate heroic bravery, but the choice to do so has varied throughout history. To improve individual response rates, disaster planners and managers must communicate the risks clearly to all members of the health care system and help mitigate their risks by providing them with as much support and security as possible. Conclusions: The decision to remain in or to leave a risky health care situation will ultimately depend on the provider's own risk assessment and value system. If history is any guide, we can rest assured that most clinicians will choose to stay, following the heroic example established through the centuries and continuing today. Ó 2018 Elsevier Inc.

During the 2009 H1N1 outbreak, for example, many doctors and nurses at a large New York hospital system-especially from the EDs and intensive care units, which saw the highest number of ill patients-were absent due to proven illness; their social workers and counselors, however, had the highest 290 K. V. Iserson absence rate, which they claimed was due to illness, although they were shown to have the lowest infection rate of any group (8) . To ameliorate such situations, disaster planners and managers should do everything possible to communicate the risks clearly to all members of the health care system and to provide them with as much support and security as possible. Research also demonstrates that to obtain the maximal response during risk-prone and other disasters, planners must do everything they can to mitigate perceived risks and to address other concerns that may prevent staff from responding. Research shows that disaster planners can, depending on the nature of the disaster and the responders, mitigate common responder concerns that may prevent them from being either able or willing to work in a disaster (Table 1 ) (8) (9) (10) 12, 18, (24) (25) (26) (27) . Responders are generally most concerned about the safety of their family and loved ones rather than about themselves. Highly effective strategies for planners involve assessing the most common concerns of their workforce and addressing those concerns within the limits of their budget and situation. For example, multiple studies show that females are less likely to respond to disasters, and more than 90% of nurses are women. Therefore, prioritizing their concerns, such as providing childcare in the wake of widespread school closings, may be extremely important (10, 28) . Potential responders to significant international risk-prone disasters, such as Ebola, may be dissuaded from responding by a negative and conflicting public response to returning responders, minimal organizational support, and confusing public health policies regarding quarantine (18) .",16.79682938698273,7.7692690407749945

The implementation of HIPAA addressed these concerns by allowing covered entities to release protected health information for the purposes of treatment, payment, and health care operations without specific authorization or consent by the patient [32] . This decision by lawmakers to abolish the consent requirement for the release of patient medical information raised concern among advocates of medical privacy, who worried that the new era of medical information management would progressively eclipse patient confidentiality in the interest of furthering the administrative and operational needs of the modern health care system [34] [35] [36] .",11.678968734206196,6.572895097068452

It was designed to provide surveillance information that is obtained from unified and broadly applicable health surveillance methods for all levels of public health to detect diseases and related health problems early with a timely assessment and response. BioSense uses many forms of surveillance information, including complaints, symptoms and laboratory tests that are required for clinical diagnoses. Focusing on clinical symptoms and symptoms of diagnosed or undiagnosed cases, it reflects syndrome surveillance and constitutes, together with BioWatch and NBIS, the three core biological surveillance programs. BioSense is an international, multijurisdictional, information-sharing surveillance platform that applies to all levels of the public health sector. At the same time, given its use of standardized data elements and analytical methods, BioSense analysts can compare the public health status in different countries or regions in the same country. BioSense can visualize time, space, people and other information via maps, charts, tables and other forms, and the information that it presents can indicate data anomalies. When receiving a prompt, users can confirm the anomalies with related information and may provide an early warning of health problems. Since its development in 2003, BioSense has been greatly improved and developed to meet changing demands and user feedback, and its sources of information have expanded to the US Department Introduction CHAPTER 1 of Veterans Affairs, health-related information from the US DOD and treatment information for all citizens.

The MIBBI (Minimum Information for Biological and Biomedical Investigations) consortium established the MIBBI project in 2008 to provide a freely accessible, web-based resource for minimum information standards and to enable owners of those standards to harmonize overlapping elements where applicable. The most wellknown of these standards is MIAME, or Minimum Information About a Microarray Experiment, but the MIBBI portal lists over 30 minimum information reporting guidelines (Taylor et al. 2008 ) . These guidelines identify only the types of information that must be included. They do not specify format or semantics. For example, MIAME enumerates six required pieces of information: (1) raw data, (2) processed data, (3) sample annotation, (4) experimental design including, e.g., which raw data fi le relates to which sample, which hybridizations are technical versus biological replicates, (5) array annotation, and (6) lab and data processing protocols. Array annotation could include a fi le that identifi es the sequence of each individual spot on the array, or it could simply name a standard commercial microarray chip for which annotation is readily available from the manufacturer. Either of these methods would be MIAME compliant for the array annotation component in that it would enable someone looking at the data to understand what each spot represents. One could argue that these guidelines do not go far enough-without specifying semantics or format, the information cannot be computed over and is therefore less useful than it could be.

Two principal dimensions to trust are brought to bear when public health surveillance data are 1326 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 24, No. 7, July 2018 shared. First, organizations sharing public health surveillance data should do so in a transparent manner and should be able to demonstrate to communities from which the data originate how their data are collected, analyzed, used, and protected. Second, trust-building measures between organizations or individuals sharing data, whether at the personal or organizational level, help create an environment where public health surveillance data can be shared. Transparency with regard to what data are shared with whom, and for what purpose, is a prerequisite. Trust includes ensuring that the shared data are used responsibly and not made available to other parties or publicly without consulting the data providers. When the purpose of sharing data is clear and explicit, and those persons involved in sharing know each other, understand each other's expectations, and carry out commitments as agreed, a trust relationship can emerge. Established trust increases the likelihood of collaboration and shared benefits and promotes core surveillance capacity through the creation of surveillance networks (19) . Building trust for routine data sharing can provide strong foundations for emergency surveillance and response. Building trust can be hard, but losing trust is all too easy. In practice, trust often translates into developing appropriate professional relationships with counterparts in other countries or regions (35) . Trust-building measures sometimes take the form of face-to-face meetings, regional workshops, desktop exercises, or joint outbreak investigations (19) . For data recipients, providers must be trustworthy in providing high-quality data.

The Boston Marathon Bombing event illustrated the need to provide emergency and surgical care to mass casualties, requiring coordination of response between hospitals and enhanced field rescue efforts to meet high volume demands over a short time period. In New York after 9/11, the cleanup phase after the event led to prolonged increased prehospital and ED volume. Most care was provided by emergency personnel working close to ground zero.

As a consequence, the design of emergency information systems should focus on the group communication process by accommodating how humans collect, contribute, and utilize data in a time-urgent manner [25] . Given that Turoff's remark is about generic emergency response information system, it is applicable to public health emergency response. It suggests that public health emergency response information systems can also be viewed as structured group communication systems. Turoff et al. [26] have articulated five criteria for the design of such a group communication system: metaphors, roles, notifications, context visibility, and hypertext. Metaphors, which pertain to the interface design, are the mental models of the system that help users to create a cognitive map between task objectives and interface elements. Roles reflect various parties' responsibilities in an event, and this concept should be built into the design of the group communication system by offering specific privileges and tools to different users. Notifications are relevant alerts to a user of change in status, data, or other information. The group communication system should raise appropriate notifications when events or actions of other users take place to cause the change. Context visibility refers to the idea that the components of the meaningful data objects are presented in a context that relates to the understandings of the user, that is, when the user activates a certain object the system should be able to know the user's intention and provide a list of relevant action choices. Hypertext refers to ''the possibility of multiple two way linkages with semantic meanings that allowed a person to utilize any item in the content of the application as a set of menu alternatives to move to another content or functionalities in the interface'' [26] .

For care coordination, numerous synonyms have been used, e.g., collaborative care, integrated care, shared care or cooperation, with a common underlying understanding that the term describes the continuity and totality of care for a given patient provided by different providers in concert. In 2007, MacDonald et al. identified more than 40 definitions of care coordination [1] . Since most of them were less than satisfactory, the authors created a new one: ""Care coordination is the deliberate organization of patient care activities between two or more participants (including the patient) involved in a patient's care to facilitate the appropriate delivery of health care services"". Care coordination is thus the patient-centered organization of care that providers including patient caregivers should share in order to improve the quality of a patient's management and ultimately the patient's health. Because of the fragmentation of services, effective communication among providers is crucial. A key success factor to care coordination is sharing of the same holistic view of a patient's condition by all actors, including the patient's active diseases and current treatments, and the planned care pathway that establishes the role of each provider and his/her interventions. Unfortunately, transitions from one setting or provider to another still frequently lack clear communication and coordination resulting in increase of health care costs and reduced quality of care including polypharmacy and adverse drug interactions, duplication of services, unnecessary Emergency Department utilization, high hospital readmissions rates, and in the worst case patient injury.

However, the FDA has modest expectations with regard to communication to the public about an EUA. The FDA Commissioner mandates that ''to the extent practicable, [emphasis added]'' the manufacturers of the drug provide fact sheets for the healthcare provider or authorized dispenser and to the recipient. 5 The FDA ''expects that some form of written information will be given to recipients, similar to the Fact Sheet for health care providers or authorized dispensers.'' However, FDA's guidance is confusing. While it provides the commissioner with the authority to mandate fact sheets for providers and recipients, the FDA does so only ''to the extent practicable given the circumstances of the emergency.'' 5 Therefore, these fact sheets are not required if the urgency of the emergency is such that their production or distribution would slow administration of the EUA drug or vaccine. If practicable, the manufacturer may use a variety of channels to disseminate information, including public service announcements, videos/DVDs, websites, and healthcare providers. The FDA recommends that fact sheets be tailored to audience level of education and literacy and, when possible, pretested for clarity ''particularly regarding messages on uncertainty and relative risks.'' Thus far in the H1N1pandemic, the FDA has authorized the emergency use of two drugs, Tamiflu and Relenza, as well as use of an N95 respirator and 3 RT-PCR diagnostic test kits. 7, 10, 11 Currently, there are fact sheets for healthcare providers and the public on each EUA, available in English only, on CDC's Emergency Use Authorization website. The FDA EUA declarations for Tamiflu and Relenza explicitly require written information about the use of the drug. 7 There may well be more EUAs issued during the pandemic. In fact, the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology explicitly called for consideration of a possible EUA for the intravenous use of antivirals. 12 FDA guidance also permits the distribution of the EUA drug or vaccine by authorized dispensers other than health professionals and in non-healthcare settings. 6 Currently, there is significant concern that the sheer demands of providing mass immunizations could prompt the use of non-health professionals to distribute a vaccine.

Finally, possible applications of this model, and future research directions are discussed. Foster's (2004) non-linear model of information-seeking behavior introduced a new perspective to the conceptualization of information practices, one in which ""the unit of observation expands from the study of individual tasks, individual search sessions, and the study of activities in relative isolation, and becomes the study of activities within a mesh of complex interactions"" (Foster, 2006, p. 165 ).

The main difference between this model and other IB models, including Foster's model, is this focus on the interdependence between context and information practices.

The ego nodes were defined as the households randomly selected from 10% of total households in each village including equal number of either positive or negative O. viverrini infection households. Alter nodes were all possible households who share food with egos and also with others. The links between egos and alters were indicated by their foodsharing or trading activities. The link direction was considered by the direction of sharing-in (in-degree) and sharing-out (out-degree). Questionnaire surveys including social network and attributes data, such as O. viverrini infection, fish sharing, food sharing, freshwater fish recipes and raw fish-eating behaviour, were conducted with all egos and their alters.

The area is a typical lowland floodplain along the Chi River. Ego network analysis was used to determine raw fish sharing in 2 of 12 rural villages. The selection criteria for these two villages are they have high O. viverrini prevalence (34.6% and 48%) and distinct spatial layout of the households. One village has a closely clustered pattern of households, but the other has a linearly pattern such that households disperse along the road. The researchers expected that different spatial arrangement of each particular village might result in dissimilar social interaction and food-sharing patterns. Questionnaires consisted of two phases; the first phase was designed for O. viverrini community-level intervention, and the second phase had a supplementary SNA questionnaire that exclusively focused on questions about fish dish sharing. Partial network analysis was carried out using nodes defined as households and ties defined as food-sharing relationships based on four types of raw fish dishes Koi-pla, Pla-som, Pla-ra and Pla-jom. Household locations were determined by a handheld global positioning system receiver (Garmin Ltd.; Olathe, KS, USA), and household maps were created using Quantum GIS, version 1.8.0 (http://www.qgis.org/en/site/). This information was then used to visually characterize the spatial pattern of households in each village. Statistical analysis of raw fish sharing and O. viverrini infection risk associated with exposure to raw fish dishes were performed using R statistical package, version 3.0.3 (R Core Team, 2013). Raw fish-sharing networks were constructed, and the degree of food sharing (DFS), which is defined as the number of the household members who share food together regardless of providing or receiving food, was measured using the igraph R package. These networks were complex and showed an apparent association between household food sharing and O. viverrini infection prevalence. Information from the network analysis demonstrated that a household's members who were positive for O. viverrini infection also tended to consume a greater variety of raw fish dishes. The direction of the ties showed that providers were household members who fished and prepared fish dishes, whereas the recipients were household members who did not fish, mainly elderly or disabled individuals. A statistically significant association was showed between DFS and O. viverrini infection and other risk factors such as raw fish consumption and types of raw fish dishes. However, the result revealed the different networks that share raw fish dishes which illustrate more complexity or greater number of sharing in a clustered pattern village than in a linear pattern village. In addition, social determinants of raw fish dish sharing were observed. Three factors associated with these behaviours were expressed: enjoyment of raw fish dishes among relatives and friends, alcohol drinking and access to the fish used in raw fish dishes (Saenna et al., 2017) .",14.842739758750522,6.849307953567558

The combination of rapid economic growth and unprecedented rate of commercialisation has brought about notable market failures, none more spectacular than those in the health-care sector. Market failures occur when public goods, such as public health, are not produced suffi ciently and in proportion to need. These failures have been compounded by information asymmetry, in which health providers have much greater information than patients on prices and quality of treatments and drugs. Under such conditions, providers can use their knowledge to persuade patients to spend more on services that will not necessarily lead to the best health gains, as has been happening in China. 26 Providers, for example, have been prescribing tests, drugs, and procedures that will make them the most profi t-causing cost escalation, unnecessary or even dangerous practices, and poorer quality care. Furthermore, government fi nancing as a proportion of total health expenditure decreased from almost 40% in the early 1980s to 18% in 2005, while out-of-pocket payments rose from 20% to more than 50% in the same period. 27 Before the economic reform launched in 1978, over 90% of the rural population in China was covered by the Cooperative Medical Scheme, 28 while the Government Insurance Scheme and Labour Insurance Scheme provided almost free health care to the employees of the government agencies and public institutions in Chinese cities. 29 Both schemes also partly covered the cost of health care for dependants of employees. According to a national survey in nine provinces in 1986, less than 14% of the urban population was not covered by any health insurance or plan. 30 As a whole, the Chinese population was able to access basic health care at a low and aff ordable cost before the mid-1980s.",11.70916056139962,8.510788582029875

The intention was that this would make them more cost conscious since they would be paying; that is, they would be deterred from referring patients too readily for tests and treatments, and that they would hold care providers, principally hospitals, to account for spending and quality of care for patients (Hunter 2016) . The New Labour government of 1997 broadly extended this policy, merging general practices into Primary Care Trusts which jointly commissioned services for patients. The late 1990s into the early 2000s saw the further introduction of private providers into the NHS, for example, to run day surgery, pathology and diagnostic services (DoH 1997). In 2010, the new Coalition government consolidated this by the setting up of Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) which hold approximately two-thirds of the NHS budget. CCGs currently purchase care on behalf of GPs for their patients. Moreover, under the new 'any qualified provider' provision, care could be commissioned not only from NHS providers but also from the for-profit and the not-for-profit third sector (charities and social enterprises) (DoH 2010). This overall policy remains in place at the time of writing in 2017 with recent concern focusing less visibly on structural reform and more on incapacity to meet demand-for example, in January 2017 the British Red Cross said that the NHS was facing a humanitarian crisis in the face of escalating demand and rising waiting lists for treatment.",11.08313983998068,7.232118801399854

They found that the passive facility-based system yielded consistently lower incidences than active surveillance. Possible explanations for this finding included the possibility of under-reporting cases of pneumonia by health facilities due to low motivation or insufficient time, under-detection by health providers due to insufficient training, or failure of patients to present to health-care facilities in the study area. The proportion of severe pneumonia cases was slightly higher in the active cohort than in the passive system (23% vs 18%), but the difference was not statistically significant. 37 There was concern for under-reporting of severity assessments in the passive surveillance system, which could have led to an artificially low incidence of severe pneumonia. 37 A different approach was adopted for the cooking and pneumonia study, 11 which assessed for pneumonia via passive, facility-based surveillance. Study staff affixed a sticker to the Malawi Ministry of Health and Population health passport (ie, a patient-held medical record system) of all participants, which included a description of the trial and space for providers to document symptoms of pneumonia. This information was then recorded by study personnel every three months. Community health providers and family members were asked to call or text study staff after pneumonia episodes. Although this approach elegantly used pre-existing infrastructure, it could be difficult to replicate in other settings, and might have been subject to under-reporting if a health provider did not see the sticker or neglected to fill out study documentation, or if the participant's health documentation was not presented or lost.",9.957294915827802,9.900067773609798

Protection of patients and staff during a pandemic,"Therefore, health care institutions should discuss and agree with staff representatives concerning the best means of minimising these risks. Possibilities include access to isolation facilities, sharing transport with colleagues who live in proximity or even providing a specific staff transport system during the event in order to maintain staffing levels. If sharing transport systems are developed, any staff members developing signs of potential infection should avoid participation. The recent evidence suggesting that wearing of surgical masks may have some efficacy in reducing the risks of disease transmission [11] Many staff members will find it very difficult to accept the necessity to restrict patient care or to limit admissions because of insufficient resources to meet the demand. This is, however, an inevitable consequence of a pandemic or other major disaster event. Health care institutions have a responsibility to provide advance training and information to staff to raise awareness of these potential issues and minimise the risk. Staff training should include information relating to the likely duration of the event and reassurance (if appropriate) about when a return to normal working practice may be anticipated. Although this may have limited benefit for the care of acutely ill patients whose risks of recovery may be influenced by lack of resources, for patients with more prolonged conditions (e.g., awaiting transplantation or elective surgery), it is likely to be beneficial if reassurance about future care can be given. Advance contingency planning in accordance with local or national guidance for expanding capacity will also potentially improve the ability to cope with excess demand, and the engagement of staff in this process may help to reduce the discomfort caused. Failure to maximise the use of the resources available is likely to cause demoralisation, particularly if colleagues, relatives or friends suffer as a result.",10.292974222819877,6.108891972097064

As a result, the ethical frameworks surrounding health surveillance are racing to catch up with the pace of technological advancement. The 2005 changes to the International Health Regulations contained provision for nonstate actors to provide information to WHO in the context of outbreak prevention; something which is thought to have caused tensions during certain outbreaks as governments have attempted to control the flow of information in order to prevent national panic [12] . As health surveillance moves beyond the realm of government agencies, it is likely that a range of mechanisms will develop that allow for the prioritisation of rapid information sharing ahead of the specific interests of individual nations. This will, however, require international collaboration to take into account the diverse needs of different populations.

This controversial decision was triggered by a dispute over property rights between the Indonesian Government and an Australian company that had used viral strains from Indonesia to produce and market an H5N1 infl uenza vaccine. Indonesia argued that the incident exposed wider issues of exploitation and global inequalities-pharmaceutical companies obtain, free of charge, viral samples that are shared by developing countries with WHO, then patent the resulting products and sell them at prohibitively expensive prices, thus providing benefi ts disproportionately to high-income countries. 68 The controversy forced WHO and its member states to reconsider the current approach to global infl uenza surveillance and the sharing of biological materials, and to create new mechanisms for benefi t sharing. To this aim, in May, 2007, the World Health Assembly adopted a resolution that promoted the ""transparent, fair and equitable sharing of the benefi ts arising from the generation of information, diagnostics, medicines, vaccines and other technologies"", 68 while reasserting the need for timely sharing of both information and biological samples with the Global Infl uenza Surveillance Network. Additionally, it established an intergovernmental meeting to consider further actions aimed at ensuring fair and equitable distribution of pandemic infl uenza vaccines. 69 In 2008, after many debates and negotiations, the Indonesian Government agreed to share H5N1 infl uenza sequences (but not the viral samples) through the new Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Infl uenza Data. 70 The dispute and its underlying issues, however, have not been settled. In 2009, Indonesia did not share any samples with the Global Infl uenza Surveillance Network, including those from pandemic infl uenza A H1N1. Moreover, the initial eff orts to create a more equitable framework for the purchase and distribution of vaccines have not produced any substantial results thus far. Disagreement has arisen because high-income countries are reluctant to accept the suggestion of legally binding obligations to share the benefi ts of vaccines that accrue from sharing of biological samples, whereas many low-income and middle-income countries, notably Indonesia, Thailand, and Brazil, want to see binding obligations. 71 tuberculosis, and malaria, but other diseases that carry a heavy burden of morbidity and mortality in the region are neglected, including traditional childhood diseases, emerging vector-borne diseases, and respiratory infections. A further concern is that disease-focused programmes that receive substantial funding are often poorly integrated within the wider health systems of recipient countries. Many initiatives in southeast Asia signify potentially important reforms-for example, the Linked Response in Cambodia, which aims to improve integration of vertical programmes for HIV, tuberculosis, and maternal and child health, and the incorporation of programmes initiated in response to H5N1 infl uenza into the broader control programme for emerging infectious diseases in Laos. 55 Overarching many of the challenges to governance that we have outlined is a diversity of domestic political institutions, and tensions between and within countries that have the potential to hamper regional eff orts to prevent and control emerging infectious diseases. Southeast Asia has witnessed major political upheavals during the past decade, with military coups (in Thailand), democratic reform (Indonesia), and a shift, albeit at diff ering paces, from Marxism to free market economies (Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos). Tensions also exist between and within countries-for example, a lingering border dispute centred on Preah Vihear temple between Thailand and Cambodia, an ongoing ethnic separatist insurgency in the south of Thailand, recent violence associated with elections in the Philippines, and terrorist attacks on tourist areas in Indonesia. The ongoing military dictatorship in Myanmar is a continuing regional concern. Emerging infectious diseases too have the potential to fan the fl ames of ethnic tensions. Recently, pigs-raised predominantly by non-Muslims in Egypt and Malaysia, both countries with predominantly Muslim populations-were a focus of concern regarding the H1N1 and Nipah viruses, respectively. These political, ethnic, and religious tensions all have the potential to create instability that aff ects the emergence and response to emerging infectious diseases.",11.18917389328128,6.428496667396983

Different media platforms can affect what people talk about and share (Berger & Iyengar, 2013) and thus may explain the discrepancies in those findings. Email and Facebook networks involve a great number of pre-existing social relations (Ellison, Steinfield, & Lampe, 2011) , while Twitter network may involve a larger number of strangers or very weak ties as following a Twitter user typically does not require a mutual agreement from both relational parties (Hansen, Arvidsson, Nielsen, Colleoni, & Etter, 2011) . Social bonding is an important motivation when sharing information with pre-existing social relations (Berger, 2014) . Sharing positive emotions helps build a positive self-image and maintain positive interpersonal relationships. However, when communicating with very weak ties, it may be less important to be a positive or a nice person. Instead, sharing negative-tone messages may attract more attentions from others. Information that arouses negative emotion may signal danger and thus are more urgent and useful (McLaughlin et al., 2016) .

Like all passive systems, it relied on astute healthcare providers to detect and report illnesses that might have been SARS. The lack of a rapid diagnostic test that could reliably diagnose SARS-CoV infection during the early phase of illness increased the workload and anxiety of clinicians, public health personnel, patients, their contacts, and the general public. Frequent, labor-intensive contact with healthcare providers was needed to obtain updated clinical information for reported case-patients. As a result, classification of patients as suspect and probable case-patients was dynamic and often changed as new information became available. This situation sometimes created seeming discrepancies between national and state and local health department case counts, which in turn complicated public communication. The evolution of the worldwide outbreak required frequent modifications of the case definition, and establishing consistent criteria to define a SARS-affected area on the basis of community transmission was difficult. Finally, the paper-based reporting system increased the difficulty of reporting to CDC and delayed timeliness of reports, and the resulting database did not allow states immediate access to their own information.",13.151611550279105,9.260371667414582

Decision support can be one tool to help busy providers remember to screen for rare events, and give direct messaging when such a screening is positive. Alternatively, providers should also be made aware of the potential for false alarms or false positives. Here, clinicians must rely on further assessment and their clinical judgement to ascertain the presence or absence of a disease. The future of this type of support lies in leveraging systems that work with devices that patients already use, for example, smart phones.

The EHR was blamed and believed to be a contributing factor in the initial missed diagnosis [30] . In truth, the EHR itself was not to blame, but the answer was likely more in the way the EHR collected and presented critical data to the medical team and the current state of organizational policies where the technology was concerned. The EHR should have helped to better identify a patient for whom a clinical concern should be raised, particularly when a disease is rare and not on the mind of providers (as was the case for the medical team in Dallas at the time). The concern was not that the critical data had not been collected, but that it had been placed in a relatively unobtrusive area that was easy to skip when the EHR was reviewed. This in turn led to confusion where the patient's international travel was recorded and whether the relevant information was effectively communicated to all members of the healthcare team (http://res.dallasnews.com/ interactives/duncan-timeline/). This would constitute an example of what Borycki and colleagues term a ""technology-induced"" error [31] , which is an error that results from human factors issues and deficiencies whereby a health information system may lead a health professional to make an error (which could be an error of omission, such as omitting to read key information, or commission). Such errors do not result from errors in programming but rather emerge in the complex interaction of health information systems with end users in the busy and often hurried context of clinical practice. Indeed a key aspect of both EHRs systems and public health systems is their level of usability, with systems and user interfaces that are difficult to navigate or use leading to a higher probability of technology-induced error [32] . In response to the problem in this example, the hospital then reported updating their EHR to collect additional screening information in a more rigorous fashion to help identify high-risk patients [33] .",11.891928481431911,8.325383572360117

When coded information is collected in the EHR about travel or other designated related screening information, an active pop-up alert for patients such as the one illustrated in figure 2, can be displayed to the relevant provider to acknowledge the risks and initiate any desired behaviours or treatment pathway. As passive decision support, additional reminders can be added to the patient's chart in the form of informational banners or highlights. This system would work with the existing workflow of providers but interrupt (through the active alert) only when patients screen positive. It also has the drawback that it needs to be adjusted. In this specific case, when patients traveled to one of four specific countries, the alert fires. If, as is prevalent in infectious disease, the countries or risk factors change, the coding behind the alert must change as well. This requires more programming support. Also-if the list of risk factors grows very large (in our example, if the list of affected Ebola countries were to swell to 10-20 countries) the electronic screening would likely be much less accurate. Here, one could look towards international organizations such as the World Health Organization to maintain and update DSS content about Ebola using a service oriented architecture approach [40] .",13.063539533200288,6.688356621001013

They are trained to provide search and rescue operations, triage, and emergency care depending on the type of disaster. However, when it comes to day-to-day operations, the majority of the EMS calls are non-emergency, or non-life threatening calls, meaning that patients need minimal care and transport to the appropriate care facilities [23] .

However, reliable systems for rapid transmission of epidemiological, genomic, and clinical data were not established during the Ebola epidemic. Although governments in the three worst aff ected countries transmitted epidemiological information to WHO, robust channels were not established for direct data exchange and coordination between the three capitals. Although some researchers shared genomic sequencing data early in the outbreak through an open access database, other researchers later withheld such data from the public domain. 71 And although care providers and researchers collected thousands of patient samples, now housed in laboratories in west Africa and worldwide, no clear arrangements exist for scientists to access those samples, 72 for their safe handling, or to ensure that west African patients benefi t from the fi ndings or technology that might result. 73 Previous epidemics show that better arrangements are feasible. During the 2003 SARS outbreak, WHO established online systems for data sharing among a worldwide network of scientists, enabling researchers to identify the virus, sequence its genome, and understand its characteristics. 74 In 2006, an international consortium of researchers agreed to data sharing norms for infl uenza, which enabled real-time dissemination and publication of epidemiological and clinical data during H1N1 in 2009. 73 The Consortium for the Standardization of Infl uenza Seroepidemiology helps to coordinate a global community of researchers working on infl uenza serology. Furthermore, after 4 years of intergovernmental negotiations, the 2011 WHO Pandemic Infl uenza Preparedness Framework achieved a delicate balance between sharing samples and access to the resulting technology. 76, 77 However, no analogous framework exists for other pathogens.",14.54325764578861,9.326022625176098

More timely information and networking among the ""helping hands"" could become the most driving factor. Challenges are related to the increased information overload, including the amount of unauthorized information which is information not officially confirmed by health officials, which might be addressed by technology, e.g., by including sophisticated filtering algorithms to prefilter the information before showing to the user. A challenge is the high risk of manipulation, in particular the risk of analyzing postings containing wrong or misleading information. The usefulness of social media for disease surveillance depends clearly on the willingness of people to share (correct) information online and to use online tools.

The Maquiladora Program was established in 1965 to help relieve high unemployment in the northern region of Mexico. Foreign-owned firms were granted the right to set up production in the region and to import materials and equipment duty-free under the proviso that the goods would be re-exported. Not all maquiladoras are majority owned by US corporations, so these data complement the information in Table 1 based on US multinational data only. The maquiladoras are an important source of employment and export-oriented growth for Mexico, with their exports accounting for half of all non-oil exports from Mexico and one-third of manufacturing employment. 13 The US is the predominant trading partner with maquiladoras, accounting for roughly 90% of total maquiladora exports in 1998 (Bendesky et al., 2003) . Table 1 shows that including maquiladoras trade significantly increases the measures of production sharing between US and Mexico described above. For example, in Panel C we observe that the production-sharing intensity of trade increases from roughly 25% to 55% when maquiladoras are included. 14 To quantify the operations of maquiladoras, Panel A in Fig. 1 displays the ratio of imports by maquiladoras as a fraction of their exports, for the period 1993-2005. The average value of the ratio is roughly 0:75. This suggests that for every 75 cents of imported intermediate inputs, 25 cents of Mexican value is added to the product, and one dollar is re-exported.",12.068920546998811,8.743674052735747

Integrated programs and collaboration, on the other hand, facilitate the efficient management of the complex, varied, and proliferating issues and information sources that exist today. The nature of public health surveillance also lends itself to multiple-purpose approaches in that strategies for preventing and controlling diseases, such as West Nile virus, are to a great extent the same as for an influenza epidemic, a foodborne disease outbreak, or a bioterrorist attack. 31 Technology that enhances communication and data sharing across disease programs, surveillance systems, and even across jurisdictions increases the ease of obtaining and disseminating useful information to a broad audience, including public health agencies, healthcare providers, policymakers, and the general public. 6, 32 This rapid information exchange not only facilitates timely response, but can also reduce emergency room visits, hospital admissions, and even costs of care. 33 However, many health departments currently have systems that are not flexible enough to respond to changing health IT needs, which makes it difficult to deliver information when and where it is needed. 4 Disease or program-specific funding also exacerbates program vulnerability to funding and budgetary cuts. For example, when funding is earmarked for specific purposes (e.g., emergency preparedness and associated surveillance systems), and then is reduced, such as has occurred for public health emergency preparedness cooperative agreement funding through CDC in the past seven years, 34 it can undermine and reverse efforts to establish sustainable systems that serve multiple crosscutting purposes throughout public health.

The challenge resulted in MappyHealth, a Twitter monitoring programme now being piloted for digital health surveillance around the country, helping offi cials examine real-time events. Digital surveillance was used by public health workers during the infl uenza A H7N9 outbreak to monitor Chinese social media for events, myths, and concerns. 6 Improvements in digital surveillance have also improved public communication. Local health departments that can monitor Twitter can give immediate feedback to correct dangerous mistruths that are contagious on social media. 7 CDC's @CDCEmergency Twitter feed, fi rst established during the infl uenza A H1N1 response, now reaches more than 1·5 million people with emergency health information. During the Japan nuclear disaster response, Twitter was used to correct the dangerous myth that healthy people in the USA should take potassium iodide to prevent harm from radiation. 8 These technological advances have been developed in parallel with diplomatic information sharing advances.

Improved capacity and the high priority placed on rapid information sharing led to China's timely reporting in 2013 of clinical and genetic information about infl uenza A H7N9 and early sharing of isolates, by contrast with the response to sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) a decade earlier, when information was slower to emerge. 9,10 Cloud computing allowed for distribution of validated epidemiological and analytical programmes to the global community, while allowing China to share genomic sequences, providing the opportunity for immediate actions to analyse the viral genome and develop vaccine candidates. 6 The Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasure Enterprise was established by HHS to coordinate federal eff orts and build new ways to respond to 21st century health threats-from discovery to deployment. The programme generated a government-wide strategic plan to build all-hazards capabilities and countermeasures throughout federal public health agencies.",17.05589744006145,7.019693675578552

Undoubtedly all understand the professional and societal dilemma of maintaining strict confidentiality of personal information that could have significant implications for a person's employability, insurability, and social acceptability versus the challenges associated with the information itself if its maintained confidentiality endangers the public good. Quarantine was seen as an effective mechanism to sequester diseased persons to minimize the spread of disease. Today, millions of birds have been destroyed to contain avian flu, but the disease is spreading along well known bird migratory routes. It is apparent that quarantine is unlikely to be a successful defense in the international community. If this is the case, then what personal information about travelers who have recently visited disease endemic regions should become publicly available and to who? It is possible that knowledge of disease transmission patterns could lead to earlier diagnosis and potential therapeutic solutions; however, to obtain this degree of specificity, it is likely that traditionally held beliefs of personal privacy would be compromised and the international response to such information requests is suspect at best. The value of international organizations in this situation becomes uniquely important, because networked databases that contain personal identifiers free, but nonetheless valuable demographic information, may be made available to physicians worldwide while the personal prerogatives of patients and their families becomes the debate of international legislative and diplomatic bodies.

For instance, FDA collaborates with HHS and other US government partners on a variety of MCM issues, such as international requests for MCMs. Through the Global Health Security Initiative (GHSI), FDA works with such partners to strengthen operational frameworks and build regulatory capacity for responding to global infectious disease threats through the sharing of MCMs and expertise (eg, on legal/regulatory approaches) across countries. 22 FDA also works closely with US and Canadian partners through the Beyond the Border Initiative, providing MCM expertise, and collaborates with WHO to help ensure rapid availability of needed medical products by assisting with prequalification of products for deployment to needed areas. 23 To enhance internal and interagency emergency coordination, FDA's Office of Crisis Management serves as FDA's focal point for coordinating emergency and crisis response activities involving FDA-regulated products and manages FDA's EOC, which is linked to the global EOC network through the HHS EOC. 24 In addition to helping to prevent epidemics in some situations, product approvals are often important for responses to public health emergencies when they are occurring. In the area of pandemic preparedness, FDA expanded the approval for use of an antiviral to treat children as young as 2 weeks of age. 17 Other public health threat product approvals include a botulism antitoxin (the first polyclonal antibody approved under the Animal Rule), an antibiotic for treatment of plague, an inhalational anthrax therapeutic (the first monoclonal antibody approved under the Animal Rule), and a next-generation portable ventilator. 17 As mentioned, FDA has special legal and regulatory authorities to help improve access to MCMs during public health emergencies. These include the EUA, other emergency use authorities under PAHPRA (eg, emergency dispensing of approved products), and Investigational New Drug Application (IND) or Investigational Device Exemption (IDE). In direct response to the emerging threats of MERS-CoV and the novel influenza A (H7N9) virus, FDA issued EUAs to facilitate access to new diagnostics to help detect the novel threats in the US and abroad. In response to the 2009-10 H1N1 influenza pandemic, FDA issued 22 EUAs for MCMs (ie, antiviral drugs, IVDs, and personal protective equipment) to counter the novel influenza strain during the response. FDA also has mechanisms to extend the expiration dating of certain properly stored MCMs based on scientific data. When appropriate, this can enable local, state, and federal stakeholders to use their stockpiled MCMs for a period of time beyond the labeled expiration date so as to be ready to respond rapidly during an emergency. 25 While MCM legal authorities can enhance FDA's capabilities to detect, prevent, and respond to health threats domestically, they can also help to address global health threats and facilitate the international sharing of MCMs. In appropriate cases, FDA can, for example, authorize a particular MCM to be used for US government personnel in other countries or by foreign laboratories. In other cases, the EUA or other FDA authorities have helped to inform approaches and planning efforts with global partners related to the sharing of MCMs with international partners during an emergency, or could potentially provide a certain level of assurance or information during a response about an MCM that is not yet approved but is needed for the emergency.",11.41027536127654,10.76138874438197

The planners recommend creating a recreation area in the bamboo wood around the Guniu Lake, which requires cutting part of the wood. But the park general manager does not like the idea. His argument is that the park needs the green bamboo trees to enhance the lake scenery. He would like to move the recreation area to another place in the park. No detailed planning has been specified regarding this matter, so the park general manager just acts, partially as a planner and, in the meantime, an interpreter to do the actual job of implementation, with the assistance of his business friends and clients.

Curricula for urban planning programmes in higher education institutions should expand to include topics related to the interactions of society, environment, economy, and health. Urban planning elements as diverse as housing, transportation, information technology development, and land use can affect health through their influence on food access, physical activity, housing quality, health information, access to care, transport choice and affordability, school locations, social equity, clean air and water, and other factors. 330 Therefore, a multi-scale, cross-sectoral vision of urban health should be built into city and regional planning programmes to ensure that urban planners are fully aware of the various elements required for a healthy city. If health cannot be given proper consideration in the design and planning of districts, communities, individual buildings, and urban infrastructural elements (such as roads), the healthy functioning of an entire city is unlikely to be achieved. A healthy city should also have the capacity to shield its citizens from potential health risks. Correspondingly, the curricula of public health programmes should provide the skills and knowledge needed to work together with urban planners to jointly develop strategies that address the root causes of poor health, rather than simply targeting specific diseases or individual behaviours. 315",16.09399205437704,9.91028800901762

Many experts believe that the SARS outbreaks in 2003 were a prologue to the next flu pandemic, possibly from an avian influenza virus (Stohr, 2005) . Since the SARS outbreaks, serious concerns about the extent to which health care providers would tolerate risks of infection have been raised (Ruderman et al, 2006) . Nonetheless, the expertise of health care providers is an integral part of the response to a pandemic. No other profession can be legitimately expected to fulfill this role and to assume this level of risk (Ruderman et al., 2006) . Health care providers can be prepared for avian influenza and a potential pandemic by becoming familiar with the lessons learned from the SARS outbreaks such as case detection, reporting, clear and timely dissemination of information, and strict infection control measures in handling an infectious disease outbreak and the procedures that prevented the spread of SARS virus (Abdullah, Tomlinson, Cockram, & Thomas, 2003; Weinstein, 2005) .",15.275122100081461,10.960104442525154

These advantages include (i) the agility of service deployments in which the services are up and running when we need them, (ii) the low cost of deployment as there is no need to own the hardware or to maintain the system operations and (iii) the widespread availability of such systems in most of the world. Public cloud facilities for data storage and data sharing are needed to support our proposed model. Cloud storage model provides flexibility in storing huge amount of data that is easy to be accessed by different parties from different locations. The access is provided using predefined portals. The cloud storage can be leased from cloud service providers and controlled by SLA . Similar to the computing resources, it can be scaled in and out based on the demands.

Thus, the input data and assumptions of models need to be clear so that planners can evaluate the relevance of model results. Models must provide results quickly and allow users to easily perform sensitivity analyses on different response scenarios. Good models will also allow users to evaluate tradeoffs in strategies (e.g., evaluating the tradeoffs between investment in local stockpiles versus the development of local dispensing capacity, or downgrading the standard of care in hospitals versus enhancing hospital surge capacity for the critically ill).

The national system had been able to detect and confirm the outbreak etiology but required external support to monitor the spread of cholera and coordinate response, because much of the information produced was insufficiently timely for real-time monitoring and directing of a rapid, targeted response. The A&R System was designed by the Pan American Health Organization/ World Health Organization in collaboration with the Haiti Ministry of Health, and it was based on a network of partners, including any institution, structure, or individual that could identify, verify, and respond to alerts. The defined objectives were to (1) save lives through early detection and treatment of cases and (2) control the spread through early intervention at the community level. The operational structure could be broken down into three principle categories: (1) alert (early warning), (2) verification and assessment of the information, and (3) efficient and timely response in coordination with partners to avoid duplication. Information generated by the A&R System was analyzed and interpreted, and the qualitative information was critical in qualifying the epidemic and defining vulnerable areas, particularly because the national surveillance system reported incomplete data for more than one department. The A&R System detected a number of alerts unrelated to cholera and facilitated rapid access to that information. The sensitivity of the system and its ability to react quickly was shown in May of 2011, when an abnormal increase in alerts coming from several communes in the Sud-Est Department in epidemiological weeks (EWs) 17 and 18 were noted and disseminated network-wide and response activities were implemented.

WHO has also produced outbreak communication guidelines to aid in the dissemination of information to the public, recognizing that 'expertise [in communications] has become as essential to outbreak control as epidemiological training and laboratory analysis'. 2 The boundaries between risk communication and management are not, however, sharply delineated, as illustrated by the controversy surrounding H5N1 influenza virus sharing. Indonesia is one of the countries hardest hit by outbreaks of H5N1. Virus sharing with the international community is the mechanism by which, first, viruses developing pandemic potential can be tracked (risk communication), and second, vaccines can be developed to meet global need (risk management). Indonesia refused to virus share, not because it was opposed to the sharing of technical information to better understand the threat posed by H5N1 avian influenza, but because it felt excluded from equitable access to the resulting vaccine, meaning that its management of a subsequent pandemic would be constrained. 3 It could be argued that Indonesian authorities currently view virus sharing as an important element in risk management and thus a sovereign issue, although the international community, by contrast, views virus sharing as a critical element of risk communication and, by extension, a global risk management issue. Differing interpretations of international treaties are possible and resolution is proving challenging. 4 Ultimately, the debate is centred on the boundary between the governance of risk communication and risk management, the former now being mandated through international laws, with the latter remaining, to a large degree, a national sovereignty responsibility.",14.692791448378566,6.78125712396741

SA relies heavily on the correct information and good communication of the information among multiple event respondents [24] . Incorrect or insufficient information may lead to endangering rescuers and poor outcomes [24] . There is also shared SA, which entails communicating and relaying information about the event to authorities and other responders and promoting teamwork and cooperation [24] . An established flow of communication among disaster responders and the transmission of important information in a timely fashion is crucial. Awareness of cultural norms is also part of SA. Electronic surveillance and wireless communication systems help facilitate information flow and distribution [24, 25] . Barriers to satisfactory SA include (1) lack of universal operational models; (2) poor communication; (3) incorrect, insufficient, or outdated information; and (4) undefined information-sharing plans and routes [24] . Norri-Sederholm and colleagues [24] surveyed emergency paramedics to determine what information was crucial to successfully respond and manage emergency medical situations. There were 5 important information categories identified: mission status, area status, incident data, safety at work, and tactics. Incident data was the most important category, as this provides basic information about the event, number of victims, nature of the event, ages of the victims, and other details about the event (eg, are there victims trapped somewhere, are there any obstacles preventing responders from getting to the victims). Mission status includes the number and type of personnel assigned to respond to the event, the number of respondents required for that particular event, estimated time, and confirmation of a completed mission. Area status refers to the number of responding units available, the type of units that are available, the location of the units, and urgency of the missions. Safety information is obtained from police or authorities at the scene to let responders know if there are any safety risks to personnel (eg, active shooter, biochemical exposure, unexploded ordinance). Finally, tactical details include coordinating response and obtaining instructions from the police, devising a response plan, and communicating said plan to other authorities involved (ie, police) [24] .",13.481829641120578,9.733792626112631

[55] [56] [57] The benefits of electronic storage, retrieval, and transmittal are numerous; they include the timely availability of information to clinicians such as medical history, medications, and previous ECGs. These benefits may be especially important in the ED because patients often arrive without documentation of their condition or of treatment provided at other institutions. A disadvantage, however, is that widespread availability of electronic records and the use of electronic data transmission opens the door to unauthorized access, a clear violation of confidentiality. Stories abound of ''hackers'' who have found access to supposedly ''secure'' information, such as financial and even national security information. The HIPAA privacy rule requires that access to electronic records be given only to authorized individuals. 42 A HIPAA-authorized security rule, to take effect in April 2005, will require that electronically transmitted health information be encrypted according to strict standards. 58 Medical records are also sometimes transmitted by fax. In such cases, safeguards must be in place, including ensuring that the receiving fax number is correct and that machines that receive faxes are in secure locations accessible only to authorized personnel. When ED reports are automatically transmitted to primary care providers after an ED visit, it is important that the database of fax numbers be updated periodically. (Similarly, the database of e-mail addresses must also be periodically updated if reports are automatically transmitted by e-mail.) It is also good practice for the fax cover sheet to indicate the confidential nature of the items being faxed.

Nevertheless, the Chinese government assigned responsibility for censorship of the media, including the Internet, to local agencies. 5 In the new media age, in which social media (including the Internet, short message services, and mobile applications) are centralized, the government restricts freedom of expression in the same way as it has restricted such freedom among traditional media sources, such as newspapers, radio, and television. 6 The control of the acquisition of information is more difficult in this new age because social media are tools not only for the dissemination, sharing, and seeking of health information but also for the expression of feelings and the sharing of personal experiences and opinions. 7, 8 Therefore, organizations need to build effective communication tools to respond to emerging infectious disease (EID) outbreaks because the public may express scientific skepticism about scientific topics and participation in decision-making. 9 During epidemics, people usually require guidance on how to behave from a trusted source. The government and public institutions are the ideal sources because people tend to rely on the national administration.

Kunin et al. recently reported on how primary care physicians helped pass on important pandemic-related information to out-patients during the 2009 pandemic in Israel. This, they concluded, helped enhance the success of the national pre-pandemic preparedness plans. 188 Indeed, during public health disasters, the speed at which information is needed by policymakers may be faster than is usually possible through traditional mechanisms of research dissemination. This scenario makes information sharing a norm; even possibly those provided by preliminary research findings. 189 Humans instinctively show care to other humans in need. While this caring instinct has been socially modified and conditioned in some parts of the world where individualistic tendencies run rife, some communal-oriented cultures give room for a freer expression of the instinct of care. The instinct of care may, however, be counterproductive in the context of PHDs. For instance, during pandemic influenza, sick and dying patients remain active carriers of infection, 190 as such, will infect susceptible friends and relations who feel obligated to show care in relation to helping them. In other words, ""unbridled"" caring may increase the vulnerabilities elicited during pandemic influenza.

It is important for hospital infection prevention programs to recognize that if face protection supplies are not available at every bedspace or room, a substantial proportion of providers may choose to omit using face protection in situations in which it is indicated. 4, 5 In addition, our survey revealed that face protection was perceived by many providers as unnecessary, despite our inclusion of education about standard precautions as part of our hospital's required annual computer-based training for all clinicians.",10.446636314157654,6.623416457809412

People would flee the area by way of bribes because of food shortages or psychological isolation. As the virus has spread unchecked across West Africa, other untraceable emigrants may carry it inside their bodies as they cross borders. Therefore, the WHO recommends that ''response activities must be adapted in areas of very intense transmission and particular attention must be given to stopping transmission in capital cities, thereby facilitating the larger response and relief effort. If non-essential movement in and out of a containment area is stopped, ensure that essential movement (e.g. for response providers, essential services) continues unhindered.

In a remarkable study, the breadth of immune responses to the HCV proteome was addressed in a number of HCV-infected patients by enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT) analyses of their T cells stimulated against HCV-encoded peptides. Most patients presented with a broadly reactive response with signals seen among a large number of the HCV peptides. Two patients, however, had an extremely focused response against a peptide spanning the HCV and IAV cross-reactive epitopes.

For care coordination, numerous synonyms have been used, e.g., collaborative care, integrated care, shared care or cooperation, with a common underlying understanding that the term describes the continuity and totality of care for a given patient provided by different providers in concert. In 2007, MacDonald et al. identified more than 40 definitions of care coordination [1] . Since most of them were less than satisfactory, the authors created a new one: ""Care coordination is the deliberate organization of patient care activities between two or more participants (including the patient) involved in a patient's care to facilitate the appropriate delivery of health care services"". Care coordination is thus the patient-centered organization of care that providers including patient caregivers should share in order to improve the quality of a patient's management and ultimately the patient's health. Because of the fragmentation of services, effective communication among providers is crucial. A key success factor to care coordination is sharing of the same holistic view of a patient's condition by all actors, including the patient's active diseases and current treatments, and the planned care pathway that establishes the role of each provider and his/her interventions. Unfortunately, transitions from one setting or provider to another still frequently lack clear communication and coordination resulting in increase of health care costs and reduced quality of care including polypharmacy and adverse drug interactions, duplication of services, unnecessary Emergency Department utilization, high hospital readmissions rates, and in the worst case patient injury. Many patients or their caregivers already serve as care coordinators, filling information gaps between providers, addressing conflicting instructions, and managing redundant orders and medications during care transitions.",13.897169238847537,9.225351186874224

When a patient is diagnosed with a highly infectious disease such as SARS, emergency medical planners may need to decide whom they should quarantine after analyzing the patient's history spanning the entire incubation period (e.g. approximately 10 days for the case of SARS). The information extraction phase can be carried out by a medical practitioner to record patient's name, identification number (or Passport number), address, family members, colleagues or classmates, friends, workplace address, and activities happened during the last 10 days. The extracted information is then structured into a set of events which include four primary attributes: (1) duration, (2) persons contacted during that period, (3) location visited (e.g. enclosed spaces such as offices, air planes, etc.), and (4) food taken. A snapshot of information extraction menus designed for the SARS infectious disease for entering visiting activities is depicted in Figure 2 .

Dozens of databases and Internet resources are available on the internet providing various types of information for the last decades. Development of an inclusive database with information about classification, activity, and ready to dock library of medicinal plant compounds is essential for drug designing using resources of medicinal plants (Mumtaz et al., 2017) . If one particular database could not provide a complete picture of a medicinal plant, data mining and sharing from different resources may be utilized. Such items need unique identification number for a particular plant or a particular entity. These databases are required to provide phytochemical and pharmacological information on medicinal plants. Number of medicinal plant databases increases year by year with specialized or comprehensive information giving opportunity for the study of plants and the utilization of traditional knowledge. For instance, development of Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking curated information and enabled sharing of raw, processed, or identified tandem mass spectrometry data (Wang et al., 2016) . Another example of curating specialized data are plant protein interaction data, such as IntAct, The Arabidopsis Information Resource and BioGRID, etc. (Lee et al., 2010) . Data curated on medicinal plant databases need to be comprehensive as far as possible to serve as important resources for drug discovery studies. Aggregation of these data allows researchers to visualization, data mining, and further analysis to produce new insights. Aggregations would be unachievable if the data are dispersed within largely inaccessible formats (Rodriguez et al., 2009) . Challenges encountered during aggregating data arising from different formats can be mitigated by ontological linking as well as introduction of noSQL data model (Ningthoujam et al., 2014) .

The absence of genuine engagement of civil society groups, including the media and the scientific communities, and the expectations and pressures from higher-level authorities, often results in a results-oriented policy implementation, such that local officials tend to manipulate nonscientific and arbitrary results to satisfy their superiors perfunctorily [40]. In this view, ensuring the accuracy of reported disease information should be a high priority in the future development of HIV surveillance in China.",11.809583857773514,8.582738419663478

For example, the Cryptophyta clade with a library size of 2 MB produces 3.8 million of k-mers 9 . We reduce space occupancy by not storing character strings, but a single unsigned 64 bit integer that holds multiple k-mers sharing the same prefix and location index. For quickly accessing k-mer positions, we use bit vectors in the length of the reference sequences.

In the era of globalization and information, actively reflecting on China's response and teaching strategies amid the COVID-19 pandemic is of great significance to facilitate the in-depth development of medical science and medical education, deepen the teaching concept of ""student-centered"" and ""competency-oriented"" medical education, as well as explore teaching approaches to advance the medical education. More importantly, with the wide spread of COVID-19, China's experience in online higher medical education may serve as a reference to other countries during the pandemic.",4.985687114848764,2.1256513847101974
