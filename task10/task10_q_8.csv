Geographic information systems (GIS) offer a means to visualize, analyze and understand the distribution of infectious diseases over space and time, thereby revealing spatiotemporal trends, patterns and associations between the pathological factors and the geographic environments of the disease [26, 27] . Exploiting the analytical, modelling and simulation features of GIS has improved epidemiological outbreak investigation and response, in which recognizing the spatial spread and transmission dynamics of an emerging infectious disease is essential for advising on efficient disease control and prevention measures [28] . However, since the first reported case of MERS-CoV in 2012, there has been a paucity of studies addressing the spatial dimension of the distribution of this disease. With the use of ecological modelling in a GIS environment [29], a preliminary transmission risk map of MERS-CoV was produced across the Middle East by analyzing the spatial distribution of MERS-CoV cases and environmental transmission risk factors (bioclimatic variables). This suggests that the transmission route of the disease via camel exposure plays a major role. However, the effects of environmental risk factors on disease transmission were not explicitly determined. A geo-additive regression model was also utilized to examine the risk factor levels of individuals for MERS-CoV mortality in the Arabian Peninsula between 2012 and 2015 [30], and significant spatial variation and clustering with a lower risk were found in Riyadh, Arar, Aljouf and Jizan, whereas a higher risk was observed in Qassim province. However, the spatial analysis lacked detail at the governorate and city levels. The application of an iterative empirical process in a GIS environment revealed that high-camel-density areas, camel convergence points (camel markets, barns, breeding sites and slaughterhouses), former MERS-CoV cases and high seroprevalence rates were the potential risk factors for spatial MERS-CoV hotspots in Kenya [31].

The high-risk areas determined by the CRF index corresponded well to the provinces where a high number of autochthonous cases were reported during the outbreak in Japan. The CRF index was further estimated at a 5 km by 5 km resolution in order to identify high-risk areas for future dengue outbreaks in Japan and South Korea. In both countries, dengue fever has not been prevalent. However, the recent dengue outbreak in Japan may signal that the two adjacent non-dengue-endemic countries might also be exposed to the risk of temporal and sporadic behavior of dengue fever. Because the disease has not been widely known in both countries, it is particularly challenging to raise the awareness of the general public and among health officials, and to prepare for potential outbreaks. For example, in South Korea there was an outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2015 but, although the healthcare infrastructure was wellestablished in the country, not many people were aware of the disease. Furthermore, the outbreak of the disease, Fig. 2 The CRF index and dengue cases over time in Tokyo, Japan which originated from a Middle-Eastern country, was completely unexpected. Late diagnosis, quarantine failure of super spreaders, and poor communication by the government resulted in the failure to control the disease spread during the early phase of the disease introduction, and this put the entire society in a chaotic situation, affecting the regular routines of the general public [25] . This clearly indicates that understanding the potential risks and geographical variation of a disease are critical to minimizing the detrimental impacts of an outbreak.

In the agent-based model, the risk attitude assignment is done by way of a risk-attitude distribution for each agent population that randomly assigns one of the four categories to each agent. The relative proportion of each risk attitude category in the distribution is set by the user. In this way, it is possible to create agent populations with different risk attitude characteristics. Concretely, we used this feature in our study to create scenarios where we varied the relative proportions of risk tolerant, risk neutral, risk opportunist and risk averse agents in the population of producers and tested the effect of risk attitude shifts in the disease incidence outcome.",20.045742944199443,8.769834985694795

As children enter adolescence, the typical adult-type disease begins to manifest, with apical cavities and parenchymal breakdown, reflecting pathology largely caused by the host immune response. Although some societal and behavioral elements may influence these age-related changes in risk of disease progression and resulting disease phenotype, it is likely that to a large extent these result from age-related changes in the host immune system.

With the recent report suggesting that HEV originated in Asia, most likely from a human ancestor that existed ∼4500-6800 years ago and that the split of camel-infecting genotypes occurred during camel domestication, HEV circulation between camels and Bedouins could be expected [38] . The high HEV seropositivity rate observed in non-Bedouin Arabs, most of whom live in Northern parts of Israel, could be attributed to exposure to HEV-3 which is possibly circulating in the country and was recently identified in local sewage facilities mainly in the north of Israel [39] . As both Judaism and Islam forbid the consumption of pork, we find it unlikely that this is the main risk for the identified HEV seroprevalence in the Muslim population. The low HEV seroprevalence observed in Israeli-born Jews may be associated with the overall higher socio-economic status characterising this population, living in better sanitary conditions than the Bedouins and most of the non-Bedouin Arabs, rendering HEV infection less conceivable. The variability observed between different population groups and in different studies, may be explained by exposure to potential risk factors associated with HEV infection as lifestyle habits (dietary), environmental conditions, geographic location, occupation, religion (as the prohibition of consuming pork among Jews and Islam) but also to co-morbidities. Differences may also be explained by the assays used for antibodies detection, demonstrating wide variation in the ability to detect HEV antibodies (sensitivity and specificity) [40] .",19.959677736562956,8.992368873169882

Evidence suggests that human exposure and infections with hepatitis E virus (HEV) genotypes (GT) 3 and 4 results from zoonotic transmission. Hypothesising that HEV GT3 and GT4 are circulating in the Vietnamese pig population and can be transmitted to humans, we aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of HEV exposure in a population of farmers and the general population. We additionally performed sequence analysis of HEV in pig populations in the same region to address knowledge gaps regarding HEV circulation and to evaluate if pigs were a potential source of HEV exposure. We found a high prevalence of HEV GT3 viral RNA in pigs (19.1% in faecal samples and 8.2% in rectal swabs) and a high HEV seroprevalence in pig farmers (16.0%) and a hospital-attending population (31.7%) in southern Vietnam. The hospital population was recruited as a general-population proxy even though this particular population subgroup may introduce bias. The detection of HEV RNA in pigs indicates that HEV may be a zoonotic disease risk in this location, although a larger sample size is required to infer an association between HEV positivity in pigs and seroprevalence in humans.",21.660008232138146,10.667124714572783

In particular, despite HEV GT3 being a zoonotic infection, a higher seroprevalence was not found in adult farmers than in other adults. This suggests that additional HEV risk factors need to be identified and evaluated. Confounders associated with the high HEV seroprevalence detected in both farmers and the hospital-attending population may be due to other risk factors rather than just direct contact with pigs. One potential risk factor might be consumption of internal pig organs, which is common in Vietnam. Other risk factors associated with high seroprevalence in human may be due to household flooding, drinking contaminated water or poor household hygiene. Future population-based studies, using random controls chosen by geographic area, should be performed to confirm or contradict these results.

At the population level, on the other hand, disease progression proceeds as if the infectiousness of the disease effectively changes, as a result of the network dynamics. Hence, analyzing an adaptive network scenario at a population level can be achieved via a correction on the transmission probability, keeping the mathematically more attractive wellmixed scenario.

Hepatitis C virus belongs to family Flaviviridae, genus Hepacivirus, species Hepatitis C virus Incidence rates in the chronic disease population have decreased, averaging 0.7 to 3 percent per year [30] . Recognition of hepatitis C in patients with chronic renal failure may be confounded by the limited sensitivity of serologic diagnosis in this population. All hepatitis C seronegative transplant candidates who have abnormal transaminases and/or risk factors for hepatitis C should undergo nucleic acid testing. Because of the increased risk of progressive liver disease following transplantation, patients with hepatitis C should undergo liver biopsy to exclude advanced liver disease, which in some cases may necessitate a combined liver-kidney transplant [128] . Hepatitis-C-positive patients usually have a marked rise in viral load with initiation of immunosuppression immediately after transplant. Chronic immunosuppression used in transplant recipients also leads to higher circulating levels of virus and intrahepatic virus due to the decreased T-cell response to the NS3 region of hepatitis C virus [30] . Consequently patients with hepatitis C are at increased risk for progressive liver disease and the development of cirrhosis following transplantation.",19.03399434321402,11.816461602068419

The highly mobile population moves frequently and is dispersed evenly over all patches. The mixing commuter populations are distributed between their residential patches and a common destination patch. Increasing the ratio transforms mixing commuters into highly mobile individuals, who disperse widely. This change intensifies transmission in the common destination patch, and to a small extent in the residential patch, because there are fewer people there at any given time. Conversely, it dilutes transmission in the other destination patches, those visited by the non-mixing commuter population, because there are more people there at any given time. Highly mobile individuals also disperse the infection risk, synchronising the epidemic trajectories in different population groups. The mosquito populations in patches in which transmission is intense because the vector-host ratio is high act as reservoirs and hubs of infection maintained and disseminated by the highly mobile group. In our model, the size of the mosquito population is the same in all patches. Consequently, the residential patches do not function as infection reservoirs because there are many people there at any given time and dilution is strong. Clearly the vector-host ratios could be adjusted non-uniformly to make the transmission intensity highest in the residential patches, or any other patch. A comprehensive analysis of the resultant plethora of combinations of host, mosquito and spatial heterogeneities would be laborious. However, we anticipate that non-uniform mosquito populations would change the way in which the epidemics in different population groups or patches are related, but not produce any fundamental new insights with regards the relation between dilution, connectivity and epidemic control.",20.27275914274705,10.80248253755836

Not all visitors pose equal risk, and focus could be on hygiene measures related to visitors in direct contact with animals and especially if they are livestock owners. New legislation coming into force in Sweden in September 2013 establishes the famers' responsibility for biosecurity related to farm visits [23] . As part of implementing the new rules, these results provide important information when communicating the risk of disease transmission through visitors to farmers. Further, the findings are relevant for strategies on how to come into contact with visitors in case of a disease outbreak. The study has identified that the number of people that would need to be reached can be very high and that many of them may not be part of the farming community, i.e. they will probably not be reached through the farmers' press or information sent to farmers. From the results, the importance of asking the farmer at an early stage of contact tracing if they have many visitors e.g. due to hosting fields trips or having construction workers or repairmen at the farm, has been highlighted. Another important finding is the proportion of visitors of different categories that was reported to be in direct contact with the animals or to enter the stable. These findings also need to be seen in light of previous findings, where use of protective clothing was examined [7] . For example, salesmen and repairmen were reported to have poor use of protective clothing, and many farmers did not require such usage, whereas this study found that that one fourth of the salesmen entered the stables and almost nine percent of the repairmen were in direct contact with animals. Many visitors within these categories of professionals may not have an education related to animal husbandry and there is a risk that they do not realise their potential role in spreading disease. These results should be considered in the design of preventive biosecurity programmes or information campaigns during disease outbreaks where it is important not to forget this category of visitors. There is a need to communicate, both to the farmer and to the visitors, the risk of disease spread through indirect contact.

To assess univariate associations of S. suis with potential risk factors in hospital controls, we used both logistic regression without any adjustment for covariates and with adjustment for sex, age, and living in a rural or urban area. We used conditional logistic regression for the matched community controls and these analyses were performed with and without additional adjustment for sex (in addition to the matched variables age and place of living). In a multivariate analysis of potential risk factors of main interest, all potential risk factors plus the potential confounders (e.g. age, sex, place of living) were jointly included in a logistic (hospital controls) or conditional logistic (community controls) regression model. No model selection such as backwards elimination was performed. We included separate effects of exposure to pigs or pork depending on whether the individual had skin injuries or not. S. suis infection occurred predominantly in males but controls were not matched by gender. As a sensitivity analysis, we therefore repeated the multivariate analysis including only male cases and controls.

Also regional differences in biosecurity and management routines in relation to farming styles can be assumed.

To quantify the relative impact of potential risk factors for a herd to be detected as BCV or BRSV-infected (e.g. trade intensity, density of dairy herds, herd size, biosecurity measures, type and number of visitors), studies could be conducted by comparing herd characteristics and management practices in the low and high-risk areas identified.

Better-informed public and media debate about bats and bat-related disease will markedly improve understanding in many groups and so facilitate communication. Broader 'one health' lessons and approaches will aid international science and policy communities, and methodologies for a new holistic paradigm could produce a lessonlearning manual for research teams and agencies engaged in interdisciplinary environment and health challenges.

Also, some of the studies assessed in this review seem to overestimate the potential risk of geese (e.g. [5] ), compared to our conclusions, and to regard them as a 'source', rather than possible links in a transmission chain or a circle. Other authors have found that when exploring ecosystems and looking into global health risks, e.g. avian influenza, in relation to industrial scale animal production, there is a tendency to overrate the importance of wildlife. [168] Nevertheless, the wildlife-livestock interface in disease ecology must not be neglected and warrants continued attention, which is exemplified by the recent incursion of HPAIV H5N8 and reassortant viruses in North America. [63] Our present synthesis demonstrates that swans and geese can be colonized/infected by a number of microorganisms that can cause disease in humans and/or domestic animals, although for some of these microbes there are uncertainties about their host-specificity. However, there is very little evidence of such transmission actually taking place, and we therefore argue that although there are potential risks, these are often exaggerated in line with the precautionary principle.

In general, most plasmids remain at the site of injection (for a review see [12] ) for, in certain cases, up to several months [13] . Shortly after injection, small amounts of plasmids spread throughout the body and are detected in remote organs [14] . DNA vaccination involves the introduction of small amounts of plasmid DNA into the nucleus of host cells. It is then conceivable that there is a potential risk of partial or complete integration of plasmid DNA into the host cell genome. Therefore, this potential risk should be examined carefully. Furthermore, it is also conceivable that for techniques allowing an entrance increase of the plasmids in the cells, as it is the case for electroporation, these potential risks should be even more deeply taken into consideration. Usually, plasmids are quantified in the injected tissue samples by PCR-based methods (as, e.g., in [15] ). It is admitted that if there are no plasmids detected, plasmid integration event may not have occurred.

However, the detection of transmission events is based on limited evidence [1] , and detection of specific pathogen clusters is generally subjective in nature [2] . Furthermore, even well-established infection prevention strategies can be often disregarded [3] at various levels. Overall, these factors may lead to the transmission of pathogens within the hospital, a missed opportunity to investigate a disease cluster, or false ascertainment of a cluster resulting in the misuse of hospital resources for investigational purposes [2] . Statistical methods, such as the scan statistic, may enhance the identification of disease clusters and/or outbreaks in the hospital setting [2, 4] .

First, the exclusion of patients from one sentinel hospital contributed to the relatively small sample size which may have limited the ability to detect potential risk factors of mortality, such as cardiovascular, renal, and neurological disease which have been shown by others to contribute to poor survival of patients with influenza and pneumonia in this population [28] . Second, exclusion of bacterial culture results and admitting chest x-ray findings prevented assessment of factors such as chest x-ray abnormalities and bacterial co-infections as risk factors for mortality. Third, the SARI patients included in this analysis may not be representative of the population of Southern Arizona where an estimated 22 million people crossed the northbound Arizona border in 2014 alone [11, 29] . Since sentinel sites in closer proximity to the U.S.-Mexico border were not included, the results of this analysis may not represent the burden of disease in the highly mobile border population. By limiting surveillance to large referral hospitals, we suspect there may be bias for certain risk groups, such as adults ≥ 65 years old, and more severe cases presenting later in the course of illness. The high frequency of ICU admission in our patients supports this hypothesis. Additionally, the sentinel sites used for this analysis are not major providers of pediatric care in Southern Arizona so a similar pediatric SARI mortality estimate remains unavailable in this population.

Outside of the Middle East, these studies need to be undertaken, especially outside of the Arabian Peninsula and in African countries where MERS-CoV has been detected and/or isolated in dromedaries. Outside of the Arabian Peninsula, a number of joint human/camel serological studies are currently underway in North Africa (Pasteur Institut, Pers Comm) and planned in sub-Saharan African countries (HKU and Cirad, Pers Comm). Middle East and Africa is likely to explain some of the differences in potential infection risk. For that purpose, ""ecological studies"" could help to explore diverse drivers of transmission among different environments and societies. However, studies based on aggregated data are prone to many biases (58) making it difficult to know if individuals have really been exposed to the risk factor in question. Furthermore, social sciences have to be enlisted in order to puzzle out the relationships between camels and humans. Outputs can serve for epidemiological studies and modeling (e.g., multi-agents systems, see hereunder). Additionally, improved surveillance systems in humans and animals in rural and nomadic areas are required for MERS-CoV considering possible changes of the public health situation due to virus evolution (e.g., toward more pathogenic strains or diffusion of strains from areas with human disease, etc.) over time, modification of camel husbandry, etc. For population-based studies, epidemiology and surveillance, we need to have speciesadapted and validated serological tools.

Bat exposures conducive to potential lyssavirus transmission were also common in this population and were reported by members of all four activity groups, supporting more than just a theoretical risk for these types of incidents. We found that guano miners reported the highest frequency of transdermal bat exposures, were the least knowledgeable about rabies, and were the least likely to say they would respond to bat exposures in a manner that would ensure rabies prevention. Based on these findings we conclude that of the groups we surveyed, bat rabies has the greatest potential impact on guano miners. The potential risk associated with guano mining is even more stark given that moribund bats (i.e., those most likely to be rabid) normally fall to the floor of caves, where they can readily come in contact with someone collecting bat droppings by hand.

In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), one study found a significant association of the R47H variant and ALS risk, as well as an inverse correlation between TREM2 levels in the spinal cord and survival in ALS patients [64] , though this was not replicated by others [40] . The TREM2 R47H variant has also been reported to be associated with increased risk of Parkinson's disease [39] by some [40, 65, 66] but not all studies [6, 42, 67] . In order to understand these differences, Lill and colleagues [42] divided their groups by ethnicity and found that the odds ratio of the R47H variant was significantly higher in their Northern European population compared to non-Northern Europeans. Others identified another Parkinson's disease (PD)-associated SNP 5 kb upstream of TREM2 [66] , though its effect on TREM2 expression is not known. The TREM2 R47H variant has also been investigated as a risk factor for posterior cortical atrophy [68] , multiple system atrophy [69] , essential tremor [70] , multiple sclerosis [71] and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) [41] , though these studies were not conclusive. One family has been identified in which a mutation in TREM2 is thought to result in progressive non-fluent aphasia [72] , though other cases will be necessary to confirm this association. So far, evidence suggests that TREM2 variants are not significantly associated with dementia with Lewy Bodies [73] , ischemic stroke [40] or progressive supranuclear palsy [40] . Because many of these diseases share overlapping clinical features with AD and FTD, it will be important to validate any associations of TREM2 with other NDDs in neuropathologically confirmed cases. Overall, the association of TREM2 variants with these other NDDs is less clear, and future studies with large sample sizes in diverse but well-matched populations will be required to definitively establish whether TREM2 variants confer risk for NDDs other than PLOSL, FTD and AD.

Next, populations were merged using a network-based approach. Populations were treated as nodes and two nodes were connected if their genetic distance was under a cutoff value. Populations were grouped in an iterative manner. In each iteration, all maximal cliques (i.e., subsets of nodes that are fully connected to each other) in the network were identified. Maximal cliques represent groups of populations in which all populations have similar allele compositions to each other. Then, mean genetic distance within each clique was calculated. The clique with the lowest average distance was selected and its populations were grouped together. Then, this clique was deleted from the network. Iterations were repeated until no maximal cliques remained in the network. Grouping of populations was carried out using different distance value cutoffs (1st, 5th, 10th, and 15th rank percentile of all distance values).

To correct for these factors that vary at the individual patient level some high-income countries employ sophisticated adjustment approaches. A number of hospital mortality measures are used in high-income countries and are recommended by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and national governments as part of portfolios of quality indicators and there is little doubt such measures (and the debate around them) have directed nations' attention to improving quality and outcomes.

Approximately 19% of people working in health services were infected by their patients. These professionals were able to obtain rapid treatment, which means that it was unlikely that they would contribute to SARS spread outside their areas of residence. Housewives and retired people are groups that were extremely susceptible to infection by their families. However, these population groups typically have no desire to move to distant places. The most probable suspects for disease spread were labourers and businessmen, but these groups constituted only ∼7% of total infection cases. The randomness of SARS spread among various cities is a characteristic that has been explained via the theory of super spreaders. The starting point of this theory is that the SARS virus always evolves and mutates. Most virus strings evolve slowly with similar infectivity, but a small fraction evolve into extremely infective virus types. People affected by such virus strings are so-called super spreaders. These individuals were comparatively very contagious, and they transmitted the virus to dozens of other people. For instance, five super spreaders in Singapore were found to have infected 103 people [28, 29] . The randomness of virus mutation to high infectivity indicates considerable randomness in the way people became infected. This randomness also extended to the relatively random directions in which the epidemic spread among cities.",20.666696080565433,10.112468174248926

Since the evolutionary and ecological dynamics of rapidly evolving pathogens occur on approximately the same time-scale, they must be studied conjointly to be properly understood. During the course of a single outbreak or epidemic season, mutations are generated de novo and can spread through an infectious disease population, creating a reciprocal link between the polymorphisms carried by a particular pathogenic organism and its propensity for onward transmission in a heterogeneous host population. The term 'phylodynamic' is often used to describe studies that aim to characterize the joint evolutionary and epidemiology behaviour of infectious diseases, particularly those that incorporate tools from the field of phylogenetics [1] . The term originated from-and is most commonly associated with-studies of RNA viruses, whose mutation rates can be more than one million times faster than their metazoan hosts [2] . However, in the last few years, it has become increasingly clear that the same perspective can be applied readily to other groups of pathogens with lower rates of mutation, including DNA viruses [3, 4] and some bacteria [5, 6] .",17.47115466824334,9.347247312872671

Alternatively, an overreaction to the threat of an EID can overwhelm public health systems and resources, divert resources from effective disease control activities, and lead to severe economic losses in areas affected by the disease.

Several factors, such as nutrition of lactating and dry cows, vaccinations of lactating and dry cows, length of dry periods, cleanliness of the calving environment and disease status of the dams, will ultimately affect disease resistance and health of replacements. It is important to note, however, that cows that are overfed tend to have difficulty calving because of being excessively over conditioned. Cows that are underfed, which results in mineral or vitamin deficiencies or lack of body condition, may produce inferior and low-volume colostrum. They also may experience difficulty calving. Protein deficiency in cows during the dry period may lead to low birth weights, low metabolic rates and poor vigor of calves, resulting in poor survivability. Some research also indicates that inadequate protein and energy nutrition of the dam results in poor absorption of immunoglobulins from colostrum by the calf. Cows that lose condition during the dry period are also at greater risk of experiencing calving difficulty. Calves that experience difficult births require more time before being able to stand, experience an increase in the time to voluntary suckling and have a decreased ability to absorb immunoglobulins. All these problems result in decreased transfer of passive immunity from the dam to the calf and increased risk of disease in calves.

Pandemic communication need to contain clear, comprehensible information about the pandemic offered through trusted, commonly accessed media channels, such as national and local TV networks. Customizing messages about risk to one's intended audience and communicating these messages to them via appropriate information channels are instrumental to running an effective communication campaign. 38 -44 It is notable that minority participants had both lower awareness of and less correct knowledge about MERS and that individuals with lower education and lower income were less likely to have an awareness of any pandemic, indicating the presence of communication inequalities in pandemic awareness among these subgroups. More research is needed on the awareness and knowledge of future pandemics in a diverse low SEP sample to best understand the impact of communication inequalities and how to address them through targeted campaigns. The current findings indicate a need to pay attention to segments that may not be actively seeking out information and to deliver it via channels that they use. Given the fact that few people reported that they had first learned about MERS through social media, our data suggested that national media such as TV are still important and social media, at least in times of pandemics, appear to be less effective.

Thus, only three studies asked their respondents to also rate other disease risks or to make direct comparisons between risk of SARS and other risks [37, 44, 53] . Such comparisons could provide important insights, as the motivational potential of risk perceptions in case of an outbreak depends not only on their absolute but also their relative strength when compared to other health concerns. Relative importance of pandemic influenza risk, however, also relates to other types of risk which might be involved in a pandemic influenza hazard such as, for instance, social risks. Especially studies looking at health care workers did assess not only personal health risks but also the perceived risk of spreading the disease to family and friends and/or issues of stigmatization and social isolation [32-34, 37, 54, 55] . While in the reviewed studies stigmatization and social isolation were mostly assessed in terms of actual experience, it is plausible to assume that anticipations of such processes (""social risk cognitions"") are relevant for shaping the sum of pandemic influenza risk connotations and thereby influences behavioral responses. Above and beyond risk to one's personal health, anticipations of being responsible for spreading the virus to loved ones or being socially excluded because of one's job might detract considerably from readiness to accept risk and might interfere with professional behavior in health care workers. This issue was also explicitly reflected in the concept of risk acceptance, which was brought up by a few studies [33-36, 37, 54, 55] . How professional groups who have a key role within containment plans balance personal and social risk expectations with their professional roles, how they weigh the risk of getting infected and in turn infecting others against the risk of jeopardizing their professional identity, is a concern which needs to be faced and dealt with in the course of effective intervention planning. Otherwise, a sudden lack of readiness of professionals will disrupt care for those who have already become patients or get in the way of public health containment measures and endanger collective protective action.",15.575610102891766,8.999206892239993

Implementation of precautionary behaviour is largely dependent on effective risk communication, i.e. communication that induces realistic risk perceptions, correct knowledge and skills to promote and enable precautionary practices. Scientific knowledge about these topics in the area of infectious disease control is scarce. Neither is there knowledge if the theories and measures developed for risk perception research on, for example chronic diseases, can be applied in the area of infectious diseases. However, such knowledge is vital for effective control of newly emerging infectious diseases, because our ability to promote health protective behavioural change depends on our knowledge of important determinants of such behaviour [15] . For people to voluntarily engage in precautionary actions, they first of all need to be aware of the risk. Risk perception is a central feature in many health behaviour theories. According to the Protection Motivation Theory, for example [16] , protection motivation is the result of the threat appraisal and coping appraisal. Threat appraisal consists of estimates of the chance of contracting a disease (perceived vulnerability or susceptibility) and estimates of seriousness of a disease (perceived severity).",17.138771556465105,10.748794122464355

For example, selecting against high susceptibility would not only increase the average disease resistance in future generations, but also decrease the proportion of highly susceptible individuals in the frequency distribution for susceptibility. On the basis of our predictions, the associated changes in the shape of the distribution would decrease the future risk of disease establishment and disease severity much more than would be anticipated from classical quantitative genetics theory alone, which does not account for changes in the distributions' shapes. Finally, the results of our study elucidate that the choice of the most appropriate selection strategy would depend on the parent and offspring environment. For example, whereas our results suggest that selection against high susceptibility would be the most efficient means to reduce disease risk and prevalence in environments with low contamination risk, selection for fast recovery would be advantageous if the contamination risk is high. Given thus the results from this study, among the next steps to be taken in the genetic control of infectious disease are a more accurate description of genetic heterogeneity among individuals and the development of statistical methods to account for different types and shapes of genetic variation in the analysis of disease data and in genetic-epidemiological models.",16.610563019767,10.335553972869224

For example, assuming a finite locus model for genetic variation, with one locus controlling the transmission coefficient (representing host susceptibility to infection) and another locus controlling the recovery rate, Nath et al. (2008) found that genetic variation in the transmission coefficient resulted in higher probabilities of disease emergence, whereas variation in the recovery rate had no such impact. Defining host variation also by few (i.e., two) distinct homogeneous subgroups, Yates et al. (2006) have further shown that variation in host infectivity can greatly reduce the probability of disease emergence. Our model predicts similar trends if host susceptibility, recovery, or infectivity are controlled by multiple loci. However, in contrast to the results of Nath et al. (2008) and our results, Yates et al. (2006) predict that variation in susceptibility will not increase the risk of disease establishment, in particular when bacterial decay is fast. A likely cause for this discrepancy is that Yates et al. (2006) simulated heterogeneous populations by assigning 100 times higher susceptibility to 10% of the individuals than to the rest of the population, thus approximating a negatively skewed distribution in susceptibility rather than the positively skewed distributions considered here. Combining the results of both studies would thus suggest that compared to homogeneous populations with the same average susceptibility, heterogeneous populations with a large proportion of highly susceptible individuals have a higher risk of disease emergence, but the emergence risk will not decrease if the majority of individuals are resistant.",18.485797080590785,9.940508371212145

As for variation in susceptibility (T S ), the influence is substantially stronger for low a and becomes negligible for high values of a (Figure 2 , C-F). However, in contrast to what is observed for host variation in susceptibility, variation in host infectivity (T D or k D ) can substantially affect the risk of disease establishment in all environments. For example, for T B ¼ 12 days, the probability of disease persistence for $3 years decreases from 0.86 for homogeneous populations to 0.46 and 0.45, for variation in T D and k D with a ¼ 0.25, respectively (Figure 2, C and E). For T B ¼ 1.5 days, the risk of footrot persistence in populations with the same degree of variation in T D and k D , respectively, decreases from 0.31 to 0.08 (Figure 2 , D and F) and becomes virtually zero for T B ¼ 1 day (i.e., disease persisted in ,5 of 10,000 replicates; results not shown). There is little difference between the probabilities of disease establishment associated with host variation in T D or k D (Figure 2 , C-F). Variation in other epidemiological parameters (T L , T C , k C , and T R ; Table 1) was, however, found to have little effect on the risk of disease establishment, regardless of the shape of variation and of the simulated environmental conditions. Impact of variation on disease prevalence over time Figure 3 shows the predicted influence of host variation on footrot prevalence over time in populations avoiding stochastic disease extinction. Average prevalence profiles, and the impact of host variation on them, depend strongly on bacterial survival rates. If bacteria survive in the soil for a long time, average footrot prevalence rapidly increases toward its peak within a few weeks after the introduction of the infection into the population, after which it gradually declines toward an endemic equilibrium (Figure 3 , A, C, E, and G). In contrast, when bacteria decay fast, prevalence in populations in which footrot could establish generally increases gradually toward an endemic equilibrium with a lower average proportion of animals infected than for slow bacterial decay ( Figure 3B shows the trend toward the equilibrium).",17.182286217014365,9.88569567995283

Epidemiology is essentially a science that assesses patterns of disease occurrence in human populations and the factors that influence these patterns (Lilienfeld and Stolley, 1994) ; the field of neuroepidemiology is simply the application of these epidemiologic principles to neurologic disorders. Epidemiologists are primarily interested in the occurrence of diseases as categorized by time, place, and person. Epidemiology attempts to determine whether there has been an increase or a decrease of disease over time, whether one geographic area Risk factors are attributes of the agent, host, and environment that increase the risk of a disease. Protective factors are attributes of the agent, host, and environment that decrease risk of the disease. Assessment of risk and protective factors involves the comparison of frequency of disease in a group exposed to those factors with disease frequency in the unexposed group. The relative risk (RR) is the ratio of risk of disease among persons in an exposed population to that in an unexposed population. RRs best reflect the effect of an exposure of interest when the groups being compared are similar in all variables being evaluated that might alter the RR except for the exposure of interest or when the RRs are adjusted to account for the known differences in these variables. An RR of 1.0 indicates identical risk in the compared groups; an RR greater than 1.0 indicates that those with the exposure have a higher risk than those without, and an RR less than 1.0 indicates the opposite -that those with the exposure have a lower risk than those without. It is important to differentiate the RR from the attributable risk (AR) -the absolute amount of risk directly due to exposure. AR is estimated from the difference between the risk of developing a disease in the exposed and unexposed groups. An AR of zero means that there is no difference in risk of disease between the exposed and unexposed groups.",35.907830534933936,15.274170472716913

Levels of immunization coverage required for herd immunity can vary for different disease organisms, but in the case of measles it requires over 95 percent immunization coverage over a long period of time by an adequate two-dose policy, with monitoring, funding, and quality assurance for immunization programs. Adequacy means coverage of the population at risk of the disease as groups with inadequate vaccination become unexpectedly vulnerable as, for example, in recent importation and spread of measles and mumps in the Americas where these diseases had previously been considered eliminated. New challenges emerge requiring increasing vaccination coverage including tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, and influenza for pregnant women, and their family members and care givers to protect newborns who are vulnerable until their immunization can be completed. Herd immunity (i.e., immunity by vaccination among a high percentage of a population sufficient to reduce the risk of transmission by isolated cases which varies for different diseases) must be achieved and maintained to reduce the potential for transmission of a disease to vulnerable people such as people with immune deficiency due to infection with HIV, cancer chemotherapy, or immunodeficiency diseases.

Protective factors are attributes of the agent, host, and environment that decrease risk of the disease. Assessment of risk and protective factors involves the comparison of frequency of disease in a group exposed to those factors with disease frequency in the unexposed group. The relative risk (RR) is the ratio of risk of disease among persons in an exposed population to that in an unexposed population. RRs best reflect the effect of an exposure of interest when the groups being compared are similar in all variables being evaluated that might alter the RR except for the exposure of interest or when the RRs are adjusted to account for the known differences in these variables. An RR of 1.0 indicates identical risk in the compared groups; an RR greater than 1.0 indicates that those with the exposure have a higher risk than those without, and an RR less than 1.0 indicates the oppositethat those with the exposure have a lower risk than those without. It is important to differentiate the RR from the attributable risk (AR) -the absolute amount of risk directly due to exposure. AR is estimated from the difference between the risk of developing a disease in the exposed and unexposed groups. An AR of zero means that there is no difference in risk of disease between the exposed and unexposed groups. Pragmatically, in epidemiologic studies it is often useful to compare risk factors by looking at odds. The concept of odds is slightly different from that of risk, and is used when the total number of persons who may have been exposed to a situation or agent is not actually known, as is frequently the case in epidemiologic investigations. The odds of an event occurring is the probability that the event will occur divided by the probability that the event will not occur. Odds compare the number of ill persons known to be exposed to a particular factor to the number of non-ill persons known to be exposed to that factor:",37.11863234396453,17.379627881094677

It includes a wide range of animals, such as invertebrates, amphibians, insects, fi sh, reptiles, birds, and mammals, including as many as 500 species in sub-Saharan Africa (Ape Alliance 2006 ). Although research has focused largely on mammals and, to a lesser extent, birds, theoretically any wildlife species harvested for bushmeat could be a potential source of zoonotic disease that can spillover during the hunting, butchering, and preparation process (Wolfe et al. 2000 ; Karesh and Noble 2009 ) . Hunters face risk of injury from live animals, which might allow animal blood to enter the hunter's bloodstream through open wounds. While small animals can be carried in bags, large animals are commonly carried on the shoulder or back, bringing the hunter in close contact with the animal and facilitating transfer of body fl uids (LeBreton et al. 2006 ) . The highest risk of disease transmission occurs during the butchering of animals, e.g. skinning, opening of the body cavity, removal of organs, and cutting of meat. More people butcher than hunt animals (83 % and 42 %, respectively, LeBreton et al. 2006 ) and butchering involves the use of sharp tools, which may lead to cuts during the process. Subramanian ( 2012 ) found that 38 % of respondents cut themselves on a regular basis during butchering. Women are especially at risk of disease transmission as they engage more often in butchering and in food preparation than men. In discussing the links between bushmeat and disease, we refer to this all-encompassing suite of risky behaviors as ""bushmeat-related activities.""",16.539391133039448,9.394400235511103

The two different susceptible groups were considered as these are the major transmission pathways for Hep C, in developing countries such as Pakistan. Further in the absence of an effective vaccine against all known genotypes of hepatitis C formulating optimal quarantine strategies would provide insight to public health officials. Dynamical system techniques were used to analyze the model. We observed the following points 1. The disease-free equilibrium of the model is globally asymptotically stable whenever the basic reproduction number R c is less than unity; 2.

In severe case hospitalizations due to severe influenza, >64 age group presented the highest hospitalization rates (60.95/100,000) compared to other age groups, which highlights the need to increase vaccine coverage in this age group to prevent mortality. 12 The delay in the administration of antiviral drugs, from the onset of symptoms in those patients with a risk condition of complication identified such as elderly people or people with underlying chronic illnesses, is likely to be a bad prognosis of the flu vaccine. This fact evidences the need to administer early treatment (within 48 h of admission) to be effective. 13 Most frequent influenza infection complication is pneumonia, yet in this season five influenza encephalitis were registered among adult SHLCI patients. Acute encephalopathy syndromes as a complication of influenza infection has been previously described by other authors in children and adults, but our observation in unvaccinated adult population with risk factors to develop influenza complications underscores the need for higher vaccination coverage in at risk population despite age.

As mentioned, the surveillance of populations for explicit 'risk factors' affecting health indicates a shift in conceptualizations of illness as a phenomenon that transpires within the individual body to one that inhabits a novel 'extracorporal space' (Armstrong, 1995b, p. 395) . One outcome of this adjustment has historically been (and arguably, continues to be) that disease is attributed to specific populations and related spaces within society. The epidemiological understanding of 'risk groups' as neutral and empirical descriptions can inadvertently/intentionally result in the identification of these risk groups as responsible for the spread of disease. The presentation of 'risk groups' as arising from objective value-free criteria leads to the treatment of individuals as consumers who have unrestricted choice in their exposure to risks. Furthermore, the role of discrimination and marginalization within the construction of dominant understandings of risk groups and the reality that these risk groups often overlap with social groups is frequently overlooked. For example, the history of conflating AIDS risk groups with the gay population in the U.S. has not only reinforced existing attitudes of discrimination, but has also led to inadequate understandings of the disease (Fee and Krieger, 1993) . Simultaneously, the representation of disease in populations based on potential 'risk groups' versus social groupings, based on race, class or gender, effectively functions to depoliticize potentially contentious understandings and realities of health experiences.",30.506476434384474,12.878614180594823

Fundamental to this specific form of social control is the use of the discourse of risk in providing directives on maintaining healthy normative behaviours and lifestyles (Crawford, 1977) . That is, surveillance medicine transforms signs, symptoms and disease into general categories represented as 'risk factors', which rather than representing the actual occurrence of disease indicate the potential for disease in the future (Armstrong, 1995b) . Armstrong (1995b) asserts that the subject of surveillance medicine is, in fact, the 'risky self', where 'surveillance machinery deployed throughout a population to monitor precarious normality delineates a new temporalised risk identity.'

The relativity of such a system is emphasized in this analysis where that which is perceived of as 'dirty' can only be defined in relation to that which is 'clean'. The analysis of the creation of socially defined boundaries that distinguish between 'dirty' and 'clean' spaces or people is relevant to discussions of public health, where attempts to identify healthy versus unhealthy populations dominate discourses relating to risk.

Weekly birth weight-specific attack rates for NEC declined sharply in all birth weight groups when the equivalent of 35 to 36 weeks of gestational age was reached. The authors' data are consistent with the hypothesis that the risk period for NEC is determined primarily by the maturity of the gastrointestinal tract. 111 These data are supported by other studies whose findings suggest that the occurrence of NEC is most closely associated with immaturity of the gastrointestinal tract and that with increased maturatino there is a significantly lower incidence of NEC. [112] [113] [114] [115] [116] [117] It appears reasonable to suggest that the development of NEC is dependent on the interplay of numerous factors. The premature infant is at greatest risk by virtue of immature intestinal host defense mechanisms, and when additional insults are introduced, such as stress (ischemia, cold), potential pathogens, and hyperosmolar feedings, the additional insults may overwhelm the immature intenstine. It is imperative to continue our studies of NEC to determine how we can best indentify infants at greatest risk for this disease.

Specifically, risk of MS is 20-30% between monozygotic twins compared to 2-5% among fraternal twins. More recently, genome-wide analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms has identified a number of genetic loci that are associated with increased risk of MS among the general population (Australia and New Zealand Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium (ANZgene), 2009; De Jager et al., 2009 ). Many polymorphisms map to genes or genetic loci associated with immune regulation. The strongest association is with the HLA-DRB1 gene on chromosome 6p21 that accounts for 16-60% of genetic susceptibility to MS. The increasing number of genetic loci implicated in susceptibility to MS indicates that, if MS is a genetic disease, it is a complex genetic disorder in which multiple interacting polymorphic genes have low penetrance and exert a small effect on the overall disease risk (Ch. 41).",16.28923810087582,8.62662928896178

Understanding the current geographic and taxonomic distributions of zoonotic mammalian hosts offers an important baseline of empirical data against which observed patterns of human disease can be compared to improve first-order predictions of human disease risk posed by wild mammals. Here, we have summarized the global distributions of mammal hosts and the zoonoses they carry, and discuss them in context of existing research on human zoonoses. These hotspots provide only a partial view of zoonotic disease risk in humans and highlight many outstanding questions for future research (see Outstanding Questions). Moving forward, studies comparing hotspots of mammal hosts or particular pathogen types against the spatial landscape of epidemiological metrics (e.g., prevalence, incidence, frequency of disease events in human populations) and extrinsic drivers (e.g., environmental, sociopolitical, economic) will continue to triangulate those areas where high realized risk of human disease coincides with high zoonotic potential.

In these situations, how the outcome variables and study population are defined and measured can affect interpretation of the results and the validity of the conclusions. For example, in the development of recombinant vaccines for hepatitis B virus (HBV), two vaccine formulations, containing either 10 µg or 20 µg of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in each dose, were evaluated in clinical trials. Higher antibody titers developed in subjects who were administered vaccine with the higher dose. Both vaccines produced sufficient levels of antibody to be considered protective against infection, and both were licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. However, when the vaccines were more broadly case-control studies, odds ratios (ORs) are determined and approximate the relative risk. ORs provide a valid estimate of the RR under conditions that prevail in most case-control studies: the cases of disease are newly diagnosed, prevalent cases are not included in the control group, and the selection of cases and controls is not based on exposure status. 31 An increased RR or OR (i.e., >1.0) for an exposure variable indicates that the exposure is related to an increased risk of disease. Similarly, a decreased RR or OR (i.e., <1.0) indicates that the exposure variable is related to a decreased risk of disease. For example, the consumption of undercooked ground beef has been associated with an increased risk of E. coli O157:H7 infection in outbreak settings and of sporadic E. coli O157:H7 infections in the community. 32 Although RRs and ORs do provide a measure of the risk of disease associated with a specific factor, they do not directly describe how much disease in the community can be attributed to that factor. Rather, the attributable risk or fraction considers both the RR for an exposure variable and the proportion of the population exposed to that variable. In a case-control study of sporadic E. coli O157:H7 infections conducted by the Foodborne Disease Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) in 1996 to 1997, persons who ate undercooked hamburgers away from home had approximately a 6 times greater risk of E. coli O157:H7 than those who did not. For those who ate undercooked hamburger at home, the risk was only 2 times greater. However, eating undercooked hamburger at home was more common than eating it away from home. Therefore, eating undercooked hamburger at home accounted for an estimated 8% of cases, whereas the riskier (i.e., higher OR) practice of eating undercooked hamburger away from home accounted for 7% of cases. Furthermore, persons who ate at a table service restaurant were only 1.7 times as likely to have E. coli O157:H7 infection than those who did not. But, because eating at a table service restaurant is a very common practice and therefore represents more frequent exposure, it accounted for an estimated 20% of cases. Although it had the weakest statistical association, it accounted for the highest proportion of cases. Similarly, in a case-control study of sporadic listeriosis cases reported in FoodNet sites from 2000 to 2003, living on a cattle farm had the strongest association with illness (OR = 13.75), but, because it was an uncommon exposure, it had a population attributable fraction of only 1.6%. However, eating melons at a commercial establishment accounted for 10.6% of cases, even though the OR was only 2.6. 33 The identification of melon as a risk factor for sporadic listeriosis in this study subsequently made it easier for investigators to identify cantaloupe as the source for a large multistate outbreak of listeriosis in 2011. 34 As these examples show, both RR and attributable risk are important measures for describing the epidemiology of infectious diseases and determining public health priorities.",21.063466825533464,10.140544523256017

As a consequence, many refrained from purchasing pork, leading to domestic and regional pork markets downturn. In fact, pork-importing countries within the region considered introducing trade restriction on live pigs as precautionary measures to safeguard the local pig industries and preserve human health (Johnson, 2009) .

Social epidemiology often focuses on what Krieger (1994 Krieger ( , 2001 described as the multifactorial aetiology or web of causation-an array of social determinants of health distribution, an interplay of host, agent, and environment. There are numerous interconnected risk factors in the social system, which exposes individuals to the agents of diseases. These multifactorial links constitute the focus of social epidemiologists. It is through the understanding of the multicausality of disease that the differential distribution of diseases can be explained. One fundamental principle in social epidemiology is that humans are embodied agents (both socially and biologically). The interplay of these embodiments plays significant roles in risk exposure and susceptibility.

Most of the currently used vaccines are based on whole microorganisms or viruses in attenuated or killed forms. Although these vaccines possess high immunogenicity and efficacy, some aspects could be improved such as better reactogenicity and reduction of the risk of developing the disease in some population groups (e.g., immunocompromised individuals). The development of safer vaccines can be achieved by generating subunit vaccines, which are formulated with a few antigenic components from the pathogen. One of the challenges to address in this regard is the poor immunogenicity of the individual antigens, which is a frequent issue due to their low molecular complexity and absence of PAMPs in the formulation to stimulate innate immunity mechanisms that subsequently trigger the induction of adaptive immune responses.

The practitioner has to inform the biologist on all symptoms and relevant information so as to optimize the analysis and its cost-effectiveness.

Classical epidemiology, for instance, might seek to identify risk factors for a given condition, which might be environmental or genetic. This allows us to identify interventions to minimize the risk of disease. In the case of a transmissible disease, the situation is somewhat different. The spread of infectious disease is a dynamic process in which the increasing numbers of cases increase the risk to the rest of the population. Similarly, as people recover they may become immune (or more pessimistically they may succumb to diseaseit makes little difference to the infecting organism) and be removed from the system. Hence the numbers of hosts available to be infected change over time. To describe the changing state of the population, infectious disease epidemiology makes use of mathematical models comprising sets of differential equations, or statistical models that are defined using a probabilistic framework.

A question often asked, but rarely answered, is whether the psychobehavioural responses of these groups correspond to groups in completely different cultural environments. For example, would members of the League of Women Voters perceive and respond similarly to risk as poultry farmers in Viet Nam? Would the same techniques of communication be relevant for these widely differing groups? Different cultures ascribe different meanings to illness, sickness and disease and biomedical explanations of disease are not universally accepted. 11 A study of the understandings of acute respiratory illness among mothers and community health volunteers in Bangladesh, for example, found that, similar to other Asian countries, influenza and influenza-like illnesses were attributed to imbalances between ""hot and cold"" in the body. 12 Eating foods thought to be ""cold"" such as rice, bananas and beans were thought to aggravate or, in some cases, cause influenza. Remedies consisted of massaging the patient with ""warming"" substances such as a mixture of garlic and oil and cumin seeds. The way people respond to health communication messages is dependent on whether their cultural construction of the disease is similar to that of the communicator.

For instance, projects such as Gapminder [38] have developed animations of world income distribution and global health that are easy to understand. However, to our knowledge, this work is the first to experimentally evaluate visualization strategies to communicate infectious disease prevalence to the general public. Numerous studies have evaluated the impact of graphics on risk communication [24, 25] . However, this prior work has primarily focused on communicating to individual patients-particularly the risks and benefits individuals would receive as a result of a medical procedure. While epidemiologists have long used graphical displays to illustrate the spread of disease [39, 40] , that work has focused on delivering information to highly trained public health specialists. In contrast, this study assesses graphics that communicate disease prevalence to the general population, simulating that their country is at the epicenter of an infectious disease outbreak. This type of communi-cation is especially relevant to public health and government officials seeking to provide broadly accessible health information. As the lay public receives more of its health information multidimensionally, from healthcare experts, news, and social media, it is critically important to evaluate the most appropriate graphics used to communicate disease prevalence, spread, and risk. Understanding optimal communication strategies is of particular importance in relation to influenza, where vaccination greatly reduces the risk of contracting disease [41, 42] ; yet, vaccination rates remain suboptimal [43] . Prior research related to public health communication and influenza has demonstrated that the general public prefers brief, balanced, and evidence-based messages [44] [45] [46] . However, there is currently no standard method for the graphical communication of epidemiological data to the lay public. The WHO and the CDC used a combination of dot and heat maps during the recent Ebola outbreak to depict prevalence [30, 31] . Dot maps appear most often in the literature [32, [47] [48] [49] . However, heat maps have been discussed infrequently in the literature. In one study of Europeans interested in weather forecasts, a color contour map featuring hypothetical forecasts was preferred over six other more typical formats of graphical presentation of data, such as bar graphs, pie charts, and line graphs [50] . Yet, we found that while both heat maps and pictotrendlines were preferred over dot maps, the use of heat maps to demonstrate the spread of disease increased interest in vaccination compared to the use of picto-trendlines and no differently than dot maps. Furthermore, dot maps appeared to be the worst method to convey information, as respondents with dot maps had less knowledge gained from the graphic compared to those with heat maps and picto-trendlines. Thus, unlike dot maps and picto-trendlines, heat maps achieved the trifecta-greater respondent preference, increased interest in vaccination, and better translation of knowledge. Graphics must also be carefully examined to assess both their potential positive and negative impact. Visuals can produce a wide variety of emotional responses that may be difficult to predict [23, 27] . Furthermore, it is often difficult to adequately illustrate uncertainty in risk communication [51] ; however, this becomes even more imperative when presenting graphics at the population level, since risk may vary greatly between individuals and across locations. Experimental evidence remains limited as to how different graphics are processed and understood [51] ; therefore, additional research is necessary to evaluate the impact of public health graphics aimed at the general population. In particular, it is unclear how other modes of communication, such as animations and videos, impact public health communication. Our prior work using animation in the context of cancer treatment options suggests that animated graphics may result in suboptimal risk communication [52] .",18.01253521441847,11.087366765735553

Bayesian model averaging (BMA) [2, 16] allows for the integration of predictions of multiple models, weighted by their posterior support, to generate a single ensemble estimate that accounts for uncertainty in model selection. Here, via BMA, we use the ensemble of fitted models to predict the short-term and long-term impact of vaccination on rotavirus incidence. We then estimate the predicted impact using the vaccine efficacy from two different studies.

Investigation into a respiratory outbreak in mountain gorillas in Rwanda by PREDICT veterinarians revealed human metapneumovirus infection in affected individuals (Palacios et al., 2011) .

The parks where mountain gorillas reside are surrounded by very dense human populations, and research and ecotourism bring thousands of people into direct and indirect contact with the gorillas annually.

This may also apply to other subjects which are at risk of developing fungal infections because of predisposing underlying conditions such as diabetes or invasive surgery or other local factors, but are not systemically immune-depressed to such an extent as to make vaccination unlikely to raise the correct protective immune response. Here the cost-benefit ratio is of the paramount importance as is the accurate information about the prevalence of the disease, both factors being unfortunately in most cases unknown. Much more complex is the identification of the target population in subjects with deep immunodepression either of the natural immunity, as for instance, the neutropenic subjects undergoing conditional chemotherapy for and after bone marrow transplantation, or of the adaptive immunity, as for primary or acquired T cell deficiency as in AIDS. Clearly these subjects are unlikely to respond protectively to vaccination owing to the partial or total lack of immune-competence, rather, they may suffer from aggravation of the immunological disorder following the immunostimulation by vaccine antigens and adjuvants. Here a crucial question is the definition of risk criteria which are associated to the likelihood of becoming ill and identify exactly the population with higher risks which could justify the cost and the possible side-effects of a vaccination before becoming immunosuppressed. While the discussion is very active in this area, there are several indications that a rather high number of subjects at risk could indeed benefit of a advance active immunization against Candida and Aspergillus These may also include, for instance, patients candidate to transplant and those affected by tumours the therapy of which predisposes to fungal infection (Stevens 2004; Sheppard et al. 2004 ). Moreover, opportunistic agents of diseases have low-penetrance virulence traits and the immune responses which contribute to their control are usually redundant and impinging on both natural and adaptive immunity. Thus, a vaccine which simply potentiates a residual setting of the immunity may nonetheless be beneficial. A particular case in point here is the observation that CD8 cell activation can replace CD4 in the induction of protection against histoplasmosis in a model of CD4 cell deficient mouse, as well as the report about the direct anticandidal and anticryptococcal activity of cytotoxic CD8 T cells (Deepe, 2004; Levitz et al. 1995) . Clearly, the issue is here the knowledge of the type of immune responses which help the host to rid a transmissible agent or to control a commensal fungus. This is probably the most critical aspect in the definition of a priority for an antifungal vaccine aimed to combat opportunistic fungal infections.",17.469027356063208,11.859058132285085

The aim of these studies will be to understand the relevance of genetic variants associated with a disease within a population to disease within an individual patient. How many risk variants does an individual require before they are destined to develop a neurological disease? Do the variants merely affect age of onset, or do they also influence disease severity and outcome? How do these variants interact with each other to determine an individual's risk of disease, and what is the biological basis for this interaction? In complex diseases arising from multiple different loci in each individual patient, is changing the expression of a single variant sufficient to prevent disease in that individual? Is it too late to institute such an intervention at the time of first presentation, or should we undertake population screening and presymptomatic intervention? All of these questions must be considered before the advantages of our knowledge about genetics can take full effect. Longitudinal, prospective epidemiological studies are the ideal tool to address these issues in a meaningful, scientifically rigorous manner. An example of such a study is underway at the National Institutes of Health, where patients with Parkinson's disease due to mutations in the LRRK2 gene, identified as a key cause of familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease [19, 20] , will be followed over a ten-year period to elucidate how symptoms develop over time (www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT00467090).

Since the evolutionary and ecological dynamics of rapidly evolving pathogens occur on approximately the same time-scale, they must be studied conjointly to be properly understood. During the course of a single outbreak or epidemic season, mutations are generated de novo and can spread through an infectious disease population, creating a reciprocal link between the polymorphisms carried by a particular pathogenic organism and its propensity for onward transmission in a heterogeneous host population. The term 'phylodynamic' is often used to describe studies that aim to characterize the joint evolutionary and epidemiology behaviour of infectious diseases, particularly those that incorporate tools from the field of phylogenetics [1] . The term originated from-and is most commonly associated with-studies of RNA viruses, whose mutation rates can be more than one million times faster than their metazoan hosts [2] .

One possible explanation for this heterogeneity is that disease susceptibility was accounted for by more than one SNP within the five-SNP panel, thus rendering single SNP analysis incomplete. A second reason might relate to underlying population structure, where different CISH SNPs may tag the informative variants in each distinct population. A third possibility is that there remain unidentified functional SNPs within the region of association delineated by the five-SNP panel that also account for association with disease. This last possibility is unlikely however, as direct sequencing did not detect additional putatively functional polymorphisms. To explore the first and second possibilities, we utilized multi-SNP scoring for all five associated SNPs. Risk of disease increased markedly with an increase in the number of risk alleles carried in each population. As this multi-SNP analysis was more informative than single-point analysis, the above two possibilities remain plausible explanations.

The first step in viral invasion is the attachment to host cells via an interaction with functional surface receptor(s). 42 After attaching to host cells, a virus will release its genome into the cytoplasm through endocytosis or direct membrane fusion. Once inside, the viral genome will work as mRNAs to produce viral proteins that will bind with a number of host cell factors to allow for viral replication and transcription. The viruses can then circulate freely in the blood or they may associate with leukocytes, platelets, or erythrocytes and be harbored by them. 3 In response, the host cells will generate an immune response by producing immunoglobulin proteins specific to that particular virus capsule or envelope proteins.

As early as the 18th century, diff erential susceptibility to infection was suggested to be a characteristic of the host, and diseases such as tuberculosis and leprosy were believed to be inherited defects. 21 Infectious diseases, like other phenotypes, may exhibit familial aggregation: a greater frequency of the disease in relatives of infected individuals compared with relatives of those without disease. Studies of familial aggregation can therefore investigate the importance of shared determinants, both environmental and genetic, in disease susceptibility. They usually use a form of the recurrence risk ratio, essentially the ratio of prevalence in the relatives of the index case to the prevalence in the general population. It is important in such studies that the disease phenotype is carefully defi ned, particularly in the context of infectious diseases. Interpretation of recurrence risk is more straightforward if the phenotype is a binary or dichotomous trait (eg, the presence or absence of meningococcal septicaemia) than a qualitative range of clinical phenotypes, which may be less consistent (eg, measures of severity of infection determined by treatment interventions). Familial aggregation measures make no supposition about the cause of such aggregation, and recurrence risks within the same generation, such as sibling risk ratios, will identify both shared environmental and genetic eff ects. In infectious diseases, transmission of pathogens between family members may increase the risk of disease and contribute to the observed phenotypic aggregation. For example, in a study of sibling recurrence risk ratio for meningococcal disease, there was a 30 times increased risk of infection in siblings of cases compared with the general population risk, but the risk decreased with a longer time interval between the index case and the sibling case. 22 The recurrence risk for meningococcal disease in siblings was 11·9 times the population risk when the index and sibling cases occurred more than a week apart, falling to a risk of 8·2 if a year had elapsed between cases. 22 These data indicate signifi cant genetic determinants of meningococcal susceptibility, and also the importance of common acquisition of virulent strains within families, which accounts for the more immediate increased risk in household contacts. 23",16.879143880267208,6.857400353015207

Thus, a risk-assessment model has been developed to qualitatively assess the potential risk of vaccine process contamination by viral pathogens. The model takes into account the basic growth characteristics of each virus, its ability to grow in different cell substrates and resistance to processing steps during vaccine manufacture. The risk-assessment model has been applied to various pathogens to determine potential risk and relevance in different manufacturing scenarios, using different cell substrates for virus propagation, including Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Avian viruses, introduced via use of embryonated eggs for virus isolation, were found to present the greatest risk, irrespective of the substrate used for influenza virus propagation. The use of MDCK cells to propagate vaccine virus from egg-isolated influenza virus strains does not introduce a new or greater adventitious virus risk, compared with egg-based vaccine production.

One of the main requirements for mathematical models of disease spread involves the estimation of the effective contact rate in a given population. This is the product of the total contact rate per unit time (effective or not) and the risk of transmission. However, there are limitations to this calculation as contact rates can vary widely between individuals and groups. It is also difficult to determine transmission risk accurately, as this requires the study of infection rates by deliberate exposure of unaffected individuals to the organism, which is clearly unethical. However, post-outbreak contact study may allow the transmission risk to be estimated by assessing the number of secondary infection cases in a known exposed population (the secondary attack rate). In order to do so, contact tracing must be thorough and effective to identify all potential contacts with the primary case. Secondary attack rates can also be useful in investigating the efficacy of a vaccination by comparison between vaccinated and unvaccinated groups for a specified organism. Several software models are available to facilitate this process, as well as much more complex epidemic simulations, such as Epigrass. There is a considerable community of software developers, many of whom use incredibly sophisticated programs to model disease spread and interventions, and measure subsequent population consequences.

However, spatial clusters of high residual values from the final models indicates that there are still spatially dependent unmeasured risk factors.

Death certificates are mandatory in most countries and must be signed by a licensed physician before the body can be buried or cremated and before insurance payment or inheritance can occur. The contents of the death certificate are important because the medically certified cause of death is the basis for mortality statistics. Personal data include the age, gender, ethnicity, place of residence, and other variables such as occupation and injury. Completeness of reporting, accuracy of diagnosis, and coding of causes of death may limit the conclusions that can be drawn from such data. In practice, however, the data reported in large disease categories are an acceptable guide to actual events.",22.815442031602444,11.63769579439673

The key parameter here is R 0 (Eq. 5), which can be shown to be the parameter that defines the stability of the system (i.e. whether the disease is likely to become a major public health problem or not); since if it is greater than 1, the introduction of cases of disease into a population will likely cause an epidemic, whereas if it is less than one, the introductions will fade-out.

The use of CDRs for surveillance and control as part of state security apparatuses cannot be ignored here, and their use in disaster management could be seen as an example of 'function creep', a process of normalization through data repurposing or recontextualization (Custers and Uršič, 2016 ) that serves to accelerate and strengthen the global corporate-government surveillance assemblage (Haggerty and Ericson, 2000; Murakami Wood, 2013; Taylor, 2015; Taylor and Broeders, 2015) . Similarly, the surveillance potential of SMS needs to be better understood, including the ways in which this technology might be used for 'social sorting', such as the categorization of people according to risk, which can have serious real-world consequences (Lyon, 2003) . In disaster situations, using citizen-generated SMS data to define population groups based on risk categories is clearly problematic; when this process initiates different levels of assistance or intervention there is the possibility of engendering significant social harm or conflict. Arguably different rules apply in disaster situations, however the value of CDRs for monitoring movements and SMS for gathering information from citizens must be carefully considered against threats to freedom and societal control (see Buscher et al., 2013; Taylor, 2015) . As Lyon (2007, p. 3) has argued, surveillance is a neutral concept (neither inherently good or bad); each specific implementation exists ''somewhere on a continuum between care and control"" (italics in original), and so it is vital that the potential for societal harm is carefully considered despite the ostensibly good intentions of disaster management and digital humanitarianism activities.",17.328863362375497,7.644202779696643

Given the immunosuppressed status of children with malignancy and/or HSCT, immunization of those closest to them at home and those caring for them in the hospital is critically important in preventing infections. Live attenuated vaccines contain a theoretical risk of being transmitted to an immunocompromised host. Live oral polio vaccine, which is no longer administered in the United States, is an absolute contraindication for people taking care of this high-risk population. However, data suggests that measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), varicella zoster, and herpes zoster vaccines can be safely provided to healthcare workers and household contacts [25] . If healthcare personnel develop a rash that cannot be covered within the first 42 days following receipt of the varicella vaccine, they should avoid any contact with immunocompromised patients until all rash has crusted to avoid the potential risk of transmitting vaccine strain varicella to patients [25] . Infants living in households with persons who are immunocompromised including PHO and HSCT patients may be safely immunized against rotavirus; it is recommended, however, that immunocompromised persons avoid contact with the infant's diapers/stool for 4 weeks following vaccination to minimize risk of acquiring vaccine strain rotavirus infection [26] . An inactivated influenza vaccine is preferred for personnel taking care of immunocompromised children as opposed to live attenuated influenza vaccine [25] . Vaccination against other non-viral pathogens (such as pneumococcus or pertussis) by family members is another important method to minimize the risk of serious infection in PHO patients.",13.361361245309908,8.19958899517701

Some have a sort of imperial power, like smoking, obesity, or high blood pressure, to effect negative outcomes. Presumably these conditions could be put at the head of the list. Yet, for making positive gains in longevity, regular exercise comes up shining. Many of us were brought up to observe five valid health rules, prescribed in no particular order: Do not smoke, check your blood pressure, eat properly, get sufficient exercise, and choose your parents carefully. I do not attempt any ranking of the nongenetic risk factors here, only a simple enumeration of them, with brief notes regarding their role in disease in the United States and elsewhere today. One group of influences affecting health, the environmental factors, are outside the control of the individual except as individuals are part of a group, act collectively, or experience them in common.

Visuals can produce a wide variety of emotional responses that may be difficult to predict. 23, 27 Furthermore, it is often difficult to adequately illustrate uncertainty in risk communication; 51 however, this becomes even more imperative when presenting graphics at the population level, since risk may vary greatly between individuals and across locations. Experimental evidence remains limited as to how different graphics are processed and understood; 51 therefore, additional research is necessary to evaluate the impact of public health graphics aimed at the general population. In particular, it is unclear how other modes of communication, such as animations and videos, impact public health communication. Our prior work using animation in the context of cancer treatment options suggests that animated graphics may result in suboptimal risk communication. 52 This study must be interpreted in the context of several limitations. First, we chose three graphics to present to participants, but other graphics not presented in this study could be better suited to communicate disease prevalence. However, these graphics were chosen based on a pilot study in which these three graphics were the most promising. In addition, this study used graphics to accompany text, which may have a different effect than graphics viewed in isolation. Second, each respondent viewed a single graphic; however, no single graphic may suit the communication needs of all individuals. Furthermore, in this study, the picto-trendline graphic contained data only on the participant's country, compared to heat maps and dot maps, which included data on surrounding countries. However, including additional data in the picto-trendline graphic may increase its complexity and decrease its efficacy. Third, while differences seen in this study were statistically significant, it is difficult to project whether they are clinically relevant. Fourth, preferences in this study were developed based on a hypothetical scenario, which may not correspond with preferences during an actual pandemic of influenza. For example, we examined interest in future vaccination, which may not be perfectly correlated with actual vaccination. However, vaccination intentions are strongly associated with subsequent vaccination. 53 Additional research is necessary to determine how these graphics affect actual vaccination rates.

Questions in the media about the value orientations of those in authority offered an alternative framework through which their actions could be judged, potentially eroding public trust in the government and their stated commitment to evidence-based policymaking. According to this view, the risk of Hendra virus was not voluntarily assumed by affected individuals, but forced on them by current government policies.

Widespread stigma and discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS arise partly from the existing negative public attitude towards these people [12] . The negative public image of HIV/AIDS and people carrying the virus is not only associated with the nature of the disease but also with the socially constructed meaning or understanding about the risk factors. The extent of stigma varies according to modes of transmission or behaviours perceived to be responsible for the infection and the pre-existing characteristics of the at-risk groups. Many different social institutions contribute to the construction of specific public images of the target populations. The people and places at risk of contracting a disease are identified by the epidemiological studies but they do not necessarily become comprehensible to the masses. The public, the media, and the policy-makers begin to develop certain images about the disease and the at-risk people. According to Schneider and Ingram [13] , 'officials develop maps of target populations based on both the stereotypes they themselves hold and those they believe to prevail among the segments of the public likely to become important to them.' Formulation and shifts in policy for a particular group, subpopulation, or community depend on how they are viewed by policy-makers. Gauri and Liberman contend that where social institutions divide the population groups deeply, elites and common people perceive AIDS to be a disease of other people outside their community and who are unlikely to mingle with them [14] . When responsible authorities take 'us' and 'they' approach by prejudicially linking the disease with specific sections of the populations, AIDS policies remain misguided and fragmented.

A related concept is the 'deficit model', which is a common and traditional way of looking at communication between scientists and nonscientists (Durant et al, 1992; Ziman, 1984) . This model essentially argues that the public lacks adequate scientific information on which to base their judgments, which is why public perceptions of risk are often at odds with scientific assessments. To remedy this, proponents argue that we need to educate lay people to think more like scientists, so that they will become more receptive to the scientists' arguments. Although few people would argue against having greater scientific literacy or a general understanding of scientific concepts among the public, focusing entirely on 'fixing' a deficit diminishes the role that nonscientists can play in risk characterizations. Being acutely aware of risks in the context of their everyday lives, non-scientists often provide unique insight into risk assessments, which at times may even lead to better risk characterizations (Stern & Fineberg, 1996 (Scherer, 1991) . Proactive risk communication calls attention to a potential or existing issue, suggests an agenda for discussion, and recommends a format for information exchange. Advantages of proactive communication include its potential to allow for more balanced and meaningful discussions. By its very nature, it can also alert people to a risk they did not know existed, which can help them to take precautionary measures to avoid exposure. Some might also consider this a disadvantage, particularly when the experts think that the risk in question does not pose a significant danger to human health or the environment. Reactive risk communication, in comparison, occurs only after the public or the media draw attention to a specific issue, or in response to a crisis. A considerable difference exists, however, between reactive risk communication following a crisis situation and reactive risk communication after an organization has been viewed as 'stonewalling' or avoiding public comment, with the latter incurring much more damage to that organization's perceived trust and Pre-1979 Asian poster promoting youth vaccination for smallpox and measles. © Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA special issue S64 credibility. Other disadvantages of reactive risk communication are the danger that science can become less relevant when issues become emotionally charged, the tendency of people to disbelieve or discredit delayed information and the fact that communicators are placed in defensive positions. Reactive risk communication can also sometimes come too late to help or protect individuals or their families from harm, such as when US postal workers died in 2001 after exposure to anthrax spores in the mailroom. Unfortunately, not all risks can be avoided or detected. Generally speaking, however, proactive risk communication yields greater potential for building trust among individuals and risk management, as well as for satisfying legal and ethical obligations. For example, controlling antimicrobial resistance will require ongoing proactive risk communication with, among others, healthcare professionals, patients, pharmaceutical companies, food producers and consumers. While proactive risk communication can work to reduce the need for antibiotics and the spread of resistant strains of bacteria, reactive risk communication will probably be necessary as the inevitable cases of illness arise.",20.505886274779648,9.374927184354945

Because of these different approaches to and perspectives of risk, breakdowns in risk communication occur frequently, which has prompted a fair amount of study into i m p r o v i n g the risk communication process. In this regard, the 'co-orientation' factor has become increasingly important. This refers to the degree to which individuals' or groups' perceptions are similar or differ and to the degree to which these perceptions are correct. Building on early work by Newcomb (1953) Risk communication, in essence, is therefore defined as an iterative coorientation process among scientists and non-scientists about risk assessment, risk characterization, risk management and risk policy. This holds true for a range of topics: from discussing the risks and benefits of new and emerging technologies, such as nanotechnology, to providing guidelines for preventing exposure to recent health risks, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, to implementing international health campaigns to reduce the transmission of infectious diseases, such as AIDS or tuberculosis. Risk communication encompasses characteristics of the sender and receiver, and it entails both purposeful and unintentional messages about risk. It is multidirectional, and it occurs at individual, group, organizational, community and societal levels. The next few paragraphs address the nature of risk communication, including some of the challenges facing risk communicators today, and review some common and other, more promising, risk-communication strategies. F irst and foremost, risk communication is a matter of building trust. One problem of modern societies is that we are not quick to accept risks, neither as individuals nor as societies, which has led to our complex systems of risk management. Instead of feeling more at ease, however, our society has been growing more concerned about risks in recent decades (Slovic, 1993) . We can see a corollary in a widely documented decrease in the public's confidence in institutions that are responsible for risk management (Laird, 1989) . The reversal of this trend may lie in the revival of trust. Common sense tells us that trust is essential, yet some argue that its role has been largely under-appreciated in risk management efforts (Slovic, 1993) .",18.300225159325542,9.265107692558983

Scientists and engineers are abuzz with excitement about the substantial promise of nanotechnology to improve food, agricultural, medical and security systems; yet we already see growing public concern about the real and potential ethical implications associated with this new technology, the possibilities of its misuse and other unforeseen risks or consequences. Popular media accounts and bestselling novels do their part in fuelling the public's perceptions of risks and hazards, but, as with any emerging technology, a shortage of public knowledge and a great deal of uncertainty about the science also exists. It is equally likely, however, that scientists are as much 'in the dark' about how individuals, groups and other stakeholders will respond to the new and emerging risks of nanotechnology and other technologies, as the public is ignorant about the science. T oday, it is essentially a truism in risk communication that pushing technological advances without considering public input runs the risk of triggering backlash or opposition. For some scientists, perhaps a more bitter pill to swallow is that even the best efforts to communicate and involve the public in decisions about how to implement new technologies safely are no guarantee of public acceptance or even agreement with the scientists. Fessenden-Raden and colleagues included the following admonition in an article about risk communication: ""No matter how accurate it is, risk information may be misperceived or rejected if those who give information are unaware of the complex, interactive nature of risk communication and the various factors affecting the reception of the risk message"" (Fessenden-Raden et al, 1987) .",18.02078354219797,7.682001581301996

Face-to-face risk communication can entail holding a single public hearing during an environmental permitting process or conducting a series of intense, deliberative workshops with targeted audiences. Massmediated risk communication can involve scientists or government agencies issuing press statements, holding press conferences or giving interviews. Just as the specific avenues of risk communication vary, so too do the reasons behind them. Some efforts are used primarily to inform and educate, others actively seek public input, and still others seek consensus. The main concern here is matching objectives with methods and ensuring that participants understand their part in the overall process. A final consideration relates to the degree of control over the message. Senders of risk communication information have much less control over the ultimate messages when they rely on news media to propagate them, although the potential reach is much greater. By contrast, control is much greater in face-to-face settings or other direct forms of communication. Table 1 provides an overview of some common methods of risk communication and lists some advantages and disadvantages of each. With these considerations in mind, the next section examines four approaches towards providing risk information: persuasive, balanced, dialectical and narrative. F irst, conventional risk communication efforts that are used to educate lay audiences resemble persuasive models. Typically these models are one-sided approaches that try to convince audiences to change their attitudes or behaviours about a particular issue or set of issues in a particular direction (Krimsky & Plough, 1988) . Because of their explicit intent to change people's attitudes and behaviours, persuasive approaches are sometimes also referred to as advocacy approaches. Just as countless studies have examined the factors mitigating the impact of persuasive messages, numerous studies have also shown that conventional approaches to risk communication need to account for psychological factors (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974; Slovic, 2000; Weinstein, 1989 ), sociological influences (Kasperson, 1992 Freudenberg, 1993) and cultural determinants (Douglas, 1985) .",17.87473518060041,7.4067824601355925

The current model could further link those attributes with individual reaction process and responsive behavior, and explore how different communication strategies influence influenza spread dynamics. Furthermore, other public interventions are often used with the presence of public risk communication and individual behavioral responses.

For risk communication to succeed, it is imperative that the communicator understands the stakeholders and how they perceive the potential risk. Identifying, assessing and segmenting the stakeholders, understanding their concerns and perceptions, would enable the communicator to design better risk communication strategies. It would enable the communicator to design better risk messages, customize messages for specific target groups and ensure that stakeholders receive relevant messages. It is equally important for the communicator that the stakeholders want to be involved. One-way forms of communication, in which the stakeholders are mainly seen as receivers of information from experts, are no longer considered acceptable. Risk communication is now a two-way form of communication, with emphasis on interaction and dialogue between an organization and its stakeholders. Hence communications that enhance interactions, elicit responses and generate dialogue are preferable. Openness (e.g. involving representatives from affected stakeholders) enables an organization to get input from outside the organization, thereby improving the quality of interactions. A dynamic, flexible risk communication approach that involves stakeholders at every possible stage can enhance the effectiveness and credibility of risk communication throughout the crisis management cycle.",28.13814407175711,10.805416862717031

The perspective on stakeholders (audiences) is embedded in definitions of risk communication, be they source-or sender-oriented definitions focusing on conveying or transmitting information, from the risk assessors to the stakeholders, or interactive process definitions focusing on the exchange of scientific information between interested parties (Covello, Winterfeldt, & Slovic, 1987; Infanti et al., 2013) .

Persuasion includes ""any effort to modify an individual's evaluation of people, objects or issues by the presentation of a message"" (Petty & Cacioppo, 1987, p. 25) . Persuasive communication emphasizes the notion of change, be it change of attitude, behaviour, habits, emotions or beliefs about an issue. Hence any message that is intended to shape, reinforce or change the responses of another, or others, will be defined as persuasive communication (Stiff, 1994, p. 10) . Several strands of research from different disciplines such as behavioural science, psychology and political science exist in message effect studies.

Risk management processes would be futile if internal stakeholders were not included in the processes. The same applies to the sharing of risk information in interorganization networks, especially crisis management organizations like the police, defence and security. In analysing risks and solutions, risk managers should also consider how the chosen solutions would affect stakeholders. The risk decision processes thus involve different ways of engaging and accommodating internal and external stakeholder interests.

The interactive perspective on health risk communication moves beyond the old view of a passive receiver and instead focuses on how health risk messages can elicit different responses depending on (a) who communicates them, (b) how they are communicated and (c) how the public actively processes the information (Lemal & Merrick, 2013) .

As noted in Gutteling and Wiegman (1996) , to some risk communication researchers, especially those who hold an implicit technical view of risk communication, there is no problem in trying to reach agreement between the source and the receiver by applying persuasive tools. Other researchers, however, argue that using persuasion communication strategies is not acceptable and contradicts the goals of fairness. More recently, there has been a shift in the understanding of risk communication from merely a one-way communication flow to an emphasis on a two-way communication process involving sharing of information and promoting dialogue between technical experts and stakeholders. This approach acknowledges the concerns of stakeholders. Properly applied dialogue-based risk communication can help stakeholders and experts to share knowledge and understanding of the risk issue. Dialogue is aimed at ensuring that a diverse range of people share a common understanding of the risk issue with the organizations/ individuals in charge of managing the risk concerned. Sandman (1989) argues that the principle of involving the public in risk issues, whether it is risk assessment, decision-making, management or communication, is crucial. The aim of dialogue-based risk communication is to bring together diverse stakeholders in risk knowledge creation and sharing. This approach recognizes that certain risks are complex and multidisciplinary and hence need to be addressed through dialogue with, and participation by, diverse stakeholders. Increasing stakeholder participation raises the likelihood of the message being credible. There is a growing realization by risk researchers that for risk communication to be effective, it should have a stakeholder perspective. Dialogue-based perspectives are captured in the definition of risk communication by Lang, Fewtrell, and Bartram (2001) : ""[R]isk communication is any purposeful exchange of information about risks between interested parties."" In their 'General Principles of Food Safety Risk Management', the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) hold that ""risk management should include clear, interactive communication with consumers and other interested parties in all aspects of the process"". In its project to investigate what type of communication would improve the public understanding of flood risk and encourage people to take action, the British Environment Agency (2015) carried out a major public dialogue project on flood risk communication. In its project evaluation it found that ""getting people and communities involved in talking about flood risks increases people's understanding of local flood risk and can help them on a journey towards making preparations to protect themselves against flooding"" (Environment Agency, 2015).",17.226439429155043,6.872855669250953

The IHR bind WHO member countries to not only notify all events that may constitute a public health emergency, but also to respond to requests for verification of information. WHO has also produced outbreak communication guidelines to aid in the dissemination of information to the public, recognizing that 'expertise [in communications] has become as essential to outbreak control as epidemiological training and laboratory analysis'. 2 The boundaries between risk communication and management are not, however, sharply delineated, as illustrated by the controversy surrounding H5N1 influenza virus sharing. Indonesia is one of the countries hardest hit by outbreaks of H5N1. Virus sharing with the international community is the mechanism by which, first, viruses developing pandemic potential can be tracked (risk communication), and second, vaccines can be developed to meet global need (risk management). Indonesia refused to virus share, not because it was opposed to the sharing of technical information to better understand the threat posed by H5N1 avian influenza, but because it felt excluded from equitable access to the resulting vaccine, meaning that its management of a subsequent pandemic would be constrained. 3 It could be argued that Indonesian authorities currently view virus sharing as an important element in risk management and thus a sovereign issue, although the international community, by contrast, views virus sharing as a critical element of risk communication and, by extension, a global risk management issue. Differing interpretations of international treaties are possible and resolution is proving challenging. 4 Ultimately, the debate is centred on the boundary between the governance of risk communication and risk management, the former now being mandated through international laws, with the latter remaining, to a large degree, a national sovereignty responsibility.",16.906992381548307,7.094250034299888

Now, others re-define 'metaphylaxis' as mass medication of healthy animals when the disease of interest is present within the group/flock/herd (EMA 2016) .

Studies in such settings have shown that HIVfree survival at 7 months of age is similar in exposed infants that were breast-fed or formula-fed from birth [360] [361] [362] . Studies in Africa show that mothers who exclusively breast-feed in the first 6 months of life have reduced risk of HIV transmission compared with mothers who supplement breast-feeding with other foods and milk sources [360, 361, 363] . In areas of the world where the burden of infectious diseases and malnutrition is high and where alternatives to breast milk that provide adequate nutrition are unacceptable, affordable, feasible, and safe, exclusive breast-feeding is recommended by the WHO and other authorities for women whose HIV status is unknown and for women known to be HIVinfected [293, 344, 358, 364] .

The most commonly used models are called population (compartmental) models. Developments by WH Hamer, Sir Ronald Ross and Kermack and McKendrick between 1910 and 1930 resulted in the core mathematical models that continue to be used to understand and predict the transmission of infectious diseases today (Kermack and McKendrick 1927) . These deterministic dynamical models have been extended to stochastic variants for use under certain circumstances, and for modelling diseases with other modes of transmission than those originally studied, as well as for studying endemic and endemo-epidemic diseases. Age structure and spatial structure have been introduced as further features to the dynamical models. More detailed spatial structure between subpopulations, taking account of social groups and travel patterns, captures a subclass of pandemic models with increased spatial heterogeneity. Network models of infectious disease take advantage of modern computing power and increased amounts of readily available social network data to model transmission based on models of individual people's contacts with others in their social groups. Agent-based models go one step further and Where the animal is marked with an asterisk (*), this indicates that the disease's zoonotic origin was traced back to the same animal host. Note that where there is no observed recent animal-to-human transmission for some diseases, it remains likely that the disease's earliest origins were via zoonosis. Smallpox's mode of transmission is suspected to be airborne but was not fully confirmed before its extinction in 1979 (Milton 2012) (if applicable) and pathogenic agents, thus removing some of the assumptions underlying the dynamical models and attempting to generate real-world epidemic behaviour directly from the interactions of the agents. 5 By definition, pandemics occur only if the susceptible population is sufficiently large that sustained transmission can occur over large swaths of the planet. For this to happen, there needs to be low residual immunity in the population: it is emerging or re-emerging pathogens that are likely to give rise to pandemics. Moreover, in an unconventional risk transfer context, the principal use case is to model the risk of emergence of a novel pathogen capable of reaching pandemic scale, and subsequently the size, scale and impact of that pandemic. It is for this reason that industry focuses its attention on population models with spatial heterogeneity: they are able to capture the large-scale behaviour of pandemics relevant to counterparties involved in risk transfer transactions.",16.16699452284127,8.311618382524475

High risk is not the same as HTR, although there appears to be substantial overlap; whereas not all at high risk are hard-to-reach, many in the HTR population are at high risk. While no uniform definition of HTR populations exists, HTR populations have typically been defined from the perspective of linkage with the health care system, i.e., persons who do not seek treatment in traditional care settings such as provider offices or clinics. The size of hard-to-reach populations, whereas hard to estimate, is not trivial; some examples of constituent groups are as follows: 11.5-12 million undocumented immigrants nationwide, 18 1.5 million injection drug users in 96 large U.S. metropolitan areas 19 and 744,000 homeless persons nationwide, 20 as well as a proportion of the elderly and minorities. Overall, the percentage of U.S. residents at high risk for influenza but who are not immunized has been estimated to be as high as 65%. 3 Failure to be immunized is related to lack of health insurance and to having a regular provider; 21 this may be a particular concern for specific HTR groups. For example, mobile elderly differ from the majority of the other population groups in that they are covered by Medicare and generally frequent a health care provider. Thus, whereas the elderly as a high-risk group may differ from other groups in terms of access to health care as an entitlement, a proportion is not connected to care and is therefore HTR. The lack of a regular health care provider is correlated with race and ethnicity. 7 While 80% of White adults have a primary care provider, the percentage is closer to 70% for Asian-Americans and Blacks, and only 57% for Hispanics. 22 As reviewed elsewhere, other barriers to accessing care include culturally derived attitudes and belief systems, negative experiences with past treatment, language and other barriers in patient-provider relationships, and legal status (e.g., undocumented immigrants). [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] Some groups harbor substantial myths about and distrust of the medical system; previous research has shown that their attitudes appear to be strong predictors of being immunized. 28 VLAHOV ET AL. 616",17.108286359398566,8.726900027663659

Host population size is important in maintaining a chain of transmission through these troughs; however, small populations can still allow for disease persistence. One possible explanation for this is immigration: an infected host from outside comes into the population and starts a new round of infections, as seen in measles [11, 38] . Another explanation is that a different host species can act as a reservoir for the virus, which could be the case with Ebola virus [39] . A third explanation is the presence of a low proportion of carriers, which can allow persistence even in small populations (Figures 1c, 2b) , as might be the case with foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) [40] .

The seroprevalence in the Yellowstone bison and elk population is estimated with 40% to 60% and 22%, respectively. 8, 9 This has been associated with physiologic and immunologic characteristics common to bovine species but is probably also caused by typical behavioral patterns of large social groups and the periparturient behavior of bison dams that tend to calve within groups that facilitate disease transmission through direct contact around parturition. 10 In contrast elk dams segregate themselves during the periparturient period and meticulously clean the birthing site, considerably reducing the risk of disease transmission through direct contact. 11 Disease transmission may, however, be common during the abortion period in the last trimester of pregnancy from February to April, when many elk congregate in large groups on lower elevation winter habitat that overlaps with cattle-grazing areas. 11 From 2009 to 2011 eight infected cattle or captive bison herds were detected in Wyoming and Montana and all episodes were genetically or epidemiologically linked to elk, suggesting that spillover transmission from elk to cattle is epidemiologically more important than transmission from bison to cattle. 11 This has been explained with the continuously increasing elk population, which is currently above management target values in many areas of the Greater Yellowstone area and the greater mobility of free-ranging elk. 10 Horses In horses the organism is often found in chronic bursal enlargements as a secondary invader rather than a primary pathogen. It is commonly present with Actinomyces bovis in fistulous withers and poll evil. It has also been identified as a cause of abortion in mares.

The ongoing technological revolution has rapidly transformed research, diagnostic and therapeutic tools. However, there is still a requirement for the reliability and the standardization of sampling and biological testing to be increased as information is exchanged internationally. In future, the organization of clinical microbiology laboratories will probably follow that of other areas of the life sciences -that is, with large centralized laboratories and a local head. The position and the role of experts in clinical microbiology processes will become an important question. The interpretation of diagnostic tests can require different levels of expertise. The predictive value of a test depends on its intrinsic quality and on the prevalence of the disease in the population. Therefore, the final interpretation relies on both the microbiologist and the physician. In some instances, the indications of the clinical and epidemiological data to the laboratory will make it possible for a diagnosis to be made.In other cases, communication of the intrinsic values of the test (for example, sensitivity and specificity) might allow an infectious-disease specialist to make a diagnosis on-site (FIG. 1) . Finally, the need for consultation on rare diseases with experts around the world using the Internet will increase.

Through various diseases, comorbidities have been associated with outcome.[88], [89], [90], [91], [92] Screening of significant extrahepatic comorbid conditions is the cornerstone of the health assessment required before placement on a waiting list. The UCLA score was developed with the aim of identifying variables associated with 3-month or in-hospital mortality after LT in patients with very high MELD scores (≥ 40). Among the evaluated variables, authors chose the Charlson-comorbidity index (CCI)93 that had already been proven in a recalibrated form to be efficient in determining outcome in an LT population.94 Another score named the “cardiac risk score” was defined by the presence of at least 1 of the following variables: severe valvular disease, coronary artery disease with more than 70% stenosis or previous revascularization, history of myocardial infarction, history of ventricular and/or atrial arrhythmias, elevated pre-orthotopic LT troponin I (> 0.2 ng/ml), and/or new wall motion abnormalities on echocardiography. Indeed, cardiovascular disease was shown to be associated with short-term outcome, particularly in the first month following LT (mortality or cardiovascular events).[95], [96] MELD score, pretransplant septic shock, but also age-adjusted CCI and cardiac risk score were associated with outcomes using a multivariate analysis. In the final score named UCLA futility risk score (UCLA-FRS) an important weight was given to comorbidity including the cardiac risk index and the CCI: UCLA-FRS = 0.5 × (MELD score) + 5 × (1 = CCI ≥ 6; 0 = CCI < 6) + 4 × (1 = cardiac risk; 0 = no cardiac risk) + 3 × (1 = septic shock; 0 = no septic shock).97 In a recent study reporting results of LT in patients with OFs, this score seemed to be helpful in selecting candidates for LT when considering predicted and observed post-LT survival rates.98 Another study aimed to compare available scores in 2 independent cohorts of transplanted patients with high MELD scores (Swiss and UNOS cohort). Most prediction scores showed low positive predictive values for post-transplant mortality despite good specificity. Among these scores, the BAR score was the only score linearly associated with complications.99 The usefulness of this score, which was designed for the more critically ill patients, seems restricted to this population based on its performance in other cohorts100 (Table 3).",9.283603052325372,7.559282623737618

We start with the traditional SEIR (for Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Recovered stocks representing population groups) model and incorporate feedbacks regulating endogenous changes in contact rate, screening, diagnosis, and reporting in response to risk perception and other relevant factors. Thus not only reported statistics, but also the effective reproduction number, Re, are endogenously generated and can change as people respond to the epidemic. The model is very simple on other fronts: it assumes perfect mixing for the whole population of Iran and includes no disaggregation of population into different groups, nor any travel patterns across population groups. The focus being on a single country, the only link with the pandemic is when the cases were first seeded in Iran (supposedly from China). We use this model, along with various strands of data reported above, to weave together an estimate of disease trajectory so far, and offer projections for expected future trajectory. Given the rapid development of this model and various uncertainties not included in the analysis, the results should be seen as an assessment to enhance the overall picture of the epidemic, but not as reliable point estimates. With these limitations in mind, we estimate over 916,000 (90% CI: 508K, 1.5M) cumulative cases of the disease in Iran as of March 20th, with over 15,485 (90% CI: 8.4K, 25.8K) deaths. We thus estimate that only 2.1% of cases and 9.2% of deaths are officially attributed to COVID-19, with the rest going undetected. The confidence intervals around our estimations are relatively wide due to data limitations and our conservative assumptions in estimating those intervals. Nevertheless these results point to extreme gaps between official data and actual trajectory of disease, which may lead to slow response and under-appreciation of risks of the diseases in the coming months.",18.63977393246884,7.919919278303963

From a scientific point of view, there are two course of actions that can be followed. On the one hand, new vaccines and pharmaceutical interventions need to be developed. This usually requires months of work. Therefore, on the other hand, it is important to study the large-scale spatial spreading of the disease through mathematical and computational modeling, which allows evaluating ""in-silicon"" what-if-scenarios and potential contention measures to stop or delay the disease. This modeling effort is key, as it can contribute to maximize the effectiveness of any protection measures and gain time to develop new drugs or a vaccine to protect the population. Here, we follow the modeling path and analyze, through a data-driven stochastic SEIR-metapopulation model, the temporal and spatial transmission of the COVID-19 disease in Spain as well as the expected impact of possible and customary contention measures.",9.518399053701783,6.528308112284698

Hence, controlling for social group effects simultaneously controls for unmeasured variation between groups and most technical batch effects related to sample collection and processing.

Perhaps the most important one has to do with the inability of current large-scale epidemiological models to fully account for behavioral changes in the population when a disease is evolving. As it is the case for the spreading of COVID-19, the information −and more often than desired, misinformation− travels faster than the disease. This produces undesired effects such as a collapse in the emergency rooms at hospitals, a proliferation of information sources that do not provide sensible advices in all cases, anticipated economic loses and, in general, uncoordinated responses. Therefore, it is a pressing challenge to develop more realistic ways to incorporate in models like the one employed here all these risk-averse responses and reactions. Another limitation of the current study includes the relatively low spatial resolution, which is essentially determined by the data availability. The results however indicate that the level of granularity used here is enough to capture mobility patterns and the effects of possible interventions. Finally, we have not considered the temporal and spatial variability of disease parameters, nor other potentially important characteristics of the host population such as the existence of super spreaders or the age structure, which seems to play a relevant role for this disease, at least in what concerns the case fatality rate. We plan to investigate on all these issues in the near future.",9.367308076462898,5.4968007760093744
