Baker and Fidler raised concerns that syndromic surveillance may not be effective in the timely detection of emerging diseases [9] . Although these critiques raised valid concerns, in some areas syndromic surveillance systems have detected outbreaks in a timely fashion, complementing traditional surveillance. The WHO also supported the use of syndromic surveillance at the national level during its interim review as part of strengthening core surveillance capacity.

Building effective public health partnerships is critical for sustainability of such a system. Uganda has made significant progress in responding to emergencies during the past quarter century, but its public health workforce is still inadequate in number and competency. Objectives: To reinforce implementation of priority public health programs in Uganda and cultivate core capacities for compliance with International Health Regulations. Methods: To develop a competent workforce to manage epidemics and improve disease surveillance, Uganda Ministry of Health (MoH) established an advanced-level Field Epidemiology Training Program, called Public Health Fellowship Program (PHFP); closely modelled after the US CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Service. PHFP is a 2-year, full-time, nondegree granting program targeting mid-career public health professionals. Fellows spend 85% of their field time in MoH placements learning through service delivery and gaining competencies in major domains. Results: During 2015-2018, PHFP enrolled 41 fellows, and graduated 30. Fellows were placed in 19 priority areas at MoH and completed 235 projects (91 outbreaks, 12 refugee assessments, 50 surveillance, and 60 epidemiologic studies, 3 cost analysis and 18 quality improvement); made 194 conference presentations; prepared 63 manuscripts for peer-reviewed publications (27 published as of December 2018); produced MoH bulletins, and developed three case studies. Projects have resulted in public health interventions with improvements in surveillance systems and disease control. Conclusion: During the 4 years of existence, PHFP has contributed greatly to improving realtime disease surveillance and outbreak response core capacities. Enhanced focus on evidence-based targeted approaches has increased effectiveness in outbreak response and control, and integration of PHFP within MoH has contributed to building a resilient and sustainable health system in Uganda.",32.23751021214864,13.101001783966913

Routine surveillance has continuously evolved since 2010, expanding in scale and scope with more sites reporting on more conditions every year since. The ability to add diseases and conditions to the system before and during outbreaks, and if necessary set up enhanced complementary components such as cholera surveillance exemplifies the system's adaptability, scalability, and flexibility. The planned integration of community-based surveillance will improve detection of health threats in rural communities where health-care utilization is very low. 20 In line with CDC and WHO guidelines on Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response, the system should be integrated to coordinate and streamline the portfolio of existing surveillance activities and to maximize efficiency and resources, rather than trying to maintain separate vertical activities. 21 The experience of establishing a surveillance system of national scope in Haiti utilizing existing surveillance infrastructure highlights the fact that it is more efficient to integrate existing disease surveillance data flows into a matrix-like structure where vertical (or in-depth) surveillance systems capture the information necessary to meet the surveillance data needs of a horizontal (or broad) system. Cholera surveillance provides a working example of a vertically designed module capable of being integrated into the horizontal routine system. Such an integrated and centralized platform of surveillance is a step in helping Haiti to conform to the 2005 IHR core capacity requirements for surveillance and response. 22, 23 Through a resolution in 2008, WHO emphasized the role of public health laboratories by calling for the organization of a national public health laboratory that would link national, regional, subregional, and international laboratories. 24 Internationally, the national laboratory has already developed partnerships with the relevant regional laboratory (Caribbean Public Health Agency) and reference laboratories (e.g., CDC-Atlanta). Within the country, the national laboratory is working on implementing in-country regional laboratories that will greatly improve the laboratory component of the surveillance system and ensure that laboratory results are linked in surveillance system with cases. Integrating laboratory confirmation into routine surveillance and its complementary systems is essential to minimize delays in taking public health action. 20 The laboratory-enhanced surveillance system represents a significant step in the long-term transition toward laboratory-based surveillance and a model for how the laboratory testing can be best integrated into routine surveillance STRENGTHENING NATIONAL DISEASE SURVEILLANCE AND RESPONSE activities as capacity in this field continues to grow. However, much work remains to be done along this axis. As one example of an area for future improvement, the ongoing implementation of electronic laboratory information management systems will allow testing results to be linked with case data in real time. Furthermore, laboratory diagnostic capacity at the level of health facilities across the country needs to continue to be improved in parallel to the strengthening of regional reference laboratories. To achieve this, in parallel to building diagnostic capacity at this level, sites should be encouraged to routinely send samples to the national laboratory as a part of their quality assurance program.",31.932196466277635,13.471223432672726

What are the hospital infection control issues associated with a SARS outbreak, and what are the most effective approaches to address these issues? What type State and local health departments continue to face unprecedented challenges in preparing for, recognizing, and responding to threats to the public's health. The attacks of 11 September 2001 and the ensuing anthrax mailings of 2001 highlighted the public health readiness and response hurdles posed by intentionally caused injury and illness. At the same time, recent natural disasters have highlighted the need for comparable public health readiness and response capabilities. Public health readiness and response activities can be conceptualized similarly for intentional attacks, natural disasters, and human-caused accidents. Consistent with this view, the federal government has adopted the all-hazards response model as its fundamental paradigm. Adoption of this paradigm provides powerful improvements in efficiency and efficacy, because it reduces the need to create a complex family of situation-specific preparedness and response activities. However, in practice, public health preparedness requires additional models and tools to provide a framework to better understand and prioritize emergency readiness and response needs, as well as to facilitate solutions; this is particularly true at the local health department level. Here, we propose to extend the use of the Haddon matrix-a conceptual model used for more than two decades in injury prevention and response strategies-for this purpose. of advance planning strategy could a local public health department use to identify the contributing factors to this public health emergency?

We think not: current high-quality public health surveillance already utilizes multiple sources of information to gain a more complete picture of the incidence and distribution of disease. For example, influenza surveillance may include laboratory-based virological surveillance, sentinel syndromic surveillance (e.g., school-based absenteeism reports) and evaluation of mortality trends for pneumonia and influenza, which taken together may provide a more complete picture of disease risk and impacts. Searchtermbased surveillance and other modalities mentioned above thus provide an additional tool in the surveillance toolbox, which has advantages over traditional surveillance as well as limitations. It should be noted, however, that limitations such as those described above are not absent from traditional surveillance systems either: estimates of incidence can change markedly with changing case definitions, incidence of laboratory-confirmed disease can change markedly with augmentation or restriction of clinical testing or changes in diagnostic test methodologies, and syndromic surveillance systems can be subject to poor specificity and frequent false alarms. Thus supplementary information derived using methods such as the one developed by Chan and colleagues should be welcomed by public health professionals. The transparency of such systems may also help demonstrate the value of openness in disease reporting, which may have ''spillover effects'' on traditional surveilance systems. Figure 2 .

There are four major strengths in the SID-SSS. First, daily report of pre-diagnosis data from bottomup non-medical professionals in schools detected earlier peaks of EVI and ILI cases than those found from the conventional hospital-based surveillance system. School teachers and nurses participated in public health activities and shared the workload with local public health professionals, thus minimizing the size of clusters and the scale of epidemics. Second, inter-departmental coordination by the three government agencies in health, education, and social welfare through top-down systematic approaches helped to reach ultimate common goals of public health.

Efforts in the US to identify key domains for PHEP are consistent and have similarly identified 'health surveillance' [86] . Communication is an area that has been noted to be problematic in post-emergency event assessments; thus, it is positive that research is emerging under this theme [6, 87] . The social behavioural facets of communication relating to PHEP have recently been explored in the literature. For example, concepts of trust and preferences for certain characteristics of messaging highlight the contextual aspects that are emerging from PHEP communication research [40, 43, 45] . Important knowledge gaps were identified for communication in PHEP relevant to the use of emerging technologies. Education, Training and Exercises was another theme in which preliminary study on approaches to training for 'hard skills' such as technical skills and 'soft skills' such as leadership has been undertaken [53, 54] .

As outlined in the examples above, EU laboratory networks coordinated by ECDC as well as the European Commission over the last years have brought public health added value through fitforpurpose harmonization and validation of laboratory methods, quality assurance and training activities as well as contribution to preparedness and response for biological threats. The EULabCap surveys concluded that the EU/ EEA as a whole has a strong and improving public health micro biology system (7) . Its key assets include harmonized methods for AST, extensive reference laboratory services, and laboratory inputs within national and EU surveillance networks. The use of molecular typing for surveillance and laboratory participation in outbreak response showed significant progress. In an era of rapid progress in electronic recording and transmission of health data, it is noticeable that half of the EU/EEA countries have implemented automated electronic reporting of microbiology laboratory data to their national communicable disease or antimicrobial resistance surveillance systems (7) . To track the transmission of resistance genes needed for targeted control measures, ECDC has developed a protocol for genomicbased surveillance of carbapenemresistant and/or colistinresistant Enterobacteriaceae at the EU level (56) .

Emergency preparedness levels have been a concern globally in past emergencies; for example, Canada's response to the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak raised a number of issues: lack of surge capacity in the clinical and public health systems, difficulties with timely access to laboratory testing and results, and weak links between public health and the health care system were clear gaps in preparedness [3] . Recognizing complex and system-level challenges that affect emergency preparedness efforts globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) has called for all countries to create resilient integrated systems that can be responsive and proactive to any future threat, although this remains a knowledge gap [4, 5] .

The one health approach to zoonoses however remains an average priority for health care professionals. The impact of zoonoses on animal health has been largely neglected but the effects on public health usually drive control initiatives on zoonoses and are much better defined by the use of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYS) [30] . The first zoonoses prioritization exercise involving health professionals in North America who had a limited knowledge of infectious diseases identified zoonoses as an area of priority [31] . Another study reported that local public health agencies in North America were not prepared and potentially unaware of their responsibility to be the initiator of the work on zoonotic disease information intelligence [32] . The advancement of the one health approach has increased the discussion and reporting on the topic. There remains a lack of knowledge and application of the integrated approach to health care by the health care professionals. Reaching the goal of control, and elimination and/or ultimate eradication of zoonoses pose a significant challenge for the future. Standardized interlaboratory test validation, intersectoral collaboration and establishment of an international one health diagnostic platform are considered to be important strategies [33] . The sharing of best practices on diagnosis of zoonoses and the further refinement of new, cheaper, multispecies tests which can be interpreted by minimally trained individuals could contribute to a greater level of intersectoral integration, control, and elimination of zoonoses. The projection from one health may eventually lead to a one system approach based on the inherent challenges to intersect disciplines that belong to different systems. One health approaches applied across international boundaries that share the same challenges are required to create sustainable and coordinated control. The one system approach focusing on the strengthening of the community model health system as a whole as well as developing effective and novel tools to be applied across all aspects of health, is fundamental of a one world one health approach [34] .

Although previous studies [17, 21] and the results of our analysis showed the temporal relatedness of GDT and dengue incidence, relying only on search query data for making future public health decisions on dengue may trigger unnecessary panic from the public [48] . On the contrary, results from GDT can help to identify hotspots where further dengue investigations can be conducted. This is in line with the concept of 'now-casting' where potential locations for dengue cases can be predicted at present (through real-time monitoring of GDT data) rather than in the future to prevent outbreaks [16] . While countries with underdeveloped disease surveillance systems can greatly benefit from real-time monitoring of GDT data to supplement traditional epidemiologic investigations when identifying hotspots [17] , caution should still be made considering that not all actual hotspots can be identified due to variations in Internet access [16] . Overall, GDT's capability as an early warning signal for outbreaks can only be attained if it can be combined with meteorological, environmental, social, and entomological factors to produce a robust dengue prediction model [48, 54] .

The problems federations have with compliance with international treaties can occur at several levels. First, as already mentioned, the necessary powers to ensure compliance with a treaty may not fall within the jurisdiction of the federal level of government. While in many federations, the federal power to sign treaties may permit them to override the jurisdiction of regional governments, this is not necessarily always the case. And in scenarios in which the federal government does have the necessary constitutional authority, they may choose not to exercise it because of political concerns about creating confl ict with regional governments. Even in scenarios in which the federal government has the necessary legislative power and does choose to exercise it, regional governments may not be able to cope with the fi nancial and/or practical burdens of compliance [21] .

Decisions made by patients, health care providers, and public health professionals about seeking and providing health care and about reporting cases to health authorities are all influenced by the information environment, which changes constantly. Biases are therefore imbedded in surveillance systems; these biases need to be characterized to provide better situational awareness for decision-making purposes. Our goal is to develop a statistical framework to characterize influenza surveillance systems, particularly their correlation with the information environment. Methods: We identified Hong Kong influenza surveillance data systems covering healthcare providers, laboratories, daycare centers and residential care homes for the elderly. A Bayesian hierarchical statistical model was developed to examine the statistical relationships between the influenza surveillance data and the information environment represented by alerts from HealthMap and web queries from Google. Different models were fitted for non-pandemic and pandemic periods and model goodness-of-fit was assessed using common model selection procedures. Results: Some surveillance systemsespecially ad hoc systems developed in response to the pandemic flu outbreakare more correlated with the information environment than others. General practitioner (percentage of influenza-like-illness related patient visits among all patient visits) and laboratory (percentage of specimen tested positive) seem to proportionally reflect the actual disease trends and are less representative of the information environment. Surveillance systems using influenza-specific code for reporting tend to reflect biases of both healthcare seekers and providers. Conclusions: This study shows certain influenza surveillance systems are less correlated with the information environment than others, and therefore, might represent more reliable indicators of disease activity in future outbreaks. Although the patterns identified in this study might change in future outbreaks, the potential susceptibility of surveillance data is likely to persist in the future, and should be considered when interpreting surveillance data.",30.41595897713441,12.974579463141147

These studies have exemplified that if properly analyzed, high-resolution satellite imagery data can be extremely useful for understanding disease spread and implementation of control activities. Remote sensing using satellites has existed as far back as the 1960s and 70s. In contrast, in the last ten to twenty years, numerous studies have advanced several nontraditional data streams as tools to supplement public health surveillance systems.

Thus, although it has not been recognized and studied systemically, many influenza surveillance systems may reflect changes in the information environment as well as actual disease trends.

The broad and multifaceted practices of surveillance approaches are used to monitor the progress and outcome of interventions to mitigate or stop the progression of an outbreak, including of economically and ecologically important animal or plant species and the transmission of zoonotic diseases among animal and human populations over space and time, as well as to predict future transmission patterns [20, 22] . Currently, disease outbreak surveillance and detection relies heavily on the astute individual: the clinician, the veterinarian, the grower, and the livestock manager noticing both routine and suspicious symptoms and bringing them to the attention of the public health or veterinary community including academics and zoological parks. Most developed countries have a surveillance system in place and the ability to detect and diagnose human and animal diseases. Innovations and strategies for the surveillance and detection of human and animal diseases, and assessing the resource needs and opportunities for improving and coordinating infectious disease surveillance, early detection, tracing, case investigation, prompt reporting, and management are needed in upholding health systems strengthening and future sustainable development in most under resourced countries [21, 22] . Technological advances in disease surveillance and detection that have benefited public health surveillance such as rapid, automated, and sensitive biosensors; portable sampling and assay systems; and DNA-based diagnostic tools remain to be adapted to track animal diseases. Models and interventions incorporating M&E systems and true coordination and collaboration would enable optimal surveillance response, thereby driving policy and action, with a feedback process to facilitate continuous evolution and adaptation [20, 21] . Information would be drawn from a broad range of disciplines relevant to physical and mental health, as well as domestic and wild animal health and plant health, through the complementary processes of agent or disease surveillance and host and environmental monitoring with potential economic benefits of surveillance systems for all. Nevertheless, the release of surveillance information should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, as trust is not built by merely sharing data, but by helping people understand information that is context-specific. Active engagement to discuss the perception of risk of outbreak and identifying priorities for action is also essential. Community or regional active surveillance systems, new effective rapid diagnostic methods, and prompt reporting have the potential to advance infectious disease control and prevention efforts in Africa and elsewhere. Although, the Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community-Based Epidemics (ESSENCE), operated by the Department of Defense, allows epidemiologists to track-in real-timesyndromes reported in daily data feeds from regional hospitals and clinics, it is yet to be actively implemented in most Africa countries. Due to the persistent outbreaks of infectious diseases across Africa, it is crucial to analyze the applicability of surveillance response systems in order to improve the ability of hospital/health center triage systems to identify and appropriately treat patients who show symptoms associated with an emerging infectious disease, a threat of an infectious disease (e.g., influenza, SARS, and Ebola, as well as potential bioterrorism agents such as anthrax and smallpox), or an emerging infectious disease. Laboratory diagnosis may be possible by building a network of information about early warning alert and response systems that travels up or down the public health hierarchy, from the local to the international level and vice versa [20] [21] [22] . 4. Shifting towards an effective public and global health paradigm Due to globalization, health for all under the ""One Health"" initiate calls for immediate Ebola and other outbreak actions plans. A future, in which outbreaks and bioterrorism agents are continually reengineered to evade standard detection and diagnostic methods, as well as therapeutics, is imagined. Hence, Africa and the global community has no choice but to move from postsymptomatic to presymptomatic detection and diagnosis, and to prompt effective surveillance response systems that seek to benefit the global community. Ultimately, to reach the best-case scenario stage in which microbes are ubiquitous, constantly evolving, and adapting requires community and national surveillance policies to inform and guide action on the basis of importance, not for reaction and emergency to dictate priority [21, 22] . There is no magic bullet for changing paradigms; steady progress, albeit being slow, can be made through small successes. This needs to be properly recognized as an effective engine for change to educate the next generation of leaders early in their careers and encourage greater global, inter-, and trans-disciplinary awareness in future public health professionals. The quest for EEE in shifting the public and global health paradigm to achieve the MDGs post the 2015-2030 agenda, the ""One Health, One World"" and other global health initiates requires: Community outreach and advocacy, and local and international mobilization to combat outbreaks in Africa and globally.

Before the Ebola virus disease outbreak that occurred in 2014, the country had not yet adopted or implemented the revised IDSR guidelines (2010). Thus, public health surveillance was weak in Sierra Leone and may have contributed to the delayed case detection of the first Ebola cases [9] . The situation was aggravated by the infection of 328 health care workers with Ebola virus disease and the death of at least 152 [10] . Many volunteer health care workers, who constitute a considerable proportion of health workforce in Sierra Leone, resigned during the outbreak further worsening the shortage of health care workers. This led to the closure of health facilities thus interfering with collection and transmission of surveillance data. A rapid assessment conducted in 2015 showed that less than half of the health facilities were submitting weekly reports of priority diseases and often, the reports were submitted late. Thus, the surveillance system was in need of revitalization to ensure rapid detection of outbreaks and tracking of the progress of health events such as the Ebola virus disease outbreak. This paper describes the processes, successes and challenges of revitalizing public health surveillance in a country recovering from a protracted Ebola virus disease outbreak.

We estimated Ebola cases in three scenarios: a delayed response, a Liberia-like response, and a fast response scenario. Based on our estimates of the number of Ebola cases that could have occurred had Ebola spread to other countries beyond the West African foci, we emphasize the need for improved levels of preparedness and response to public health threats, which is the goal of the Global Health Security Agenda. Our estimates suggest that Ebola could have potentially spread widely beyond the West Africa foci, had local and international health workers and organizations not committed to a major response effort. Our results underscore the importance of rapid detection and initiation of an effective, organized response, and the challenges faced by countries with limited public health systems. Actionable lessons for strengthening local public health systems in countries at high risk of disease transmission include increasing health personnel, bolstering primary and critical healthcare facilities, developing public health infrastructure (e.g. laboratory capacity), and improving disease surveillance. With stronger local public health systems infectious disease outbreaks would still occur, but their rapid escalation would be considerably less likely, minimizing the impact of public health threats such as Ebola. Conclusions: The Ebola outbreak could have potentially spread to other countries, where limited public health surveillance and response capabilities may have resulted in additional foci. Health security requires robust local health systems that can rapidly detect and effectively respond to an infectious disease outbreak.",44.36789950871435,16.830617131793385

Figure 3 shows the classification of standard disease surveillance systems. Event-based surveillance systems are based on the organized, rapid capture, and reporting of information about outbreaks or events that can be a risk to public health [25] [26] [27] . However, rather than relying on official reports, this information is retrieved directly from witnesses of real-time events or indirectly from reports transmitted through various communication channels, such as social media, and information channels including news media and public health networks [28] . A great deal of attention from the public, and media interest, are associated with an epidemic [29, 30] . Health information monitored via the Internet and social media is a pivotal part of event-based surveillance and is most often the source emphasized by many existing surveillance systems [18] . Event-based disease surveillance systems can be classified into three main categories of news aggregators, automatic systems, and moderated systems. Moderated systems function so that information is processed by human analysts or is processed automatically before being analyzed by human analysts [31, 32] . These systems screen for epidemiological relevance of the data extracted within the information prior to being presented to the user [26] . Examples of this system include ProMED-Mail, GPHIN, GOARN, and Bio-Caster. The process by which automatic systems collect data is complex; it adds a series of steps for analysis, but differs in the levels of analysis performed as well as in the scope of information sources, language coverage, speed of delivery, and visualization methods. EpiSPIDER, Health-Map, EpiSimS, MedISys, and GETWELL are examples of automatic systems [33] [34] [35] . Finally, news aggregators include Google Flu Trends, which collect reports and articles from sources screened by language or country; by such means users can easily access many sources via a common portal but they are required to view each article individually [26] .",36.77543998209113,16.603512050277153

These changes were sufficient to spark integration between the ICT and public health issues, leading to the rise of web-based disease surveillance systems.

Since the initiation of these web-based surveillance systems as trial programs, many have evolved and become renowned over the past few years. Several general trends are observed among the characteristics of the 11 web-based surveillance systems. Most of the web-based surveillance systems were first developed in North America, particularly the United States, with abundant infrastructure and technological resources, when integration of ICT and syndromic surveillance for early detection and response to diseases was at a preliminary phase. As time progressed, other regions, such as Asia and Europe, have caught up by launching similar but distinct web-based surveillance systems, spreading the notion of early detection of disease outbreaks by real-time scanning and collecting, and analyzing unstructured information from diverse internet sources [62] . English was the only language in service in the earlier systems but, subsequently, the collection and analysis of data began to be published in different languages based on the service area. The scope of data sources has also expanded as newer surveillance systems extract information not just from secondary news reports but also from social media, web search queries, and various organizations such as the CDC, Central Intelligence Agency, and the WHO.",38.28890866785885,15.296436136587204

These challenges have led to the need for new approaches and technologies to reinforce the capacity of traditional surveillance systems for detecting emerging infectious diseases. In the last few years, the availability of novel web-based data sources has contributed substantially to infectious disease surveillance. This study explores the burgeoning field of web-based infectious disease surveillance systems by examining their current status, importance, and potential challenges. Methods: A systematic review framework was applied to the search, screening, and analysis of web-based infectious disease surveillance systems. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases to extensively review the English literature published between 2000 and 2015. Eleven surveillance systems were chosen for evaluation according to their high frequency of application. Relevant terms, including newly coined terms, development and classification of the surveillance systems, and various characteristics associated with the systems were studied. Results: Based on a detailed and informative review of the 11 web-based infectious disease surveillance systems, it was evident that these systems exhibited clear strengths, as compared to traditional surveillance systems, but with some limitations yet to be overcome. The major strengths of the newly emerging surveillance systems are that they are intuitive, adaptable, low-cost, and operated in real-time, all of which are necessary features of an effective public health tool. The most apparent potential challenges of the web-based systems are those of inaccurate interpretation and prediction of health status, and privacy issues, based on an individual's internet activity. Conclusion: Despite being in a nascent stage with further modification needed, web-based surveillance systems have evolved to complement traditional national surveillance systems. This review highlights ways in which the strengths of existing systems can be maintained and weaknesses alleviated to implement optimal web surveillance systems.",38.94195164599545,14.561873279765095

The front line of emergency response preparedness is people. Role perceptions of individual staff members of a given organization strongly affect response probability and performance. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine local public health employees' perceptions of emergency response responsibilities, identify factors that influence their perception, and indicate the challenges and bottlenecks of PHE response in the Health Inspection Institution (HII) after its separation from China's multiple Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Methods: We used a stratified randomized sample survey to examine HII workers' knowledge of their own duties concerning PHE response in 17 facilities in Heilongjiang, a province in northeastern China. Data were collected from May to July 2010 using a 9-item combined question inquiring about the workers' statutory duties. Results: Of 348 administered surveys, 309 were returned for an overall response rate of 88.8 %. Overall, the correct recognition rate of PHE responsibilities was low. Some HII workers were confused about their responsibilities required by law, regulations, and emergency response plans. A quarter of all the respondents had the lowest knowledge for PHE responsibilities. Factors influencing their perceptions of responsibilities were department, work experience in a CDC, and PHE response experience. Conclusions: To improve preparedness for a PHE, efforts are needed to train, support, and monitor the workers' knowledge and competencies in PHEs as part of an organizational change; the worker's knowledge of their responsibilities should be measured and used as an indicator of preparedness for a PHE, and training should be undertaken where there are deficiencies. Management should also encourage workers in the departments of food hygiene/school health surveillance to be more involved in PHE preparedness and response issues.",28.30870968658887,13.132339917577374

The goal of the CDC is to provide a central public health organization with responsibility for both community and individual health needs. The development of the CDC strengthened the Government's role in public health. 5 As public health and primary care share the common goal of improving the overall health of specific populations, it was decided to integrate the two systems by strengthening public health functions in primary healthcare settings. This approach could improve local public health surveillance and reinforce disease prevention and health promotion. 9 In order to resolve the problems of the increasing burden of healthcare expenses and limited access to health services, the Chinese Government initiated its CHS programme in 1997. 4 The 'threetiered' hospital system was replaced by the current 'twotiered' CHS centre system. The new system consists of ambulatory care in CHS centres and inpatient care in referral hospitals. 7 The main roles of the CHS centres are to provide high-quality, affordable, accessible primary health care and public health services to community residents.",34.29076263419283,13.598156558364852

Whilst many countries could track syndromic respiratory illness in primary care settings quite effectively (and some coupled this to virological surveillance), at the start of the pandemic, few had systems capable of doing much more than counting the number of hospital admissions due to respiratory illness. Ad hoc systems were devised in haste, but detailed clinical and epidemiological information on severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) was initially hard to locate. In the aftermath of the 2009 pandemic it has been recognised that SARI surveillance systems are critically important but mainly underdeveloped; and that their usefulness will extend over a broad range of acute respiratory pathogens, known and unknown.

Furthermore, there is considerable variation among states and organizations, especially those which are public, county-owned, or state-owned teaching institutions. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that healthcare facilities follow their respective federal, state, or local regulations as it is not a regulatory agency [17] . It is important to know these nuances. Studies show that hospitals are experiencing challenges with the implementation of their respiratory protection programs. Twenty-four states have state-approved OSHA plans. These state-level plans incorporate regulations that are at least as strict as those set forth by OSHA at the federal level. In August 2009, during the peak of H1N1 pandemic, California enacted the nation's first occupational standard for aerosol transmissible diseases [18] . The standard requires, among other things, that hospitals care for patients with pandemic influenza using respiratory protection that includes an N95 respirator at a minimum.

The ability to identify quickly the causative viral pathogen of an emerging viral epidemic markedly increases the chances of success of any countermeasures for containment, prevention and control of the possible disease. Surveillance of environmental viruses can underpin the detection of both cases and outbreaks by identifying an increase in frequency of disease above its background incidence (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2001 ) and by estimating disease impact. In addition, surveillance can help generate hypotheses and stimulate research, evaluating prevention and control measures and facilitating planning. Many countries and international organizations, notably the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), and international research projects have devoted considerable energy to developing integrated surveillance networks; these networks are for tracking environmental viruses including food-and water-borne viral pathogens such as NoV, RV and EV and for providing information about the viruses' genetic structure and geographical distribution and about the host populations and environmental matrix involved. Recent advances in molecular biology, including DNA chip technology and wholegenome sequencing technologies, continuously improve diagnostic power to detect and characterize a wide range of pathogens and their variants. Public health surveillance systems for outbreak detection can establish the relative value of different approaches for the detection of outbreaks at the earliest stages and provide the information needed to improve their efficacy. However, substantial costs can be incurred in developing, enhancing and managing these surveillance systems and investigating false alarms (Wagner et al., 2001) .

Surprisingly, an example from Washington D.C. suggests that at least for some types of hazards and in at least one region, welldefined roles were not clear (Schulman, 2015) . The DHHS in collaboration with the National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO) sought to determine how local health departments (LHDs) could best contribute to a large-scale chemical event response. A focus group of 33 local, state, federal, and nonprofit agency representatives in the National Capital Region met to discuss possible roles. The result of the focus group was that the participants had very different perspectives on the role of LHDs in a chemical response. Though LHDs have responsibility for protecting human health in all hazards, the role of LHDs was perceived to be limited to disease prevention and control and not really in responding to a hazardous material incident. As noted by Schulman (2015) , ""the perception of chemical incidents as hazardous material (hazmat) events, and not public health events, may result in LHDs being left out of the loop, even after the incident transitions to a mass casualty or mass fatality event."" She also identified the following roles for LHDs. l ""Public health surveillance activities are crucial to determining that an event has happened, as well as the nature of the event. Routine passive surveillance results can be monitored for unusual symptoms associated with chemical exposures. l LHDs' preexisting community relationships position them to be a trusted source of risk communications. While other responders handle the hazardous materials, LHDs have the ability to calm and inform the populace. l LHDs provide subject matter expertise to healthcare partners on matters such as the toxicity of chemical agents and sampling and screening approaches. If the agent is unknown, LHDs could use epidemiologic investigation methods to help identify it. l Other potential roles based on LHD expertise include: (a) coordinating the provision of mental and behavioral health services to affected communities; and (b) providing guidance to ensure the safety and health of on-theground responders.",34.04625958361315,14.987853095485077

An effective decontamination policy must determine safe public exposure levels, which depend on site use and individual susceptibility to infection. Little data exists on environmental background levels for common pathogens. Moreover, the scientific debate regarding the effects of low-level exposure to pathogens may be as contentious as the low-level radiation debate. Therefore, the seemingly simple question of how clean a site must be to ensure public safety will, in fact, be difficult to answer with existing scientific data. Answering this question should be the first priority for decontamination research. Pathogen levels will have to be monitored for months to years after an event, which is both expensive and complicated by the fact that some detection techniques (e.g., DNA sequence matching) do not distinguish living from dead pathogens. In addition, communicating the risks associated with residual contamination to the public in a credible way is vital to allay public anxiety and the economic consequences that flow from these fears.

Vital to reducing the spread and impact of zoonotic pathogens to humans and among animal populations is early detection and isolation, which first requires observations of the affected animal hosts either when they are sick or dead. Because the transmission route for zoonotic pathogens from animal host to humans is inherently complex, evidence can be presented to advocate for both active and passive animal surveillance (Olson et al. 2012) . We suggest that, in part because of this complexity, both should co-occur in comprehensive surveillance programs for disease prevention in humans and wildlife. We have shown that 75 zoonotic pathogens are known to cause extended morbidity or mortality in their animal hosts, and we argue that the quick reporting of these sick or dead animals could have prevented the subsequent or concurrent emergence in humans. Active animal surveillance programs, although essential, are often costly and must be operated by extensively trained personnel thus limiting the scope of surveillance efforts. Passive animal reporting monitoring, on the other hand is a monitoring system that can employ low-cost technology available to civil servants (e.g., park rangers) and the public (e.g., hunters, farmers, citizens) of all income levels, greatly expanding the geographic range of surveillance efforts. If zoonotic disease surveillance and monitoring were limited to the sampling of live animals, it would greatly limit the scope of the search to a small proportion of the public trained for such sampling. We therefore propose that integrating an animal morbidity and mortality surveillance program is fundamental for the success of public health surveillance systems. Pilot tests can easily be included in public health platforms initially in one to two zoonotic disease hotspots by merging public health surveillance systems with wildlife management efforts. Peri-urban regions near wildlife conservation areas would be ideal interfaces for such pilot tests and disease hotspots would provide a more opportunistic environment to evaluate the effectiveness of reporting sick or dead animals for pathogen detections. Recent use of mobile phone technology has proven highly successful in the public health sector (e.g., 'Outbreaks Near Me' application, [29] [30] [31] FrontlineSMS, 32; EpiSurveyor, 33) . It also offers a similar utility for animal morbidity and mortality monitoring because it can easily be integrated in citizen science approaches that encourage people to report animal mortality events as well as prioritization of reporting in high-risk pathogen transmission zones, such as conservation areas and regions where agriculture and wildlife overlap. We propose that mobile-based data collection could facilitate and rapidly mobilize surveillance teams for pathogen sampling by linking reporting by the public and civil servants to alerting mechanisms with local authorities. Once local authorities are alerted, dead animals can be sampled for the presence of pathogens and surveillance efforts can be initiated if animals have tested positively for zoonotic pathogens, thus focusing surveillance on target animals, pathogens, or areas. The challenges inherent in any system requiring large-scale surveillance of potentially small targets are both in the survey and reporting. For animal morbidity or mortality surveillance, reports may be biased toward larger animals-not only because they are more visible but because carcasses may persist for a longer period of time (Santos et al. 2011 )-, animals that are found near or in human habitations, or domestic animals (Table 1 ) because of their proximity to humans and financial value.",36.825622973976415,14.053498057373622

Both approaches may play complementary roles with current methods of public health surveillance 10-12 by assisting the physician and public health official with a continuously updated picture of the ''health status'' of a population. 13, 14 A focus of our research has been syndromic surveillance from free-text chief complaints routinely collected by triage nurses in EDs and acute care clinics during patient registration. We have deployed this type of surveillance at the 2002 Winter Olympics and in the States of Pennsylvania and Utah. We described a previous version of the RODS system, 12 but the system has undergone considerable subsequent development both architecturally and functionally.

Monitoring that relies on data from these Internet sources can be used to detect threats not specifically found by indicator-based surveillance, since this information relies less on data structured and filtered through the aforementioned preestablished structures for surveillance. Event-based surveillance can identify events faster than indicator-based reporting procedures can, and it can detect events that occur in populations not able to access formal channels for reporting. In addition, event-based surveillance can be used with other established indicator-based methods, thereby enhancing the combined arsenal for combatting critically prevalent pathogens with a high threat potential, such as influenza virus or Escherichia coli.

These data can be organized to provide information for political and administrative units such as counties or federal states, and/or geomorphological units, that is, basins. In the United States, since 1971, the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Environmental Protection Agency, and the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists have maintained a collaborative surveillance system which monitors the occurrence and causes of water borne-disease outbreaks (WBDOs) (Calderon et al., 2002 ). The surveillance system includes data for outbreaks associated with drinking water and recreational water. State, territorial, and local public health departments are primarily responsible for detecting and investigating WBDOs and voluntarily reporting them to CDC on a standard form. The unit of analysis for the WBDO surveillance system is an outbreak, not an individual case of a water-borne disease. Two criteria must be met for an event to be defined as a WBDO. First, more than two persons must have experienced a similar illness after either ingestion of drinking water or exposure to water encountered in recreational or occupational settings.

The delay in reporting may not be sufficiently sensitive to detect a disease outbreak as a diagnosis may take days to weeks. Knowledge of the type of surveillance systems upon which decisions are made may aid in planning the timing of the deployment of system health care resources when surge capacity is needed. To address all these challenges, the next generation of surveillance systems for notifiable disease called the National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NEDSS) will integrate the various reporting sources (labs, public) with clinical databases from hospitals, clinics, emergency rooms that are secured by Health Level Seven American National Standards Institute (HL7) security protocols for protected health information as well as an interface of automated grouping software (for syndromes), statistical and geospatial analysis (see Fig. 3 ). HL7 covers how messaging transactions regarding patient information to various data repositories are transmitted, authenticated, and determined to be complete and accurate (Edwards, 2008 ). This new system architecture will facilitate real-time surveillance and the early detection of outbreaks. The eventual integration of databases from outside the hospital setting, such as from pharmacies, is critical. Lack of access to health care and/or lack of health care insurance may prompt individuals to self-care/medications (e.g., purchase of over-the-counter antidiarrheals, cold remedies at pharmacies) or seek no care thereby missing and underestimating emerging diseases in some communities. The early detection of outbreaks through the integration of administrative data, public health data, laboratory data, and public/provider reporting through surveillance is an important strategy not only for preventing widespread disease outbreaks but also for combating infectious disease resistance to antibiotics through implementing control measures earlier when the first signs of increased statistical trends in diseases of public health importance emerge.

Biggs, when reflecting on the controversies that had greeted his efforts to mandate the reporting of tuberculosis cases-as he moved forward to begin the surveillance of sexually transmitted diseases in the early twentieth century-remarked that, ""[t]he ten year long opposition to the reporting of tuberculosis will doubtless appear a mild breeze compared with the stormy protest against the sanitary surveillance of the venereal diseases"" (Biggs, 1913) . Despite the existence of much opposition, the reporting of cases by name to local and state health departments and to special confidential registries ultimately became part of the tradition and practice of public health. u S courts almost always deferred to public health authorities that have deprived individuals of their liberty in the name of public health. one uS state high court declared at the beginning of the twentieth century that, ""[i]t is unquestionable that the legislature can confer police powers upon public officers for the protection of the public health. the maxim Salus populi suprema lex is the law of all courts in all countries. the individual right sinks in the necessity to provide for the public good"" (parmet, 1985) . Even more remarkably, a plenary grant of authority was still found to be constitutional in the 1960s. in upholding the detention of a person with tuberculosis pursuant to a statute that provided virtually no procedural protections, a california appellate court declared in 1966 that, ""[h]ealth regulations enacted by the state under its police power and providing even drastic measures for the elimination of disease…in a general way are not affected by constitutional provisions, either of the state or national government."" t he breadth of powers that public health authorities had enjoyed remained virtually unchallenged through most of the twentieth century, but finally came under increasing scrutiny during the last decades of that era. the development of a robust jurisprudence of privacy, and the ""due process revolution"", which extended rights to prisoners, mental patients and others under the authority of the state, ultimately questioned the long-held assumptions that had protected public health from constitutional scrutiny. the groundwork for this profound change was laid in the transformations that occurred in american politics, law and culture during the 1960s and 1970s. But it was the HiV/aiDS epidemic that forced a fundamental rethinking of the dominant ideology of public health. the methods of mandatory screening and examination, reporting the names of those who were sick or infected to public health registries and the imposition of quarantine once again became the subject of controversy and dispute (Bayer, 1989) .",30.67681234617466,15.264657451101165

Incidence surveillance for HIV infection has been adopted as a component of the existing national HIV/AIDS reporting system which covers 22 states. The ability to identify new from long-standing cases of HIV-infection aids in determining if there has been a shift in population subgroups at risk because of changes in risk factor patterns and if disparities in health care or access to health care. The new system confirmed that the majority of new cases (72%) continued to be among men having sex with men. The HIV incident surveillance system has identified an increasing disparity in the incidence of HIV. The rate among black males 13-29 years was found to be 7.1 times higher than comparable age white males. Among black females, the incidence rate was 14 times the rate in white females (Prejean et al., 2008) .

Those forces are still at work. Table 1 is a summary of some of the economic forces, including the rise of managed care organizations and their attendant accumulation of bargaining power with reference laboratories. In the face of ever-rising health care costs, hospitals are enduring unrelenting pressure to reduce laboratory costs, resulting in the formation of consortium laboratories among hospital groups, referrals of specimens to private reference laboratories, closings of smaller hospital laboratories, and reductions in laboratory staff. Table 2 shows the forces at work for clinical laboratories, which are fighting battles on two fronts to maintain staff levels against further erosion. Management is asking for workforce reductions, while fewer qualified applicants are available for open positions. With the closing of many medical technology schools over the past two decades, graduating medical technologists, clinical laboratory scientists, and technicians number less than half of projected workforce needs. At the same time, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) has placed new demands for secure patient information handling, adding another burden on laboratory staff (1, 2) . Table 3 lists the forces at work with public health laboratories. While engaged in traditional public health activities, these laboratories are experiencing multiple new pressures, including HIPAA and CLIA regulatory compliance issues, the need to be prepared for analytic response to bioterrorism acts, loss of state funding with a parallel need to bill Medicaid for patient testing and provide testing on a fee-for-service basis.

The project failed and the canal was abandoned and the land sold at public auction.

While IPC programs are frequently responsible for reporting hospital-associated infections within their facility, it is the responsibility for reporting communicable diseases that is relevant to defense against biological attacks. Communicable disease reporting requirements (also known as Infectious Disease Reporting) vary within each state and even county, but overall, there are state laws requiring medical providers to report notifiable disease to local public health departments [1] . While there is variation in the lists of notifiable diseases that states require healthcare providers to report, there is a general consistency of common and concerning microorganisms that includes all Category A agents and a majority of those listed within the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) bioterrorism agents page [2] [3] [4] [5] . Within hospitals and healthcare facilities, it is generally the IPC program that is responsible for reporting communicable diseases to local public health authorities. While laboratory reporting can and does happen, it is mostly incomplete information and commonly limited to the positive laboratory result and the name of the patient. The legal responsibility of reporting the communicable diseases ultimately tends to fall upon the infection prevention and control program, which must not only report such diseases with complete patient and laboratory information, but also within the required time frame. State reporting laws dictate the list of notifiable diseases and their required reporting time frame. For example, in California, the California Code of Regulations requires a report for West Nile virus infection be submitted by electronic transmission, telephone, or mail within one working day of identification, while a human or animal case of plague requires immediate reporting by phone [6] . These lists mirror that of the CDC's National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). In essence, the reporting structure commonly begins with the IP performing surveillance based off laboratory reports and daily reports of admitting diagnoses for newly admitted patients. From this surveillance, reporting is performed to the local health department, which will then report to the state health department, which then reports it to the CDC. In short, national diseases surveillance and reporting frequently starts with hospital IPC programs. IPC programs have a critical role in communicable disease reporting, which aids in public health response. The strength of the infection prevention and control program will be seen in their ability to perform more specific surveillance and real-time disease reporting. Poorly supported or minimally staffed IPC programs will likely rely solely on microbiology reports and might be delayed in their surveillance and reporting efforts. Some diseases, like Kawasaki syndrome, cannot be confirmed by laboratory tests, which can be challenging, but is overcome through daily chart review and a strong relationship with physicians and other clinical staff. Moreover, once a case is identified as a communicable disease that must be reported, the skilled IP will not only report the required information (e.g., laboratory results, demographics, contact info) but also relevant medical record information for the condition, which will include a timeline of illness, travel history, physician notes, etc. Such attention to detail facilitates a more rapid and efficient response from public health authorities. Overall, the infection prevention and control program within healthcare facilities is frequently the primary source of communicable disease reporting, which is a vital part of public health response during biological events.",32.46057563460374,15.741419179268444

However, the coverage or efficiency of public health surveillance systems worldwide is still far from uniform.

Hence, their surveillance is critical. Currently, many surveillance strategies and systems are in use around the world. An inventory of the data, surveillance strategies, and surveillance systems developed worldwide for the surveillance of infectious diseases is presented herein, with emphasis on the role of the microbiology laboratory in surveillance. Methods: The data, strategies, and systems used around the world for the surveillance of infectious diseases and pathogens, along with current issues and trends, were reviewed. Results: Twelve major classes of data were identified on the basis of their timing relative to infection, resources available, and type of surveillance. Two primary strategies were compared: disease-specific surveillance and syndromic surveillance. Finally, 262 systems implemented worldwide for the surveillance of infections were registered and briefly described, with a focus on those based on microbiological data from laboratories. Conclusions: There is currently a wealth of available data on infections, which has been growing with the recent emergence of new technologies. Concurrently with the expansion of computer resources and networks, these data will allow the optimization of real-time detection and notification of infections.",28.101166987669387,11.382944607226223

ESSENCE II transfers information to its users via secure websites. 31 To summarize, users can see data and results in different formats, including a map of the geographic distribution of data sent by users and clusters obtained by scan statistics or lists of alerts emitted after the detection processes. 31 ESSENCE II normally analyses data every 4 h but can also alter the processing period if real-time data are available. 31 The French armed forces developed a real-time syndromic surveillance system, ''le systè me d'Alerte et Surveillance en Temps ré el'' or ASTER. [32] [33] [34] Briefly, every 10 minutes, the system collects medical data routinely transmitted via secure Internet connections by doctors, paramedics, and nurses who live with the French armed forces deployed outside of the country. The data include the numbers of military personnel suffering from various symptoms, including cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and respiratory symptoms. Data are routinely analysed using the Current Past Graph method and the mean AE 2 or 3 standard deviations method .

The language of human rights is increasingly part of the landscape for health law in Australia and a See, for example, Public Health Act 1991 (NSW) s 23. internationally. [43] [44] [45] Given the potential for public health laws to impact upon the freedom of individuals, and the need for public health laws to balance the interests of individuals and society, public health laws will ideally have a transparent ethical framework, articulating the principles upon which state intervention will be premised. 46 The World Health Organization has acknowledged the importance of legal and ethical considerations to pandemic preparedness, noting that public health measures such as quarantine, compulsory vaccination and off-licence use of medicines 'need a legal framework to ensure transparent assessment and justification of the measures that are being considered, and to ensure coherence with international legislation (International Health Regulations)'. 47 Consideration of ethical issues is also essential for, as the World Health Organization has noted, ethical issues 'are part of the normative framework that is needed to assess the cultural acceptability of measures such as quarantine or selective vaccination of predefined risk groups'. 48 The exercise of state powers in terms of quarantine, isolation and detention during a public health emergency is likely to be particularly controversial in Western liberal democracies such as Australia. The extent to which the state can and should exercise its powers in this area has become increasingly relevant in public health, as is clear from debates over detention of tuberculosis patients, 49, 50 and from the use of quarantine during the SARS crisis. 51 Although comparable countries to Australia in Europe, the USA and Canada all have human rights charters or equivalents, which could provide procedural protections and safeguards for citizens in relation to quarantine and detention, Australia has yet to develop a Bill of Rights at the federal level. While Australian state and territory governments have begun enacting human rights legislation, 52 there is no comprehensive inclusion of human rights safeguards in the federal Quarantine Act, which raises issues about the mechanisms for ensuring procedural safeguards in the event of a pandemic. 53 Public health measures directed at implementing social distancing, quarantine or travel restrictions will not only infringe on individual liberties that are often taken for granted in Western societies, but are also likely to have a profound economic impact. As outlined above, estimates indicate that pandemic influenza will have a significant impact on the global economy. At local level, businesses may be closed or experience a reduction in their cash flow as public health measures are introduced or people stay home voluntarily. In such an environment, the economic cost to individuals and businesses may be significant, which in turn demands consideration of development of support systems and compensation systems for those affected. 54 In the USA, a great deal of work has been done on strengthening the public health laws, both generally and specifically for public health emergencies. The Turning Point Public Health Statute Modernization National Collaborative developed the Turning Point Model State Public Health Act. 55 In 2001, the Centre for Law and the Public's Health at Georgetown and Johns Hopkins Universities prepared a Model State Emergency Health Powers Act, setting out the powers for a state of public health emergency. The provisions of the earlier Model State Emergency Health Powers Act were adapted and included in the Turning Point Model Act. 56 Article V of the Turning Point Model Act deals with the powers of public health authorities, including the powers of quarantine and isolation. The Model Act provides that the principles to be applied in relation to quarantine and isolation include that they should be by the least restrictive means necessary to prevent the spread of disease (s 5-108[b](1)).

Significant additional funding to strengthen this capacity followed. In the U.S., the biodefense preparedness budget increased from $294 million in 2001 to $3 billion in the next year and to $5.2 billion in 2004. Of the funds committed since 2001, $3.6 billion was spent on state, local, and hospital preparedness, representing a substantial infusion of new money into public health systems that had seen little new funding in the preceding decade. 16 At the same time, the European Union (EU) established the Health Security Committee to develop a health information system, EU-wide surveillance, a database of the medicines stock, a facility to disseminate medicines and specialists, and health-specific protocols for a coordinated EU response to an attack. 17 By 2006 a growing concern about the possibility of pandemic influenza of avian origin in the U.S. led to an infusion of another $3.8 billion into preparedness activities. 18 The bulk of preparedness budgets in the U.S. was allocated to a range of related health activities intended to respond to acts of bioterror, emerging infectious diseases, and later pandemic influenza. Bioterror and pandemic preparedness investments included the upgrading of disease surveillance, hospital capacity to handle mass casualties, patient isolation systems, laboratory diagnostics for new biologic agents, and the enhancement of command and control structures as well as communication among health and emergency services agencies. 19 Public health officials became concerned that the singular focus on new threats might overshadow the traditional activities of public health departments and hospitals and weaken their ability to tackle existing challenges. 20 -23 Among the negative effects observed was the diversion of staff in hospitals and public health departments from routine activities to meetings and training sessions on preparedness, and reduced attention to nonbioterror-related concerns. Implementing new preparedness activities while maintaining ongoing activities proved to be a challenge. 20, 24 For example, the program to vaccinate health workers against smallpox-one of the most prominent bioterror-preparedness activitiescaused many health departments to defer or cancel other core public health activities, because of the burden of program work and the required monitoring for adverse effects. 17, 25 While infectious disease response may have received a boost from preparedness funding, chronic disease programs lost ground because of the diversion of managers' attention. 20 -22 However, not all preparedness funding was earmarked restrictively, and health managers were able to direct some of the preparedness funding to investments such as infrastructure-human resources and communication-which proved to have multiple uses. 19, 21 As described below, these investments were found to improve both the general functioning of public health departments and hospitals and their ability to handle traditional health threats (Table 1) .",32.96803334672238,14.062933778381794

Social media and internet based data has shown to play a role in sending early warning signals to public health authorities to take an informed course of action to prevent and control the spread of such diseases. This noticeable increase in new emerging infectious diseases has led to several challenges facing public health officials operating at different levels, locally, nationally and globally, to take the right action at the right time. Addressing such challenges in the era of Information Technology (IT) has called for effective use of new emerging technology development and approaches towards detecting, tracking, reporting, forecasting, and improving early warning systems and proper response (Milinovich et al. 2014c ). Nevertheless, most infectious diseases are still being traditionally monitored by passive and reactive public health surveillance systems, which are officially maintained by national public health authorities.

Traditionally, it has been applied to individuals with serious, life-threatening infections who have not or cannot be treated so as to be rendered noninfectious. The potential for bioterrorism-related illnesses, such as smallpox or pneumonic plague and the occurrence of SARS, have highlighted this issue. Quarantine, the separation or restriction of movement of persons who are not ill but are believed to have been exposed to infection, to prevent transmission of disease was developed in the 14th century but has been implemented rarely on a large scale during the past century. The SARS pandemic demonstrated that governments might use quarantine as a public health tool to treat infectious diseases, particularly if other preventive interventions (e.g., vaccines and antibiotics) are unavailable. 113, 114 In some instances, the best mechanism to prevent disease occurrence is through modification of the host, such as developing or boosting immunity through active or passive immunization.

Active surveillance involves a regular, systematic effort to contact reporting sources or to review records within an institution to ascertain information on the occurrence of newly diagnosed diseases or infections. An example of an active surveillance system for foodborne illnesses is FoodNet, which operates as part of CDC's Emerging Infections Program. 56 Active laboratory-based surveillance for confirmed cases of Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium, Cyclospora, E. coli O157:H7, Listeria, Salmonella, Shigella, and Vibrio increased from five sites, covering 5% of the U.S. population in 1996 to 10 sites covering approximately 15% of the population in 2007. Each clinical laboratory in the surveillance catchment areas is contacted weekly or monthly to ensure that all confirmed infections under surveillance have been reported. These data have been extremely useful in establishing national estimates for the burden of foodborne illness in the United States and for monitoring trends in the incidence of specific foodborne agents. Passive surveillance relies on the individual clinician or laboratory to initiate the report. For many diseases of public health importance, passive surveillance can be almost as comprehensive as active surveillance. Although surveillance systems are labeled as active or passive based on how cases are reported, all surveillance systems require an active review and analysis of reported cases, with dissemination of results to key stakeholders. 44 Two key qualities of community-based surveillance for infectious diseases that must be considered when interpreting surveillance data are representativeness and timeliness. These qualities vary by disease and depend on multiple factors. The first factor of importance is that the patient must seek medical attention. It is not common for persons with mild or limited illnesses to seek medical attention. Second, the physician must seek laboratory testing of appropriate clinical specimens to confirm the diagnosis. Third, the laboratory must have the capability to identify the agent. Fourth, the physician and laboratory must report the clinical and laboratory findings to public health officials in a timely manner. Fifth, the availability of molecular subtyping techniques such as PFGE and the ability to compare PFGE patterns electronically through the national computer network PulseNet can greatly increase both the sensitivity and the specificity of pathogenspecific surveillance. Even in states where laboratory-based infectious disease reporting is required, there may be confusion among physicians and laboratory officials regarding who has the responsibility for reporting. Finally, public health agencies must have the resources to conduct timely and routine follow-up of such reports, to ascertain basic case demographic and other relevant data. Failure at any step of this process results in loss of information to the community-based surveillance system.",29.476658723390088,12.359126846564408

Although the threat of Ebola importation contributed to preparation of an eff ective response, the other countries already had components of the GHSA in place, and although not fully developed it showed that even nascent capacity was crucial in facilitation of a timely response. In Nigeria, a dedicated public health emergency operations centre for polio eradication and a cadre of Field Epidemiology Training Program-trained 56 epidemiologists facilitated the multi sectoral coordination and extensive contact tracing eff orts needed to control the outbreak once it spread as it spread within Lagos, and from Lagos to a second city. 51 A common theme in quelling the Ebola importation events has been the ready availability of trained ministry of health staff who used existing surveillance systems, laboratories, and public health emergency operations capabilities to quickly control Ebola.

In work environments where exposure to M. tuberculosis may occur -such as healthcare settings, residential care facilities, shelters, and correctional facilities -active TST surveillance among susceptible individuals is indicated. Periodic TSTs are especially important in the wake of several recent outbreaks associated with drug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis in hospitals, adult care settings, and home healthcare settings. 16 Skin testing should be performed at least annually in these settings, and perhaps as often as every 6 months, for personnel at high risk for exposure to active TB. Surveillance of teachers, travelers to endemic areas, and employees in other institutional settings where close contact with infected individuals is possible also may be warranted, depending on the local prevalence of TB. 14 Surveillance for infections among laboratory workers and animal handlers exposed to specific pathogens should be individualized in accordance with standard guidelines for biosafety in microbiologic and biomedical laboratories. 47 Maintaining standardized records of reportable infectious diseases is an important component of passive surveillance in the workplace. Centralized collection and assessment of these records at regular intervals may allow early detection of outbreaks of occupational infections amenable to specific control interventions. Geographic or temporal clusters of cases or clustering among persons with similar attributes or occupational tasks suggest a common source of exposure and infection and warrant investigation.

However, as in other resource-poor regions, capacity for animal health surveillance in southeast Asia is underdeveloped. 53 Major constraints include the absence of specifi c government policies and legal frameworks for surveillance and control of zoonoses, as well as inadequate resources, insuffi cient animal-human public health cooperation, coordination, and collaboration, frail laboratory facilities, and weak and disconnected reporting systems. 54 The emergence of SARS and the H5N1 and H1N1 (2009) viruses focused minds and brought investment. In Laos, for example, until 2004 there was almost no national infrastructure for communicable disease control. 55 Initially, the Law on Hygiene, Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (2001) was the only law that addressed communicable diseases, and it principally applied to prevention rather than control and response. 56 In the wake of H5N1 infl uenza outbreaks, however, the government established several new institutions to strengthen national capacities, including a National Coordination Committee on Communicable Diseases, a National Emerging Infectious Disease Control Offi ce, and a Centre for Laboratory and Epidemiology that has recently been designated the national focal point for the implementation of the International Health Regulations. 56 Similarly, the governments of Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Cambodia, Malaysia, and the Philippines have all set up new institutional bodies, strengthened diagnostic laboratory capacity, and improved coordination mechanisms. Although gaps in national planning and surveillance systems persist, countries in southeast Asia have made substantial progress towards eff ective prevention and control of infectious diseases. 57 Crucially, surveillance systems for infl uenza have started to integrate elements of animal health, particularly poultry-related incidents. 57 For example, rapid response teams have been mobilised and trained to improve community-based surveillance in 331 districts in Indonesia. In Laos and Cambodia, a substantial amount of donor funding has been used to support pandemic preparedness and responses, including development of surveillance systems. Laboratory capacity to handle infl uenza viruses has improved-for example, through the building of biosafety level 3 laboratories in Indonesia and Cambodia for virus sequencing. 57 Regional public health institutions have become sensitive to the threat posed by zoonoses. ASEAN member states have recently endorsed a Regional Mechanism on Animal Health and Zoonoses, to develop a unifi ed framework against threats from animal diseases. 58 Moreover, the integration of animal and human health has been at the centre of WHO's Asia-Pacifi c Strategy on Emerging Diseases-an ambitious strategic framework that aims to develop mechanisms for information sharing between the animal and human health sectors both at regional and country levels, in partnership with the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Organization for Animal Health. 59 The overlapping functions of some regional institutions and their substantially diff erent geographic coverages are described on webappendix p 4.",33.30640384800075,13.139612728470498

For example, it would be absurd to use only the symptom of fever to attempt to establish a working diagnosis of inhalational anthrax in an individual, but it would be very reasonable to establish a working diagnosis of anthrax release in a community if we were to observe a pattern of 1,000 individuals with fever distributed in a linear streak across an urban region consistent with the prevailing wind direction two days earlier.

These states are characterized by a history of underfunding of health and surveillance systems, unreliability of access to drugs, continuing increase in diseases such as drug-resistant tuberculosis and HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and inadequate public health responses to disease. 46 Since these states have entered into the EU, citizens can cross borders into other, better-resourced states. In the context of a pandemic, this could mean an influx of persons who are possible disease carriers from poor states with a frail public health system and with insufficient medicines, to other EU states, putting citizens at risk and draining health resources in those states.

Accurate communication of infectious disease risk assessments to the general public and policy makers is thus key to rationalise the broader debate for this issue.",25.535743075535798,12.361824992571409

Every public health jurisdiction in the country has the responsibility to develop and maintain the capability to carry out first response and federally assisted mass drug dispensing and vaccination campaigns tailored to its local population. At least four reasons underlie this rule: 1. Local mass prophylaxis activities need to be under way before the arrival of any federal assets. 2. Federal or state assistance will not include sufficient personnel to fully command or staff community-wide mass prophylaxis dispensing operations. 3. Mass prophylaxis operations are likely to remain under local control even after federal or state assets are delivered. 4. Dispensing and follow-up operations are likely to continue after the departure of federal or state assets . Once requested, assets from the SNS are likely to arrive in less time than it takes to set up a network of fully functional dispensing or vaccination centers. Each center must have a well-defined supply route linking it to the receive, store, and stage site for these SNS materials, as well as to any local stockpiles (see Fig. 12 .4). Most local stockpiles are predesignated for use by local first responders, hospitals, and emergency management personnel to ensure that they are ready to work with the public as soon as or before federal assets arrive. Onsite stockpile management requires the ability to ensure proper storage (eg, coolers), inventory management, and security of supplies. If the center is dispensing drugs or vaccines under investigational new drug protocols, local staff may have to track the patients to whom those supplies are distributed. However, recent legislative proposals call for the creation of emergency use authorizations (EUAs) to facilitate rapid dispensing of off-label or investigational medicines and vaccines in the setting of mass prophylaxis (Hupert et al., 2004) .",42.75613381055662,17.93340397433126

An interesting point raised by Mandl and his colleagues is the need for truly unique person identifier, so that individuals are not double-counted as they move between healthcare institutions (sometimes during the same day). Mandl et al also suggest using data already collected for other purposes whenever this is possible, since implementing new data collection processes can have prohibitive costs, and healthcare workers have repeatedly demonstrated poor compliance with additional data collection and administrative tasks.

In our analysis, Weibo served as a platform leveraged by central/provincial governments, local news agencies and the public for the timely release and retrieval of information. The Chinese social networking sites' timeliness of reporting are significantly better compared to international mainstream media in English, official websites of the central Chinese government and WHO. Information was released by the local news agencies on the social networking site in the local language before any reports in the conventional news websites or government websites. The information was subsequently amplified by the social networking sites through re-posting of the original report. This allowed the international community greater access to more detailed and timely information compared to that released at the central government level to the international media. The central Chinese government may have allowed the provincial/municipal health authorities to release information on new cases when available to ensure transparency and timeliness of public communications. The access to such timely, crowd-sourced information on infected cases greatly facilitated the understanding of the epidemiology of an unknown disease, which is key in developing effective prevention and control measures. public health practitioners, social media surveillance could provide early warning for unusual public health events in a foreign country and serve as an additional source of epidemiological intelligence to complement conventional surveillance tools. For local public health authorities, social media surveillance could function as an effective platform for public education and social mobilization. The underlying value coupled with the challenges of using social media warrants future research and collaboration between public health agencies and computational scientists to enhance its use in disease outbreak surveillance and response.",32.48568709839432,14.1605815753556

For example, Dr David Kern recognised that the occurrence of interstitial lung disease in two young men from the same small nylon flock plant indicated a likely risk for other employees. 1 Similarly, Dr Alan Parmet reviewed medical records compiled by a lawyer for eight former microwave popcorn plant workers with bronchiolitis obliterans. 4 Half of these cases were on lung transplant lists-hardly to be expected in a young worker group from one small plant-and he reported the cases to public health authorities. In automotive plants with clusters of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, labour unions pressed for investigations of work-related aetiology across the industry. At a plant in Massachusetts, herbicide workers and their physicians suspected a work-related cause of occupational asthma because of work-related symptoms. In this instance, the trigger for public health investigation was a state-based surveillance system for occupational asthma, which identified the asthma cluster from individual case reports submitted by multiple physicians. In summary, physicians, workers, lawyers, and public health surveillance systems are the reservoirs of recognition of emerging causes of occupational lung disease.",34.108319853014365,13.867317709320101

Indeed, many of the issues that must be addressed for influenza are relevant to responses to other potentially widespread emerging infections (eg, SARS) and bioterrorism agents (eg, smallpox virus). 32 Figure.

Usually, these systems are based mainly on nationally organized sentinel networks of physicians, covering at least 1 to 5 % of the population in their countries, and on hospital reports of clinically suspected or laboratoryconfirmed influenza cases [5] . In Portugal, the National Influenza Surveillance Programme aims to collect, analyze, and disseminate information on influenza activity, identifying and characterizing influenza virus in circulation in each season, as well as performing the identification of emerging viruses with pandemic potential that pose a risk to public health. In this way, it seeks to contribute to decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with infection and its complications. The data from the National Influenza Surveillance Programme also allow orientation for prevention and control of influenza. The surveillance programme integrates the clinical and virological component enabling: (1) to estimate the morbidity of the disease through determining the weekly incidence rates of influenza-like illness and identification of outbreaks in population under observation; (2) identify and characterize the virus influenza strains circulating and quantify their presence in the population under observation, during the period of influenza activity; (3) through the information gathered and after its evaluation, promote intervention at health services in actions for prevention and therapy advising.

Observation of vector-borne infections should also include systematic monitoring to determine the distribution and competence of autochthonous or newly emerging vectors, monitoring of non-human reservoir species (Jansen et al. 2007 ) and targeted studies on other pathogens which are not notifiable in Germany at present, e.g. West Nile virus (Linke et al. 2007 ). The availability of such studies in turn depends on priority allocation of resources to public health. Finally, physicians need to include emerging or reemerging infections in their differential diagnosis to timely diagnose, treat and control the infection (Haas et al. 2004 ). In addition to mandatory surveillance, well-functioning networks of medical institutions (infectious disease departments, institutes of tropical medicine, hospitals, general practitioners) are necessary to early detect imported tropical diseases and occurring cases of autochthonous transmission. Close cooperation between physicians, laboratories and the public health service on local, federal and state levels is warranted to accomplish this requirement. At present, though, the German surveillance system is well equipped to detect both largescale and sporadic cases of imported or autochthonous vector-borne infections in a degree of spatial and temporal discrimination that is sufficient to serve as a basis for public health recommendations and preventive measures.",36.92581338523422,17.65486881130445

In the process, the surveillance systems act as intermediaries, facilitating a localglobal dialogue. The technologies are largely deployed and developed by organisations in the global North, yet their success is dependent on the reporting of events in places across the global North and South. Moreover, decisions made by these systems to issue alerts are, in the main, dependant on uncovering largely 'informal' information broadcast through local press reports, news wires and online sources such as discussion sites (Grein et al., 2000) . In the case of H1N1, our research has demonstrated that, through a process of 'verification', this information became 'formalised' and established a basis for issuing global alerts. Thus, implicit in this local-global interaction, was detailed analysis derived from information in the public domain, on what was said rather than what was left unsaid.

Cooperation with the WHO was deemed, therefore, to be highly desirable.

In addition, the potential impact of climate change on vector-borne diseases has been identified as an important public health issue (Sutherst 2004) . Hence, contemporary surveillance of vector-borne diseases that are sensitive to climate-including both autochthonous and imported infections-needs to detect and respond to the impacts of climate change on human health. We investigated routine surveillance data of imported and autochthonous vectorborne diseases in Germany to evaluate the performance of the national surveillance system with respect to geographic and temporal trends of vector-borne infections. Looking at hantavirus infection as an example for a vector-borne disease endemic in Germany, national trends are accurately and timely detected by routine surveillance. In 2005, the increase in hantavirus cases affecting not only the known endemic areas but also several urban areas prompted us, in collaboration with federal and local public health departments, to carry out a nationwide case-control study into the risk factors of hantavirus infection. The results formed the basis for increased surveillance and control of rodent populations in selected areas and for targeted prevention measures (Abu Sin et al. 2007 ). In early 2007, it has been recognised that the number of notified hantavirus infections strongly increased ). As in previous years, most infections were reported from the federal state of Baden-Württemberg, but in most endemic regions, infection rates never had been as high as in 2007. The incidence of human hantavirus infections is known to be correlated with the population size of the bank voles, which serve as the main reservoir of hantavirus in Germany and which are particularly abundant in endemic regions. It is well known that the geographical distribution and epidemiology of hantavirus reflects the distribution and density of the reservoir rodent (Augot et al. 2006) . The dynamic of the bank vole population follows a 3-to 4-year cycle, often with two consecutive high density years (Rose et al. 2003) . The winter season 2006/2007 was exceptionally mild, and in many endemic regions, there was no snow cover. In addition, there was an abundant supply of beech mast in the autumn of 2006. These conditions resulted in higher overwinter survival rates of rodents and in rapid onset of the breeding season in early spring or an extension of the reproductive activity over the winter (Krautkrämer and Zeier 2008) . Due to the early detection of the upcoming hantavirus epidemic in 2007, it was possible to timely inform public health authorities and to address general recommendation for the prevention of hantavirus infections. The efficacy and performance of these recommendations, however, need to be evaluated and possibly adapted in forthcoming hantavirus seasons. In addition, further studies about the interrelation of ecologic factors (including climate), bank vole population cycles and disease incidence among humans are necessary. In this context, systematic monitoring programs of the rodent population are warranted. Such information may help to predict future epidemics in time.",30.982111887486923,13.365143057429048

This is reflected in increasing demand, rising costs, and a return towards curative and hospital care, making re-exploration of the Alma-Ata principles both timely and relevant. 3 A better alignment of a population-based public health approach with personal health services is needed urgently, along with better integration of personal health care and public health. To quote van Weel et al., primary care needs to be organized on the principle of care for individuals in the context of the population, and the future of primary care, and health care in general, will depend on how effectively a community-oriented approach and its contribution to equity and social cohesion is achieved. 2 The recognition that health systems play a key role in public health has been endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in the report 'Primary Health Care -Now More Than Ever', published on the 30 th anniversary of the international conference of Alma-Ata. Arguing the need to revisit Alma-Ata, the report identifies four broad policy directions of improving health for all: tackling health inequalities through universal coverage; putting people at the centre of care; integrating health into broader public policy; and providing inclusive leadership for health. 4 This approach requires public health strategies as well as clinical skills in meeting the needs of populations, particularly the poor and vulnerable, and is congruent with the influential report from the Commission on Social Determinants of Health which stresses the relevance of an ecological approach to health, essential to achieving the millennium development goals. 5 The implicit need for stronger public health was again re-inforced by the 2009 WHO World Health Assembly resolution which calls for primary healthcare services to provide health promotion and disease prevention as well as curative care and palliative care, and for integration and co-ordinated practice to take account of the needs of populations and to promote active participation by all people. 6 The corollary to these global health policy developments is an increasing interest in appropriate educational strategies, and a growing recognition that public health education must change if it is to meet the needs of modern societies, the health threats they face and the challenge of developing equitable health systems.",26.705978319395975,11.437889269860872

In the broader context of communities and larger populations, it involves a public health system and infrastructure designed to detect perturbations in the baseline occurrence of either symptoms, as is the case with syndromic surveillance systems, or diseases, as is the case with a standard public health system of reporting. Syndromic surveillance systems, such as monitoring prescription drug sales from retail pharmacies, have been used to successfully track influenza activity and that of other emerging infectious diseases and have been proposed as surrogate indicators of early disease activity. 39 QUARANTINE Quarantine, the physical separation and geographic restriction of groups of uninfected individuals potentially exposed to a communicable illness, has been variably considered to be a management strategy following bioterrorism. The potential effectiveness, feasibility, legality and consequences of quarantine were reviewed following the USA anthrax attacks. 40 The logistics of this approach are complex and impractical and it can be associated with adverse consequences such as increased risk of disease transmission among a quarantined group or public unrest. It seems clear that there are only limited scenarios in which the potential public health benefits of the imposition of quarantine may outweigh the potential problems it engenders; these scenarios involve highly transmissible, lethal agents.

Since then, the adoption of the revised International Health Regulations in 2005 has implemented new regulations such as national obligations to guarantee a set of core surveillance and response capacities to prevent international spread of disease irrespective of its origin (biological but also chemical or radio-nuclear sources). 3 Furthermore, new diseases have emerged (H1N1pdm09, Middle East Coronavirus), some others have spread dramatically such Ebola virus disease in West Africa. 4 In the context of globalisation, the concept of public health surveillance has evolved to include public health security. 5, 6 Politicians and stakeholders rely upon their public health agencies to be informed in a timely fashion and to be able to respond promptly to all potential health treats that may arise as populations need protection whatever the risk. For public health surveillance, this implies the need to monitor a very large spectrum of all hazards health threats. At the same time, as many public agencies are currently facing budgetary constraints, they must allocate theirs resources as efficiently as possible, as surveillance systems cannot be implemented for all known health threats. The priorities for diseases surveillance need to be reviewed regularly in order to guarantee that the most topical public health issues are consistently tackled and to ensure quality and effectiveness of surveillance. Furthermore, best practice recommends periodic evaluation of public health surveillance systems (PHSS). 7 Like other national public health agencies, 8 the French National Institute of Public Health (InVS) has implemented several prioritization exercises to guide its own surveillance strategy. [9] [10] [11] It has also implemented an external and formal evaluation process of its surveillance systems, based on a generic evaluation protocol drawn up in accordance with the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines, 12 and using a design developed by the European Center for Diseases Prevention and Control (protocol provided by Dr A. Ammon, personal communication). Four surveillance systems for infectious diseases were assessed between 2009 and 2013. 13 Given the current economic context, this assessment process was less than comprehensive as it did not consider the increasingly important question of the costs and the benefits of surveillance systems. The CDC guidelines 12 indicate that costs should not be estimated alone but be judged relative to benefits or at least relative to the effects of the surveillance system on prevention, care, research or decision-making. The guidelines state also that 'a more realistic approach would be to judge costs on the objectives and usefulness of the system'. However, the CDC guidelines do not clearly define methods to do so. A WHO report issued in 2005 underlined that the evaluation of the costs and the benefits of national surveillance and response systems was an area of great importance. In the report, the authors indicated that little related work has been carried out to that point and highlighted a number of methodological difficulties in evaluating benefits of a surveillance and response system such as implementing the appropriate study design, defining the scope of the surveillance or assigning a monetary value to health outcomes averted. 14 To assess the current development of economic evaluations in the field of public health surveillance, we performed a systematic review of the literature. In this review, we also assessed the methods used in the selected studies to evaluate the benefits of public health surveillance.",47.50558559733529,19.004220257433897

One attempt separated systems into those based on a ''data collection system that is dedicated to the purpose of this public health surveillance'' (e.g., during a specific event) and those for the day-to-day monitoring of ''data that are routinely collected for other purposes'' [27] . Another categorization divided systems by data source: those data sources based on the use of health-care services and those based on health-related behaviors [6] . While these are useful distinctions to make when examining syndromic surveillance systems, they are not the most fundamental. The proposed categorization within the scope of this research addresses the most critical distinction among syndromic surveillance systems, which is the level of specificity of the outcome under surveillance. The distinction between data sources as sub-categories within each of the two larger categories (specific and non-specific detection) is taken into consideration because there is a fair amount of overlap. As noted in Table 2 , the data sources used in SNS systems can include those data sources used in SBS systems, but frequently focus primarily on pre-clinical data.",37.2745416367553,13.744512825864138

The literature review makes evident that many systems that are considered ''syndromic surveillance'' are less IT-dependent, may include some manual component, and have much broader applicability. The importance of taking an all-inclusive view to the field of syndromic surveillance is put best by Fricker: ''a myopic focus only on early event detection for bioterrorism in syndromic surveillance systems misses other important benefits electronic biosurveillance can provide, particularly the potential to significantly advance and modernize the practice of public health surveillance'' [43] .",35.089958565631264,13.39033890964544

Significant medical school debt can drive new physicians away from the ID specialty and public health. Targeted loan repayment opportunities would allow more physicians to pursue these critical career paths. In July 2018, in a move supported by IDSA, the US House of Representative's Energy and Commerce Committee passed legislation that would authorize the CDC to provide loan repayment for those who serve in the Epidemic Intelligence Services (EIS). More than 85% of EIS officers continue serving in public health roles, and this proposal would significantly help make this career path more financially feasible for physicians. Such loan forgiveness opportunities could also be broadened to support ID physicians who work in public health at the federal, state, or local level and face similar challenges around compensation and medical student debt. Establish financial compensation for ID physicians who work in public service (eg, local, state, and federal public health agencies) or who do ID work that provides broader public health benefits (infection control and antimicrobial stewardship). Physicians who perform infection control and antimicrobial stewardship work should be compensated for these activities. As part of hospital accreditation, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) mandates that every participating facility have an active infection control program [37] . States could attach an accreditation process to such mandates that would formally document ID clinicians who oversee hospital infection control and antimicrobial stewardship committees, with loan forgiveness or other financial incentives attached to this accreditation. Ensure that ID physician compensation reflects public health value added. As a cognitive specialty, many of the clinical services ID physicians provide are billed under Evaluation and Management codes, which have not been reevaluated in more than 20 years. The CMS should update these codes to reflect the increasingly complex care provided in inpatient and outpatient settings. Public and private payers, healthcare systems, and hospitals should also provide appropriate compensation and protected time for nonclinical services that are crucial to public health, including infection prevention and control, antimicrobial stewardship, and bioemergency preparedness and response. Fully fund local, state, federal, and global public health agencies and build a competent workforce.

Local officials use this system when responding to natural disasters, as well as to man-made incidents. Its use would be equally appropriate in the response to a biological attack. Under the ICS, a designated official, often the fire chief or the chief of police, serves as local incident commander. In any incident, when local resources or capabilities are exceeded, the local incident commander may request assistance from the state through the State Coordinating Officer (SCO).

We analogously need streamlined, real-time output from the microbiology laboratories with centralized data aggregation to detect spread of resistant organisms and direct appropriate local and public health countermeasures. Here, the authors review some of the major existing resources that have supported our public health efforts and also identify programs and policies that could be of significant benefit. Governments, standards organizations, researchers, industry, and clinical microbiology laboratories should continue to collaborate to better address unmet public health goals and individual needs of infected patients.",33.49868096620327,14.427703714357515

It is a three-in-one strategy to help countries: (1) strengthen the generic capacities for managing emerging diseases, (2) improve pandemic readiness, and (3) build up to meet the IHR core capacity requirements for surveillance and response. APSED (2005) identified five programme areas as priorities for national capacity-building, namely surveillance and response, laboratory, zoonoses, infection control and risk communication. Through the collective efforts of countries and areas, WHO and partners, considerable progress has been made in all five APSED (2005) capacity areas. For example, most countries have now established event-based surveillance systems to detect public health events including disease outbreaks. Trained rapid response teams (RRTs) are able to conduct field investigations quickly. The capacities of the national influenza centres have been significantly improved. These capacities were tested through a realworld global public health event -Pandemic (H1N1) 2009. The pandemic response clearly demonstrated the value of regional investment in capacity-building. 15 The 2005 Strategy has been recently revised in response to requests from countries and areas following recent developments and evolving needs. The updated Strategy, now called the Asia Pacific Strategy for Emerging Diseases (2010), also known as APSED (2010), was endorsed at the sixty-first Session of the Regional Committee for the Western Pacific in October 2010. 16 It builds on the experiences and accomplishments gained from implementing APSED (2005) and takes into account the key lessons learnt from the pandemic response, the needs expressed by countries and areas and the technical advice provided by experts during the intensive country and regional-level consultations between July 2009 and October 2010. Table 1 shows the similarities and differences between APSED (2005) and APSED (2010). APSED (2010) aims to build sustainable national and regional capacities and partnerships to ensure public health security through preparedness planning, prevention, early detection and rapid response to emerging diseases and other public health emergencies.

Numerous factors must be considered when a minor patient requests confidential health care, including the best interest of the patient, future patient attitudes toward health care, concerns of the parents, federal and state laws, and public health issues. [59] [60] [61] Physician attitudes about issues of adolescent confidentiality show considerable variation in different health care settings. 62, 63 For minors who do not meet criteria for emancipation or ''mature minor'' status and whose conditions do not receive statutory confidentiality protection, issues of confidentiality can be difficult. For example, parents may request health information about their child, but the minor patient may, for a variety of reasons, request that the information not be disclosed to them. Ideally, education of minor patients about the importance of parental involvement in their health care may bridge the gap between the parties. In most such cases, minor patients should be encouraged to be open about health care decisions with their parents. If consent cannot be obtained from the minor patient, the issue of disclosure to parents becomes more controversial. Some argue that parents have a right to receive health information about their dependent children. Others believe that minor patients have the same rights of privacy and confidentiality about health care as adults, particularly because adolescent minors are more likely to seek health care when confidentiality is ensured. 64, 65 In general, decisions about disclosure without consent of a minor patient should be made in the best interests of the patient and his or her parents, with careful consideration of state and federal law.",30.11340613476129,12.18935254374238

Surveillance is the systematic, ongoing collection, management, analysis, and interpretation of data to stimulate and guide action. The best-recognized use of surveillance is the detection of epidemics and community health problems. Big data has the potential to accelerate early detection of outbreaks and other community health issues. 4 New technologies will accelerate timeliness and completeness of electronic laboratory reporting for notifiable conditions. Tracking population movements and contact of potentially infected individuals can also be modernized using available technologies. For example, during the West African Ebola outbreak, mobile phone data provided objective, real-time information on location and movement of people to pre-empt future outbreaks. 7 Population data are also used to detect changes in health behaviors, monitor changes in environmental exposures, and evaluate control measures. The quality of surveillance will improve owing to new data sources, such as electronic health records, and communication methods, such as mobile technologies. More-accurate laboratory technologies will allow tracking of trends in environmental exposures and disease outcomes. The growth of interconnectivity in digital information can be used to monitor health both at the individual and population levels. Population disease surveillance systems, such as cancer registries, will benefit from enhanced refined diagnostic classification of diseases by adding molecular markers of etiology and treatment response as exemplified by the recent National Cancer Institute report to the nation on the status of cancer (e.g., HER2 mutations in breast cancer). 12 CDC's new surveillance strategy 13 will jump start accelerated use of tools to improve availability, quality, and timeliness of data, and linking public health data more effectively with clinical systems. A radical transformation is taking place in epidemiology, the fundamental science of public health, to include and integrate disparate sources of data. As with precision medicine, separating signal from noise will not be easy. A healthy dose of skepticism may be needed to guard against the overpromise of big data. For example, in compared with public health surveillances. 14 Even more problematic could be the potential for many false alarms by mindless examination, on a large scale, leading to putative associations between big data points and disease outcomes. This process may falsely infer causality and could potentially lead to faulty interventions. As the authors discuss in detail elsewhere, 4 separating signal from noise will require epidemiologic study designs that minimize bias, robust knowledge integration process, adherence to principles of evidencebased medicine and population screening, and a robust multidisciplinary translational research agenda that goes beyond initial discoveries to implement findings in populations. 4",32.503853061398935,14.46703092307883

Tavern keepers were required to report instead of health care providers, as persons were more often seen by the former than the latter.

The modern era of “public health preparedness” had begun as did a “new normal” in public health that required active involvement in homeland security efforts on a basis of 24 hours, 7 days a week. Discussions around how federal dollars for preparedness should be allocated at the state and local levels led to the development of the ASTHO-NACCHO (National Association of County & City Health Officials) Joint Council. Convening health officers to discuss coordinated emergency response efforts to Hurricane Katrina, the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, the H1N1 outbreak, and severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak laid the groundwork for ASTHO's role in supporting state and territorial health agencies and federal partners during public health disasters. Working collaboratively with NACCHO, the ASTHO-NACCHO Joint Council also became an increasingly important factor in policy formulation and advocacy for governmental public health.",44.631521093831665,19.915965856904954

Singapore","Pneumonia, an infection of the lung due to bacterial, viral or fungal pathogens, is a
significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the past few decades, the
threat of emerging pathogens presenting as pneumonia, such as Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome, avian influenza A(H5N1) and A(H7N9), and Middle East
Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus has emphasised the importance of the surveillance
of pneumonia and other severe respiratory infections. An unexpected increase in the
number of hospital admissions for pneumonia or severe respiratory infections could
be a signal of a change in the virulence of the influenza viruses or other
respiratory pathogens circulating in the community, or an alert of an emerging
pathogen which warrants further public health investigation. The purpose of this
study was to develop a forecasting model to prospectively forecast the number of
emergency department (ED) admissions due to pneumonia in Singapore, a tropical
country. We hypothesise that there is complementary information between
hospital-based and community-based surveillance systems. The clinical spectrum of
many respiratory pathogens causing pneumonia ranges from asymptomatic or subclinical
infection to severe or fatal pneumonia, and it is usually difficult to distinguish
between the different pathogens in the absence of a laboratory test. Infected
persons could present with varying degrees of severity of the infection, and seek
treatment at different healthcare facilities. Hospital-based surveillance captures
the more severe manifestation of the infection while community-based surveillance
captures the less severe manifestation of the infection and enables earlier
detection of the infection. Thus, the integration of information from the two
surveillance systems should improve the prospective forecasting of ED admissions due
to pneumonia. We also investigate if the inclusion of influenza data from the
laboratory surveillance system would improve the forecasting model, since influenza
circulates all-year round in Singapore and is a common aetiology for pneumonia.",25.911047536217744,10.112854646473378

Related to this, is the failure of quarantine mechanisms in Ebola ravaged nations. For example, it was widely reported that Patrick Sawyer (index case in Nigeria), who had contact with a sister (who died of EVD) while he was in Liberia, actually sneaked out of quarantine. Invariably, this laxity has promoted and is promoting the spread of the disease in the sub-region. Obviously, there is need for better funding of quarantine facilities and expansion of such facilities in different locations to enhance accessibility. Furthermore, health information systems seem to be problematic as most often, health ministries fail to deliver timely and reliable health information. To buttress this, there was a long time lag (of close to 4 months) between the time when the outbreak started in the remote community of Guinea and to when the health information was reported to the World Health Organization.3 A particular weakness in reporting systems in many sub-Sahara African countries is that they are still heavily paper-based, especially, at the peripheral levels. Additionally, field experiences indicate some degrees of under-reporting due to this rudimentary reporting system, documentation and data management systems. Common root causes of under-reporting of health information include political maneuvering, poor health seeking behavior, weak surveillance networks and poor health financing.

This includes occupational zoonoses, and can lead to underestimation of the real burden of disease attributable to biological risk in agriculture. Agriculture represents a good model to explain this trend. In fact, the agricultural sector is characterized by small size and family-run enterprises. This leads to a difficult evaluation of the exposures and a lack of health surveillance of the workers. The experience of our center, the International Center For Rural Health, fully supports this claim. For example, a case of ""Milker's Nodule"" was observed in a young cow milker. The man came to our attention through a medical examination performed as part of a program of periodical health surveillance at the workplace. During the patient's examination, a 1 × 1 cm papule at the 4th finger of the right hand, characterized by light rose-yellowish color, surrounded by an erythematous area was noticed. The patient told us that he and his colleagues had already suffered from the same symptom several times, and was well aware that the disease comes from cows. Therefore, after a consultation with the veterinarian in charge of the breeding farm, we knew that an epidemic of the cow parapox infection was present at the farm. In collaboration with the veterinarian, we diagnosed the parapox virus lesion (""Cow Milker's Nodule) (Fig. 1). The lesion disappeared spontaneously, as anticipated, but the preventive intervention by us and the veterinarian avoided any further infection in animals and/or workers. This example shows that some zoonotic diseases can actually be transmitted from animals to workers, and vice versa, and that the abililty to detect early signals is fundamental in prevention. In this case, the signal was not detected early [22].",15.814695303590995,8.565193967752819

Even as the epidemic appears to be near its end in the Americas, it is unclear whether substantial Zika virus transmission may still be ongoing. This issue is exacerbated by large discrepancies in local case reporting and significant delays in detecting outbreaks due to surveillance gaps. To uncover locations with lingering outbreaks in the Americas, we investigated travel-associated Zika cases diagnosed in the United States and Europe to identify signatures of transmission dynamics that were not captured by local reporting. We found that a large and unreported Zika outbreak occurred in Cuba during 2017, a year after peak transmission in neighboring countries, with cases still appearing in 2018. By sequencing Zika virus from infected travelers, we show that the 2017 outbreak in Cuba was sparked by longlived lineages of Zika virus introduced from multiple places in the Americas a year prior. Our data suggest that while aggressive mosquito control in Cuba may initially have been effective at mitigating Zika virus transmission, in the absence of vaccines, herd immunity, or strong international coordination, such control measures may need to be maintained to be effective. Our study highlights how Zika virus may still be 'silently' spreading in the Americas and provides a framework for more accurately understanding outbreak dynamics.",20.79839587713148,8.2057923572928

"HMIS and IDSR system, a more integrated electronic IDSR system is essential for the health authorities to correspond the diverse demands",0.13566757619122194,0.6730096936225891,1.1954039335250854,c98f48a5-e553-435b-a1e7-96501642511f,biorxiv_medrxiv/Title: Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) in Malawi: Implementation Gaps and Challenges for Timely Alert Submit journal: PLoS ONE,"We assessed the differences between IDSR technical guideline and actual practice in the health system in Malawi for the first time. According to the quantitative data, we observed relatively good completeness of IDSR monthly reports compared to timeliness. Timeliness is a general problem to countries implementing IDSR system across Africa, and this makes the public health authorities unable to take quick action and respond to the suspected health events [12, 25] . Facility level IDSR reports may not be sufficiently timely to pick up the outbreaks from community. The strengthened community level surveillance and verbal autopsy to detect unusual deaths can be a good approach to detect lower level health events and provide timely response [26] . In Malawi, a pilot study conducted in Lilongwe District in Central Region showed that mobile technologies had good opportunities to improve timeliness of HMIS reports [27] . However, concerning the different purposes of HMIS and IDSR system, a more integrated electronic IDSR system is essential for the health authorities to correspond the diverse demands. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/363713 doi: bioRxiv preprint African health ministries are quickly adopting mHealth solutions to improve disease surveillance and health programmes. Tanzania piloted an IDSR reporting system using SMS function and regular phones for report in 2011 [28] and further expanded it to be the national strategy for diseases surveillance using Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) technology linked with DHIS2 for the immediate reporting for IDSR [29] [30] [31] . Zambia tried to use DHIS2 mobile to enhance its malaria surveillance in Lusaka district and to improve case management and reporting [32] . Other mobile technologies including smartphone applications, patient monitoring devices, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), as well as laptops and tablets PCs connected with network service were piloted and implemented in various African countries [33] . Countries and development partners are eager to apply the mobile technology to capture real-time field data for surveillance and case management at the community level health care system [30, [34] [35] [36] [37] . However, notable issues were documented including technical, financial, infrastructural challenges, data security and medical supports during the design and implementation process of mHealth surveillance in sub-Saharan Africa countries [33] . Considering the complexity of public health works and needs of integration services at the community level [38] , the utilization of mobile technologies requires more rigorous studies to evaluate such innovations for programme implementation to become sustainable and scalable [39] .",16.561746632381066,7.011080178979361
