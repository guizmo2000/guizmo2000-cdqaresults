It is also important to remember that most patients suspected with EVD will not have EVD, but will have illness in need of prompt treatment-commonly malaria-that may require empiric treatment while awaiting diagnostic testing [84, 85] . Barriers to providing the standard of care to patients suspected of EVD will repeatedly arise: ""We don't have the capacity to do that… that is not part of our protocol.""

Pudpong et al. [20] assessed a voluntary health insurance scheme for migrants in Thailand. They found that it improved access for previously uninsured migrants and reduced the financial burden for public hospitals in the project area. They suggested further efforts to raise community understanding of the benefits of being insured in order to improve the sustainability and effectiveness of the program. Gaboardi et al. [21] assessed the goals and principles of providers working with people experiencing homelessness in eight European countries, indicating a contrast between providers who were more focused on their client's autonomy and those whose primary focus was on the client's basic needs such as food, health and temporary accommodation. Braun-Lewensohn et al. [22] explored the coping strategies for stressors among women in Bedouin society and described the stability of sense of coherence (SOC) in this minority society as it underwent rapid social and cultural changes. Significant differences were found between age groups, and the oldest women were identified as an at-risk population due to limitations in their coping strategies and SOC. In related research in a very different community, Millan et al. [23] examined the health beliefs and practices of Gypsies and Travelers in the UK, where these communities experience significant marginalization and discrimination. They described this community's health problems and their experiences in health care systems, including discrimination and negative stereotypes.

However, the KIR study found that vaccination coverage in the elderly (age $65 years) was 38.0%, which was lower than the findings of our telephone survey. The KIR information is highly reliable as it used vaccination uptake data. By contrast, the telephone survey confirmed vaccination coverage through selfreported data. Therefore, it is possible that vaccination coverage was overestimated in those aged $65 years. Yet, although selection bias might apply in the severely ill and in the elderly, previous studies support the validity of self-reported vaccination coverage [9] [10] [11] . Moreover, the KIR only provides information on age, sex, and the priority group type of the vaccinated. On the other hand, our survey data provide a range of information, such as the triggering events for the vaccinated or the barriers encountered by the non-vaccinated; the perception concerning pandemic influenza can be a clear advantage.

In Cambodia, having a responsive health financing system for both formal and informal sectors is the single biggest barrier to achieving UHC. There is no financial scheme for public servants due to low government salaries and low government spending on health. Furthermore, the concept of health insurance is rather new, with the non-existence of SHI financed by pay roll tax (27) . It is estimated that OOP for health was 61.7% in Cambodia in 2012 (27) . Women spent more than 10% of their total expenses on health, with the poorest spending 18% and the highest quintiles 14% (28) . In Indonesia, insufficient infrastructure (human resources, facilities, and equipment) has hindered progress toward universal coverage for the population, which policymakers aim to achieve by 2019. The ratio of doctors to population in Indonesia is amongst the lowest in Asia (only two for every 10,000 population in 2010, compared to an average of 5.5 per 10,000 population for countries in the WHO South East Asian region). Moreover, the ratio of hospital beds to the population is very low (six beds per 10,000 population against an average of 11 beds per 10,000 population in the WHO South East Asian region) (29) . With a large geographical archipelagic area, another huge challenge is to provide equal access to healthcare, including for populations in remote areas and islands of Indonesia. A national health information system (HIS) with unique individual identifiers is currently lacking in Indonesia. A complete and reliable HIS is essential for planning UHC; such a HIS should consider population movement, relevant to ease of obtaining access to healthcare outside of the person's residential area, and it should be possible to link health usage databases from different healthcare providers. In Lao PDR, the level of public expenditure on health, despite efforts to increase it, is still too low, and is currently insufficient to meet the health needs of the population. Geographically scattered and limited population coverage by social protection schemes are both major barriers to accessing care, resulting in a high level of OOP payments and impoverishment; a further government subsidy could help to ease the high burden of OOP payments. There is low utilization of health services because of geographically remote mountainous areas and poverty in Lao PDR. Despite prepayment schemes for four targeted population groups, there are still challenges to implementing these and expanding coverage (the ongoing health finance reform is now addressing this issue). The low quality of care at the health centers and district levels and the constraints of providing a full range of services at the primary care need to be addressed to gain people's confidence and increase utilization of services.",14.472190934202104,7.315520265920321

Considering the diversity of natural biomarkers such as eckol, a definite push is required to further decode these kinds of compounds for their proper use. Eckol exhibiting several biological activities is extraordinary, particularly the involvement of eckol as an anti-oxidant, anti-diabetic, radioprotective, hepatoprotective, and anti-inflammatory agent to name some. The use of eckol as anti-hair loss and anti-hearing loss is a refreshing new discovery. Increasing the scope of eckol as a neuroprotective agent by evaluating it against G protein coupled dopamine receptors is also a novel exploration for the treatment of major neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Thus, introducing eckol to various new receptors related to different diseases, other than the usual ones, could be of great interest. Since eckol exhibits activity against life-threatening disease like cancer, further research in this particular field also holds great potential for eckol to be established as an anti-cancer agent. The major reason for the broad spectrum of activity related to eckol is possibly due to its structure. Even the other potent phlorotannins of the same family have a basic backbone of eckol. So, developing eckol as a single pharmaceutical product could be beneficial in the field of medicine. Hence, natural product-derived compounds hold a multitude of opportunities for the discovery of novel therapeutic agents. The shift in focus from synthetically developed agents to natural agents could be a stepping stone for further advancements in the treatment of various infirmities.

As it stands, it remains uncertain which bioaerosol particles are predominantly responsible for personto-person transmission. There may also be differences between pathogen populations in the infected host vs. what is emitted into the air. This poses an excellent opportunity to leverage advances in metagenomics with developments in aerobiology to extract more sophisticated data from aerosol samples and, potentially, determine genetic bottlenecks for transmission. This would feed back into more fundamental work on bacterial or viral determinants of transmission, as well as lead to novel means for surveillance and mitigation. Similarly, translational studies enhance our understanding of risk and determinants of exposure. For many settings and situations, several components of risk assessments are based on limited evidence. This is of particular concern from an occupational health perspective, in healthcare (e.g., purported aerosol-generating procedures), agricultural, or specific settings such as wastewater treatment plants (45) (46) (47) .

The relationship between in-hospital mortality and determinants was analyzed using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Conclusions CAP is a disease with a high in-hospital mortality. We have shown that, after correction for confounding factors some treatment and organizational factors are related with outcome in patients with sCAP. The need for mechanical ventilation remained an independent risk factor for mortality, and liberal use of tracheostomies for the weaning process was also associated with higher mortality. The mean number of ICU admissions with sCAP per year was inversely correlated with hospital mortality. Many other parameters that are often claimed to be associated with better or worse outcome (like differences in antibiotic therapy) did not correlate with outcome. Background and objectives Severe asthmatic patient who requires the use of invasive mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit is, despite its low incidence, a potentially very serious case, which requires early and very specific respiratory care. This care will largely determine the average ICU stay, occurrence of secondary injuries or even death.

Applying GIS-based methods and multilevel regression analysis to unique longitudinal three-wave survey data from rural Mozambique, the authors investigated the impact of a rapid expansion of HIV-related services on access to and utilization of HIV testing. The results illustrate the declining importance of spatial barriers to utilization of HIV testing services as these services expanded. In addition, the expansion of HIV-related services decreased the spatial variability of HIV testing among the survey respondents. Use of geographic information systems for placement and management of point-of-care technologies in small-world networks Point-of-care technologies afford first responders with the mobility to deliver diagnostic testing at the site of care, and because they do not rely on conventional infrastructure, are more robust for use in disasters and complex emergencies.

Problems do not exist 'naturally' but they have to be articulated and put on the agenda in a process of social interaction. This approach draws back to Michel Foucault and his proposal to acknowledge a power/knowledge nexus in general and specifically the power effects of truth claims. According to this, articulating and framing an issue are powerful ways to predetermine the range of thinkable approaches and solutions. By using the term ""Global Health"", policy-makers, non-governmental actors and academic observers are drawing together several health problems into a common frame, but also marking this frame as a field of intervention and claiming its relevance. The contours of this frame are still blurry and there exist numerous approaches to define ""Global Health"" (Brown et al. 2006; Farmer et al. 2013; Fassin 2012) . There is no accepted definition and ""Global health […] is more a bunch of problems than a discipline"".

A good example of how variation in host ranges can influence opportunities for recombination can be found amongst the geminiviruses of South America. On this continent, an enormous number of geminivirus species have emerged as crop pathogens within the last two decades. This surge in the number of reported geminivirus associated plant diseases has been widely attributed to the introduction onto the continent in the early 1990s of a highly invasive transmission vector strain (or biotype) that feeds on a far wider range of species than indigenous strains [179] [180] [181] . By breaking the transmission barriers that had previously existed between many potential geminivirus host species, the new vector has increased the effective host ranges of enormous numbers of indigenous South American geminiviruses [179] . Therefore, whereas only a single geminivirus species had been reported in Brazil as a tomato pathogen prior to 1990, today the list of recognized Brazilian tomato pathogens includes fifteen geminivirus species [182] . While there is no definitive evidence that broadened host ranges have caused increased rates of recombination amongst the South American geminiviruses, it is nevertheless interesting that most of these newly discovered tomato-infecting species are obvious recombinants [182] [183] [184] [185] [186] [187] .",14.839515039907962,7.076371229048048

A list of trauma centres was obtained from the NHS England website. All critical care units (other than obstetric high dependency units and coronary care units, unless part of a cardiothoracic critical care unit) within each hospital were surveyed. Each respondent was asked about the visiting hours, whether children were allowed to visit and how many visitors to a bed space. Results Fifty-three units with between four and 75 beds and covering the whole of England were surveyed: there was a 100% response rate. Visiting hours varied between hospitals and between units within the same hospital. Nine units (17%) had open visiting hours, although most gave advice on times to avoid such as nursing handover. The majority of units (44.83%) operated restricted visiting with a median (range) of 6 (2 to 9) hours. All units allowed a maximum of two visitors to the bedspace. Children were allowed in nine units without restriction, the remaining units advised that it may not be appropriate for children to visit and it was at the discretion of the parents and medical staff . Conclusion The majority of adult critical care units in England, including our own, have restricted visiting policies. Visiting policies are a source of debate amongst staff in intensive care with concerns about open visiting including increased workload and interruptions to normal routine [1] . This is consistent with the views of staff at our own unit who, in appreciative enquiry, have expressed mixed opinions about extending visiting times.

First, births are increasingly concentrated in large, well staffed, and well equipped county hospitals, whereas smaller township hospitals focus on antenatal care and screening of women at high risk. This concentration of births in high-volume facilities ensures an efficient organisation of obstetric care, including training, supervision, and the maintenance of skills. Second, the huge investment in human resources has resulted in a density of licensed doctors that is close to the 2·5 per 1000 population threshold that is deemed necessary by UN health agencies to achieve a high coverage of skilled attendants at birth. 59 China does not officially have a midwifery cadre, but the doctors and nurses who routinely attend deliveries are effectively the so-called midwifery workforce. 60, 61 Although the level of training is variable and many providers only have a basic medical or nursing degree, 62 the strict system of birth attendant certification ensures that most staff have the minimum skills to ensure safe childbirth. Third, an effective referral system ensures that women developing unexpected complications or those found to be at high risk antenatally can reach the hospital in time and receive a timely response once admitted. Screening for social and medical factors allows women without family support to go to hospital before labour starts-effectively a maternity waiting home strategy. 63 Fourth, financial barriers have been reduced through a system of social health insurance and extra childbirth subsidies in remote parts of the country. Antenatal care has also been recognised as one of the essential public health services that should be free at the point of care. Fifth, the Chinese Government's commitment to rigorous health infor mation systems across the country has ensured that most child and maternal deaths are counted. 64 Such a reporting system not only enables direction and evaluation of ongoing strategies, but also provides a mechanism to hold health-care providers and administrators accountable. Responsibility for maternal health lies with the highest authorities within the province or county, and achieving a specified maternal mortality target is one of the key performance indicators for government officials. We focused our analysis on western China because its relative poverty, remote geographical location, low literacy, and ethnic diversity pose difficult challenges. Although the western region is not homogeneous in terms of socioeconomic development, variation in maternal mortality and coverage of maternal care is relatively small. By 2014, the maternal mortality ratios between provinces were remarkably similar, except for Tibet, which was still lagging behind. Despite undoubted success, maternal mortality remained higher in the western region than in the eastern and central regions, and socioeconomic inequalities in access to maternal care persisted at the individual level. The reasons why western China remains behind is not entirely clear. Total health expenditure and human resource density differed between the western and eastern provinces, but these factors did not explain the excess mortality in the western region. Indeed, in our regression model the only factors that partly explained the regional differences were the proportion of ethnic minorities and female illiteracy, although their effect was small. The variation in access to antenatal and delivery care at the individual level by education of the mother in the western provinces was surprisingly large and much greater than previously reported. 65 beyond the financial reach of poor farmers. 67 County hospitals might be too far away and too reliant on advanced technology for uneducated women to choose to give birth there. Whether traditional customs add further barriers to facility delivery among ethnic minority populations is uncertain, although results from studies among Tibetan and Yi minority populations suggest that this might be the case. [68] [69] [70] The stark contrast between inequalities in access to maternity care and the relative equality in immunisation coverage might provide further insights. Immunisation is offered in township hospitals close to the woman's home, is entirely free of cost, is being actively promoted by village doctors, and is organised at times when women gather together such as on market days. 71 Although many township hospitals are poorly equipped for delivery care, strengthening their obstetric capacity might be one way of making delivery care more accessible to women in remote rural areas. Notwithstanding China's success, the facility-based, doctor-led model of maternal health care comes at a cost. Large county hospitals are replete with the most advanced technology and costly interventions, and many women have highly medicalised pregnancies and births, including unnecessary ultrasound, fetal monitoring, antibiotic use, and caesarean sections. [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] China has one of the highest caesarean section rates in the world, 77 although the difference in caesarean section rates between the richest and poorest provinces (63% in urban Beijing vs 5% in rural Tibet), or between the highest and lowest education level (44% vs 8%) in rural western China suggests that extreme excess goes hand in hand with unmet need. The problem of overmedicalisation is not unique to maternal health. 36, 78 The Chinese Government is well aware of these problems and has recently taken measures such as monitoring of caesarean sections in hospitals, setting up a midwifery cadre to conduct deliveries, strengthening obstetric training, and offering health education to communities. 79 Whether these measures will have an effect remain to be seen.",14.008590013384612,7.540913836866544

A Study Comparing Two Areas with Different Management Models,"Tuberculosis has been regarded as a ""poverty-related disease"" due to the association with poverty and malnutrition, which are more prevalent in developing countries. For example, in South Africa, tuberculosis is referred to as a ""barometer of poverty"" [4] . Tuberculosis-affected patients and their family members face many economic and social problems, such as high medical costs, loss of productivity, stigmatization and social isolation [5, 6] . In 1992, China initiated its modern National Tuberculosis Control Program (NTP) with directly observed treatment, short-course (DOTS) [7] . Recently, especially after the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in 2003, the Chinese government has taken a series of measures to strengthen its public health system with great efforts towards tuberculosis control. By 2005, China achieved the global targets for tuberculosis control with 100% DOTS coverage and over 90% treatment success [8] . Each year in China, more than 1 million tuberculosis patients receive DOTS therapy [9] . To reduce the financial barriers to and burdens on patients seeking essential healthcare, a ""free-TB service policy"" has been implemented gradually throughout the country [10, 11] . Under this policy, tuberculosis suspects are provided a free diagnosis and anti-tuberculosis treatment, including a free chest X-ray examination, sputum smear test and designated firstline anti-tuberculosis drugs [12] . Initially, the free-service policy was only performed for sputum smear-positive patients. Now it has expanded to sputum smear-negative patients. Moreover, the government has taken more measures to reduce the patient burden, including the establishment of universal health coverage and increasing the reimbursement rate for patients with tuberculosis [13] . The central government's spending on tuberculosis control increased from 40 million Chinese Yuan (CNY) in 2001 to 580 million CNY in 2010 [14] . China has established universal health coverage for 830 million rural residents through the rapid expansion of the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS). Moreover, a free-service policy has been gradually adopted in order to lighten the economic burden of patients with tuberculosis. Despite these policy changes, previous studies have revealed that patients still bear a high financial burden, which could affect their health care-seeking behaviors and treatment outcomes [10, [15] [16] [17] [18] . The revenue-driven practices in some health facilities, such as over-prescription of medication, poor referral and high hospitalization rates not only influence a patient's economic burden but also affects the entire tuberculosis control program [19, 20] .",15.665516402635719,6.826046955793908

The surveillance of influenza and other respiratory viruses is undertaken by 268 primary care centres for adult and pediatric patients ( Fig. 1 ) distributed in 24 governorates covering 2.7% of general Tunisian population (Table 1) . Sentinel physicians report weekly the total number of patient visits to their facilities for influenza-like illness (ILI) and acute respiratory infection (ARI) within four age categories (0-4 years, 5-14 years, 15-64 years, and 65+ years). Sentinel physicians are asked to collect respiratory specimens from patients with symptoms of ILI or ARI. ILI was defined as an outpatient with fever (38uC) and cough or sore throat with onset less than five days prior to presentation in the absence of a specific diagnosis. ARI was defined as an outpatient with sudden onset of respiratory signs including cough, difficulty breathing, rhinitis and general symptoms such as fever, headache, fatigue, and myalgia less than five days prior to presentation. The physicians sent specimens for influenza testing and basic demographic data from a subset of patients with ILI each year during October through May to the National Influenza Centre (NIC) situated at the Charles Nicolle's Hospital Tunis, provided that the number of consultants is 10% above the total number of consultants in the sentinel centre.

The so-called care cascade aims to identify and fill gaps in the continuum of services for testing, care, and effective treatment of HIV (UNAIDS, 2014) . In relation to this, the UNAIDS report has led to the global initiative ''90-90-90'' by 2020 that sets out goals in care cascades to achieve the following: 90% of people living with HIV know their HIV status, 90% of people diagnosed with HIV have access to antiretroviral therapy (ART), and 90% of people receiving ART have suppressed viral loads (UNAIDS, 2014) . UNAIDS even aims to achieve 95-95-95 at a global level by the year 2030, contributing to successfully controlling HIV and AIDS, as supported by the so-called test-and-treat strategy (Granich et al., 2009; Granich et al., 2017) . To quantify the situation of each country, monitoring diagnosed individuals is essential; moreover, estimation of the diagnosed proportion of HIV infections must be supported by firm scientific methods, to estimate the first part of the three 90-90-90 targets, i.e., 90% of HIV-infected people know their HIV status. In Japan, an analysis of blood donors took place in 2017, in which it was estimated that 85.6% of HIV-infected individuals, regardless of nationality, were diagnosed (Iwamoto et al., 2017) . Nevertheless, it is known that the analysis of voluntary blood donation data is prone to sampling bias of donors owing to the tendency of people with high risk to repeatedly undertake anonymous laboratory testing through the practice of blood donation (Kihara, Imai & Shimizu, 2000) , and moreover, an exclusion of repeaters can result in underestimation of the prevalence, resulting in overestimation of the fraction diagnosed, even though such screening of a large number of people is very costly. Considering the need to achieve continued monitoring of the diagnosed proportion of HIV-infected individuals, development of a reasonable yet scientifically rigorous method based on other datasets would be beneficial, especially using epidemiological surveillance data (Hsieh et al., 2012; Cuadros & Abu-Raddad, 2016; Hsieh & Lin, 2016; Mumtaz et al., 2018) .",13.22346436836807,5.928895723327704

Immunization is highly effective at reducing the burden of ill health from pneumococcal infection and Hib, but less so for influenza. The effectiveness of influenza vaccination depends on the match between the antigenic strains included in the vaccine and the circulating strains in the community, and this can vary substantially from year to year. EMR countries are at different stages of adopting these vaccines. High-income EMR countries have introduced pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) to their national immunization programs. Moreover, all low-income countries in the region except Somalia have introduced PCV thanks to support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. (Gavi 2017 the Vaccine Alliance) Somalia has issues with under-coverage of immunization, even for traditional vaccines such as DTP vaccine (diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis).

The ""floating population"" constitute a salient and disadvantaged group in China accounting for more than 10% of China's total population [24] . The migrants are often poor and less educated than the general population in urban areas. They typically live in low quality housing with inadequate sanitation, and have limited access to local health services. The needs of the migrant population have not been taken into full consideration in health care policy-makers' formulation of relevant policies and regulations, such as health insurance, occupational injury and infectious disease prevention strategies including immunization. Meanwhile, the ""floating population"" itself is reluctant to spend its already limited discretionary resources on health care. It comes as no surprise that the overall health status of rural-urban migrants is generally lower than that of local urban residents [33] . In particular, migrants can be more susceptible to infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and sexually transmitted diseases (STD), as well as vector/food-borne diseases, and are less likely to receive proper treatment or be cured of infectious diseases than local permanent residents [7, 34] . Further, children of migrant parents are also shown to have poorer health, lower nutrient intakes and constrained access to education compared to children of local or permanent residents [36] . Additionally, vaccination coverage among migrant children is lower than the rates for children of local or permanent residents [36] .

Leaders and populations in low prevalence regions are often less aware of the dangers HIV/AIDS present, and lack of sense of urgency to initiate organized responses to tackle this epidemic; in contrast in high prevalence regions, the social infrastructure (e.g. health and education) and basic social services may be overstretched, such that securing resources is both necessary and challenging to establish comprehensive and intensified measures for prevention and care [23] . As China has become the world's second largest economy, major international programs for HIV/AIDS prevention and care have ended or will end soon, e.g. both GF and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundations projects will end in 2012.

Influenza poses a serious public health threat around the world, particularly for the most vulnerable populations. Fortunately, vaccination can mitigate the negative effects of this common infectious disease. Although inoculating frontline health care workers (HCWs) helps minimize disease transmission, some HCWs continue to resist participating in voluntary immunization programs. A potential solution to this problem is government-mandated vaccination for HCWs; however, in practice, there are substantial barriers to the adoption of such policies. The purpose of this paper is to identify the likelihood of adopting a policy for mandatory immunization of HCWs in Ontario based on a historical review of barriers to the agenda setting process. Methods: Documents from secondary data sources were analysed using Kingdon's agenda setting framework of three converging streams leading to windows of opportunity for possible policy adoption. Results: The problems, politics, and policies streams of Kingdon's framework have converged and diverged repeatedly over an extended period (policy windows have opened and closed several times). In each instance, a technically feasible solution was available. However, despite the evidence supporting the value of HCW immunization, alignment of the three agenda setting streams occurred for very short periods of time, during which, opposition lobby groups reacted, making the proposed solution less politically acceptable. Conclusions: Prior to the adoption of any new policies, issues must reach a government's decision agenda. Based on Kingdon's agenda setting framework, this only occurs when there is alignment of the problems, politics, and policies streams. Understanding this process makes it easier to predict the likelihood of a policy being adopted, and ultimately implemented. Such learning may be applied to policy issues in other jurisdictions. In the case of mandatory influenza vaccinations for HCWs in Ontario, it seems highly unlikely that a new policy will be adopted until perception of the problem's importance is sufficient to overcome the political opposition to implementing a solution and thus, create a window of opportunity that is open long enough to support change.",16.91062977471748,6.14502897258182

As seen in our case, it is crucial to always attempt to obtain blood cultures prior to initiation of antibiotics. In absence of confirmed organism by culture, studies suggest empiric coverage with ceftriaxone or cefotaxime [1] . Some experts suggest the addition of clindamycin for broader coverage of anaerobic or MRSA coverage, with the substitution of vancomycin for clindamycin for suspected MRSA pneumonia.

Although intensified surveillance and massively expanded HIV testing will be a key aspect to controlling the epidemic, a failure to capture key data on risk behaviors, treatment adherence, drug resistance and host and virus genetic sequences from known populations is a missed opportunity. Such data can inform policies to lower HIV incidence and mortality by helping target resources to where the largest impact could be expected, eg, MSM and sex workers (female, male, or transgender). The MENA region is comprised of countries with a wide range of financial resources and technical capacity. Yet most of the data, particularly viral sequence diversity, comes from three middle-income countries: Algeria, Morocco, and Iran (Figure) . 16 Recently, several MENA countries have undertaken initiatives that put their genomic technologic prowess on full display. The Qatar Genome Program, for example, aspires to generate personalized genomic data for its entire population as part of a national precision medicine initiative. 17 In an initial demonstration project, the program sequenced 1000 human genomes and uncovered more than 20 million polymorphisms to analyze. Yet, in the face of this titanic effort to sequence human genomes, not a single viral sequence from the approximately 100 documented HIV cases in Qatar has ever been entered into GenBank, as of April 2017. 18 This incongruity argues that the tools and funding are available, but the political will is lacking for collecting basic virologic information on recognized HIV cases. The key will be in convincing policy-makers in the region that obtaining key data on subtype diversity and antiretroviral resistance mutations is straightforward and could guide the epidemiologic and clinical knowledge relevant for both HIV prevention and clinical care for persons living with HIV in the region.",16.772423477343843,8.594405998766664

Furthermore, in COPD patients, mechanical ventilation had greater short term effectiveness, based on survival to hospital discharge (76 % vs. 38 %), and had higher 2-month and 6-month survival. Curtis and colleagues [118] pointed out an additional important problem related to EOL is the strategy of communication: the physicians' frequent difficulties in discussing EOL care with patients and their families and caregivers Health care utilization is strongly weighted toward the end of life in COPD as well as in other diseases. For example, Andersson and colleagues [119] showed that more than 68 % of all COPD admissions and 74 % of all days in hospital occurred in the 3.5 years before death. The last 6 months of life accounted for 22 % and 28 % of all COPD admissions and days, respectively. Suboptimal surveillance, inadequate services, and absence of palliative home care are common in severe COPD patients with EOL issues [120] . This also holds for respiratory patients who are housebound with high levels of morbidity and high requirements for community health services. COPD patients approaching EOL require, at a minimum, education on diagnosis and disease process, available treatment modalities, what they have to do and what to expect, and information on prognosis. Despite this, only 32 % of respiratory patients report discussing EOL cares with their physicians [120] . Stated barriers in this study included, ""I would rather concentrate on staying alive than talk about death"" or ""I'm not sure which doctor will be taking care of me if I get very sick.""

Quality assurance systems, that include providing proficiency testing, sites visits, and corrective action, are essential to ensure that accurate results are being used to guide treatment decisions, and to ensure that control strategies are based on accurate surveillance data. Studies have shown that deployment of POC diagnostics can be an opportunity to improve health outcomes and strengthen health systems [29] [30] [31] . Overcoming challenges will in turn motivate health care workers and increase capacity and efficiency to test and treat appropriately.

The findings presented in this study further our knowledge of well-characterized and previously unknown viruses present in serum collected from pediatric dengue-like illness patients and advance our understanding of the application of metagenomic approaches to human pathogen detection. Deep sequencing analysis of clinical samples holds tremendous promise as a diagnostic tool by permitting the detection of many different viruses simultaneously, including those present at low-copy numbers and of divergent origin. Major remaining barriers to high-throughput sequencing strategies becoming standard diagnostic practice include prohibitive cost, lengthy sample preparation time, and computationally intensive data analysis requirements. These challenges are magnified in resource-limited settings, such as Nicaragua, but are gradually being addressed. Industry hardware and technical advancements have steadily decreased the per-base cost of deep sequencing, and the results presented here strengthen our expectations of multiplexed sample preparation and bioinformatic data filtering within the framework of current secondgeneration sequencing platforms. Long-term bi-directional partnerships with developing country collaborators facilitate easier access to techniques not currently available on-site, such as deep sequencing, and are also important in providing training opportunities for local scientists and developing relevant pathogen tests and diagnostic policies. This study expands our understanding of the virus diversity in pediatric dengue-like illness in Nicaragua and the application of genomic detection techniques in a tropical setting, findings that are particularly valuable given the pressing need for improved global emerging pathogen surveillance.

Local conditions differ and regional epidemics have diverging trajectories. Since the antiretroviral and infrastructure investments spurred by the massive HIV programs began in 2003-2004-such as the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria-HIV incidence and AIDS-related death rates have fallen significantly in some of the worst-affected areas of the world (ie, sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia). In contrast, HIV has steadily risen in what were previously thought to be low-risk, low prevalence zones (ie, Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Middle East and North Africa [MENA]). 1 Karamouzian et al, in their recent editorial, offer insights into one of the key reasons for this epidemiologic discrepancy: poor data availability and integrity. 2 The authors identify some of the major challenges to capturing and validating HIV surveillance data in the MENA region; including the persistence of violent conflict, lack of political will, and stigmatization of the mostat-risk populations. Although there are some common challenges that stretch across the region, MENA countries comprise a complex mosaic of populations and policies. Thus, each country requires a tailored approach to improving HIV surveillance and prevention efforts. Iran, for example, hosts the highest number of cases in the region (Figure) and is battling an epidemic driven primarily by injection drug use. 1,3,4 It has implemented a set of inconsistent policies that has had both progressive and regressive impacts on the public health community's efforts to control HIV transmission. For example, while Iran has served as a model for other countries in its successful implementation of harm-reduction policies and deployment of peer education programs and needle exchange centers, 5 national laws have also been passed that are severely punitive against persons who inject drugs (PWIDs) and men who have sex with men (MSM). 6 Saudi Arabia, in contrast to Iran, has among the lowest registered HIV cases in the world and leads the Arab Strategic Framework for the Response to HIV and AIDS, 7 but pursues policies that confine and deport any incident cases among its sizeable guest worker population. 8, 9 Persons from the large guest working population who acquire HIV in the more tolerant United Arab Emirates still face the same expulsion policy. Conflicting policies and practices are not unique to specific countries, as competing priorities can yield contradictory approaches to societal problems, particularly in a region where traditional and modernizing influences create divergent sentiments. Advocates for enhanced HIV prevention, care, and treatment services in the MENA region face a conundrum: they require reliable data in order to persuade governments to pursue rational and consistent HIV prevention policies and invest more resources for HIV surveillance. How, then, can national policy makers in the MENA region be convinced that HIV is a public health threat that demands increased vigilance without verifiable evidence to justify such investments? Karamouzian et al suggest some initial steps toward tackling this problem, including the amplification of outreach efforts to regional refugees, MENA research training programs and cooperative initiatives to combat HIV-related stigma. 2 Although these measures are necessary for a comprehensive strategy to rein in a worsening regional epidemic, they do not address the primary challenge of igniting stronger political will among regional health and finance leaders. In this commentary, we seek to enhance the excellent points presented by Karamouzian et al by suggesting additional ideas on how to create conditions that will promote national and international investments into enhanced data capture and validation systems that will ultimately lead to better control of HIV spread in the MENA region.",13.591210206977,5.793074352762117

Even where the cost-effectiveness of One Health strategies has been demonstrated, for example, in relation to mass rabies vaccination of dogs in Africa [76, 77] , sheep and goat vaccination against brucellosis in Mongolia [62] and control of human African trypanosomiasis in Uganda [13] , barriers remain to scaling-up. Increasing attention is being paid to opportunities for integrating platforms for delivery of health interventions, with international health agencies focusing on the importance of strengthening health systems to achieve equitable delivery of health services, rather than developing multiple vertical programmes for specific diseases [78] . It is recognized that establishing independent delivery efforts for specific diseases can lead to fragmentation, and that coordination across sectors is needed to strengthen health systems. In Tanzania, these ideas are being explored through a programme investigating whether the reach and cost-effectiveness of MDA targeting soil-transmitted helminths in children and mass vaccination of domestic dogs against rabies can be improved through integration.

Systemic infections constitute a real clinical challenge as balancing between patient risk and the costs of testing/treatment is unclear. The third most frequent clinical syndrome was URTI (19%) including mainly acute tonsillitis, acute pharyngitis, non-specific URTI, acute sinusitis, and acute otitis media. The next most frequent syndromes were gastroenteritis (12%), UTI (7%), and cellulitis (4%). CNS infections (2%) included septic and aseptic meningitis. Additional clinical syndromes (1%) were classified as 'Other' and included less common infections (e.g., otitis externa, epididymitis, etc.). The observed pattern of clinical syndrome distribution represents most of the frequent and clinically relevant syndromes and is consistent with previously published large studies [4] .

For example, uptake may be compromised if animals identified for vaccination under epidemiologically optimal strategies are not the same as those considered by owners as the most valuable (e.g. in terms of traction power, food provision or social value). Household-level decisions will also need to be made as to how to balance potential costs for healthcare and treatment against recurring costs of preventive measures. These decisions will be particularly difficult for interventions directed at disease syndromes with multiple aetiologies, such as febrile illness, when the links between animal infection and human disease may be poorly appreciated, and the impact of any single intervention will only reduce a proportion of the overall burden of the disease syndrome (box 1).",16.80723137435903,8.390865462741816

This requires understanding of the (molecular) interactions between WSSV and its potential hosts. In the infection process, WSSV invades host cells and initiates replication of its components. This is followed by assembly and release of new virions, resulting in host cell death and disease. To prevent disease, hosts must recognize the invading pathogen and elicit appropriate defense strategies or create a cellular environment that is not appropriate for production of new virions. A number of review articles have been published detailing the interactions between viruses and the host innate immune system (Li et al. [45] , Shekhar and Ponniah [46] , Sanchez-Paz [47] , and Sritunyalucksana et al. [48] ) but the interactions between WSSV and the host intracellular environment have received less attention.

The ""entering approach"" is not always most desirable for all the subgroups. It is found that for the 10-29 age groups, policies that aim to help people leave CSSA will be more effective than policies that aim to prevent people from entering CSSA. According to the Hong Kong Poverty Situation Report 2017, the unemployment rate among the young people 15-29 is relatively higher than the general population. On the other hand, for those who are employed, young households have the highest proportion of high-skilled workers and the lowest poverty rate [2]. By upgrading working skills of young CSSA recipients, young adults can enhance their employability and secure jobs with better earnings, so that they can support themselves without CSSA. Diversifying the economic and working opportunities is also of great importance in improving the employability of our young people. Most of the economic activities in Hong Kong are in the professional, financial, and service sectors, and limited opportunities are available in other sectors, such as creative industries and local startups. The excessive rental cost in Hong Kong has been found to be a barrier for young people to start their own business. It is important for the government to provide initial support for these young entrepreneurs at the early stage of their career development. Meanwhile, for the 30-59 age groups, policies that aim to prevent people from entering CSSA will be more effective than policies that aim to help people leave CSSA. People of these ages often have other family members to care for, either young children or old parents, and sometimes both. More often, they have jobs but the earnings are not adequate to cover the living expense of the whole family, and thus all members in the household become CSSA recipients. In this case, policies that can increase the family income can prevent them from entering CSSA. We should try to maintain or enhance the employability of these groups of people as a matter of importance. Keeping them in the job is important for poverty alleviation. It will be difficult for the unemployed individuals to reenter to the workforce, especially for those who are not professionals. The bargaining power to aim for better working conditions would also be limited for the low-skilled workers as there are plenty in supply due to the current migration policy, with there being an influx of migrants of 150 per day from mainland China entering into Hong Kong. The wage of the low-skilled worker has been lagging behind the economic growth. Hong Kong still has one of the largest poverty gaps among the high income societies with a Gini coefficient of 0.54 [2] . It is important to improve the wage level, especially for the low-skilled workers in Hong Kong. The minimum hourly wage is HKD 37.5 (USD 4.8), which is one of the lowest in comparison to other OECD (i.e., The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries. Currently, the Individual-based Work Incentive Transport Subsidy (I-WITS), to some extent, can help middle-aged adults broaden their horizons for better job opportunities across the whole territory [33] . In addition, the Working Family Allowance can provide extra income to households with children. The results have provided insights into the improvement of the CSSA system in terms of accurate targeting. It should be emphasized that the probability of entering and leaving CSSA, as well the elasticities with respect to these probabilities, should be monitored frequently and closely so that a more timely response can be in place to improve the efficiency of CSSA.",15.70028764148368,7.438620517143952

Pulmonary delivery is a promising approach of delivering RNAi therapeutics directly to the airways for treating local conditions and minimizing systemic side effects. It is a non-invasive route of administration that is generally well accepted by patients. However, pulmonary drug delivery is a challenge as the lungs pose a series of anatomical, physiological and immunological barriers to drug delivery.

Training and certification of vast number of health care providers to use POC diagnostics, and ensuring an effective supply chain for tests and drugs across the country present an enormous challenge to health systems that are already suffering from a critical shortage of human resources. Quality assurance systems, that include providing proficiency testing, sites visits, and corrective action, are essential to ensure that accurate results are being used to guide treatment decisions, and to ensure that control strategies are based on accurate surveillance data. Studies have shown that deployment of POC diagnostics can be an opportunity to improve health outcomes and strengthen health systems [29] [30] [31] . Overcoming challenges will in turn motivate health care workers and increase capacity and efficiency to test and treat appropriately. RDT introduction and implementation must be culturally sensitive and accompanied by an inter-connected system to monitor the necessary processes.

In contrast, the most frequently reported reason amongst Dutch GPs for not being vaccinated was having no medical indication for influenza vaccination 19 and in Israel; physicians were much less frequently influenced by the fear that vaccination would cause influenza when compared to other practice staff. 20 There was almost no consistency of agreement with both these misconceptions in our sample or that of Litt et al., 16 who found that the main reasons indicated by Australian GPs for being vaccinated against influenza were concern about getting influenza or its complications and to prevent having time off work because of influenza. Live viruses in the influenza vaccine was the most common myth supported by respondents (21AE6%, 30 ⁄ 139) yet a decade ago, less than 4% of Australian GPs gave this as a reason for not getting influenza vaccine. 16 The reasons behind this shift in belief is unknown; however, technology could play a part, with increased access to a variety of information sources. In the light of this, GP education should continue to focus on dispelling this myth through use of evidence-based information. Other barriers to influenza vaccination identified in our study were lack of awareness of any recommendations for general practice staff to receive the influenza vaccine (10%) and unacceptable side effects of vaccination (7%). These are similar to those commonly cited by HCWs in other countries. [19] [20] [21] For hospital doctors, being too busy has been identified as a major barrier to getting vaccinated against influenza. 6, 12, 24 In contrast, only a small number of participants, all of whom were GPs, identified lack of time as a barrier as did approximately 25% of GP respondents the Australian Influenza and Pneumococcal Vaccination Survey (2003) in the elderly. 16 A previous investigation of general practice staff across 53 DGPs in Australia found a significant association between workplace influenza vaccination policy and staff vaccination. 23 We found that interrelationship between staff beliefs and practice policies may be an important determinant of HCW immunization behaviours in these practices. Office policies demanding immunisation and operating within an effective hierarchy can lead staff members to re-evaluate their beliefs about influenza immunization in the light of their own experience. 31 Continued efforts at the practice level to make formal commitments to staff health by developing policies for influenza vaccination of staff may assist in increasing coverage in this group. Provision of the influenza vaccine to patients along with consistent, direct, exposure to influenza like illness by this population 32 may further impact on their decision to be vaccinated. Pandemic (H1N1) Influenza 2009 is also likely to increase awareness of influenza vaccination and instigate new policies and practices surrounding vaccination of primary health care staff as has been seen in other countries during heightened awareness of an impending influenza pandemic threat. 33 There are a number of limitations to this study including sample size, generalisability and use of self-report for vaccination status. Although the sample size was small, compared to other general practice-based surveys, it would be considered reasonable in the light of the challenges with surveying this population. 34, 35 There is potential for selection bias in this study towards those who are particularly concerned about influenza and ⁄ or vaccination or those who accept vaccination. Furthermore, using self-reported vaccination status in adults has been shown to overestimate coverage. 36, 37 There may also be limitations with generalisability because our study was conducted only in one state of Australia. This study did not collect any data on nonrespondents or outcomes for those who intended to be vaccinated in 2009. In addition, the barriers in our survey may not have covered all possible options, thus may have influenced participants response.

Influenza vaccination coverage amongst GPs in Australia was 50% in 1998. 16 In neighbouring New Zealand, coverage amongst GPs was 68% and 64% in PNs in 2001. 17 Other countries have reported lower coverage estimates, with only 35% of Canadian family physicians from Québec 18 and 36% of GPs from the Netherlands 19 vaccinated in 1996 and 2008, respectively. A study across all primary health care professions in Israel reported an average of 30% coverage across physicians, nurses, pharmacists and administration staff. 20 Factors associated with influenza vaccination status have been examined in primary health care clinicians in other countries. [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] Amongst this group of HCW's, significant predictors for vaccine acceptance include the following: agreement that HCW's have professional responsibility to be vaccinated, on-site access to free vaccine, workplace recommendation for staff influenza vaccination, desire for self-protection and belief that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risk of vaccine side effects. 17, 21 Furthermore, previous influenza vaccination has been significantly associated with current vaccine acceptance in both hospital HCWs and primary care physicians. 20 Factors significantly associated with lack of vaccine acceptance include the following: no medical indication for vaccination, belief that regular medical exposure will protect against the disease, low risk of contracting influenza, fear of vaccine side effects and lack of time or priority. 17, 19, 20 Some of these factors are similar to those cited by hospital HCWs whilst others differ. In a review of attitudes and predictors to influenza vaccination of hospital HCW's, lack of convenient access to vaccine and poor knowledge about influenza infection were prominent reasons for lack of vaccination with the desire for self-protection and belief in the vaccine's effectiveness the most prominent reasons for vaccine acceptance in this group. 22 To the best of our knowledge, there have been limited studies which specifically examine: influenza vaccination coverage, workplace provision of vaccination, knowledge, attitudes and personal barriers to influenza vaccination amongst GPs and PNs in Australia. The aim of this study therefore was to contribute to the limited literature base in this important area by investigating this in the primary health care setting in NSW, Australia.",18.06926131965224,8.120915963774188

Identifying effective interventions were and are difficult in prevention, where prospective controlled trials are often difficult to conduct. These studies come from the field of epidemiology which has changed remarkably during its growth in the past quarter century. One of those changes has been a mixed blessing of ever-increasing specialization among its practitioners at the cost of the generalist. This phenomenon has shaped the field and a partial explanation for this trend is found in the decline in the availability of training funds not focused on specific and general disease areas. Without returning to the training of general conservation-medicine based epidemiologists, the needed trend associations and study designs that are needed to show the economic and public health returns related to preventative practices field will not be realized and in addition lose some of its ability to quickly respond to new and expected emerging public health challenges. Conflicting recommendations from different organizations, further exacerbated by the advocacy positions of some groups, leave many clinicians uncertain about what to do. Clinicians facing increasing time pressures in practice may question the value of some routine preventive interventions, as may employers and other payers struggling with accelerating health care costs. Although more prevention information is reaching the public, the messages conveyed are often inconsistent and increasingly colored by commercial self-interest. Clinicians may feel compelled to provide unproven or ineffective services because patients demand them or they fear being sued, but patients may find that insurance coverage for individual preventive services, especially new technologies, is inconsistent. The importance of clarifying what we know and do not know about the effectiveness of specific preventive services is as important in 2001 as it was in 1984. Although the USPSTF was disbanded in 1989 with the release of the Guide, the need to keep pace with the rapid growth in scientific evidence led to convening a second panel in 1990. The second USPSTF was smaller, with only 10 members, eight of whom were primary care physicians. It refined the previous group's methods for reviewing evidence and making recommendations, and expanded the scope of topics. It adopted policies for disclosure of conflicts arising from financial interests, funding sources, or other affiliations.",16.35689868653803,8.104647071597437

Consecutive adult patients admitted for IV treatment of CAP were identified by screening admission lists. On day three of antibiotic treatment, clinical response was scored by objective parameters for clinical stability and treating residents were interviewed on their switch strategies and potential barriers in individual cases. Additionally, all residents and specialists responsible for the treatment choices were interviewed to evaluate their knowledge and adherence to guideline advice. Results: Of 162 enrolled patients, 13 (8%) were excluded, leaving 149 patients for analysis. They were treated by 107 physicians, of which 97 (91%) were interviewed. Based on clinical parameters, a switch to oral antibiotics was possible in 68/149 (46%) patients on day 3 of treatment, but not performed in 27/68 (40%). Patient factors delaying the switch were a high CURB-score on admission (p = 0.04), oxygen treatment (p = 0.04), high temperature (p = 0.00) and high respiration rate (p = 0.04) on day 3. The clinical experience of physicians was not related to duration of IV therapy. Physicians' barriers (n = 47) to an early switch in clinically stable patients were mainly practical considerations (n = 13, 28%), organisational factors (n = 8, 17%) and misconceptions (n = 26, 55%). Strikingly, 91/97 of (94%) physicians were not aware of guideline advice and 59/116 (51%) of patients marked as clinically stable by residents, did not meet objective parameters for clinical stability.

One tool to assess infection control practice in clinical areas is the infection control audit; however, many institutions do not approach this in a systematic fashion. Methods: Key features of the infection control audit were identified by the infection control team and developed into a standardized format for review of clinical areas. The audit incorporates a review of the physical layout, protocols and policies, knowledge of basic infection control principles, and workplace practice review. Results: Over the last 13 years, the infection control unit has completed 17 audits involving 1525 employees. Four-hundred-one staff members have filled out questionnaires that assessed their understanding of standard precautions. A total of 257 recommendations have been made, and 95% of these have been implemented. The majority of recommendations address separation of clean and dirty supplies, hand hygiene compliance, hand hygiene signage, proper use of barriers, and environmental cleaning. Conclusion: The infection control audit is an opportunity to implement changes and to introduce remedial measures in collaboration with various departments and services.

For example, demographics and physical and social environments can be used as channels or venues to foster healthier behavioral changes; organizational settings such as community clinics or hospitals serve populations by targeting certain problems or conditions, and the programs or policies that address them can be specifically designed for the target population. By monitoring undesirable or risky health behaviors and incidence of disease and mortality rates which define public health issues in different populations, policies and programs to address them can be developed and implemented to help mitigate these health issues before they become a public health problem. Recognizing that differing demographic characteristics can trigger disparities in access to--or delivery of--health care, the policies and programs aim at eliminating barriers to accessibility to healthcare as part of a sustained effort towards the elimination of health disparities, defined as the difference in ""health status between a defined portion of the population and the majority"" in Carter- Pokras & Baoljet (2002) .

Stigma is not the determining factor in treatment seeking but, instead, economic and logistical barriers decide who will be able to avail themselves of care (Castro and Farmer 2005) . In the case of EVD, poor infrastructure and weak public health systems were undeniable contributors to the spread of the disease. Additionally, as Castro and Farmer (2005) indicate, EVD differentially affected people based upon economic resources. In one of the stories we analyze later in this chapter, the family was able to pay an exorbitant sum for the pregnant wife to access care, but many others did not have the economic means to pursue even regular obstetric care at any cost. These infrastructure and economic constraints, when combined with a high case fatality rate and rapid progression of clinical EVD, dramatically set Ebola apart from HIV/AIDS. Taken together with the criteria of Maman et al. (2009) for stigma, particularly as related to the fears of suffering and death and the fear of transmission, the weak state in many of the affected countries provided the perfect storm for the development of strong and pervasive Ebola stigma. We argue here that it is likely that health care workers and community members fell back on stigmatization as, what they saw as, one of only a few possible ways of protecting themselves. Pregnant women, even those unaffected by the virus, suffered the consequences of people's fears, which took the form of increased stigma that caused many women to be refused care at health facilities. The health care system was undeniably overwhelmed by the number of Ebola patients and the particular needs for quarantine and supplies these patients presented. The fact that an Ebola epidemic was able to effectively shut down any and all routine health care services, particularly vital functions related to obstetric care, is a testament to the long-standing weaknesses of these systems (Chothia 2014) .",16.004446360119086,9.73504366519726

In September 1995, NVAC recognized progress made on increasing preschool vaccine coverage rates [80] and resolved that the Secretary of HHS should engage all federal agencies ''to monitor the possible impact of [welfare] reforms on the immunization status of children and adults, to coordinate planning and development of welfare reform activities with respect to this issue, and to provide joint guidance to appropriate State agencies on vaccine coverage for such welfare reform proposals"" [81] . In 1998, NVAC emphasized the need to improve vaccine coverage for adolescents and recognized cost and lack of routine health care for adolescents as barriers [82] . NVAC also repeated its recommendation for insurance coverage with no deductible (i.e., ''first-dollar"" coverage) for childhood immunizations [58] . In May 1999, NVAC raised concerns about inadequate immunization infrastructure funding in the proposed fiscal year 2000 budget [83] . Following public debate about financing vaccines in the 21st century, NVAC recommended creating expanded and stable funding for vaccines under the Vaccines For Children program, harmonization of regulatory requirements to encourage vaccine development and licensure, insurance coverage with no deductible for immunization, and adequate reimbursement for providers who administer vaccines [65] . In September 2008, NVAC approved a report that sought to assure the vaccination of children and adolescents without financial barriers [84] , with the recommendations related to financing vaccine purchase and vaccine administration in the public and private sectors published in 2009 [85] . The report recommended funding for vaccine administration reimbursement for un-and underinsured children and adolescents [84] . In September 2012, NVAC recognized the vital resources provided by Section 317 of the Public Health Service Act (enacted in 1962 through the Vaccine Assistance Act) in its first 50 years with respect to achieving high levels of vaccination coverage and support for the immunization infrastructure, with discussion of the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine providing context about the importance of strong infrastructure [66] .

The 1991 report on measles suggested that NVAC ''should issue a formal set of minimum standards for immunization practice . . ."" [11] . In January 1994, NVAC approved its first full report on adult immunization, which included five major goals: ''(i) increase the demand for adult vaccination by improving provider and public awareness, (ii) assume the health care system has an adequate capacity to deliver vaccines to adults, (iii) assure adequate financing mechanisms to support the expanded delivery of vaccines to adults, (iv) monitor and improve the performance of the nation's vaccine delivery system, and (v) assure adequate support for research on (1) vaccinepreventable diseases of adults, (2) adult vaccines, (3) adult immunization practices, (4) new and improved vaccines, and (5) international programs for adult immunization"" [87] . NVAC participated in the Ad Hoc Working Group for the Development of Standards for Pediatric Immunization Practices that issued standards for pediatric immunization practices in 1993 [88] . In January 1998, NVAC approved a report that identified strategies to sustain success in childhood immunizations [58] , which provided a follow up to its 1991 report [11] .

Table 1 Comparison Although we do not have evidence that would allow us to assess appropriateness of large hospital visits, there is a strong consensus among medical and health policy experts that a substantial number of these patients could be treated more appropriately in primary care settings. In addition to the limitations we described above, existing social insurance policies seemed to be slightly inconsistent with the policies in healthcare reform. For example, social insurance policies do not allow community-based primary care organizations to prescribe some of drugs included in the pharmaceutical reimbursement list. To receive these drugs, patients must go to a large hospital. Because availability of drugs is constrained in community-based settings, some patients may be discouraged from using them as a regular source of care.

Those with low income received lower health system coverage than those with higher incomes but had an increased probability of either not seeking health care when ill or undergoing catastrophic medical spending. With mortality analysis showing a parallel transition in the major causes of death in the past 3 decades in China from communicable diseases and maternal and perinatal infectious conditions to noncommunicable chronic diseases, respectively accounting for 41% in 1973% and 74% of mortality in 2005, there was a staggering pace of increased age-standardized mortality of 10% from noncommunicable disease between 1991 and 2000. 22 Modification and prevention of behavioral risk factors, diet, hypertension, obesity, tobacco use, and the response to chronic disease have, thus, claimed center stage in China. Xiao and Kohrman 23 suggested integrating medical anthropological solutions in conjunction with legislation banning smoking in public places, uniformly high cigarette prices, and tobacco advertising bans 24 in arriving at a solution to tobacco use in China citing that smoking has been encouraged in Chinese society among men as a means of development, both economic and personal. 25 Since 1978, after China adopted reform policies and opened up to the global community, the medical care system and health of residents have improved. Nevertheless, the main orientation of health care reform in the 1980s and 1990s was to render autonomy to government-owned public hospitals without contribution of public expenditures. With the emergence of for-profit privately owned hospitals, health care expenditures increased along with disparities between urban and rural areas and different provinces increased at the expense of health care coverage and access to services for most of its citizens, most of whom were the poorest. By absorbing and integrating experiences domestically and abroad, the new guidelines for China's health care reform have addressed core issues of equity and accessibility with strong public support. 26 According to Chen, 27 China's 2009 plan for health care reform marked the first phase toward achieving comprehensive health coverage by 2020. There are 5 essential components: first, systematic reform and affirming the government's role in wide medical research coverage for more than 90% of Chinese citizens; second, a national essential-drug system to meet the basic needs for treatment and prevention of diseases and to ensure safety, quality, and supply; third, improved grassroots-level medical care, with emphasis in rural areas on infrastructure and human resources in a 3-tier network at county, town, and village levels, and urban CMCs to alleviate overcrowding in city hospitals and foster a gatekeeper system led by family doctors and nurses; fourth, promotion of basic public health services; fifth, pilot program reforms to direct substantial increases in public investment, restricting of hospital management, and correction of commercialization and skewed financial incentives.",17.58403279529019,8.668908889602635

For example, Honda's motorbike strategy in the US emerged by chance when some people showed an interest in the small motorbikes that were used by Honda's employees (Pascale, 1984) . In the hospitality industry, there are many examples of companies that failed when entering new markets or introducing new products after undertaking serious formal environmental analyses. For example, Paris Disneyland (also known as Euro Disney) was opened in 1990 after serious analyses, business plans and projections pointed to the conclusion that it would be a great success. However, after its grand opening, major problems relating to the product and its marketing approach emerged. The company encountered serious operational and financial difficulties and eventually had to readjust its product, marketing and human resource management policies in Europe. Paris Disneyland now operates as one of the Europe's top destinations. More examples can also be given about how McDonalds and Kentucky Fried Chicken started as small restaurants and eventually become national and global players through responding and overcoming emerging problems relating to their products and marketing approaches, and turning them into opportunities.",14.20223379902016,6.587466299237706

Treatment by a specialist leads to fewer hospitalizations, fewer exacerbations requiring emergency care, better quality of life, and better outcomes [163] . However, the availability of financial resources and, more important, the failure to properly allocate such resources can be such an economic burden that optimal systems of healthcare are not implemented. As a result of this, many asthmatic children receive the bulk of their care from generalists and even mid-level practitioners, even in those cases where referral to a specialist may be indicated. Unfortunately, in today's healthcare climate, generalists are being asked to see more and more patients, and they simply do not have the time to formulate a comprehensive asthma treatment program as illustrated in Fig. 16 [164] . Asthma educators who may be nurses or even medical assistants who are specially trained may help, but no financial resources are actually devoted to this form of medical care. Too many patients with asthma are not well controlled and eventually end up in an urgent care or emergency department, at many times the cost of prevention [165] .

Fostering this belief is a world economic outlook study that examined 42 countries representing 90% of the world population. 58 Output per capita per country rose but distribution among countries became more uneven as the 20th century progressed. Perhaps a better tool to assess this objectively is the Human Development Index (HDI).

The WHO directed programs and policies towards achievement of the goal of universal access to primary care in an atmosphere where there was a growing realization of the importance of intersectoral coordination for health outcomes. In describing eight essential areas of primary health care, the Declaration addressed social and biomedical aspects of health. The eight elements of primary care were health, education, nutrition, access to water and sanitation, maternal and child health care, immunization, prevention and control of locally endemic disease, treatment of common diseases and injury, and provision of essential drugs (WHO 1978) . Despite the Declaration's affirmation of the economic sector's contribution to community well-being, no explicit economic goals or inputs were described. Efforts to place health at the fore of economic and social policy remained hobbled by the comparative lack of power and resources of the WHO and many state ministries of health. A global scaling up of primary care would not be achieved easily. Perhaps the greatest consistent success came in expanding vaccination coverage vis-à-vis the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) launched in 1974 which will be discussed later in this chapter (Jamison et al. 2006 ). The era from 1978 to the late 1980s saw WHO focus on health as an outcome associated with broad socio-cultural milieu, in that success would be gauged by changes in the overall health profile of populations and communities, rather than changes in any the health burden of any one disease.",16.04333020161552,9.025257149525851

However, ultimately success and the true measure of innovation are judged by the level of adoption into the application sectors for which the technology was intended. Ultimate success depends on clear definition of the problem being addressed, as well as the capability of the end-user organization to adopt the solution. At the present time, adoption of the LOC concept has been greater in the research setting than in any other setting. While clinical diagnostics have been highlighted in the foregoing discussion, there may be other arenas where application of both LOC and POC testing offers potential benefits, e.g., in environmental, food, and material authenticity testing. Speed, simplicity, and mobility are all desirable attributes, while financial and environmental issues are equally applicable to all modalities of testing. There is no doubt that it is in these markets that the greatest volume of applications are to be found. However, we know from the experience of POC testing (see Point-of-Care Testing) that adoption has been slow, and furthermore, barriers to the adoption of new technologies in health care have been acknowledged. One of the key barriers is a poor understanding of the unmet need that might be addressed by the new technology. While it might be self-evident that an analytical device should address an unmet need, it is recognized in clinical diagnostics that there is significant over-requesting of tests, which is probably encouraged by the predominance of the fee-for-service business model. Furthermore, there is a lesson to be learned from the evolution of central laboratory analytical technology, where the early approach to ""scope"" was through the development of the ""multichannel analyzer."" It became evident after wide adoption of this technology that patients were being tested for analytes (or biomarkers) that were not necessarily relevant to their condition. This raised two issues. First, whether the patient (or the insurer) should have to pay for tests not required and second, a proportion of abnormal results were reported that were not relevant to the clinical condition being investigated. The consequence of this experience was the development of the discretionary analyzer, with a greater emphasis on ""relevant"" biomarkers or ""groups of biomarkers."" Consequently, while scope is a major attribute of the LOC concept, it presents a greater challenge to formulating the right ""group of biomarkers"" and demonstrating clinical utility. The ethical issues surrounding the generation of results not requested, referred to in the earlier discussion also has to be considered, as well as the growing demand for evidence of clinical utility as part of the patient demand for an improved quality of health care service.",17.56789938478489,8.23618123684413

Reports of ARF in children <3 years of age are very rare [17, [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] . Of 541 new cases of ARF reported from Salt Lake City, Utah, only 5% involved individuals <5 years of age. For those patients, the median age was 4 years [64]. In countries where ARF is more common than in the United States, the rate among young children is also low [66, 68, 69] . This is thought to be because it may take repeated exposures to GAS or priming of the immune system before there is an immune response to streptococcal pharyngitis that can lead to rheumatic fever [70] . The low prevalence of GAS pharyngitis and the low risk of developing ARF in children <3 years of age limits the usefulness of diagnostic testing in this age group. However, if a child is <3 years of age and there is household contact with a school-aged sibling with documented streptococcal pharyngitis, then it is reasonable to consider testing the child if the child is symptomatic. Previous family studies demonstrate a high rate of secondary streptococcal infections among household contacts. The likelihood of the spread of infection in a family is as high as 25% if the index subject has symptomatic pharyngitis [11, 71] , and studies demonstrate that up to one-third of persons in a semiclosed community developed symptomatic pharyngitis during an outbreak [72] [73] [74] . Therefore, if a child is in day care or another setting with a high rate of cases of GAS infections, then it is reasonable to test symptomatic children and treat them if they are found to be positive for GAS.",14.949851292539982,7.155624261855355

The characteristics in Table 2 largely follow this framework, including additional recommendations related to health care policies and procedures. Table 2 also identifies which of these requirements are currently used in the certification and testing of Surgical N95 respirators that have approval by NIOSH as an N95 respirator and are cleared by the FDA for sale as a surgical mask. Only 6 of the 28 Project BREATHE characteristics are currently evaluated with Surgical N95 respirators, suggesting that adoption of these characteristics in future respirator designs should help improve respirator compliance among HCP. It should be noted that some of the Project BREATHE characteristics in Table 2 can be met today with other respirator types. For example, loose-fitting, hooded, powered air-purifying respirators (PAPR) do not require fit testing and thus meet the desirable characteristics related to fit and gauging fit, whereas Effect of compliance on exposure reduction. Notes: Assigned protection factor (APF) is an estimate of the exposure reduction that a type of respirator is expected to provide when used correctly. Higher APF levels are assigned to respirators types that are expected to provide better levels of exposure reduction. APFs of 10, 25, and 50 are assigned to disposable N95 respirators, loose-fitting powered air-purifying respirators, and full facepiece elastomeric respirators, respectively. elastomeric half-mask (EHM) respirators with a particulate filter cartridge would readily meet characteristics 6 through 8. Whereas some respirator types meet a subset of the Project BREATHE characteristics, no single device today meets all of them nor could all of the recommendations be met by a single device. The health care environment is not only unique from other industries, but there are many niche settings that require different features for an idealized product. The Working Group recognized that meeting all 28 characteristics simultaneously was improbable because some of the recommendations were conflicting when applied concurrently but decided to publish all of them to provide maximum flexibility for subsequent users of the report to balance trade-offs and to not appear to favor any one type of respirator (eg, Surgical N95, PAPR, EHM, and others).",14.30818497246101,6.2316497831241096

For example, engagement of community members who advocate for best practices, encourage health-care-seeking behaviours, and support patients through treatment can help ensure that interventions initiated by the tuberculosis programme have wide-reaching and sustained eff ect. Additionally, partnerships with other government sectors, such as those in charge of prisons or social welfare programmes, can ease access to vulnerable or hard-to-reach populations. Finally, partnerships with the private sector are necessary in settings such as south Asia, where 80% of patients seek care from private providers. 75 In view of the large number and the heterogeneity of private providers, it is an immense undertaking for national tuberculosis programmes to eff ectively engage these providers to ensure that patients with tuberculosis receive timely diagnoses and appropriate treatment, and that all tuberculosis cases are reported to the national tuberculosis programme even if they are diagnosed and treated in the private sector. Although strategies will vary across settings, some approaches that have proven successful include use of large private hospitals with associated clinic networks as reporting centres for the national tuberculosis programme; use of mobile phone-based platforms to help report screening or diagnostic results from private facilities; and mass media campaigns that give publicity to private facilities that have partnered with the national programme to off er testing and treatment. 29, 75 Projection of impact What impact would be expected from a commitment to identify and treat more people with tuberculosis than is achieved at present? Models consistent with the present tuberculosis epidemics in China, India, and South Africa predict that an increase in case detection by 25% can achieve a 40-44% reduction in tuberculosis-associated mortality, a 22-27% reduction in incidence, and a 30-33% reduction in prevalence in 10 years (fi gure). 76 Furthermore, these interventions were deemed to be highly cost eff ective, even if the costs of the interventions were as high as US$2500 per case detected in India, and $5000 per case detected in China and South Africa. Importantly, these projections show that the populationlevel benefi ts of active case-fi nding accumulate with time since removal of infectious cases from the population prevents the development of additional cases in both the near-term and long-term future; thus an assessment at the end of 1 year is unlikely to show a substantial eff ect, even though the 10 year projected benefi t is substantial. These projections assume that detection is synonymous with prompt and eff ective treatment, so all case-fi nding has to be directly linked to the immediate delivery of care.",13.703971237482751,6.8553380148507586

In a digital age, it is possible to link data from diagnostic laboratories and POC test readers and devices to provide data on testing coverage, disease trends and timely information for early warning of infectious disease outbreaks to inform design or optimisation of disease control and elimination programmes. Data connectivity also allows control programmes to monitor the quality of tests and testing, and optimise supply chain management; thus, increasing the efficiency of healthcare systems and improving patient outcomes.",12.980936547963577,5.963216282225713

Specifically, CDC makes recommendations for ambulatory care settings that include dental offices. Challenges may exist when adapting Transmission-Based Precautions to dental offices rather than to inpatient facilities. For example, dental office staff members may not be able to identify patients with infections immediately, patients frequently remain in common waiting areas for prolonged periods and treatment rooms may be turned around quickly with limited cleaning. 8 Transmission-Based Precautions were mentioned in CDC's 2003 infection control guidelines for dental health care settings, 1 but not to any great extent. The same is true for dental infection control textbooks and journal articles; the main focus generally is on Standard Precautions. This may be because patients usually do not seek routine dental outpatient care when they are acutely ill with diseases that require Transmission-Based Precautions. 1 Nonetheless, a general understanding of precautions for diseases transmitted via all routes is important, because some dental health care personnel (DHCP) are hospital based or work part time in hospital settings, patients infected with these diseases might seek urgent treatment at outpatient dental offices, and DHCP might become infected with these diseases. 1 Also, recently, several diseases requiring precautions beyond Standard Precautions (for example, MRSA or 2009 H1N1 influenza) have received extensive media coverage, and some dental professionals have inquired why there were not specific infection control recommendations to cover these conditions in ambulatory care dental settings.",13.911827653241769,6.944915248311972

The UI population is often of lower socioeconomic status, which adds to the difficulties accessing health care. Given that most of the federal insurance plans are unavailable to the UI population, UIs are susceptible to higher out-of-pocket costs for care. In addition, because of undocumented status, they may not have sick leave days and may have difficulty negotiating time off from work to seek care. 8 Decreased proficiency in the language of the host country and fear of deportation may also present barriers to health care for UIs. Studies have shown that patients with limited English language proficiency (LEP) are at higher risk of poor health and have decreased access to health care. Patients who have LEP had increased difficulty in understanding their health status as well as accessing preventive services. 9 Fear of deportation may lead to the avoidance of seeking care and risk of severe health complications, 8 and this also affects health care for US-born children of UIs. In addition, shame and discrimination are common feelings experienced by the UI population and contribute to poor access to health care globally. 8 Many of these issues in health care are not unique to the United States. In a study by Chauvin and colleagues, 10 22% of the UI population in Europe had access to health coverage, and, of those, only about 36% had true access because of barriers such as administrative difficulties, limited language proficiency, and lack of awareness of available services.

Between patients who were and were not treated with neuraminidase inhibitors, there was no significant difference in symptoms; however, early receipt (within 48 hours) had a moderate benefit related to symptoms and duration of illness. 16 In an examination of clinical characteristics of ILI patients within the Military Health System stratified by hospitalization status, hospitalized patients were less likely to have received influenza vaccination and more likely to receive treatment with a neuraminidase inhibitor. Obesity and influenza A infection were also associated with increased risks for hospitalization. Furthermore, patients with influenza requiring hospitalization were more likely to be febrile, but otherwise presented with similar symptoms (e.g., chills, cough, and sore throat) as outpatients. 17 Incidence rates of ILI for trainees are typically based on passive surveillance of those presenting to medical clinics.

Governments may decide to invest in the development of primary care and disease prevention services to maximize cost-benefit indices, or tertiary care and treatment may be prioritized for fund distribution. Judgments must also be made about investment in research and development of medications, technologies and vaccines. Resource allocation decisions about health services relative to other national services are necessary. These decisions are political and vary greatly by nation and ideologies (Coburn, 2004) . They are likely to influence health by determining what kinds of services are available, how accessible and affordable they are and what sectors of the population have access (Mehrotra, 2006) . National policies regarding other domains of public life, including welfare, education, social security, subsidized housing, and employment, are also likely to play an important role in determining both quality of population health, as well as distribution of health outcomes in the population (Marmot, 2002) . Finally, political ideologies at the national level have been hypothesized to influence health by differential support of welfare policies and recognition of and attention to the needs of the population (Franco, Alvarez-Dardet, & Ruiz, 2004) . For example, a recent study found a link among good governance measured by accountability, political stability, absence of violence, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law and the control of corruption and national HIV prevalence (Menon-Johansson, 2005; Widdus, 2005) Economic decisions regarding resource allocation and distribution are likely to influence population health through various pathways with resounding health effects. For example, Freudenberg and colleagues (2006) describe the impact of city, state and federal budget cuts on a TB/HIV/homicide combined epidemic in New York City during the 1980s and 1990s, which they term a ""syndemic"". These authors argue that budget cuts undermined the ability of city health and social service infrastructures to respond to health emergencies and emerging health threats; reduced education, policing and drug treatment services; and amplified social trends. These factors then contributed to increased risk of violence and disease in the population. Other authors have posited that national policies influence health through the mechanisms of social capital, empowerment and access to information, which are differentially accorded to populations living under different political economic systems (Franco et al., 2004) . Perhaps most relevant to globalization and health are arguments delineating relationships between government policies shaped by capitalist ideology and health outcomes mediated by increasing income inequalities and lowered social cohesion (Coburn, 2000; Muntaner & Lynch, 1999) .

The definition of SPF macaques may vary from colony to colony depending on which agents have been targeted for elimination. At the most basic level, the initial targets for elimination should be Mycobacteria tuberculosis and Macacine herpes (BV) virus (Morton et al., 2008) . Although BV virus poses few problems for macaques, it does present a significant risk to personnel. Thus, from an occupational health viewpoint, most facilities prefer to utilize animals that are not infected with BV (Holmes et al., 1995; Cohen et al., 2002) . In contrast, infections with M. tuberculosis present a serious health threat to both humans and nonhuman primates, and therefore, rigorous testing for this organism is imperative, particularly when introducing animals from other sources (Ruch 1959) . In addition to BV, three other viruses have been targeted for elimination from macaque colonies designated for use in SIV/AIDS research: Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), Simian retrovirus D (SRV-D), and Simian T lymphotropic virus (STLV) (Mansfield, 2005; Morton et al., 2008) .",16.87341397282368,8.325061452854774

In areas with low healthcare use, the promotion of healthcare-seeking behaviours and the identification of missed cases during periodic interviews is important. A character isation of healthcareseeking behaviour requires under standing the types of healthcare facilities available, the l evels of health-care facilities at which patients can present for care, referral and treatment patterns, and modes of transportation between homes and health care facilities. Investigators must understand the local context regarding available healthcare-seeking behaviours, as well as barriers to care. For example, caretakers might not bring a sick child to any healthcare facility because of insurance status or if they distrust, or if they have little confidence in, medical personnel. Children with severe disease might not make it to a referral hospital if they have insufficient funds or resources for further transportation from a health post or centre. Lastly, the cost of health care at the referral facility might impede the child from receiving appropriate care. As with any community-based trial, there is rarely a universal approach. Pneumonia diagnosis and treatment differs largely between countries and even between clinicians and health-care professionals and, therefore, investigators must consider the local context when determining case definitions and surveillance systems.",17.250521825158906,7.726620475691069

In these settings, such laws are inequitably enforced, fail to meet any tangible public health objective -ie, reduce rates of HIV transmission 277 -and additionally, embed stigma and punish people for engaging in common behaviours such as sexual activity.

Therefore, while there is acknowledged need for ICT in the coordination and monitoring of treatment, surveillance, response, education, and communication in health care, in reality there are significant barriers in the application of ICT that slow progress. These barriers are in no way restricted to the developing world. The United States and other more technologically advanced nations have their own sets of challenges. Cost, misalignment of incentives, resistance, an unskilled workforce, concerns about impact on productivity, lack of standards and interoperability, and other issues contribute to a poor level of healthcare ICT adoption in the industrialized world. 16 The digital divide has resulted in large segments of low income and/or other underserved groups being excluded from online health resources. 16 Economic hardships and difficult tradeoff decisions in the US healthcare industry have further inhibited healthcare information technology growth. 17 In developing nations, the problem of ICT uptake is even further compounded. A lack of local expertise and decades of well-meaning but non-sustainable ICT projects in the developing world have left a legacy of skepticism in their wake. Systems built for Westernized health care delivery often do not match the local context, resulting in a misalignment between need and technology. Poverty and illiteracy in developing nations stand as major barriers to the adoption and sustainability of information technologies, and many believe it is difficult to make the case for ICT when basic needs for survival are barely being met. 18 The ""e-health paradox,"" a term coined by Liaw and Humphries, refers to this seeming conundrum; populations that may have the most to gain from ICT in health are those who are thwarted in their use due to barriers of untrained personnel, poor infrastructure, and lack of resources. 19 Issues such as these have fueled technological apartheid and continue to subvert the delivery of knowledge to areas of the globe that most desperately need it.",14.784540761605076,7.28028614737919

Too often, governments have used law for improper purposes, or with little consideration for the values of health with justice. In such cases, law can raise risks and create stigma. Inappropriate use of the criminal law has been deeply harmful in multiple spheres. For these reasons, policy makers should monitor and evaluate the effects of law on health and on justice.

The core instruments of international refugee lawthe 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, and the 1967 Protocol 308 -provide protection for refugees by prohibiting refoulment of refugees, or forcible returning of refugees to places where they fear for their lives or freedom. 309 Although the law has taken important steps to protect the wellbeing of refugees, profound gaps persist and negatively affect the rights and experiences of refugees, particularly with respect to health. Yet even more troublingly, laws and policies themselves can hinder health outcomes and contravene well established public health principles. This twin dynamic of unmet need and avoidable harm is exemplified in national laws and policies surrounding refugees and tuberculosis. 310 From the start of the journey, through to arrival at the country of asylum, refugees and others who are subject to forced migration are susceptible to contracting tuberculosis. This vulnerability begins with refugees' experiences in their home country, where health-care infrastructure might be lacking or have broken down because of war. For example, before the 2011 crisis began, Syria had a relatively low burden of tuberculosis. 311 Although data regarding tuberculosis in Syria remains elusive, reports show a rapid rise of the disease in the country, which is still believed to only be a fraction of the actual burden. 311, 312 After refugees leave their home country, the journey exacerbates their susceptibility to tuberculosis. Economic, social, and legal barriers increase the likelihood that tuberculosis will spread along the way and block access to care for those who contract it. These barriers, in turn, can lead to increases in the prevalence of tuberculosis in countries of asylum. Lebanon has been a country of asylum for Syrian refugees from the start of the conflict in 2011. 313 In the first year of receiving Syrian refugees, Lebanon saw a 27% increase in tuberculosis cases. 311 Reflecting this dynamic, countries enact national laws and policies regarding migrants and tuberculosis. For instance, some countries will not provide essential medical services to migrants with tuberculosis, some have legal requirements that individuals with tuberculosis undergo treatment as a condition of attaining legal status, and many detain and deport individuals who have or develop tuberculosis, frequently without providing necessary treatment. 310 In the USA, active tuberculosis is still one of the communicable diseases that trigger inadmissibility under the Immigration and Nationality Act, though a waiver may be possible. 314 These national restrictions based on tuberculosis claim public health as a justification, but directly contravene established public health principles and violate international law.",14.373077082037273,6.396578966170321

While these visions are perfectly realistic in the developed world, they are quite unrealistic in many parts of the globe. However, with the growth of cellular telephony, particularly in Africa, tremendous opportunities exist for nurses to creatively apply telehealth modalities to long-standing patient care issues. For example, Elder and Clarke cite the following examples for the potential use of cellular telephones and Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) for telehealth in Africa and Asia: 33 • Automation of demographic surveillance activities such as those at the core of pioneering health care initiatives (e.g., the Tanzanian Essential Health Interventions Project) • Testing of the use of SMS (short message service) reminders in the treatment of tuberculosis in Cape Town, South Africa • Delivery of continuing medical education and professional development via PDA • Delivery of time-sensitive alerts to patients and health care workers • Maintenance of patient records for HIV-positive patients' lifelong drug treatments • Management of specific health care initiatives such as the roll-out of antiretroviral therapy and tuberculosis treatment initiatives Again, realizing the numbers of nurses who are in the frontline of primary care around the globe and in light of the massive growth of ICT for health, tremendous opportunity awaits those who are primed to capitalize upon these factors. Making the application of telehealth/telenursing successful in developing countries will require strong nursing partnerships and leadership, however. Nurses are in a position to drive the development of science in this area, since many aspects of nursing care are naturally amenable to virtual delivery, especially in areas of assessment, patient teaching, decision support, and early identification of problems. 34 ",14.741368088984013,5.805514398442935

Concern about the health of rural-to-urban migrants in the early stages of the country's mass urbanisation was restricted to perceived threats posed by migrants, such as the possibility that this socalled floating population would evade the one-child policy 17 and contribute to the introduction of traditional rural infectious diseases to cities. 18 Migrant workers consistently underuse health services both in their origin communities and in their destination cities, creating potential short-term and long-term health problems. A large study in Shenzhenone of the top destinations for migrant workers in China (appendix)-showed that 55% of migrant workers were uninsured, and 62% of migrant workers who reported illness did not visit a doctor. 19 China's development strategy shifted to accept and promote migration to urban areas as important for stimulation of economic growth, and several major cities have initiated policies to address the major health issues facing migrants. In the 1990s, Beijing introduced policies intended to regulate the migrant population by, among other things, requiring that migrant workers had certification that they were in good health before they could legally work. 20 This policy was tested during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, when management of migrant workers became crucial for containment of the epidemic in the city. 20 In 2006, Beijing changed its approach, dropped the requirement for health certification, and offered basic health-care services through community healthservice centres, along with free diagnosis and treatment for tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. 20 Children of migrant workers were offered health-care services equal to those of registered urban citizens. 20 Progress has been slow, however, in the improvement of urban health-care access elsewhere. In 2006, only 28% of the urban population were covered by the Basic Health Insurance Scheme, which is the main urban health-care insurance scheme. 21, 22 The main reason for this low coverage was that the scheme did not cover informal sector workers and migrant workers. 21, 22 Positively, the Ministry of Health announced a pilot project in 2010, modelled on the Beijing programme, that aims to provide health-care services and health education to migrant workers in 65 major cities and counties in 29 provinces. 23 The challenges of health-care delivery to rural-to-urban migrants are made especially clear by China's childhood immunisation programmes, which have been substantially complicated by urbanisation. Since the early 1970s, the Planned Immunisation Programme has provided basic vaccines for tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, poliomyelitis, and measles; hepatitis B was added in 1992. Since 2005, the programme has offered nine vaccines free of charge to all neonates and infants nationwide, and coverage has increased strikingly in both urban and rural areas. Much progress has been made towards closing the urban-rural gap in coverage. For instance, in 1993, hepatitis B vaccination coverage was less than 50% in nearly all rural communities, whereas it was over 90% in urban areas. 24 By contrast, in 2006, hepatitis B vaccination coverage reached 95% in urban neonates and exceeded 80% in most rural areas. 25 Despite this progress, the mass rural-to-urban migration over the past two decades has resulted in a troubling trend whereby immunisation coverage in the children of migrants is less extensive than in both their urban and rural counterparts. [26] [27] [28] [29] For example, in the Pearl River Delta region of Guangdong Province-which is a major destination for migrant workers (appendix)-average full-dose coverage for tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, poliomyelitis, measles, and hepatitis B in the children of migrant workers was estimated to be less than 60%. 26 In less developed migrant destinations, such as Guigang City in Guangxi, the full-dose coverage was less than 20%, except for tuberculosis (36%). 27 China has addressed these troubling trends by establishing community healthservice centres in urban areas to provide basic post-birth immunisation, among other services, but they have been underused by migrant workers. Little awareness of immunisation among migrant parents, the costs associated with inoculation, 26,27 frequent job-related changes of residence, 28 and births that violate the one-child policy have been cited as important factors driving low immunisation coverage in their children. To strengthen immunisation programmes to reach this population is now a high priority for China's health policy makers.",16.257064259017227,6.929436252104889

There are several reasons why local and national health institutions should invite nurses with disaster management experience to participate in decision making and action plans. First, nurses have invaluable frontline empirical experience as well as immediate and reliable information. Gottlieb (2004) stressed that nurses have always played a key role in case detection, infection control, public education, risk mitigation, and risk containment. Second, nurses form the largest professional group in the health care marketplace; hence, their inputs should be seriously considered and incorporated in the design of institutional missions and policies (Des Jardin, 2001) . Third, a significant part of nurses' responsibility is to act as patient advocates and ensure that patients retain their right to quality care and informed choice. DiGaudio (1993) asserted that the active involvement of nurses in policymaking would lead to better resource allocation. Meanwhile, increased participation would promote nurses' control over their practice and enhance the respect given to nurses as professionals. As such, political and action involvement at the local and national levels will offer nurses various opportunities to influence and seek changes in their workplace and to act as a voice for others.",13.409729602466795,4.635872558639218

Americans are faced with an increasingly complex health care system and the barriers to care are more pervasive and subtle than previously identified barriers because of unfavorable insurance status. While earlier legislative initiatives such as EMTALA and the prudent layperson standard provided important safeguards for managed care plan enrollees and the larger community, many emergency providers eventually came to resent the legislation as an unfunded federal mandate for universal access to health care via emergency departments [14] . The resultant combination of regulatory and fiscal pressures on hospitals resulted in increasingly stressed and crowded conditions in many EDs [3] . Regulatory extensions of EMTALA have held health systems liable for providing not only emergency care, but also any needed care.

Indeed, the topic of access, particularly for vulnerable populations, pervades much of EM public health research. Before the 1980s, it was both traditionally and federally reinforced through Hill Burton funding that hospitals provided the majority of ''charity care'' [3] . The original emergency rooms were started in response to unattached patients. At that time, those individuals without primary care physicians who presented to the hospital in acute distress would be evaluated by the charge nurse and, if necessary, the on-call physician. Early EDs were primarily staffed by nurses, rotating residents from various specialties, and physicians trying to build practices [4] . The growth of the specialty of EM was very much consumer driven as the volume increased to the point that overwhelmed existing staff, who were all trying to do other jobs. Finally, small groups of physicians began providing full-time coverage of EDs as attending physicians dedicated to providing emergency care; the Pontiac Plan and the Alexandria Plan were examples. These informal groups soon united to define the scope of EM, develop curriculum and board certification, and lobby organized medicine for specialty status. The new specialty grew exponentially and was amazingly successful both for hospitals and EM physician groups [4] . However, major changes in the financing and delivery of health care in the 1980s resulted in increasing rates of uninsured patients [5] . Many private hospitals started to baulk at absorbing this burden and developed policies of referring or transferring uninsured ED patients to publicly funded county hospitals. Emergency physicians and patients responded to these ''patient dumping'' policies with research and advocacy [6] .

However, challenges remain and persisting inequities in vaccine uptake contribute to the continued occurrence and outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. Inequalities in immunization coverage by geography, urbanrural, and socio-economic status jeopardize the achievement of global immunization goals and call for renewed immunization strategies. These should take into account emerging opportunities for building better immunization systems and services, as well as the development of new vaccine products and delivery technologies. Such strategies need to achieve equity in vaccination coverage across and within countries. This will require the participation of communities, a better understanding of vaccine acceptance and hesitancy, the expansion of vaccination across the life course, approaches to improve immunization in middle-income countries, enhanced use of data and possible financial and non-financial incentives. Vaccines also have an important role to play in comprehensive disease control, including the fight against antimicrobial resistance.

In such situations, authoritative guidance is needed. Countries all over the world have established their own structures to disseminate outbreak control guidelines and, if necessary, put outbreak control systems in place. In a crisis, health care professionals with diverse backgrounds need to work quickly together to identify cases, perform laboratory diagnostics, trace contacts, and institute infection prevention and control measures as described in the outbreak control guidelines. 1 Optimal compliance with the guidelines, with timely and adequate outbreak control as final outcome, requires good adherence by professionals. Unfortunately, however, their adherence is often not optimal, 2-5 due to knowledge, attitudes, and behavior among professionals, 6, 7 as well as to organizational and other factors. Guidelines are not always clear, and existing facilities are not always adequate or adaptable to the sudden intrusion of crisis measures. A systematic review conducted by Cabana et al 8 revealed a variety of barriers that hinder adherence. The authors provide a generic framework for exploring barriers in various settings. According to the authors, barriers to adherence include those related to the professionals, with a more cognitive (knowledge, awareness) or affective (attitude, motivation) component, those related to the guidelines (their content and target patient population), and those related to the environment (organization, social setting). 8 Many studies have looked at determinants of adherence to guidelines in the routine care of infectious disease, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] but little is known about determinants of adherence to guidelines in crisis situations. 15, 16 Crisis situations differ significantly from routine communicable disease control, because health professionals must respond with prompt decisions, uniformity of action, and quick integration of new knowledge and skills. Furthermore, the context of crisis situations is complex, requiring optimal communication and cooperation between public health services and hospitals. A better understanding of the reasons for nonadherence of health care professionals in crises situations is needed to improve crisis management.

Methods: In-depth interviews were performed (n 5 26) to develop a questionnaire for a cross-sectional survey of microbiologists (100% response), infection preventionists (74% response), public health physicians (96% response), and public health nurses (82% response). The groups were asked to appraise barriers encountered during 4 outbreaks (severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], Clostridium difficile ribotype 027, rubella, and avian influenza) according to a 5-point Likert scale.

By contrast, basic postabortion case management will save a higher proportion of mothers in subgroup 1 but more deaths will actually be averted in subgroups 2 and 3.

The most important determinants of adherence to recommended use of FPE were found to be the organizational characteristics of the workplace. As a follow-up to this study, intervention studies testing different strategies targeting these organizational dimensions are needed. Competence with recommended use of an N95 respirator for a patient on airborne precautions was examined in phase 2 of this study, and knowledge was found to be the primary determinant of competence. No relationship between self-reported adherence and observed competence was found in this study, but one could hypothesize that, whereas competence does not always lead to effective performance or adherence, it could be seen as one of its many determinants. Further research examining the relationship between competence and adherence would be valuable. This area of research is particularly important because studies of observed adherence to recommended use of FPE are logistically difficult in the acute health care sector. Finally, the examination of different methodologies for investigating adherence to FPE could be part of future research studies. Using the current methodology, we were unable to measure observed adherence but were able to measure competence.

Emergence of drug resistance is influenced by multiple factors, such as patient compliance, immune status of patients, suboptimal dosage, drug potency, genetic barrier of a drug to resistance, viral fitness or the biology of virus (reviewed in (Gotte, 2012; Strasfeld and Chou, 2010) ). Drug resistance is caused by the development of viral mutations that arise during antiviral treatment or by preexisting virus variants that carry such mutations. Viral mutations can confer various levels of reduced susceptibility or resistance to a drug, and clinically meaningful drug resistance can arise when viral replication is insufficiently suppressed by plasma drug concentrations. Antiviral compounds have varying genetic barriers to resistance. Those with low genetic barriers relatively readily lead to the emergence of mutations associated with clinically meaningful resistance and may not be suitable for monotherapy or longer duration of treatment. In contrast, those with high genetic barriers have reduced risks of developing resistance during antiviral treatment (reviewed in (Gotte, 2012; Strasfeld and Chou, 2010) ).

The UI population is often of lower socioeconomic status, which adds to the difficulties accessing health care. Given that most of the federal insurance plans are unavailable to the UI population, UIs are susceptible to higher out-of-pocket costs for care. In addition, because of undocumented status, they may not have sick leave days and may have difficulty negotiating time off from work to seek care. 8 Decreased proficiency in the language of the host country and fear of deportation may also present barriers to health care for UIs. Studies have shown that patients with limited English language proficiency (LEP) are at higher risk of poor health and have decreased access to health care. Patients who have LEP had increased difficulty in understanding their health status as well as accessing preventive services. 9 Fear of deportation may lead to the avoidance of seeking care and risk of severe health complications, 8 and this also affects health care for US-born children of UIs. In addition, shame and discrimination are common feelings experienced by the UI population and contribute to poor access to health care globally. 8 Many of these issues in health care are not unique to the United States. In a study by Chauvin and colleagues, 10 22% of the UI population in Europe had access to health coverage, and, of those, only about 36% had true access because of barriers such as administrative difficulties, limited language proficiency, and lack of awareness of available services.

In the current Ebola crisis, the longstanding lack of access to basic primary care, laboratories with insufficient capacity, and shortage of existing hospital infrastructure to isolate and treat infected people left communities with little trust in the health system, families with no help to tend for their seriously ill members, and fuelled the spread of the epidemic and its resulting death toll.",11.798811011111567,5.040426867116034

Direct service is the provision of services to the public, especially useful in areas where universal coverage is essential (e.g., immunizations), or for high-risk groups not able to access other services (e.g., prenatal care for the poor).",13.333571464553748,7.435841129975861

For example, persons with low income are ≈2× as likely as those with higher incomes to lack a usual source of healthcare (24) . Similarly, non-Hispanic black and Hispanic persons are signifi cantly less likely than non-Hispanic white persons to report having a usual primary care provider (10). Among persons who do report having a usual source of care, those who are poor or near poor and those who are non-Hispanic black or Hispanic are 2.5-4× as likely as their relatively higher income and white counterparts to rely on a hospitalbased source of primary care (24) . These same groups are also more likely to report having diffi culty obtaining timely appointments for illness or injury, which suggests problems with access to care even among those with a usual source of healthcare (10) . Language and cultural barriers to seeking and receiving medical care also may contribute to disparities. In emergency departments, for example, interpreters are frequently unavailable or underused, which has potentially adverse implications for patients' understanding of their disease or treatment and for clinical decision making Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 14, No. 5, May 2008 711 Table. Factors that could contribute to health disparities among socioeconomic and racial/ethnic groups during an influenza pandemic Differences in exposure to influenza virus Crowding in households, medical facilities, public transportation Occupational factors such as inability to work from home, dependence on childcare outside of the home Differences in susceptibility to influenza disease, once exposed to the virus Host factors, including preexisting immunity, age, other underlying diseases or conditions, smoking, nutritional status, stress Vaccination status, reflecting differences in vaccine seeking and acceptance and in vaccine availability Differences in timely effective treatment, once influenza disease has developed Access to outpatient and inpatient medical care Care-seeking attitudes and behavior Financial obstacles, including lack of adequate insurance coverage Logistic obstacles, including transportation, language Quality of care Availability of antiviral treatments Appropriate inpatient treatment and quality of care (25) . In addition, the large numbers of persons who lack health insurance, as well as those who lack documentation of US citizenship, often delay seeking care because they are concerned about paying for the care or encountering legal diffi culties. Evidence from previous outbreaks suggests that antiviral drugs may be effective for treatment (26) and prevention (27) of pandemic infl uenza, and current antiviral drugs seem to be biologically effective against 1918 and 1918like viruses (28) . Because vaccine may not be available when a pandemic begins, experts have suggested that the antiviral drug oseltamivir should be stockpiled for use during a pandemic infl uenza outbreak. Recent models suggest that early use of oseltamivir may contain outbreaks if certain criteria regarding transmissibility and compliance are met (29) . However, experience with nonpandemic infl uenza indicates that oseltamivir must be given early during symptom development for it to have any substantial biological effect (30) ; modest delays may vitiate the treatment effectiveness (31) . Although plans for release and distribution of antiviral drugs are still being fi nalized, overcoming long-standing disparities in access to timely treatment by socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, ability to speak English, and legal status will present numerous challenges to ensuring equal access to such drugs during a pandemic.",14.563361103933211,6.6378303542339845

Financial realities must be considered. It is important to address the cost of care and give clients a schedule and treatment plan (including a cost estimate) for upcoming visits so that they can plan for these expenses. The AAHA strongly suggests that all pet-owning families consider their ability to meet unexpected expenses that may be incurred for veterinary care (Box 8-1). The expenses may be met through existing savings, credit card reserves, Care Credit or other medical payment cards, monthly budgeting for pet care expenses, or pet health insurance policies. Pet health insurance has become a good method of mitigating health care expenses. The proportion of cats insured varies greatly among different countries, but it is almost invariably lower than the proportion of dogs insured. Pet insurance can provide excellent value for the cost and allow patients to receive highly expensive urgent care and crisis management that may not be feasible otherwise. Many policies now offer preventive health care coverage. Each insurance company works differently, and clients are encouraged to review policies carefully. Few clients are aware of pet insurance without a specific veterinary recommendation; the veterinary team should explain benefits and possible limitations of pet insurance. The National Commission on Veterinary Economic Issues (NCVEI) position paper, ""A veterinarian's guide to pet health insurance,"" contains excellent information to help veterinarians and veterinary teams learn more about pet insurance. 100 In the United States there is also a website that helps consumers compare various pet health insurance companies (Pet Insurance Review, see Box 8-1).",19.27472370599156,6.726333879501182

Each suspected case of malaria will be confirmed with a rapid diagnostic test, treated with an antimalarial medicine, and tracked using a surveillance system (WHO, 2012b). Joint country efforts could be made on scaling-up access to malaria diagnostic testing, access to treatment at the community level in Africa with quality artemisinin-based antimalarial compound medicines, including lifesaving injectable artesunate, and strengthening the malaria surveillance system.

We predict that this situation will persist for several reasons. First, providers of all facility levels are mainly paid by fee-for-service, creating incentives to increase activities rather than improve patient health. Providers have no incentive to coordinate care with other health-care professionals because their fi nancial interest is to keep rather than refer patients to an appropriate site of treatment. The government has announced a shift from fee-for-service to other forms of provider payment, such as case-based payments, capitation, and global budget. However, they have so far been implemented as facility-specifi c rather than population-based payments, and therefore, do not provide incentives for several providers to coordinate care decisions. Second, fragmentation in fi nance creates barriers for the integration of services. Although primary health-care providers are mostly fi nanced by government subsidies to provide primary care, hospitals are paid by SHIs and patient out-of-pocket payments. Primary health-care facilities have no fi nancial leverage over hospitals. Third, in many cases SHI coverage is more generous for inpatient than outpatient services, incentivising patients to seek hospital care fi rst because, generally, patients do not trust the quality of primary health-care facilities. All these factors make it diffi cult for primary health care to have a gatekeeping role. Exacerbation of this situation means that, within the medical profession, specialists are held in high esteem, whereas primary health-care providers are not well respected, creating further barriers for them to have the care-coordinator role. Perhaps the greatest barrier to a primary health-care-centred integrated delivery model approach is the dominant profi t-driven hospital sector, irrespective of whether the hospital is public or private.",17.644781472539776,8.551005537102178

Aff ordability is a high priority in countries moving towards UHC. Designing and then equitably implementing eff ective policies can only be achieved through concerted eff orts by governments and health systems, in concert with the pharmaceutical industry. The Commission maintains that every available regulatory and management intervention that could improve the aff ordability of medicines must be considered. The suite of policy instruments includes: pricing interventions, pro-generic policies, use of TRIPS fl exibilities when patent barriers prevent access to lowerpriced alternatives, and avoidance of TRIPS-plus provisions in bilateral trade agreements. Considerable evidence supports the use of these policies to support the aff ordability of essential medicines. 220 No option should be regarded as off the table for political reasons. For example, removing taxes and tariff s is well within the power of governments, even if it might be unpopular with certain stakeholders. Moreover, committing to UHC provides countries with new opportunities to eff ectively implement policies, such as leveraging newly created buyer power and fi nancial pooling, to address high prices of medicines.

This legislation, often referred to as the Comprehensive Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act or ""anti-dumping"" legislation, is included in Title XVII of the Social Security Act. Any hospital that received Medicare funding must comply with these regulations, even for non-Medicare patients. A hospital can be fi ned up to $50,000 per violation, and the hospital's or physicians' Medicare and Medicaid agreements may be terminated by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. 33, 34 EMTALA applies when a person comes to a hospital with an ED and requests care for an emergency medical condition. It also applies if a parent is requesting care for his or her child. An emergency medical condition is an illness or injury that manifests itself by acute symptoms requiring immediate attention to avoid placing the health of the person in serious jeopardy. 33 In terms of a woman in labor, this constitutes inadequate time to transfer her prior to delivery. However, the existence of an ""emergency medical condition"" is based upon the defi nition of a prudent layperson, not a health care professional. 33 In order to fulfi ll the EMTALA obligation, a patient must be screened and, if necessary, stabilized. If a patient cannot be stabilized, he or she must be transferred to an appropriate facility, with the receiving facility aware of and accepting the transfer. 33 The ED and hospital should have an EMTALA policy that addresses items such as what constitutes a screening examination, who can perform the screening examination, which parts of the hospital/main campus qualify under EMTALA, and who responds to medical emergencies outside of the ED. 33, 34 A revised aspect of EMTALA is the ""on-call"" requirement.

In 2003, the new rural cooperative medical system (NRCMS) was implemented in the four provinces by the State Council.

Secondly, the diagnosis of influenza can help guide antiviral treatment for individual patients.

High risk is not the same as HTR, although there appears to be substantial overlap; whereas not all at high risk are hard-to-reach, many in the HTR population are at high risk. While no uniform definition of HTR populations exists, HTR populations have typically been defined from the perspective of linkage with the health care system, i.e., persons who do not seek treatment in traditional care settings such as provider offices or clinics. The size of hard-to-reach populations, whereas hard to estimate, is not trivial; some examples of constituent groups are as follows: 11.5-12 million undocumented immigrants nationwide, 18 1.5 million injection drug users in 96 large U.S. metropolitan areas 19 and 744,000 homeless persons nationwide, 20 as well as a proportion of the elderly and minorities. Overall, the percentage of U.S. residents at high risk for influenza but who are not immunized has been estimated to be as high as 65%. 3 Failure to be immunized is related to lack of health insurance and to having a regular provider; 21 this may be a particular concern for specific HTR groups. For example, mobile elderly differ from the majority of the other population groups in that they are covered by Medicare and generally frequent a health care provider. Thus, whereas the elderly as a high-risk group may differ from other groups in terms of access to health care as an entitlement, a proportion is not connected to care and is therefore HTR. The lack of a regular health care provider is correlated with race and ethnicity. 7 While 80% of White adults have a primary care provider, the percentage is closer to 70% for Asian-Americans and Blacks, and only 57% for Hispanics. 22 As reviewed elsewhere, other barriers to accessing care include culturally derived attitudes and belief systems, negative experiences with past treatment, language and other barriers in patient-provider relationships, and legal status (e.g., undocumented immigrants). [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] Some groups harbor substantial myths about and distrust of the medical system; previous research has shown that their attitudes appear to be strong predictors of being immunized. 28 VLAHOV ET AL. 616",16.53531414677885,7.627621821995231

The first grant, of US$90 million, was used largely to provide HIV testing and antiretroviral treatment to people in the seven central provinces of China most affected by the outbreak related to blood selling. Funding for HIV prevention and care from domestic coffers rose quickly (the details can be seen in Fig. 10 .8 of the Chap. 10). Until 2000 it languished under US$2 million a year. In 2001, with the first 5-year plan, that amount rose sevenfold. In 2003 it more than tripled again to almost US$50 million. By 2004, the year when China's leadership really put its weight behind HIV prevention and care, government spending had hit over US$100 million [12] .",13.52982220027862,6.6522264792611825

This allows the decision maker to incorporate a broad range of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions and their attendant logistical constraints into the underlying epidemic model.

In addition, leveraging on the unique ""One Health"" approach to transform health care and health policy and to prioritize collaborative programs can be extended from infectious diseases to maternal and child health and health disparity in the poorest populations in Africa [1, [10] [11] [12] . Secondly, building regional surveillance systems is another way to enhance the local health system. The importance of implementing a local and national ""One Health"" policy and programs holds tremendous prospects, such as co-tackling the epidemiological and environmental challenges, and accelerating in the transition from control to elimination of infectious diseases under China-Africa collaboration [5, 15] . Furthermore, it has potential to revolutionize national health systems, policies and strategic priorities and the patterns in health financing and resources allocation of African countries that require careful understanding of the local context of diverse stressors and drivers [21, 13] . These will continue to dominate the performance and effectiveness of ""One Health"" in threats and epidemics prevention strategies and policies on healthcare and health outcomes. Thus, assessing health impact especially how greenhouse gas and ozone emissions, rising temperature and environmental pollution resulted in climate change impacts to health ecosystem, such as population movement, animal trading and ecology of vectorborne disease and ill health, aging, chronic disease, drug use and domestic violence, inequity and poverty [16] . Thirdly, improving the core capacities of international health regulations is the sustained efforts to improve the human welfare. For example, China's response impacting the global health fund (e.g., malaria, HIV/AIDS, schistosomiasis, Ebola, influenza, TB, hepatitis, etc.) has shown robust global health leadership engagement [1, 2, 3] . The leadership reflected in the strategic mobilization and investment of resources fostering more easily accessible, availability and cost effectiveness of prevention and treatment interventions to resources limited countries including African countries [1] . The growing mutual China-Africa win-win collaboration spans to technical expertise, technology transfer and capacity development using scientific and advanced methods to tackle the disease, and have enhanced their commitment to respect the dignity of the people such as Chinese Ebola outbreak emergency response in West Africa. Fourthly, enhancing the use and management of traditional medicines could improve the community involvement in health care and extend the trade among countries. So far, trade between China and Africa is projected to reach $ 385 million USD a year by 2015. Increasingly, embracing ""One Health"" strategy to increase universal coverage of healthcare is significant as sharing China's rich expertise and lessons learnt in strengthening health systems and tackling public health burden both in China and Africa communities.

This coverage is often provided to employees in exchange for releasing their right to sue their employer for negligence, sometimes with fixed limits on payment of damages. Employers need to understand whether the workers' compensation coverage that is applicable and in place for their and their employees' protection, covers international travel. In some cases, additional policies or riders will be required to provide coverage for travel outside of the traveler's home country or state. Additional considerations to this kind of coverage should be as to ""when"" and ""where"" the coverage is in effect outside of a company office or facility (e.g., business travel). In some cases this may limit employer liability, but whether it does varies by jurisdiction and circumstance. Considering how workers' compensation benefits have been reduced in recent years, especially in the United States, 14 much consideration needs to be given to assessing what coverage is needed for traveling employees above and beyond workers' compensation, and coordinated with crisis response protocols and risk management support providers for efficient case management, claims, and documentation. All of these considerations provide a strong business case for why employers should have unique and specific programs in place for medical services and evacuations for employees and contractors traveling abroad in addition to their standard domestic health care plans and workers' compensation plans. No traveler should embark on a business trip without the complete confidence that medical coverage and resources not requiring their personal, out-of-pocket expenditure is being provided by their employer.",15.339843563762418,9.076725942278394

Additionally, a kidnap and ransom insurance policy is something for all companies to consider, with an understanding that kidnappings happen at anytime around the world, and largely go unreported. According to The Guardian News and Media (UK), approximately 75% of Fortune 500 companies have kidnap and ransom (K&R) insurance. K&R insurance originates from 1932, when it was first offered by insurance provider Lloyd's of London, after the kidnapping and murder of American aviator Charles Lindbergh's infant son. In 2015, the UK's Home Secretary, Theresa May, supported and passed the UK's ""Counter-Terrorism and Security Act of 2015,"" which prohibits insurers from paying claims used to finance payments to terrorist groups. The UK is where many of the world's K&R insurers operate. Many insurers insist that it shouldn't matter because they claim to not pay or finance ransoms, but instead pay claims for services and expenses related to negotiating the release of the captives in question, medical and counseling treatment, along with things such as employee salaries while in captivity. It's difficult to obtain information from clients who hold such policies, because most policies have strict cancelation provisions to prevent a company from disclosing the fact that it has such a policy. Details specific to restrictions on insurance related payments associated with terrorist related ransoms in the UK's Counter-Terrorism Act of 2015 can be found at http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/6/section/42/enacted.",14.847213338219769,8.63910459343719

The Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program supported the scale and spread of evidence-based home visiting programs in many state and territorial health agencies' maternal and child health programs. New opportunities to prevent chronic diseases, unintentional injury, and other leading causes of morbidity and mortality were established in the nation's first ever source of dedicated funding for prevention: the Prevention and Public Health Fund. ASTHO supports several Prevention and Public Health Fund programs including the Million Hearts Initiative, tobacco use prevention, and initiatives to expand breast-feeding at the state and territorial levels. The ACA also led to new challenges for ASTHO and its members. Questions about the public health agency role as a safety net provider were raised and threatened to lead to funding reductions because state health agency efforts were perceived of as duplicative of services covered by health insurers. While concerns that state immunization, STD/STI prevention and control, breast and cervical cancer screening, infant mortality/preterm birth prevention, hypertension, and child and youth with special health care needs programs would be eliminated by the ACA have not been realized, there are lingering questions about why public health agencies are funded to provide the delivery of clinical services when the population traditionally served by state and territorial health agencies is now Medicaid eligible or may obtain health insurance coverage through the federal health care exchange.",15.41262693339127,8.25569614864129

Laboratory information must therefore be accurate, reliable and reproducible. Although in some diagnostic questions rapid delivery of the test results is important, traditional centralised laboratories tend to highlight the quality and reliability of tests above the turn‐around‐time.3 For many diseases, care providers and patients increasingly expect patient‐focused, specialised diagnostic tests that can be performed quickly, easily and provide results within minutes.4 This has led to the development of easy‐to‐use analysers that can be performed at the point of care, more commonly known as point‐of‐care (POC) testing or near‐patient testing.1

When the attack rate is high, transmission might occur regardless of isolation and the policy might merely create a burden on the isolated individuals and their families, without a tangible public health benefit. If the policy is proven effective, it is not known whether the CDC-recommended one day of symptom-based isolation is sufficient, and if not, how many days would be most beneficial. At the outset of our project, we hypothesized that these policies would have a small beneficial effect on reducing attack rate, delay the peak of the outbreak and reduce the height of its peak. We did not expect these policies to reduce the overall incidence because there would be many other opportunities to become infected.

Reporting rates and rates of seeking medical care may differ, as most individuals visiting a clinician for acute respiratory illness are not tested for seasonal CoV.

Improved understanding of the presence and prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 at a population level can help government and hospital officials implement appropriate policies to mitigate the exponential spread of COVID-19, and diminish the future strain on healthcare facilities. Despite pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide, broad access to testing in the United States (US) has thus far been severely limited. While it is impractical to test every US resident for SARS-CoV-2, the virus has been found in the stool of confirmed COVID-19 patients (1), making it a promising candidate for wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE). WBE can help detect the presence of pathogens across municipalities and estimate population prevalence without individual testing, and inform public health officials of the efficacy of interventions. The closely related virus SARS-CoV was detected in wastewater from Chinese hospitals during the 2002-2003 SARS pandemic (2) , and WBE has been used for the early detection and direct mitigation of disease outbreaks in Israel, Egypt and Sweden (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . We have previously used this technique to measure and map the use of pharmaceuticals across residential communities (8) . Here, we describe an analytical technique to extract and detect genetic material from SARS-CoV-2 using wastewater collected at a treatment facility.",14.13129388663803,5.378992699144006

Accordingly, the saturation is reached once 0.08% of the population is detected as infected.

After containment of the initial outbreak failed, attention turned to implementing large-scale social policies designed to slow contagion of the virus, 6 with the ultimate goal of slowing the rate at which life-threatening cases emerge so as to not exceed the capacity of existing medical systems. In general, these policies aim to decrease opportunities for virus transmission by reducing contact among individuals within or between populations, such as by closing schools, limiting gatherings, and restricting mobility. Such actions are not expected to halt contagion completely, but instead are meant to slow the spread of COVID-19 to a manageable rate. These large-scale policies are developed using epidemiological simulations 2, 4, 7-17 and a small number of natural experiments in past epidemics. 18 However, the actual impacts of these policies on infection rates in the ongoing pandemic are unknown.

From the de novo set and the published primers set, we reported only the highest ranked ones. For example, for Charophyceae (clade 304574), the highest ranked primer by coverage is d8d47dc9b873d02b -a de novo computed primer, and the highest ranked published primer is EUK14. In the joint set, however, there are more de novo primer pairs that have a higher rank than EUK14, but are not reported here for the sake of briefty. When ranking by coverage, for 11 out of 19 clades a de novo primer outperformed all published primers. Since coverage optimizes towards broadness and variation towards amplicon distinguishability, we expect that the top primers for the two ranking methods may differ. In 14 out of 38 cases the top primers of the de novo or published sets are identical. In 24 cases higher variation is paid with lower coverage and vice versa. When ranking by number of unique amplicons (variation), we could identify seven de novo primers that performed equally well (see Table 8 ).",7.539761578570644,4.6796730820693515

Primarily, critical or severe cases will be affected by the gradually rational allocation of treatment teams and medical resources, the strengthening of medical power or virus toxicity decreasing. As a result, the peak time might arrive earlier than our estimates. Secondly, the impact of seasonal factors has not been considered and supposing 2019-nCoV is affected by the season, our prediction results may be unreliable. Hence, if these indicators continue to change, the model could have opportunities for improvement. In addition, due to the characteristics of severe and critical cases, there may be a huge impact on factors such as age and complex underlying diseases. Therefore, with the increasing awareness of the severity of the disease and the strengthening of prevention and control in various sectors of the society, various indicators may be reduced. At the same time, because of the instability of the previous indicators, these dynamic changes may affect the predictive efficacy of the model.",7.574053405365072,4.110584601287298
