However, the evidence base for how to achieve this priority has lagged behind. There is still little agreement on how to measure, let alone improve, public health response performance [3, 4] . A number of challenges have been cited as barriers to research advancement in this field, including: the infrequent nature of large-scale public health emergencies [3, [5] [6] [7] , the heterogeneity of emergency events and of public health delivery structures [3, 6] , the challenges with access to incident leadership during real-world emergencies [7] , the limited ability for standardized surveys to measure complex agency and system processes [6] , and the difficulty of identifying a comparison group or constructing a counterfactual of what might have occurred if particular public health interventions had not taken place [8, 9] . As a result, outside of statistical modeling, researchers have often been limited in their use of statistical methods to test hypotheses, reach generalizable conclusions, and isolate factors that are likely to have the greatest impact on response capacity [8, 10] . Additionally, because catastrophic events are infrequent, the majority of the measurement literature in this field has focused on preparedness rather than on response --on identifying and measuring the inputs to preparedness rather than the variations in response performance. What is known about public health emergency response is largely derived from simulated emergencies (e.g. exercises or drills), with a primary focus on bioterrorism or pandemic influenza [3] . By relying on an evidence base that draws from a narrow set of threats, we run the risk of overemphasizing the capabilities and resources required for those incidents while neglecting those that may be essential in other scenarios [11] .

Of the 35 participating hospitals in 2010, some are corporatized public entities (e.g. National Heart Institute).

What are the hospital infection control issues associated with a SARS outbreak, and what are the most effective approaches to address these issues? What type State and local health departments continue to face unprecedented challenges in preparing for, recognizing, and responding to threats to the public's health. The attacks of 11 September 2001 and the ensuing anthrax mailings of 2001 highlighted the public health readiness and response hurdles posed by intentionally caused injury and illness. At the same time, recent natural disasters have highlighted the need for comparable public health readiness and response capabilities. Public health readiness and response activities can be conceptualized similarly for intentional attacks, natural disasters, and human-caused accidents. Consistent with this view, the federal government has adopted the all-hazards response model as its fundamental paradigm. Adoption of this paradigm provides powerful improvements in efficiency and efficacy, because it reduces the need to create a complex family of situation-specific preparedness and response activities. However, in practice, public health preparedness requires additional models and tools to provide a framework to better understand and prioritize emergency readiness and response needs, as well as to facilitate solutions; this is particularly true at the local health department level. Here, we propose to extend the use of the Haddon matrix-a conceptual model used for more than two decades in injury prevention and response strategies-for this purpose. of advance planning strategy could a local public health department use to identify the contributing factors to this public health emergency?

Many related issues were discussed, including low literacy level, poverty, and trust of and/or deference to health authorities. Some cultural variations were expressed; for example, that certain societies more readily accept autocratic directives for disease control. Participants at all meetings affirmed that their cultures do not tolerate corruption and indicated that a lack of transparency raises suspicions of corrupt dealings. Government authorities and leaders are expected to be open and consult the community in making important decisions, including public health emergency decisions, affecting their people. Factors that complicate mass communication that were discussed at all meetings include low levels of literacy, the inaccessibility of media such as television, newspapers, and the internet because of poverty; and the unavailability of the internet and cell phone towers in some rural areas. Although the detail and depth of discussions regionally varied and some cultural variation was evident, transparency in decision-making was in general decisively affirmed. At the African meeting, in contrast to the general perception that ""big men"" and individuals with centralized power make all of the decisions, participants agreed that traditional cultures expect leaders to seek input from those they lead, through elder councils and similar institutions. Participants noted that public health leaders include traditional healers who serve as both recipients of and conduits for information. Because many Africans will seek care from traditional healers during a pandemic, these health providers must also be informed of how to protect themselves from infection, and how to guard against spreading the infection. In addition, a wide variety of local and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs), often funded by high-income countries, are active in resource poor countries in Africa seeking to meet the populations' most basic needs. Thus, it is important that both traditional healers and NGOs be engaged in the decisionmaking process. The participants at the Asian meeting varied widely in their views and practices relating to informing and engaging the public. For example, when SARS broke out in one Asian country, the government issued mandatory public health measures and expected public compliance. Due to the culture of deference to authority, nearly all communities in this country instantly adopted the measures (eg, quarantine, isolation, and social distancing). However, not all participants reported such deference to authority. This was reflected in a story from another Asian country about a boycott of a government polio immunization campaign by a minority community due to suspicions about the government's motives. Others reported that when the central government was perceived as misgoverned or weak, responsibilities for informing the public about health threats and providing leadership during emergencies fell to local leaders. Participants at the Latin American meeting stressed that community participation and cooperation will be crucial during a pandemic influenza response, particularly for migrants or minorities who are already stigmatized. Latin American participants also pointed to the importance of the media and health authorities in communicating health information and avoiding panic, as well as to convey factual information about availability and access to therapeutics. Some participants were concerned about the wide disparity in resources within and between countries, which make transparency even more important. Participants at the Eastern Mediterranean meeting emphasized the need for inclusion, accountability, and transparency in public health policies, but also noted the reluctance among countries to collaborate because of political differences and disparity in wealth and resources. Participants discussed the need to establish a clear understanding of who will make what decisions during an emergency, how guidelines will be established, and the importance of considering multiple perspectives, including perspectives from individuals most at risk.",41.40914307339044,18.322851741374215

Meanwhile, although new technology platforms (e.g., smartphones and internet) had generated interests and showed promises in efficiency and speed in mass communication in emergencies and crises, community receptivity of communication channels might differ with the nature of the emergency events [24] . For major infectious disease-based event such as the H7N9 outbreak in 2014 in Hong Kong, Tam, Huang and Chan [19] showed traditional risk communication channels (television and telephone) might still be the preferred channels of the general public.",44.390037937528774,18.553554138787995

The public health system is the lead in responding to outbreaks and in minimizing the impact of diverse emergencies on health [2, 3] . Public health sector activities in infectious disease emergencies include leading other emergency management organizations during outbreaks, conducting surveillance and investigation, implementing control measures, developing guidance for health-care practitioners, and communicating risks [3] . In addition, public health is the lead sector in preparing for the population health effects of non-infectious events incited by natural or anthropogenic hazards. Emergency preparedness levels have been a concern globally in past emergencies; for example, Canada's response to the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak raised a number of issues: lack of surge capacity in the clinical and public health systems, difficulties with timely access to laboratory testing and results, and weak links between public health and the health care system were clear gaps in preparedness [3] .

As the 'front door' of the health system, primary care professionals should be involved in planning and action for health emergency risk management. WONCA (the global professional body for family medicine) has actively championed the ways in which primary care can be supported to deliver care during population emergencies. National primary care bodies can coordinate with public health leads to cascade information to practitioners, communicate with the public, and collate health intelligence from the frontline primary care. 8 The Ebola crisis taught us a valuable lesson about what happens when an outbreak takes health workers away from core functions to focus on crisis response; the number of people who died from reduced access to usual care probably exceeded the number killed by the virus. 9 Strong health systems built on comprehensive primary care are able to integrate both functions, disseminating the emergency response resources and information required to community-level staff who have the breadth of training required to manage new suspected cases alongside routine family medicine.

To address the important task of ensuring readiness and creating resilient systems, our previous work developed a framework which identifies the essential elements of PHEP relevant to Canada, and considers the complexity of the public health system and emergency context [26] . The framework for resilience includes eleven essential elements and constitutes an evidence-based approach to defining PHEP for local/regional public health agencies and supporting practice for community health protection from disaster risks. In developing the framework, we noted that promoting resilience for public health systems requires consideration of complex aspects of preparedness such as social infrastructure [26, 27] ; for example, assessment of workforce capacity is influenced by individual workers' willingness to respond [28] .

Research clearly indicates that there are a multitude of assessments in China. First, assessments are divided according to purpose, i.e., formative and summative assessments. For example, the evaluation of Yunnan Province's emergency health response capability and core competence assessment index system at district-level control institutions was performed to guide and advance the progress of assessment targets as well as to provide a formative evaluation of management decisions. On the other hand, in Fujian Province, the study is concerned with the state of performance appraisals regarding public health emergencies and other issues, including formulating (such as plan completion rate, emergency material reserve rate, simulation exercises) overall judgments on the purposes of evaluation institutions, including accountability and summative assessment. Second, health emergency management assessment is divided into several stages, including the preparation stage (i.e., pre-emergency evaluation), the disposal stage, the in-process evaluation, and the recovery stage (i.e., post-emergency evaluation). Thus, a preliminary discussion on the early warning index system for influenza outbreaks, the construction of an evaluation index system for hospital nurses' public health emergency response capacity, a weighted analysis of emergency public health emergency response evaluation factors, and the evaluation of emergency drill activities in county-level disease control institutions in Nanchang City are all examples of pre-assessment. In contrast, social vulnerability assessments and analyses of significant factors associated with major infectious diseases are concerned with the assessment of the nature, the type, the extent, and the determining factors of public health emergencies, while epidemiological characteristics studies and normative disposal third-party assessments are all considered post-event assessments that focus on recovery, summarizing, and long-term impact. Third, emergency management work assessment can be divided according to health status, i.e., normal and abnormal assessment. For example, the analysis and the evaluation of the present state of affairs of health emergency work in Qinghai Province was a normal assessment of the state of daily management construction, whereas the comprehensive evaluation of public health emergency implementation in the Fujian Province in 2014 was an assessment of the process and the impact of the emergency response. Fourth, assessment is divided according to the evaluation implementation body, i.e., internal and external evaluation. For example, the evaluation of the public health emergency response capacity of F hospital in Qiqihar City was an internal investigation conducted by an investigation team composed of health emergency management agencies and workers. On the other hand, investigating the epidemiological characteristics of public health emergencies and standard treatment third-party assessments are surveys that involve external evaluation from experts outside the health emergency management and work organization.",64.73601948340115,26.653480139293094

Theory and implementation of health emergency systems have evolved worldwide. China has gradually implemented the construction of a comprehensive emergency management system including the use of theoretical models, assessment systems, and response studies. China's health emergency management system is an important component of the comprehensive emergency management system, and health emergency management assessment is an important part of the health emergency management system. China's health emergency management assessment system has experienced many rigorous tests in response to a series of public health emergencies and has accumulated experience in detecting health emergencies and managing the weaknesses of the evaluation system. There are many types of health emergency management assessments and many methods for health emergency management assessment in China, and the dimensions and the indicators of health emergency management assessment are complex.

The Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change has generated similar challenges to implementation in federal states, and it is notable that two key federations, the US and Australia, have not ratifi ed the treaty [20] . The problems federations have with compliance with international treaties can occur at several levels. First, as already mentioned, the necessary powers to ensure compliance with a treaty may not fall within the jurisdiction of the federal level of government. While in many federations, the federal power to sign treaties may permit them to override the jurisdiction of regional governments, this is not necessarily always the case. And in scenarios in which the federal government does have the necessary constitutional authority, they may choose not to exercise it because of political concerns about creating confl ict with regional governments. Even in scenarios in which the federal government has the necessary legislative power and does choose to exercise it, regional governments may not be able to cope with the fi nancial and/or practical burdens of compliance [21] . This latter issue, of unfunded mandates, is not unique to federal states and constitutes a challenge that all WHO member nations will need to address when determining how to implement the surveillance requirements of the new IHR.",45.45929113962442,17.790532540066703

Identifying and isolating less than half the new infected cases and tracing only half of all contacts will result in a blow-out of the epidemic. Space and human resource requirements for case finding, isolation, contact tracing, vaccination and quarantine are therefore essential for preparedness planning. Physical space requirements extend beyond isolation of smallpox cases, to quarantine of contacts. In the worst-case scenario, almost one million contacts need to be traced and there will be a lack of physical space for quarantine of high-risk contacts. Plans for home quarantine and surveillance of contacts should also be undertaken and will require adequately trained personnel. The speed and effectiveness of contact tracing is also critical to the success of ring vaccination and will require an adequately trained critical mass of public health workers and epidemiologists, separate from the clinical workforce. In Australia, as a federation, this will rely on State and Territory capacity, and cross-border mobilisation of jurisdictional capacity in the event of a smallpox epidemic, and estimation of the current and required capacity for such an event. The fact that public health personnel are not registered as health practitioners or documented in any other centralised way, makes it more challenging to rapidly mobilise suitably qualified and experienced personnel for a large-scale epidemic response. This is a policy consideration that could be addressed as part of pandemic and health emergency planning, which may strengthen response.

This needs to include not only academic and government research institutions, but also those in the private sector. Within this context, the underlying objective should be, ultimately, to improve and not threaten public health, but exactly how to do this is remains an outstanding and elusive question.

Thanks to the worldwide spread of diseases coupled with the easy access to network information, communicable diseases such as Ebola, did not only affect the locations of the outbreak but also could cause panic or even major public health events in non-endemic areas. In the public health field, increased Internet searching implied the tremendous need of Ebola-related preventive knowledge to the public. That is to say, high attention areas could be more susceptible to rumors or false online information if public health authorities did not address the emerging public concerns in a timely manner. To handle the demand warranted by this emerging situation, traditional epidemiological methods and public health education modes were obviously inadequate. Online surveillance, with the aid of opinion indices, may have sensitively detected the emergence of serious infectious diseases at their initial stage via the Big Data platform in previous studies, which could buy time for controlling outbreaks of these diseases and reducing the risk of transmission to humans [28, 38, 39] . That is to say, this modality, different from classic epidemiology questionnaires and telephone interviews developed to know the public reaction after the disease outbreak, enables surveillance beforehand and saves health resources. More importantly, online surveillance can reflect public reactions to emergency public health events and disease outbreaks in a timely manner so that public health interventions can be implemented during epidemic crises to avoid deterioration. Additionally, compared to the classical health education mode aimed at high-risk populations in high morbidity regions, our results implied a need for a shift in health education methods to a public-attention-based mode, especially in non-epidemic areas, to identify the regions of high attention. This new mode should be based on the findings of opinion monitoring through public reaction indices like BDI and SMI. Different interventions, in the future, should be adopted for areas with different indices, more attention being targeted at high-index areas in terms of public propaganda and education.",36.03347934684623,16.29335932622864

We estimated Ebola cases in three scenarios: a delayed response, a Liberia-like response, and a fast response scenario. Based on our estimates of the number of Ebola cases that could have occurred had Ebola spread to other countries beyond the West African foci, we emphasize the need for improved levels of preparedness and response to public health threats, which is the goal of the Global Health Security Agenda. Our estimates suggest that Ebola could have potentially spread widely beyond the West Africa foci, had local and international health workers and organizations not committed to a major response effort. Our results underscore the importance of rapid detection and initiation of an effective, organized response, and the challenges faced by countries with limited public health systems. Actionable lessons for strengthening local public health systems in countries at high risk of disease transmission include increasing health personnel, bolstering primary and critical healthcare facilities, developing public health infrastructure (e.g. laboratory capacity), and improving disease surveillance. With stronger local public health systems infectious disease outbreaks would still occur, but their rapid escalation would be considerably less likely, minimizing the impact of public health threats such as Ebola. Conclusions: The Ebola outbreak could have potentially spread to other countries, where limited public health surveillance and response capabilities may have resulted in additional foci.

With the stakes never higher, the urgency for WHO reform has been accelerated and is influenced by a collection of recommendations from four high-level (1): 117-134. [29] panels/commissions that examined WHO's performance during the EVD outbreak [13, 36, 37] . These include recommendations from the Interim Panel, the Harvard-LSHTM panel, the CGHRF, and the Kikwete Panel, which were reviewed and compared for: (1) proposals specifically addressing internal governance reforms or new mechanisms within WHO's structure (not including reform proposals specific to the functioning of IHR, which deserve separate in-depth discussion); and (2) proposals focused on involvement and/or coordination from the United Nations on global health and health emergency activities (see summary of characteristics of Panels in Table 2 ). The first group to issue its recommendations was the WHO Interim panel comprised of independent experts appointed by WHO, who at the May 2015 68th World Health Assembly (WHA) delivered a report stating that the agency lacked the ""capacity or organizational culture"" to respond to emergency public health events [38] . The Interim Panel also concluded that WHO managed the crisis by prioritizing ""good diplomacy"" over necessary action, but offered no alternative to WHO, arguing instead that the agency should continue in its central role as the world's lead health emergency response agency [38] . The panel recommended a set of reforms largely aimed at re-establishing WHO's central role in health emergencies by advocating for: (a) strengthening of the IHR; (b) establishing a contingency fund for outbreak response; (c) formation of an independent Centre for Emergency Preparedness and Response (housed within WHO but overseen independently); (d) support for a WHO plan to develop a global health emergency workforce; and (e) WHO playing a more central role in R&D efforts for future health emergencies [38] . It also recommended the UN Secretary-General consider the appointment of a Special Representative or Special Envoy aimed at garnering greater political and financial support during a global health crisis, but did not recommend establishment of a permanent UN structure/mission. Importantly, many of these core proposals would set the framework for similar proposals expanded upon and carried forward by the other panels. In November 2015, the Harvard-LSHTM panel published a set of 10 recommendations in the Lancet, which included several governance reform measures far more expansive than the first set of recommendations made by the Interim Panel. Reforms cover broader areas of global health governance and also include specific reform measures for WHO, all of which are grouped into four thematic areas of preventing, responding, conducting research, and governing the broader global system for disease outbreaks [39] . Reforms specific to WHO included: (a) creating a WHO dedicated independent centre for outbreak response; (b) formation of a politically insulated WHO Standing Emergency Committee for PHEIC declaration; (c) investing and strengthening global capacity to rapidly respond to outbreaks; (d) carrying out time-bound reforms to refocus and streamline WHO; (e) having WHO convene global stakeholders to develop a framework of norms and rules and a global financing facility for R&D relevant to disease outbreaks; and (f ) instituting internal good governance reforms in exchange for more sustainable funding [39] . Broadly speaking the Harvard-LSHTM panel calls for more active engagement by WHO with the greater global community in managing infectious disease outbreaks, while also recommending that the agency scale back operational activities and instead focus on certain core functions [39] . Importantly, the panel also took the step of recommending the establishment of two structures by [39] . A few months later in January 2016, the CGHRF issued its own comprehensive report with an even more expansive list of 26 recommendations aimed at serving as a broader framework to address the ""neglected"" threat of infectious-disease crises. Recommendations were categorized under four domains of investment, building public health capabilities, strengthening surveillance, and accelerating R&D for pandemics [40] . Ten of these recommendations are specific to WHO, with some mirroring previous recommendations by the Interim and Harvard-LSHTM panels (e.g. formation of an independent Center funded by increased member state contributions, establishment of a contingency fund, and strengthening of the IHR.) [41] . The CGHRF generally advocated for strengthening WHO's capacity to lead in pandemic preparedness and response by further reinforcing previous recommendation to create a WHO Center for Health Emergency Preparedness and Response, though independently overseen by a Technical Governing Board [41] . It also called for the involvement of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) to help finance and strengthen implementation of IHR core capacities. Additionally, the CGHRF called for WHO to actively engage in other proposed governance structures that would oversee acceleration of R&D for pandemic preparedness and response (including the establishment of an independent Pandemic Product Development Committee) [41] . Finally, though the CGHRF report advocates for enhanced cooperation between WHO and regional, sub-regional, national governments, and non-state actors, it does not directly call for a UN leadership role, other than in the context of developing strategies for sustaining health systems capacity in fragile/failed states and during times of war.",42.97992829176526,17.965525103533857

The local public debate on xenotransplantation began in the mid-1990s. According to Griessler, 'the debate was neither extensive nor continuous and only of concern to a small group of informed actors from research, parliament, public administration and stakeholder organizations' (Griessler 2012: 64) . A diverse range of views on xenotransplantation was canvassed in the federal parliamentary debates. Though a proposed bill banning the procedure was introduced into the Swiss parliament, it was defeated towards the end of 1999. In the following year, at the 'PubliForum'-a consensus conference on transplantation medicine-a majority of lay participants affirmed their support for xenotransplantation research (Griessler 2012: 66) . Notwithstanding public objections to xenotransplantation among sections of the community, the introduction of permissive laws sought to protect local research and economic interests in the Swiss pharmaceutical industry.

Instead, the lasting legacy of the EVD outbreak may be its foreshadowing of a governance ""shift"" in formal sharing of the complex responsibilities of global public health and health security to other international structures, most notably various organs of the United Nations [36] . In September 2014, the UN authorized the first-ever UN emergency health mission, the UN Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER), and thus became the central actor charged with mobilizing and coordinating resources across UN agencies, multiple states, and other partners working to stop EVD. UNMEER was established as a temporary measure to provide immediate financial, human resource, and logistic support for affected countries with the primary objectives of stopping the outbreak, treating the infected, ensuring access to essential services, creating stability, and preventing further escalation [56] . However, UNMEER's participation has not been without criticism. In fact, reports by panels/ commissions have noted that while UNMEER brought high-level political and financial support, coordination of the crisis became more difficult during its tenure in affected countries [38, 39] . Nevertheless, UNMEER's creation brings a new dimension to global health governance as it is the first apparatus constructed to provide a singular UN system-wide approach in order to establish unity in combating a public health emergency.

Strengthening the functions of NFPs is one of the strategic actions to enhance public health emergency preparedness through the implementation of the Asia Pacific Strategy for Emerging Diseases and Public Health Emergencies (APSED III). 2 IHR event communication refers to official communication between NFPs and WHO IHR contact points (CPs) at regional and global levels, as well as communication between NFPs in different countries, and between the NFP and relevant departments or agencies within the country to notify public health events; share and verify information; determine whether an event constitutes a PHEIC; and coordinate emergency responses. 1 Email has been the main mechanism of communication between WHO CPs and NFPs. In addition to email communication, WHO has developed a password-protected website, the Event Information Site (EIS), to facilitate information sharing with all NFPs. Events posted on EIS, which are often potential PHEICs or public hazards with international impact, are accessible to all NFPs. 3 IHR Exercise Crystal, a simulation exercise organized by the WHO Western Pacific Regional Office (WPRO) to test and strengthen event communication between the IHR CP of WPRO (WPRO IHR CP) and NFPs in the Region, has been conducted in the Western Pacific Region annually since 2008, 4 except that in 2009 NFPs communicated frequently with the WPRO IHR CP during After removing duplicates, a total of 34 438 emails were recovered from the archives of WPRO IHR mailbox from 11 September 2006 to 12 January 2017, of which 2944 (8.5%) were IHR exercise messages. Emails received from 1 May to 25 August 2011 could not be recovered due to archiving issues. Among the 34 438 retrieved emails, 13 252 (38%) were sent from the WPRO IHR CP; and 18 922 (55%) were sent to the WPRO IHR CP, including 5523 emails that copied the WPRO IHR CP. The other 2264 emails (7%) included fax notices, surveillance reports that did not list the recipients and emails sent to a very large group of recipients for which we could not determine if WPRO was on the direct or copying lines as the lines were truncated when data were imported into an Access database.

The front line of emergency response preparedness is people. Role perceptions of individual staff members of a given organization strongly affect response probability and performance. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine local public health employees' perceptions of emergency response responsibilities, identify factors that influence their perception, and indicate the challenges and bottlenecks of PHE response in the Health Inspection Institution (HII) after its separation from China's multiple Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Methods: We used a stratified randomized sample survey to examine HII workers' knowledge of their own duties concerning PHE response in 17 facilities in Heilongjiang, a province in northeastern China. Data were collected from May to July 2010 using a 9-item combined question inquiring about the workers' statutory duties. Results: Of 348 administered surveys, 309 were returned for an overall response rate of 88.8 %. Overall, the correct recognition rate of PHE responsibilities was low. Some HII workers were confused about their responsibilities required by law, regulations, and emergency response plans. A quarter of all the respondents had the lowest knowledge for PHE responsibilities. Factors influencing their perceptions of responsibilities were department, work experience in a CDC, and PHE response experience. Conclusions: To improve preparedness for a PHE, efforts are needed to train, support, and monitor the workers' knowledge and competencies in PHEs as part of an organizational change; the worker's knowledge of their responsibilities should be measured and used as an indicator of preparedness for a PHE, and training should be undertaken where there are deficiencies.

However, the rate of spread of the virus and the uncertainties surrounding the entire situation has led the World Health Organization (WHO) on 30 January 2019 to declare the Coronavirus outbreak a 'Global Public Health Emergency'. WHO determined, however, not to declare the outbreak a 'Public Health Emergency of International Concern' (PHEIC) which is a higher level of declaration. A PHEIC is defined as ""an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response"" whose scope may include: serious, sudden, unusual or unexpected; carries implications for public health beyond the affected State's national border; and may require immediate international action [3] .",40.57572667661768,17.33513921402108

In doing so, we illustrate how an instrumental as opposed to a normative lens differentiates the practice of diplomacy. Health issues are still emerging and under-analyzed in the nexus between governance and diplomacy. Figure 4 shows that there have been multiple negotiations on critical global health issues in the last 10 years, which were triggered by the catalytic effect of a series of health emergencies. Therefore, global health governance is still at a formative stage and health diplomacy is very much in the transitional stage of practice in dealing, negotiating, and managing emerging health issues at different levels of governance (Lee and Smith, 2011; Novotny and Kevany, 2013) . This process is constantly demonstrating that health diplomacy is more than about public health itself. Zucker (2012) wrote, Public health negotiations are often about everything but public health. As such one much bring in the expertise from other domains including, international treaty law, finance ministries, trade delegations, foreign affairs, international security, and any other areas that are linked to the issues at hand. (pp. 273-274) The pull effect in the practice of health diplomacy increasingly appears to be strong among the NGOs, networking with state and global and local actors. As stated by Low-Beer (2012), 'a major trend since 2000 has been a shift to a wider ""partnership approach"" to delivering health aid, bringing together governments, private sector, civil society, private foundations and multilaterals, sometimes shouting and sometimes kicking' (p. 23). Nevertheless, a multitude of actors also bring divergence in preferences and uncertainty in negotiation processes. Health diplomacy thus involves a multitude of inter-dependent actors, involved in poly-lateral diplomacy, and issues that create opportunities for partnership as well as conflict of interest.",39.069509265302834,15.72820277126404

In addition to defining the standards and grades of public health emergencies, these laws support the construction of command systems and clarify the responsibilities and the leadership role of the chief executive of central and local governments previously held by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Accordingly, the executive capacity of the command systems has been much improved. Importantly, China also established an emergency information dissemination system to enable timely (within 2 hours), accurate, and comprehensive release of information.

Substantial shortfalls and delay in distribution of vaccine supplies to low-income and middle-income countries were also emphasised by subsequent reviews of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic response. 4, 16, 45 The Indonesian Government's call for more equity and developments since the H1N1 2009 pandemic have led to several positive initiatives. 46 Within WHO's PIP Framework, discussions have evolved to improve virus sharing in the context of recognising the need for shared benefi ts. Indonesia is now one of several low-to-middle income countries that are developing or have already developed in-country vaccine manufacturing capacityothers in the WHO-supported programme of technology transfer include Brazil, China, Egypt, India, Kazakhstan, Mexico, South Korea, Romania, Serbia, South Africa, Thailand, and Vietnam. Initiatives such as the creation of a technology transfer programme at the Netherlands Vaccine Institute (RIVM) to provide training in the embryonated egg production of inactivated infl uenza vaccine are helping to achieve this aim. 47, 48 There are still barriers to eff ective international cooperation and benefi t sharing despite the number of reports emphasising the importance of this key facet of pandemic preparedness. Substantial agreement exists across the public health community about how global collaboration should work, there is greater political acceptance of the value of such collaboration, but there are still barriers arising from commercial and academic drivers. China, with its direct experience of SARS and the economic and political consequences of not being ready to respond, has shown a good example by facing the economic challenges of H7N9. 31 The experience of Saudi Arabia with MERS-CoV highlights other barriers, such as ineff ective international collaboration and partnerships. 44 Despite a declared willingness to collaborate and share, and the publication of substantial epidemiological and microbiological information about early coronavirus cases and outbreaks, there appeared to be delays at times Series in sharing information between public health authorities before it was accepted for peer-reviewed publication, and in sharing clinical and viral samples for public health use without prejudice to subsequent commercial development of products derived from that material. Confl icts of interest that are barriers to trust will probably continue as long as academic and research organisations are judged primarily by their publication record or there is an associated commercial imperative. An urgent need exists for suffi cient global public health capacity that is free from these constraints to allow free and rapid sharing of information and samples. Politicians are beginning to understand the importance of tackling these issues. The Global Health Security Action Group (GHSAG) has initiated work to develop sample sharing protocols and arrangements that build on the WHO PIP Framework but that move on from infl uenza viruses to include any organism that might lead to a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC under the IHRs). The GHSAG initiative is initially intended to focus on sample sharing between the countries in the GHSAG but it will be open to other countries to use the GHSAG-agreed protocols for sharing, and these protocols should encourage and help with sharing without compromising the commercial rights of the sending countries and without prejudicing future benefi t sharing. 49 Specifi c capacity building activity could help to increase trust and engender a true spirit of global cooperation. The positive global experience gained from the development of the Supranational Reference Laboratory (SRL) Network for the surveillance of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis under the Stop TB partnership could serve as a template for the development of a more integrated global laboratory surveillance, diagnostic, and vaccine development and manufacture network working across a series of high priority EID pathogens. 50 The eventual aim of such an initiative would be to ensure that suffi cient numbers of biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) and BSL-3 (adapted for animals) reference laboratories exist in every WHO region to serve the needs of its member countries and peoples. 51 Benefi ts of a global network would include a greater capacity of regions to respond to local and international EID threats more quickly and effi ciently, and, importantly, to retain human resources and expertise within those regions. The latter could have an additional benefi t in aiding eff orts to curtail the brain drain of scientists and technical experts from low-to-middle income countries to more developed regions of the world.",37.72775639699499,16.006275683267017

In the now famous Chaoulli case, the court concluded that the Quebec government's prohibition on private insurance for Medicare services violated the province's Charter of Rights in a situation in which a patient waits an unreasonable amount of time for elective surgery.

Surprisingly, an example from Washington D.C. suggests that at least for some types of hazards and in at least one region, welldefined roles were not clear (Schulman, 2015) . The DHHS in collaboration with the National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO) sought to determine how local health departments (LHDs) could best contribute to a large-scale chemical event response. A focus group of 33 local, state, federal, and nonprofit agency representatives in the National Capital Region met to discuss possible roles. The result of the focus group was that the participants had very different perspectives on the role of LHDs in a chemical response. Though LHDs have responsibility for protecting human health in all hazards, the role of LHDs was perceived to be limited to disease prevention and control and not really in responding to a hazardous material incident. As noted by Schulman (2015) , ""the perception of chemical incidents as hazardous material (hazmat) events, and not public health events, may result in LHDs being left out of the loop, even after the incident transitions to a mass casualty or mass fatality event."" She also identified the following roles for LHDs. l ""Public health surveillance activities are crucial to determining that an event has happened, as well as the nature of the event. Routine passive surveillance results can be monitored for unusual symptoms associated with chemical exposures. l LHDs' preexisting community relationships position them to be a trusted source of risk communications. While other responders handle the hazardous materials, LHDs have the ability to calm and inform the populace. l LHDs provide subject matter expertise to healthcare partners on matters such as the toxicity of chemical agents and sampling and screening approaches. If the agent is unknown, LHDs could use epidemiologic investigation methods to help identify it. l Other potential roles based on LHD expertise include: (a) coordinating the provision of mental and behavioral health services to affected communities; and (b) providing guidance to ensure the safety and health of on-theground responders.",37.382752160307234,17.72788082860585

MMT is expanding, with backing from multiple government ministries, however, NSEP have received less political support and funding. Methods: Semi-structured, serial interviews were conducted with key informants, knowledgeable about China's harm reduction policies. Concurrent content analysis allowed for revision of the interview guide throughout the data collection process. This was combined with a systematic analysis of official government policy documents on NSEP and MMT, including white papers, legal documents, and policy statements. Findings: Early consensus between public security and public health sectors regarding methadone's dual use in HIV prevention as well as method of drug control created broad institutional support for MMT programmes amongst policy makers. In contrast, NSEP were seen as satisfying only the HIV prevention goals of the public health sector, and were perceived as condoning illicit drug use. Furthermore, NSEP's roots in China, as an experimental collaboration with international groups, created suspicion regarding its role in China's drug control policy. NSEP and MMT's distinct paths to policy development are reflected in the complex and occasionally contradictory nature of China's harm reduction strategy. Conclusions: These discrepancies highlight the need for a more politically sustainable and comprehensive integration of harm reduction projects.

That city has no a centralized command and control system for all types of emergency sub-systems results in difficulties for different emergency command centers and departments to mutually support and coordinate timely and effectively. Their respective data resources cannot be shared so that some cities repeated construction of data resources and wasted their limited resources. As Emergency Response Systems are complicate, it is not easy for the public to remember and understand operating modes of different systems.

Our analysis broadens the existing approach to measuring the response to risk by comparing the response to public and private risk signals.

The social learning mechanism may partially explain why people react more strongly to risks that are novel rather than mundane.

The statute itself contains no suggestion that its obligations would vary in the face of a community-wide emergency; nevertheless, when such events began to seem more likely, concerns and questions arose. 62 Although it reiterated to some extent the continued application of EMTALA's obligations, the 2001 CMS letter suggested that there was an exception to the stabilization requirement if a community response plan is in place. 63 Moreover, the letter indicated that a hospital's initial screening obligation might be limited if a community-response plan designated certain facilities to handle particular categories of patients in a bioterrorism situation, and if the hospital in question is not such a designated facility. 64 The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 65 articulated a more formal policy regarding EMTALA obligations in an emergency situation. The legislation authorized the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to waive sanctions for EMTALA violations when the violations when the violation comes from an inappropriate transfer of an unstable patient in public health emergency circumstances (as defined by a presidential declaration). This potential limitation on EMTALA obligations during a public health emergency is more circumscribed than what the 2001 CMS letter suggested, as it does not indicate a reduction in the screening obligation (nor does it eliminate private individuals' right of action).",48.41114239548392,18.381772218437604

Under the IHR (2005), a number of reporting requirements oblige States Parties to promptly inform WHO of cases or events involving a wide range of diseases and public health risks including 'all cases of human influenza caused by a new virus subtype'. The official notification to WHO of cases or events likely to pose a serious international public health risk is done by a nationally appointed focal point (NFP) within 24 h of the country's assessment. WHO maintains a restricted-access website (event information system) to inform States about unusual events reported through the IHR and to convey WHO's assessment of their severity. The IHR also mandate WHO to perform public health surveillance, support States in their development of relevant capacities, and co-ordinate response activities to events that constitute an international public health risk. In extraordinary circumstances, the Director-General of WHO can determine that a 'public health emergency of international concern' is occurring. In this case, after taking advice from a committee of external experts (i.e. the Emergency Committee), the Director-General can issue 'temporary recommendations' to governments on the appropriate actions to prevent or reduce the international spread of the disease and minimize necessary interference with international traffic and trade. 10 The global influenza surveillance network For more than 60 years, the GISN has monitored influenza activity and characterized circulating influenza virus strains.

However, in the decade since the adoption of the IHR it has been clear that tensions continue to exist between global cooperation and national sovereignty. Although 86 WHO arguably has a global leadership role in coordinating responses to global public health emergencies, its limited powers and limited funding hamper effective responses, and reform of WHO has been part of the recommendations of recent expert review committees. 95 In terms of WHO's powers, as James Hodge has noted, 'In reality, WHO lacks comprehensive, enforceable legal powers to require member states to do much of anything beyond what their leadership agrees to undertake voluntarily'. 96 Although WHO has established a Contingency Fund for Emergencies, 97 the willingness of Member States to provide support for the Fund in the longer term remains to be seen. What is clear is that without funding to support its emergency response capacities, and in the absence of enforcement mechanisms, WHO will continue to be hampered in its emergency response, despite expectations for WHO to take a more operational approach in its responses to global public health emergencies. 98 Article 43 of the IHR requires that any additional health measures introduced by countries in response to either a specific public health risk or a public health emergency of international concern should be no more restrictive or invasive 'than reasonably available alternatives that would achieve the appropriate level of health protection' 99 and be based on scientific principles; available scientific evidence about risk; and any guidance or advice from WHO. 100 Despite these requirements, there were some cases of the use of travel restrictions during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic 101 and more recently during the outbreak of Ebola in West Africa in 2014 with the Interim Ebola Panel Report noting that: during the Ebola outbreak, more than 40 countries implemented additional measures that significantly interfered with international traffic, outside the scope of the temporary recommendations issued by the Director-General on the advice of the Emergency Committee. As a result, the countries affected faced not only severe political, economic and social consequences but also barriers to receiving necessary personnel and supplies. These consequences constituted a significant disincentive to transparency. 102 The lack of enforcement mechanisms to address actions taken that are not in accordance with the IHR is one of the IHR's noted weaknesses 103 ",43.97388969196586,17.291032600569704

It is important to immediately establish a response framework with a unifi ed command structure that establishes a chain of command, control, and coordinate the resources, in terms of staff, stuff, and structure. The Incident Command System (ICS) provides a structure to enable agencies with different legal, jurisdictional, and functional responsibilities to coordinate, plan, and interact effectively on scene [ 11 ] . The medical response is provided at the scene by the emergency medical services (EMS), with triage, treatment, and transport to the hospitals. EMS plays a crucial role in the immediate phase of the response to disaster. The response must be quick and effective on the scene as well as in the determination of hospital destinations for every patient, to guarantee an appropriate standard of care and to avoid bottlenecks and congestion at hospitals. Rarely, EMS is able to triage, treat, and transport every single patient from the scene. Often some casualties reach the closest hospital on their own, giving rise to disruption in the chain of triage and to the hospital.

In retrospect, we learned that our response mechanisms to public health emergencies, despite the best of intentions, were imperfect and our ability to cope with such crises required improvement.

During the SARS outbreak, health care providers accounted for 20% of all infected persons. Similarly, the Ebola virus disease crisis that devastated West Africa also resulted in high mortality rates among health care providers. It is pertinent to ask why so many health care providers using PPE and with no history of direct contact became infected. 44, 45 These examples demonstrate the importance of personal protective skills. In our study, field epidemiologic investigation skills were the second highest contributory factor identified that influenced the self-rated overall skill proficiency of public health emergency responders. Epidemiologic investigations are usually conducted in outbreak situations and serve as the key step for stipulating appropriate responses to public health emergencies that influenced the outcome of communicable diseases. 39 Therefore, effective implementation of epidemiologic investigation is a prerequisite to ensure that emergency work is carried out smoothly. Competency in coping with emergency drills is also a key element in the self-rated overall skill proficiency of public health emergency responders (OR, 1.401). For any country, public health emergencies necessitate emergency drills to simulate real emergency experiences to develop and improve skills and to assess emergency response capacity. 46 The US Federal Emergency Management Agency describes 6 levels of emergency drills, increasing in complexity from informational seminars to simulations to implementing emergency response functions. 47 However, emergency drills started relatively late in China and the country has not yet established an effective emergency drill system. So, how to ensure the emergency drill capacity to cope with public health emergencies promptly and properly will be the primary focus of China in the future.

A written pandemic emergency plan and establishment of emergency management teams are critical to mounting a coordinated and effective response to what will be a catastrophic event. Members of these teams should include public health, medical, emergency response and public safety officials, organized at each local, state and federal level. The tragic events of September 11, 2001 and the subsequent anthrax attacks have substantially increased funding and support for bioterrorism planning in the United States. Thus, public health officials have an unprecedented opportunity to strengthen current systems' planning efforts by promoting dual use bioterrorism/pandemic influenza plans. Combining lessons learned from the 2001 terrorist incidents, recent preevent smallpox vaccine programs and the history of past influenza pandemics, more effective strategies can be developed. For example, enhanced influenza surveillance systems can provide data that will not only provide early identification of a novel influenza strain, but will provide more timely recognition of other outbreaks of infectious diseases, including public health threats that may initially present as an influenza-like illness (ILI). In recent years, we have witnessed emerging and reemerging infectious disease threats that have presented us with challenges similar to those posed by an influenza pandemic. Such events highlight the need for advance planning to ensure an optimal response to a health emergency that is certain to be unpredictable, complex, rapidly evolving and accompanied by considerable public alarm. While advance warning for a terrorist attack is unlikely, the warning already exists for a possible new influenza strain, as evidenced by the recent cases of H5N1 in Hong Kong and the rapid global spread of cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome.

It is a response to a dilemma: when health crises occur, many countries promise financial support but do not pay. The call for cash-on-demand intensified during the 2014-16 west African Ebola pandemic, and the World Bank issued the world's first pandemic bond in July, 2017, raising $425 million from private investors. The financial terms of the pandemic bond are complex, but, in short, large private investors (rather than nationstates) put money in up-front for 3 years. If a qualifying pandemic occurs during that time, some of the money is disbursed for pandemic response. Otherwise, the investors get their money back plus interest of 10% or more. 8 Everyone concerned with public health agrees that pre-committed pandemic funds are a good idea. However, growing uncertainty about how best to pay for health emergencies of international concern has brought previous health and humanitarian risk management strategies into question. In the past, governments and philanthropies mitigated all kinds of risks, from disease outbreaks to droughts. Since the 1970s, however, private sector involvement in civic problem-solving has increased. The pandemic bond is an iteration of the trend of turning to the private sector for global health and humanitarian funding solutions.

The language of human rights is increasingly part of the landscape for health law in Australia and a See, for example, Public Health Act 1991 (NSW) s 23. internationally. [43] [44] [45] Given the potential for public health laws to impact upon the freedom of individuals, and the need for public health laws to balance the interests of individuals and society, public health laws will ideally have a transparent ethical framework, articulating the principles upon which state intervention will be premised. 46 The World Health Organization has acknowledged the importance of legal and ethical considerations to pandemic preparedness, noting that public health measures such as quarantine, compulsory vaccination and off-licence use of medicines 'need a legal framework to ensure transparent assessment and justification of the measures that are being considered, and to ensure coherence with international legislation (International Health Regulations)'. 47 Consideration of ethical issues is also essential for, as the World Health Organization has noted, ethical issues 'are part of the normative framework that is needed to assess the cultural acceptability of measures such as quarantine or selective vaccination of predefined risk groups'. 48 The exercise of state powers in terms of quarantine, isolation and detention during a public health emergency is likely to be particularly controversial in Western liberal democracies such as Australia. The extent to which the state can and should exercise its powers in this area has become increasingly relevant in public health, as is clear from debates over detention of tuberculosis patients, 49, 50 and from the use of quarantine during the SARS crisis. 51 Although comparable countries to Australia in Europe, the USA and Canada all have human rights charters or equivalents, which could provide procedural protections and safeguards for citizens in relation to quarantine and detention, Australia has yet to develop a Bill of Rights at the federal level. While Australian state and territory governments have begun enacting human rights legislation, 52 there is no comprehensive inclusion of human rights safeguards in the federal Quarantine Act, which raises issues about the mechanisms for ensuring procedural safeguards in the event of a pandemic. 53 Public health measures directed at implementing social distancing, quarantine or travel restrictions will not only infringe on individual liberties that are often taken for granted in Western societies, but are also likely to have a profound economic impact. As outlined above, estimates indicate that pandemic influenza will have a significant impact on the global economy. At local level, businesses may be closed or experience a reduction in their cash flow as public health measures are introduced or people stay home voluntarily. In such an environment, the economic cost to individuals and businesses may be significant, which in turn demands consideration of development of support systems and compensation systems for those affected. 54 In the USA, a great deal of work has been done on strengthening the public health laws, both generally and specifically for public health emergencies. The Turning Point Public Health Statute Modernization National Collaborative developed the Turning Point Model State Public Health Act. 55 In 2001, the Centre for Law and the Public's Health at Georgetown and Johns Hopkins Universities prepared a Model State Emergency Health Powers Act, setting out the powers for a state of public health emergency. The provisions of the earlier Model State Emergency Health Powers Act were adapted and included in the Turning Point Model Act. 56 Article V of the Turning Point Model Act deals with the powers of public health authorities, including the powers of quarantine and isolation. The Model Act provides that the principles to be applied in relation to quarantine and isolation include that they should be by the least restrictive means necessary to prevent the spread of disease (s 5-108[b](1)).

Under the Act, the scope of quarantine is quite broad and covers a range of measures which aim to prevent or control 'the introduction, establishment or spread of diseases or pests that will or could cause significant damage to human beings, animals, plants, other aspects of the environment or economic activities'. 21 The Act defines a quarantinable disease as 'any disease, declared by the Governor-General, by proclamation to be a quarantinable disease'. 22 Masters of vessels are required to make a notification to a quarantine officer if prescribed symptoms or a prescribed disease is present on board, or if the master 'has reason to believe or suspect' that a quarantinable disease or pest is on board. 23 Individuals or vessels can be ordered into quarantine if they have a quarantinable or communicable disease, 24 and there are also powers to subject individuals to quarantine surveillance in certain circumstances. 25 The Governor-General can declare, by proclamation, that an epidemic exists or that there is the danger of an epidemic, and while the proclamation exists the Minister may give directions and take actions necessary to control, eradicate or remove the danger of the epidemic by way of quarantine or measures incidental to quarantine. 26, 27 The Quarantine Act 1908 is focused on preventing quarantinable diseases at ports of entry into Australia. While there is still benefit in this focus, it is inadequate for a world where international travel is now primarily by aircraft, and passengers can travel from one country to another before they even realize that they are sick. 33 As a Canadian report on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) noted, 'SARS has illustrated that we are constantly a short flight away from serious epidemics'. 28 While previous outbreaks of pandemic influenza have traditionally taken 6-8 months to spread globally, 29 aided by international air travel, pandemic influenza could spread globally within 3 months. 30 This potential for quarantinable diseases to emerge within domestic populations raises questions about the scope and applicability of quarantine laws in these circumstances. However, it has been argued that the broad scope of quarantine under the Act, the fact that quarantine powers are not restricted to ports of entry, and the ability for state laws to be over-ridden in emergencies suggests that the federal quarantine power could also have domestic application. 31 Domestically, state public health laws are also relevant to the notification and control of communicable diseases. In New South Wales, for example, SARS and avian influenza in humans are both notifiable diseases under the Public Health Act 1991. 32 State public health laws also contain a range of measures to enable health authorities to restrict the spread of disease, including powers to require medical testing and, in some cases, powers to restrict movement or to specify treatment of individuals who are regarded as posing a risk to public health. a The intersections between federal and state laws are relevant to Australia's responses to public health threats. As Howse has noted, 'in a public health emergency caused by the spread of an emerging infectious disease, Australia could need to rely on a patchwork of legislative measures to assist it to cope'. 34 In Australia and elsewhere, cross-jurisdictional and interagency cooperation are essential components in effective emergency responses. 35, 36 At an international level, the International Health Regulations (IHR) provide a framework for notification and response to infectious diseases. First introduced in 1951 as the International Sanitary Regulations, and renamed in 1969, the IHR required Member States to notify the World Health Organization of cases of plague, cholera and yellow fever. Prior to 1981, smallpox was also on the list of notifiable diseases. However, the IHR became increasingly irrelevant during the 20th Century with the re-emergence of old diseases such as tuberculosis, the emergence of new diseases such as SARS, and the threat of biological weapons. 37, 38 A revised version of the IHR was adopted in 2005 and took effect from 2007. The IHR (2005) seek to balance public health responses to disease against the needs of international traffic and trade, and rest on the principle that public health responses should not unnecessarily interfere with international traffic and trade. While the IHR (2005) has a list of specified diseases, including SARS and smallpox, which must be notified to the World Health Organization, the IHR (2005) also move beyond the specified-diseases approach and adopt a broader approach with focus on events which could constitute a public health emergency of international concern. Using a decision algorithm, countries are required to assess public health events in order to determine whether the event is a public health emergency of international concern. If the event is of international significance, notification to the World Health Organization is required. The new IHR focus on risks to health, and provide a more flexible and relevant approach to identification of those risks. 39, 40 The IHR (2005) focus on the development, strengthening and maintenance of capacities at national level to respond to public health emergencies of international concern. As outlined above, the legislative frameworks in Australia for public health responses to infectious diseases are shaped by Australia's federal legal system, and will also be relevant to the responses in other countries with a federal structure. In becoming a signatory to the IHR (2005), the USA submitted a reservation to the IHR on the basis of federalism, noting:",46.95861342633548,20.640486572977643

What is clear is that public health rights and responsibilities for infectious disease are global as well as national. If we are to assess the adequacy of our legal frameworks for pandemic preparedness, we also need to assess the adequacy of our laws in terms of their suitability for meeting our international obligations. While developed countries of the world already have sophisticated public health systems, the capacity to meet their obligations under the IHR (2005), and the financial resources to develop national vaccine stockpiles, the developing countries of the world face a very different outlook. 57 As we consider the intersections of law and public health in the context of the shared global risks of an influenza pandemic, it is important to realize that pandemic preparedness must necessarily involve improved international cooperation and the sharing of expertise to assist in capacity building for public health and the regulatory frameworks surrounding it, as well as a renewed dialogue around international obligations to help the world's poorest and least healthy people. 58 Legal analysis must be a key part of our planning for pandemic influenza. It is essential that federal and state laws are harmonized so as to ensure their smooth functioning and to eliminate crossjurisdictional differences and uncertainties. Public health laws also play a key role in setting out the rights and responsibilities of individuals, communities and governments, providing transparency and accountability to the frameworks for decision-making. In contemporary Australian society where there are high expectations of individual rights and freedoms, and of the public health system, public health laws have an important role to play in ensuring that, as far as is possible, the public's health and the public's freedom are both balanced and protected.

Thus, the public health gains for such an intervention need to be compelling and must offset the cost of development and implementation.

The Public Health Emergency Response Regulations defined four categories of such events: (1) serious epidemics, (2) mass diseases with unknown causes, (3) large scope food or profession poisoning, and (4) other events that can severely affect public health, for example, leaking of infectious bacteria from laboratories. The public health alert system in China has three levels: yellow alert, orange alert, and red alert. Fig. 1 depicts the structure of this alert system. Two levels of public health emergency response plans are triggered by emergency alerts: the provincial and the national. If the public health emergency is confined within a certain region of a province, the provincial plan will be appropriate. If the public health emergency is diffused across provinces and endangers the national public health, the national plan will be needed. Specifically, in the event of a yellow alert, the provincial public health emergency response will become ready; in the event of an orange alert, a provincial public health emergency response will be started or the national emergency response will be ready; in the event of a red alert, the national emergency response plan will be activated. The national public health emergency response plan signifies the highest level of public health threat, and China responds to this type of crisis by gathering relevant departments in the State Council and military to form a national emergency command center. One of the leaders of the State Council, that is, the premier or a vice premier, will be appointed as the commander to direct actions resolving the emergency. The command center co-ordinates and allocates national resources, makes major deci-sions, determines outward statements in press conferences, and possibly resorts to police and military forces. On the other hand, the provincial public health emergency plan is determined by the provincial government. A command center with the provincial government leader as the commander will be organized to direct emergency response activities. The difference between the national plan and the provincial plan is mainly the scope of the response activities. In addition, it should be noted that when a public health emergency response plan becomes ready, it does not necessarily have to be activated. In this scenario, the major task would be to continue carrying out disease surveillance and epidemiological investigation to examine how the emergency develops. Related stakeholders are informed to make preparations and some resources might be allocated. But if the emergency shows no sign of escalation or is controlled before it escalates, the alert would be cancelled. The major responsibilities of the MOH are supervising and co-ordinating a wide range of activities relating to the emergency, such as organizing public health surveillance and reporting, applying for approval to start the national public health emergency response plan from the State Council, organizing and co-ordinating professional organizations to conduct field investigations, treating infected patients, tracing, sterilizing, or quarantining people who were in contact with infected patients, developing technological standards, declaring new infectious disease as legal infectious disease according to pertinent laws (only legal infectious diseases can trigger public health emergency alerts), and ",71.01960388887726,27.3364703737108

Proponents claim that this strategy may avert pandemic if it is enacted within the recommended time frame; however, there remains great controversy regarding its feasibility given current constraints in comprehensive global disease surveillance. 3 Currently, official notification of international health threats is provided by the World Health Organization (WHO), in partnership with the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), and supported legally through WHO's promotion of the International Health Regulations. WHO and GOARN utilize a service called the Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN) to scan media articles globally for references to disease outbreaks and epidemics. † GPHIN is limited, however, by the volume of media material that can be processed in multiple languages.

Significant additional funding to strengthen this capacity followed. In the U.S., the biodefense preparedness budget increased from $294 million in 2001 to $3 billion in the next year and to $5.2 billion in 2004. Of the funds committed since 2001, $3.6 billion was spent on state, local, and hospital preparedness, representing a substantial infusion of new money into public health systems that had seen little new funding in the preceding decade. 16 At the same time, the European Union (EU) established the Health Security Committee to develop a health information system, EU-wide surveillance, a database of the medicines stock, a facility to disseminate medicines and specialists, and health-specific protocols for a coordinated EU response to an attack. 17 By 2006 a growing concern about the possibility of pandemic influenza of avian origin in the U.S. led to an infusion of another $3.8 billion into preparedness activities. 18 The bulk of preparedness budgets in the U.S. was allocated to a range of related health activities intended to respond to acts of bioterror, emerging infectious diseases, and later pandemic influenza. Bioterror and pandemic preparedness investments included the upgrading of disease surveillance, hospital capacity to handle mass casualties, patient isolation systems, laboratory diagnostics for new biologic agents, and the enhancement of command and control structures as well as communication among health and emergency services agencies. 19 Public health officials became concerned that the singular focus on new threats might overshadow the traditional activities of public health departments and hospitals and weaken their ability to tackle existing challenges. 20 -23 Among the negative effects observed was the diversion of staff in hospitals and public health departments from routine activities to meetings and training sessions on preparedness, and reduced attention to nonbioterror-related concerns. Implementing new preparedness activities while maintaining ongoing activities proved to be a challenge. 20, 24 For example, the program to vaccinate health workers against smallpox-one of the most prominent bioterror-preparedness activitiescaused many health departments to defer or cancel other core public health activities, because of the burden of program work and the required monitoring for adverse effects. 17, 25 While infectious disease response may have received a boost from preparedness funding, chronic disease programs lost ground because of the diversion of managers' attention. 20 -22 However, not all preparedness funding was earmarked restrictively, and health managers were able to direct some of the preparedness funding to investments such as infrastructure-human resources and communication-which proved to have multiple uses. 19, 21 As described below, these investments were found to improve both the general functioning of public health departments and hospitals and their ability to handle traditional health threats (Table 1) .",44.48689435917964,17.32146994719496

Given developing countries' weak infrastructure and many competing public health priorities, it is not clear how to best direct these resources. Evidence from the U.S. and other developed countries suggests that some investments in bioterror and pandemic emergency preparedness, although initially implemented as vertical programs, have the potential to strengthen the general public health infrastructure. This experience may hold some lessons for how global funds for emergency preparedness could be invested in developing countries to support struggling public health systems in responding to current health priorities as well as potential future public health threats.

Although the developed world has invested its bioterror-and pandemic-preparedness dollars and euros into building highly specialized emergencyresponse capacity, it is not clear whether this could or should be replicated in the developing world, where public health infrastructure is weak due to years of underinvestment and where there are urgent, competing public health priorities that by necessity take center stage. 2 This article examines the value of a multiple-use approach to emergency preparedness in the develop-ing world-one that aims to build capacity for both emergency preparedness and current core public health activities. Such an approach could offer developing countries an opportunity to strengthen their public health system platforms, allowing them to respond to multiple priority diseases rather than creating specialized programs that will likely be difficult to sustain in the longer term. First, it reviews evidence from developed countries on the impacts of emergency preparedness for bioterrorism and pandemic influenzawhich require similar public health system responseson public health departments and the overall public health system, focusing on investments proven to have substantial collateral impacts on other public health activities.

The purpose of this study is to examine the H1N1 pandemic decision-making process in Canada with an emphasis on the use of evidence for public health decisions.

Data were analysed for thematic content guided by Lomas' policy decision-making framework as well as indicative coding using iterative methods. We interviewed 40 public health officials and scientific advisors across Canada and reviewed 76 pandemic policy documents. Our analysis revealed that pandemic pre-planning resulted in strong beliefs, which defined the decision-making process. Existing ideological perspectives of evidence strongly influenced how information was used such that the same evidentiary sources were interpreted differently according to the ideological perspective. Participants recognized that current models for public health decision-making failed to make explicit the roles of scientific evidence in relation to contextual factors. Conflict avoidance theory explained policy decisions that went against the prevailing evidence.

After 9/11, the US Congress passed the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 6 and the Bioterrorism Act of 2002, 7 which substantially strengthened the ability of the USA to oversee select agents and toxins that could pose public health threats. A recent Presidential Executive Order 8 stipulated that the list of select agents will be adjusted to focus on agents of greatest concern. Several US Government programmes (eg, CDC's Global Disease Detection, Department of Defense's Biological Threat Reduction Program, Department of State's Global Threat Reduction Programs, and USAID's Emerging Pandemic Threats Program) have also been involved in enhancing worldwide capacity to rapidly detect and contain emerging health (and bioterror) threats. These programmes increasingly focus on the development of local health capacity to support WHO's revised international health regulations in conjunction with other worldwide and native eff orts directed at epidemic preparedness and response. 9 Although preparedness and response capabilities for public health emergencies have been diffi cult to defi ne and measure 10 (a task that CDC continues to address 11 ), reports from CDC and organisations such as the Trust for America's Health have documented substantial improvements. 12, 13 These reports show that public health departments are now better equipped to identify health threats rapidly and have improved their abilities to respond eff ectively to and communicate emergencies. For example, 48 of 50 states (96%) have shown their ability to activate staff and their emergency operations centres. Similarly, the medical response to a public health emergency has been strengthened. 14 Progress in preparedness made in the past decade (panel 1) has benefi ted routine and large-scale or unexpected responses, therefore saving lives and preventing illness and injuries. 15 Annual investments through CDC's Public Health Emergency Preparedness cooperative agreement with states support crucial everyday systems. These investments support more than 5000 front-line public health workers who routinely assist local and regional responses for incidents 24 h per day 7 days per week, such as outbreaks of foodborne and infectious diseases, and regional environmental disasters, such as wildfi res, fl oods, and ice storms.",56.5391402228552,20.963533421813608

From 2008 to 2010, more than 44 000 jobs were lost in state and local health departments, and health workers such as public health physicians and nurses, laboratory specialists, and epidemiologists were reduced. 18 Thus, states must grapple with continued declines in funding levels that have already aff ected the ability of the public health system to respond eff ectively to routine and major public health incidents, especially when an increased investment was needed to protect the nation uniformly and address substantial gaps. A 2009 survey 19 found that only 37 state epidemiologists reported substantial-to-full capacity for bioterrorism emergency response-a 10% decline since the peak of federal funding in 2004. Similarly, advances in laboratory reporting are tempered by the reality that in 2010, 12 (24%) states could not submit 90% of Escherichia coli test results to CDC's PulseNet database within 4 working days, compromising rapid identifi cation of outbreaks and subsequent recalls. 12 States cannot adequately meet everyday needs, let alone increased eff orts for emergency incidents that have potential national implications, without reliable, dedi cated, or sustained federal funding.

The WHO and European Commission have both established committees with responsibility for public health as a security issue. m It is questionable whether the suspension of separation of powers and potentially of civil rights and liberties is justified in the name of public health, and arguable that recognition of human rights is essential for dealing effectively with an epidemic. Draconian quarantine measures can be counterproductive, and may even encourage people to avoid seeking medical treatment. Emergency powers exercised for public health reasons treat citizens as the enemy, and reinforce the philosophy of original public health legislation which classified diseased persons as a public health nuisance to be removed and excluded from society for the benefit of the well. 18 Hong Kong, which has had recent experience of epidemic disease, considered but rejected expanding its Emergency Regulations Ordinance to cover pandemic influenza, concluding that public health powers were sufficient and appropriate to disease control even during a pandemic. n Hong Kong has instead amended its Quarantine and Prevention of Disease Ordinance in the light of its SARS experience. 19 Emergency powers and human rights All Council of Europe member states are party to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and any person whose Convention rights have been violated by a state party can take a case to the European Court of Human Rights. In the UK, the Human Rights Act 1998 brings provisions of the Convention into UK domestic law and enables human rights actions to be brought in a domestic court. Rights with particular relevance to public health powers include Article 2 (right to life), Article 3 (an absolute right to freedom from torture and inhumane and degrading treatment), Article 5 (a qualified right to liberty) and Article 8 (a qualified right to private and family life). In Enhorn v Sweden, 20 a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive man detained by Swedish public health authorities on public health grounds successfully challenged his detention on the grounds that it breached Articles 5 and 8 of the Convention. The European Court of Human Rights held that any detention must comply with the principle of proportionality, there must be an absence of arbitrariness, detention must be a last resort measure, and any detention must have as its objective not only protection of the healthy but also care of the ill. 21 There has been little judicial challenge in British courts of the exercise of emergency powers. In relation to the English Emergency Powers Act and the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act, the courts have played a minimal role, striking down only a handful of emergency measures as ultra vires, usually well after the emergency. More recently, in a case where the British Parliament had sanctioned the indefinite detention of any person not a British citizen and certified as a 'suspected terrorist', and where the Government had derogated from both the European Convention and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) on the grounds that there was a 'public emergency', the House of Lords rejected the Government's assertion that the derogation was consistent with the European Convention. Although the majority of judges declined to question whether there was a public emergency on the grounds that the existence of such an emergency was largely a matter for the Government to determine, they concluded that imprisonment of non-citizens alone was neither proportional, given the equal threat from citizens, nor necessary, and questioned the irrationality of singling out a minority (non-citizens) for special burdens, when members of the majority could present an equal risk. 22 Lord Hoffmann was prepared to consider the notion of an emergency and he found it to be a threat to the 'organised life of the community', which would include not merely a threat to the physical safety of the nation, but also to its fundamental values: 'The real threat to the life of the nation, in the sense of a people living in accordance with its traditional laws and political values, comes not from terrorism but from laws such as these.' 23 The decision suggests a judicial role in overseeing government powers in emergencies.",42.292500708021116,19.46938474449623

The Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 established specific requirements for hazard mitigation planning, and grants became available to allow local and state governments to use mitigation funds for predisaster planning. 6 In 2001 the actions of Sept. 11 pushed Congress to create the Department of Homeland Security, which was the largest reorganization of federal agencies since the Great Depression. 6 The magnitude of disaster recovery depends on the magnitude of the destruction. In a small local disaster, volunteer organizations such as the Red Cross and private insurers may be enough to aid victims. When a disaster overwhelms the recovery forces of a community, that community can turn to the state government, and ultimately to FEMA, for resources. Within the first 48 hours of a disaster, an assessment team should provide an initial assessment of the damage. This includes identifying immediate needs such as food, shelter, and infrastructure. A preliminary damage assessment by the local government will determine whether federal aid may be needed and should be requested. Once the immediate needs are identified, and if federal aid is requested, a second, more in-depth survey should be done by FEMA. This second survey should include asking the plans of the displaced citizens: Do they plan to move, or rebuild in the same spot? Public infrastructure, sewers, and storm drains should be examined. What about the town? What was there before the disaster? What currently exists? Were there any existing plans for expansion of the area that could be used for rebuilding? What are opportunities looking at the long term? 10 Every U.S. state maintains an Emergency Management Agency (EMA) and an Emergency Operations Plan. Their role is to establish and maintain an emergency program concerned with preparedness, response, mitigation, and recovery; to coordinate and train state and local governments; to recommend whether federal aid is needed in the case of a disaster; and to coordinate state and federal resources and act as an intermediary between local and federal groups. 6 In the past, the majority of these plans have been concerned primarily with the short-term response. 2 Recently many states have been trying to adapt to a more long-term response.",44.175562978800464,18.853520793076072

At the same time, the global dimensions of public health are transforming traditional approaches to public health. Globalization has limited the capacity of governments to protect health within their sovereign borders through unilateral action alone and national and international health are increasingly recognized as intertwined and inseparable. In addition, the idea that governments have human rights responsibilities to protect and promote public health and can and should be held accountable domestically and internationally for their actions is gaining widespread acceptance. In this new era of global health governance, international law has an important role to play in promoting and coordinating international cooperation and national action.

The building of public private partnerships is proving to be one of the most effective global strategies to address the needs of disadvantaged populations living in the midst of neglected diseases [31] that are no longer considered to be a priority in industrialized nations [32] [33] [34] . If established in a balanced manner, public-private partnerships can bring together the power, resources, and experience from both the industrialized and the developing world to create synergies, define priorities, and find solutions. There are many examples of successful public private partnerships that have pooled their resources and have coordinated global strategies to increase the availability of scarce and expensive medical interventions for those that need them most. For example, the Global Alliance to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GAELF) consists of a partnership between academic and research institutions, advocacy and resource mobilization partners, country representatives, international development agencies and foundations, international organizations, nongovernmental development organizations, and private sector companies [35] . This group retains a ""light governance structure"" that provides the flexibility to focus on specific needs at regional and national levels [35] . Several attempts at regional or international partnerships in rabies prevention and control have occurred throughout the 20th century. For example, once oral vaccination of wildlife became a reality during the 1980s, the World Health Organization (WHO) held multiple consultations involving its global network of WHO Collaborating Centers for Reference and Research on Rabies for an organized approach towards red fox rabies elimination in Western Europe. The breadth and longevity of several other partnerships, such as the Rabies in the Americas Association, Latin-America National Rabies Directors Network (REDIPRA), Southern and Eastern Africa Rabies Group (SEARG), Rabies in Asia Foundation (RIA), Asia Rabies Expert Bureau (AREB), Africa Rabies Expert Bureau (AFROREB), and the recently created Middle East and Central Eastern Europe Rabies Expert Bureau (MEEREB), all demonstrate the utility of coalitions in successful information flow and regional health promotion in bringing support to local scientific and public health communities worldwide. As consistently observed by all existing rabies networks, basic education of people exposed to the risk of infection, the appropriate training of human and animal health professionals, and necessary advocacy by local health decision makers, are major milestones towards global rabies control. The North American Rabies Management Team is another recent example of professionals in Canada, Mexico, and the United States working together, sharing surveillance data, prioritizing applied research needs, and cooperating across the continent, in training and technology transfer, which allows the implementation of human and animal rabies control programs, achieving a drastic decrease of rabies cases in this region of the world.",36.29888209642605,15.601814801788057

The committee responsible for reviewing WHO's performance during the Ebola outbreak (the WHO Ebola Interim Assessment Panel) and leaked internal emails suggest several reasons for the delay including concerns about political opposition from west African leaders, economic ramifi cations, and a culture within WHO discouraging open debate about sensitive issues, such as emergency declarations. 14,64 WHO might also have hesitated because it was sharply criticised for creating panic by declaring a public health emergency of international concern during the relatively mild 2009 H1N1 pandemic. 9 Whatever the root causes, the delay emphasised the risks inherent in vesting such consequential decision making power in a single individual.

Co-investments across sectors, or at least reinforcing ones, have practical value as well. Although typically applied to for-profit contexts, we can consider the process of innovative disruption, which circumvents incumbents to effectively provide an alternative that catches an underserved market or outperforms. Shifting a portion of global health investments from reactionary approaches to preventive capacity could support development of needed renewable technologies such as solar microgrids; building local capacity for installation and maintenance could reduce cost and technological barriers for uptake and use. Capitalizing on voluntary corporate collaboration may be highly fruitful; as of 2012, 1.6% of publically traded companies held more than half of the market value globally, representing enormously powerful interests; gaining their collaboration in sustainable investments could lead to new industry standards. 67 Finally, although a survey of company managers suggested only 27% view climate change as a business risk, 68 compelling industry losses are at stake from broader ecological changes. For example, outbreaks of Marburg virus in Eastern Africa, associated with human encroachment into wildlife habitat for natural resource extraction, prompted mine closures. 69 Adding health to routine environmental and social impact assessment processes for development projects can help identify and mitigate public health risks. There are many opportunities for engagement among those organizations already conscientious of the range of effects (positive and negative) that their investments may have. Multilateral development banks and bilateral aid agencies may be best positioned to lead here given their long histories undertaking impact assessments and diverse expertise, including health. These assessments might include assessment of health inequities of disease burden or disproportionate health-related financial impact to certain populationsdinfrastructure or systems resiliency can also be assessed and improved to reduce vulnerability of investments under climate change. Risks are also highly relevant to reinsurance companies, as their clients increasingly face climate-related losses that add to volatility of risk management.

So-called digital epidemiology has enabled practitioners and researchers to use electronic databases and information to enhance traditional surveillance methods. 5 In 2012, HHS launched its Now Trending developer challenge to create programmes for health departments to monitor social media during an outbreak. The challenge resulted in MappyHealth, a Twitter monitoring programme now being piloted for digital health surveillance around the country, helping offi cials examine real-time events. Digital surveillance was used by public health workers during the infl uenza A H7N9 outbreak to monitor Chinese social media for events, myths, and concerns. 6 Improvements in digital surveillance have also improved public communication. Local health departments that can monitor Twitter can give immediate feedback to correct dangerous mistruths that are contagious on social media. 7 CDC's @CDCEmergency Twitter feed, fi rst established during the infl uenza A H1N1 response, now reaches more than 1·5 million people with emergency health information. During the Japan nuclear disaster response, Twitter was used to correct the dangerous myth that healthy people in the USA should take potassium iodide to prevent harm from radiation. 8 These technological advances have been developed in parallel with diplomatic information sharing advances. WHO's International Health Regulations and multilateral collaborations, such as the Global Health Security Initiative, have provided a framework for international cooperation during public health disasters. Improved capacity and the high priority placed on rapid information sharing led to China's timely reporting in 2013 of clinical and genetic information about infl uenza A H7N9 and early sharing of isolates, by contrast with the response to sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) a decade earlier, when information was slower to emerge. 9,10 Cloud computing allowed for distribution of validated epidemiological and analytical programmes to the global community, while allowing China to share genomic sequences, providing the opportunity for immediate actions to analyse the viral genome and develop vaccine candidates. 6 The Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasure Enterprise was established by HHS to coordinate federal eff orts and build new ways to respond to 21st century health threats-from discovery to deployment. The programme generated a government-wide strategic plan to build all-hazards capabilities and countermeasures throughout federal public health agencies.",47.20458797044517,19.92243484258092

Integrated programs and collaboration, on the other hand, facilitate the efficient management of the complex, varied, and proliferating issues and information sources that exist today. The nature of public health surveillance also lends itself to multiple-purpose approaches in that strategies for preventing and controlling diseases, such as West Nile virus, are to a great extent the same as for an influenza epidemic, a foodborne disease outbreak, or a bioterrorist attack. 31 Technology that enhances communication and data sharing across disease programs, surveillance systems, and even across jurisdictions increases the ease of obtaining and disseminating useful information to a broad audience, including public health agencies, healthcare providers, policymakers, and the general public. 6, 32 This rapid information exchange not only facilitates timely response, but can also reduce emergency room visits, hospital admissions, and even costs of care. 33 However, many health departments currently have systems that are not flexible enough to respond to changing health IT needs, which makes it difficult to deliver information when and where it is needed. 4 Disease or program-specific funding also exacerbates program vulnerability to funding and budgetary cuts. For example, when funding is earmarked for specific purposes (e.g., emergency preparedness and associated surveillance systems), and then is reduced, such as has occurred for public health emergency preparedness cooperative agreement funding through CDC in the past seven years, 34 it can undermine and reverse efforts to establish sustainable systems that serve multiple crosscutting purposes throughout public health.

However welcome a recognition of the need for public health, this 'is spreading resources very thinly' although 'there is a welcome move to broaden the skill base by introducing nonmedical specialists'. 3 GATC has created the new Health Protection Agency (HPA). The HPA has integrated national resources for control of communicable disease and response to chemical and radiological incidents, and provided a focus for response to bioterrorism.

During the early to mid-1990s, access to, and the quality of, some health services were impaired as a result of government budget cutbacks. As a consequence, public confidence in the system was eroded although most Canadians remained committed to the solidarity principles underlying Medicare (Romanow, 2002) . Since the late 1990s, both federal and provincial governments have been reinvesting in public health care in an effort to improve quality and reduce waiting time. This public reinvestment in health care has triggered concerns about the fiscal sustainability of Medicare. In reality, most of the cost drivers appear to be in the mixed and private categories of health services rather than Medicare services. In particular, the growth of private and public prescription drug plans has been in excess of double the rate in growth of hospital and physician expenditures. Despite this, most media and think tank commentators continue to focus on Medicare, occasionally suggesting alternatives to the current single-payer model of administration. These arguments were given considerable political support in a recent Supreme Court of Canada judgment. In the now famous Chaoulli case, the court concluded that the Quebec government's prohibition on private insurance for Medicare services violated the province's Charter of Rights in a situation in which a patient waits an unreasonable amount of time for elective surgery. While the decision is not likely to lead to private, multipayer insurance for Medicare services, it has fueled the ongoing debate concerning the appropriate divide between the public and the private sector in financing, administration, and delivery of health care in Canada.",43.03209238164446,17.38527138749249

Through Global Alert and Response (GAR) Disease Outbreak News (DON) releases, the WHO kept the world updated with detailed, deidentified case information provided soon after they had been forwarded on to them from each country's Ministry of Health or equivalent, as per the transparency required by the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005. However there were often delays in the posting of such information, most notably during the Jeddah-2014 outbreak when no new case details were confirmed by the WHO as originating from KSA for more than six weeks. Cases announced via the KSA Ministry of Health website have often had data inconsistencies including errors, format variations, have often lacked key information including dates, have presented deaths with insufficient information to permit linkage with the announced case and over one hundred cases remain devoid of all key data, excluding them from most epidemiological analyses. This was a particular problem during periods when rapid case accumulation became a concern for the global community. When available, WHO DONs fill in vital missing detail, with additional important demographic data like age, sex or essential dates permitting improved understanding of when illness onset occurred, when cases were hospitalised, whether they were asymptomatic and if the newly announced case was a contact of another case, an animal or an animal product. However DONs are only effective when the underlying data is forwarded to the WHO. Such comprehensive data permits other calculations, for instance the likely laboratory turnaround time, the possibility for nosocomial spread occurring and the location of cases as a determining factor in whether a cluster has become an outbreak or a local epidemic. WHO data can be viewed by the public but are also relied upon by WHO Member States' epidemiology analysts. Such experts report to many levels of Health management and government who seek to understand threats to their own population so as to make the most informed judgements. The decisions which follow may include the need to raise alert levels, prepare laboratory capacity, create educational materials, free specific response funds, ramp up messaging, manage and alter border controls or issue travel alerts. The activities of the WHO have been essential for global preparedness against MERS. The WHO rapidly and comprehensively adopted, updated and publicly promoted diagnostic tools and testing algorithms, case definitions and guidelines for investigations, research study protocols, IPC guidance, travel advice, risk assessments and summary updates via a purpose-built coronavirus-focussed website. Their social media unit strove to answer questions posed by everyone and anyone through Twitter, which in turn allowed users to take control of further disseminating the information they found most interesting, informative, relevant or concerning to others in their social networks; a process that can also be informative to public health bodies who seek to provide their clients the detail they desire. The role of WHO as a nexus for collaboration laid the groundwork for the accumulation and advancement of knowledge about MERS and the MERS-CoV through the formation of, and reporting by, the IHR (2005) Emergency Committee concerning MERS-CoV. Their role is to advise the WHO Director-General on the need for action and, as yet, no Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) has been declared. The IHR Emergency Committee has met eight times to date. Upon request, the WHO has also sent risk assessment teams to the region to gauge the MERS situation. Gregory Härtl, Coordinator of the Department of Communications for the WHO, noted that ""the more answers public health experts can provide now, the greater the public's trust in these institutions will be if and when the virus should become easily transmissible between humans and cause more widespread morbidity and mortality"" (Hartl, 2013) . This is a comment that applies equally well to the emergence of any infectious disease. By comparison, officials within the KSA were widely and regularly criticised for moving slowly, shunning collaborations and failing to show proactive action in commencing local research into MERS and MERS-CoV (2014c; Editorial, 2014; Holmes, 2014; Kupferschmidt, 2014; Reuters, 2014; World Health Organization, 2014f) .",30.267603841025256,14.570432806322493

The findings of our analysis demonstrate the potential for public health agencies to acquire time-sensitive information on rapidly evolving outbreaks occurring outside of their countries through social networking sites. In our analysis, Weibo served as a platform leveraged by central/provincial governments, local news agencies and the public for the timely release and retrieval of information. The Chinese social networking sites' timeliness of reporting are significantly better compared to international mainstream media in English, official websites of the central Chinese government and WHO. Information was released by the local news agencies on the social networking site in the local language before any reports in the conventional news websites or government websites. The information was subsequently amplified by the social networking sites through re-posting of the original report. This allowed the international community greater access to more detailed and timely information compared to that released at the central government level to the international media. The central Chinese government may have allowed the provincial/municipal health authorities to release information on new cases when available to ensure transparency and timeliness of public communications. The access to such timely, crowd-sourced information on infected cases greatly facilitated the understanding of the epidemiology of an unknown disease, which is key in developing effective prevention and control measures. public health practitioners, social media surveillance could provide early warning for unusual public health events in a foreign country and serve as an additional source of epidemiological intelligence to complement conventional surveillance tools. For local public health authorities, social media surveillance could function as an effective platform for public education and social mobilization.

Criminal law has implications for the harm which results from crime; laws on the workplace, transport, the building industry, education or discrimination look to health and welfare; laws on negligence and contract have as objectives safety standards and deterrence; even laws regulating financial transactions will have consequences for health. Categorising that body of law which regulates public health is therefore as difficult as the task of defining public health'. 5 In the preceding section, the 'intertwining' of public health law with various other subjects of study, especially within the legal syllabus, was presented as pedagogically beneficial.

The teaching of public health law demands a degree of polymathism -both within the discipline of law and external to it (given the multidisciplinary character of public health) -which may prove unduly daunting to individuals in an increasingly time-pressed academic environment. This is undoubtedly a significant obstacle, but it is not one which is unprecedented. Similar challenges have been confronted in the teaching of environmental law, another subject with strong interdisciplinary and intradisciplinary dimensions. 35 Various strategies may be adopted to minimize this difficulty, albeit that it is improbable that it will be eliminated completely. Prominent amongst these are likely to be the development of forms of intramural and extramural collaboration or networking, which facilitate the sharing of expertise and the pooling of knowledge among scholars with particular disciplinary specialisms. Allied to this will be measures to enable broad scholarly access to resources on public health law, for example through the creation of a 'virtual knowledge bank' containing case law, legislation, official publications, regulatory information and governmental policy statements. Relatedly, but more conventionally, publication of a textbook or text and materials volume and availability of relevant academic journals will greatly assist those who might consider entering this field of study in future years; scarcity of teaching resources is undoubtedly a serious impediment to student and scholar alike.",38.11745080586367,18.36136512391401

If insufficient new federal dollars are available to deal with influenza, then serious consideration should be given to reprioritizing the large infusions of dollars designated for other potential bioterrorism agents, where the risk of disease occurrence is far less certain. Indeed, many of the issues that must be addressed for influenza are relevant to responses to other potentially widespread emerging infections (eg, SARS) and bioterrorism agents (eg, smallpox virus). 32 Figure. Configuration of working groups charged with planning for and oversight of responses to (1) bioterrorism events, (2) emerging infections such as SARS, and (3) pandemic influenza will, and likely must, vary from federal to state to local areas. At federal level, alignment of expertise and resources into dedicated groups that collaborate and have some overlap in membership at key agencies is likely most effective approach at this time. Configuration of state and large urban area working groups may vary depending on their specific population size and geographic characteristics, as well as expertise available in public and private sectors. At local level, those individuals from multiple public and private agencies who will need to work together in planning for and response to each of these types of events are largely the same, and types of issues they will be facing in each scenario would be highly similar, and, in many aspects, identical. Expertise in planning for and providing of care to children may not be readily available in many localities and may be unevenly distributed among states. Use of the precautionary principle with regard to the public health obligation to protect populations against foreseeable threats, 34 even under conditions of uncertainty, will be necessary. This application must be balanced by the principles of choosing the least restrictive/intrusive alternative, fairness and justice (both procedural and substantive). 35 Issues of child care for quarantined traveling families have received little discussion to date.

Also churches have long had a role in trying to cater for the poor and the disabled. In recent years more active approaches have developed, such as the Communities of Shalom (CS) set up by the United Methodist Churches. Initiated by the Rev Joseph Sprague it has now created hundreds of shalom zones in impoverished areas from its beginning in 1992, training local residents to promote health information and social capital. In many American cities some churches have partnered with public health departments in local universities to create facilities and programmes to improve the health of people in poor neighbourhoods, using trained local volunteers and specialists, such as the Congregations for Public Health in Birmingham, Alabama (CPH). All these examples represent the contemporary equivalents of the settlement houses of nineteenth century cities, designed improve the educational, health and economic prospects of people in impoverished areas, although these were mainly secular, as seen in work of Hull House in Chicago and many other cities (Adams 1910) . Another policy has tried to improve to areas of high disadvantage and ill-health by seeking to reduce concentrations of poor families, such as by scattering, instead of creating, public housing clustering, and by removing families to other locations where there are better facilities and more social mixture (Rubinovitz and Rosenbaum 2000; Comey et al. 2008) .

Both Twining 27 and Bradney 28 have emphasized the need for the modern teaching of legal subjects to move beyond a professional/ vocational model to embrace a pluralistic, liberal idea of education. On this analysis, subjects should be taught not solely for their vocational utility, but for their capacity to 'allow [students] to understand the structures and values that permeate and underpin law. to introduce students to the wide variety of conversations that is going on within law at any one moment, so that they can explore law from a range of different stances'. 28 A liberal curriculum is thus characterized by pluralism and variety such that those who have benefited from study upon it may be capable of providing 'explicit or implicit personal and individual answers to questions about how the world is ordered and connected and how we value and evaluate these connections'. 28 It is submitted that a strong case can be made for the pedagogical value of public health law on such liberal academic grounds. One such argument has already been outlined: the opportunity which the teaching of this subject presents to familiarize students, whether of public health or of law, with the facilitative capabilities of law; that is, its capacity to 'provide an opportunity to explore the ways that law can be used to advance public health goals'. 26 In so far as this represents a departure from the more familiar reading of law's function as a negative control mechanism, this embodies a liberal pedagogical objective, since such teaching thereby allows students to comprehend law from a different stance than the norm or, to use Bradney's terminology, to be introduced to an alternative 'conversation' regarding the societal roles which law may perform. 28 A related liberal pedagogical goal which can be pursued through the teaching of public health law arises from its population perspective. As a contrast to the traditionally individualistic orientation of law, including medical law, study of public health law can therefore offer 'valuable lessons about the complexity of the relationship between individuals and populations' and law's role in mediating this relationship. 26 This, in turn, can assist in building greater understanding amongst all students of the variety of functions fulfilled by law.

The consideration that should accord severe infectious diseases the top priority in emergency public health events was inadequate. Nowadays, infectious diseasesespecially acute and severe ones transmitted via respiratory and intestinal tractsmay appear as either newly emerged infectious diseases or weapons in biological terrorism. Since such diseases usually emerge in an explosive and indiscriminate manner and have wide spread impact, they often lead to panic, social disorder, and economic trauma. Historically, severe epidemics had sometime changed war outcomes, wreaked social disorder, and altered political regimes. Considering these grave potential impacts, the establishment of a response system to severe infectious diseases should be given significant priority in the response system of sudden public health incidents. Acute and severe viral infectious diseases generally do not have specific and effective prevention and treatment measures; therefore, emergency response, prevention, and control need to be given the top priority. 2. The most significant revelation from the SARS outbreaks is that the response system to emergency public health events is inadequate. In the epidemics, weaknesses in China's command system, information system, prevention and treatment teams, and corresponding material storages were completely exposed. For the past two decades, the public health service in China has lagged behind, primarily due to inadequate funding. To solve these problems is an essential step for China to build a harmonious modern society with long-term lasting and equilibrating economic development. The establishment of China's CDCcentered nationwide laboratory monitor network, epidemic information network, emergency teams, and material storage is an essential component in building up the national response to public health emergencies. 3. No consummate public reporting institution of epidemic is observed. In the beginning of the epidemic, the policy of ""strict inward while loose outward"" concerning SARS blocked the epidemic information. The mystery of epidemic disease hovered among the public. Information was not transparent and blocked between related CDCs and researchers, even among departments of government including China and international organizations. This delayed the timely control of the epidemic and even initiated a confidence crisis among the public. It is essential to develop a complete system to announce and report epidemics -a scientific system to analyze and explain epidemics so that various departments can coordinate control of the epidemic and so that the public can correctly understand the epidemic and positively support the measures that the government takes to contain the epidemic.

By 2016, 80% of urban residents worked in the private sector, which also generates 60% of national GDP. 30 The private sector has an enormous influence on the health of employees and communities and a responsibility to address its effect on urban health and the environment. Moreover, there is emerging evidence that corporate involvement and investment in public health can create valuable opportunities for business. 320 In line with WHO recommendations, 305 healthy cities in China should use the private sector's potential to provide health-related services, support the adoption of health-promoting behaviours, and contribute to initiatives that are relevant to public health. To date, private sector involvement in health care in China is still small. Just 20% of urban hospitals in 2008 were privately owned and the market share of private health insurance was not substantial. 321 Just 12·3% of all medical treatment visits between January, and November, 2016 were to private sector facilities. 322 New policies are needed to encourage the private sector to invest more in health facilities and provide health services, especially to serve marginalised populations. At the same time, relevant regulatory and supervisory mechanisms need to be strengthened to improve the quality and consistency of private sector health care. 323 The private sector also has great potential for new investment in health technologies (eg, internet health and mobile health). For example, WeChat, which is the most popular messaging app in China, has been shown to be effective in health promotion, patient care, monitoring, diagnosis, and public health communication. 324 The private sector should also invest more in employee health and occupational safety. This situation is win-win because improvements in health can benefit businesses through reduced health-care expenditures, increased revenue, and improved reputation. Although, in some cities, privately-owned businesses have been involved in health promotion campaigns, the scale of such programmes is limited and is essentially based on voluntary participation. Therefore, there is substantial room for expansion. The private sector can also contribute to promoting healthy behaviour among customers or consumers more broadly. For example, a recent collaboration between the public health agency and a restaurant chain in Beijing aimed to cut salt content in food, benefiting customers and boosting the image of the company as health-conscious (panel 11).",42.883938920640674,17.564946268250846

The Mecklenburg Operational Surveillance Team (MOST) is an active public health surveillance program with a system in place for receiving secure electronic data regarding absenteeism from the public schools, daycare centers, and adult and pediatric clinics; a daily emergency department census; retail pharmacy information; veterinarian clinic activity; and EMS call volume. Information is downloaded daily to capture the previous 24 hours of activity. The average state of health for the county can be measured such that any significant deviations from the normal are recognized and epidemiologic processes for cause are implemented. The North Carolina Office of EMS has developed the State Medical Assistance Team (SMAT) I, II, and III initiative, which is designed to support local hospitals (SMAT I and II) and EMS (SMAT III). Each SMAT incorporates a medical equipment, personal protection, and pharmaceutical cache that may be quickly mobilized to an incident site to assist in mitigation. The Regional Advisory Councils (RACs) for Trauma have been developed in seven regions across the state. Based in the trauma center, the purpose of each RAC is to bring prehospital and hospital representatives together into a forum that facilitates open dialogue among the organizations as it relates to trauma care and transportation. Each RAC is responsible for establishing a Disaster and Preparedness Subcommittee that allows for regional planning initiatives. The North Carolina Public Health Department has developed seven Public Health Regional Surveillance Teams designed to provide oversight and bioterrorism preparedness coordination activities to all local health departments. The North Carolina Office of Emergency Management has identified, outfitted, and funded a group of Regional Hazardous Materials Response Teams and limited Urban Search and Rescue Teams to assist any jurisdiction in need of those particular resources.",43.21075867580472,17.839643039688312

Hsu et al 3 asserted that competency statements are broad and that activities associated with the statements are needed; as a result, they used the term ''terminal objective'' and defined it as the measurable performance after completion of a set of instructions. Gebbie and Merrill 2 emphasized the importance of competencies involving emergency response and public health workers. Hsu et al 3 expanded on this area of research and described competencies for health care workers during disasters. The need for workforce competence has been addressed by the National Public Health Performance Standards Program, a collaborative effort among 7 national public health organizations. This group outlined essential functions for public health systems, with function 8 having a stated goal of ensuring a competent workforce. 4 In the private health care industry, accreditation standards outlined by such organizations as the Joint Commission focus on the need for health care facilities to ensure workforce competence as a means of ensuring patient safety. 5 In 2006, Henderson 6 surveyed Canadian infection control professionals regarding their opinion of the necessary infection prevention competencies of Canadian health care workers. Her work is of particular importance in light of the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) on the Canadian health care workforce.

Significant medical school debt can drive new physicians away from the ID specialty and public health. Targeted loan repayment opportunities would allow more physicians to pursue these critical career paths. In July 2018, in a move supported by IDSA, the US House of Representative's Energy and Commerce Committee passed legislation that would authorize the CDC to provide loan repayment for those who serve in the Epidemic Intelligence Services (EIS). More than 85% of EIS officers continue serving in public health roles, and this proposal would significantly help make this career path more financially feasible for physicians. Such loan forgiveness opportunities could also be broadened to support ID physicians who work in public health at the federal, state, or local level and face similar challenges around compensation and medical student debt. Establish financial compensation for ID physicians who work in public service (eg, local, state, and federal public health agencies) or who do ID work that provides broader public health benefits (infection control and antimicrobial stewardship). Physicians who perform infection control and antimicrobial stewardship work should be compensated for these activities. As part of hospital accreditation, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) mandates that every participating facility have an active infection control program [37] . States could attach an accreditation process to such mandates that would formally document ID clinicians who oversee hospital infection control and antimicrobial stewardship committees, with loan forgiveness or other financial incentives attached to this accreditation. Ensure that ID physician compensation reflects public health value added. As a cognitive specialty, many of the clinical services ID physicians provide are billed under Evaluation and Management codes, which have not been reevaluated in more than 20 years. The CMS should update these codes to reflect the increasingly complex care provided in inpatient and outpatient settings. Public and private payers, healthcare systems, and hospitals should also provide appropriate compensation and protected time for nonclinical services that are crucial to public health, including infection prevention and control, antimicrobial stewardship, and bioemergency preparedness and response.

The reasons for this are varied and complex, but they include limited access to resources that can help people to take action during an emergency, culture and language barriers, lower perceived personal risk, distrust of authorities, lack of preparation and protective action, and frequent reliance on informal sources of information. 1, 2 Central to these factors, we argue, is the phenomenon of communi-cation inequalities, which we define as differences among individuals and social groups in accessing and using health information and the resultant impact on knowledge and behaviors. [2] [3] [4] While a solid body of work in social epidemiology has documented a connection between social determinants such as socioeconomic position, race, and ethnicity and health outcomes, the mechanisms linking the 2 have been less clear. Viswanath and colleagues developed an explanatory framework of how inequalities in public health emergency preparedness outcomes attributable to social determinants could potentially be explained by inequalities on various dimensions of public health emergency preparedness. 5 The framework is summarized by the Structural Influence Model (SIM) of preparedness communication depicted in Figure 1 . 5 The model is a heuristic framework developed to link social determinants with preparedness outcomes through public health emergency preparedness communications. The framework was originally developed in the context of health communication 5 and subsequently adopted to public health emergency preparedness communication to the public. 6 Communication to the public is critically important in public health emergency preparedness. It is one of 15 public health emergency preparedness capabilities developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): ''Public Information and Warning.'' 7 During a crisis, federal, state, and local public health agencies are typically engaged in a variety of public information efforts to inform the population, encourage the adoption of preventive behaviors, and limit the adverse impacts of specific events. Yet, individuals and groups may not be able to access and use some of the resources offered to them, including information on health and specific threats, because of existing social inequalities, including socioeconomic position, race, ethnicity, and physical and mental health disabilities, among others. 8 Emergencies, including disasters, also can lead to longterm disparities, even controlling for predisaster socioeconomic status, as a study of Hurricane Katrina showed. 9 These disparities are also found among nations. For ex-ample, a United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) study showed that the adverse consequences of disasters, such as mortality, are greater among countries with low income, low life expectancy, and less education. 10 In contrast, advanced countries with higher income and education and more stable governance suffer fewer losses in disasters. 9 Poorer households tend to have poorer coping strategies and suffer consequences over the longer term. 11 In an analysis, Kim showed that poor people are more likely than nonpoor people to be exposed to disasters and that the poor are much more likely to be concentrated in disasterprone areas, highlighting the importance of public health emergency preparedness communications. 6 During an emergency, a number of psychosocial as well as social factors influence action, even when information about a probable hazard is available and promptly communicated to the public. For example, Mexican Americans often have delayed responses to natural emergencies because of the time they spend in trying to communicate with their extended families. 12 Hearing impairment may leave elderly people more vulnerable to information processing and cause difficulty in understanding evacuation orders, 13 and individuals with low literacy may be challenged in interpreting written messages and are likely to benefit from preparedness resources that are easy to read and visually appropriate. 14 Given the importance of communicating to the public in public health emergency preparedness, it is important to examine the extent to which this issue has received attention from the scientific community. The goal of this project was to conduct a systematic review of the scientific literature to describe current research in public communication in public health emergency preparedness, with a particular focus on communication inequalities and their association with communication and preparedness outcomes. This review examines the relationship among sociodemographics, behavioral characteristics, and communication outcomes in public health emergency preparedness.",48.09098164417259,19.292481216413467

The cash received for the bonds then can be used for research and future purchase of vaccines. Whenever the bonds are issued, IFFIm pays bondholders a modest rate of interest. As money pledged by donor governments becomes available gradually over 30 years, these funds will be used to repay the capital value of the bonds. 69 IFFIm was able to double the resources GAVI has been able to allocate-$945.6 million in 2007 compared with $418.3 million in 2006. 74 Vaccine financing programs. Historically, the U.S. immunization system has been financed through public-private sector partnerships. The public sector purchases vaccines for approximately 55% of the birth cohort. 75 Section 317 (a federal discretionary grant program to all states), the Vaccines for Children (VFC) Act of 1993 (P.L. 103-66), and state funds are major public sector sources for vaccine financing. Private sector vaccine purchases are covered through private health insurance and account for 45% to 50% of the pediatric vaccines sold annually in the United States. 75 The federal government has played an evolving role in building the immunization structure in the United States. The earliest legislation pertaining to vaccine financing is the Social Security Act of 1935. Title V of this act pertains to immunization services for children and their mothers. In 1963, Congress enacted the Vaccine Assistance Act (Section 317 of the Public Health Service Act). This legislation provided grants to social service agencies and local health departments for immunization infrastructure and vaccine purchases. 41 However, barriers to immunization access still remained in some areas as a result of considerable variability in immunization efforts by state and local governments.",33.09239685627801,14.91555379065418

Many countries have invested in enhancing their fundamental public health surveillance and response systems. Various new programmes, projects and networks related to emerging diseases have also been initiated with the involvement of national governments, international organizations, development agencies, donors and partners (including the private sector) and academic or educational institutions. These efforts have helped improve the overall preparedness for emerging diseases in the region and globally. 12 The experiences and lessons learnt from implementation of the original Asia Pacific Strategy for Emerging Diseases, or APSED (2005), and pandemic (H1N1) 2009 showed a clear need for harmonization, prioritization, coordination, collaboration and efficiency in addressing the common threats. Such a collective approach required an up-to-date, agreed upon strategic framework that is relevant to all countries, regions and international stakeholders. The World Health Organization (WHO), as the directing and coordinating agency for international health within the United Nations system, has played an essential role in developing such global and regional public health policies and strategies in consultation and collaboration with countries and areas, technical experts and partners.

Regarding the actions of the WHO itself, the panel's assessment regarded there to have been ""significant and unjustifiable delays"" in declaring the Ebola outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, despite early warnings about the outbreak from its own staff and from non governmental organisations such as Médecins Sans Frontières, and that the ""WHO does not currently possess the capacity or organizational culture to deliver a full emergency public health response"" (WHO, 2015, p6) .

These challenges and the attendant lessons learned were detailed in Learning from SARS: Renewal of public health in Canada -Report of the National Advisory Committee on SARS and Public Health (1) . Key among them were the need for better coordination of response actions taken by the multiple levels of government and the need for increased or renewed recognition of the public health threat posed by emerging or re-emerging infectious disease. Although the emergence of SARS was not predicted, an influenza pandemic was and still is considered inevitable in the context of public health emergency preparedness. As such, in an effort to formally recognise and widely share Federal/Provincial/ Territorial (FPT) coordinated planning, the Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan (CPIP) was first published in 2004, incorporating lessons learned from SARS. With an updated and evergreen CPIP released in 2006, Canada was much better prepared to respond to the 2009 emergence, spread and ensuing global pandemic of novel H1N1 influenza virus that originated in Mexico (2). Canada benefited from significant capacity-building investments, such as assuring access to a domestic pandemic vaccine and stockpiles of antiviral drugs. As it turned out, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic was not as severe as some of its predecessors. Hence, during and post-H1N1, national governments and the World Health Organization (WHO) recognized that a more flexible and adaptable response to future pandemics was needed to reflect local and regional circumstances (2). The Ebola virus disease outbreak that began in West Africa in late 2013 was not only a severe disease with high morbidity and mortality, it was also an epidemic of fear. This outbreak demonstrated the fatal impact of poor communications and the importance of accounting for local cultural beliefs and local leadership in the response. It was also a poignant example of the need to strengthen public health emergency response capacity in every country and to better coordinate rapid global response capacity, including research, if we are to protect others as well as ourselves (3, 4) .",57.72251684197659,21.9666059698175

This is where the twin demons of money and power raise their heads. Already, at the turn of the 1980s, A. Bartlett GIAMATTI 86 (1938 -1989) , who was then president of Yale University in the USA, commenting on American university policies, spoke of a ""ballet of antagonisms"" between, on the one hand, commercial companies that are interested in the rapid cost-effectiveness of any new therapeutic advance and, on the other hand, non-profit university laboratories. Recently, James J. DUDERSTADT 87 (b. 1973), emeritus President of the University of the Michigan, argued that the University is a ""counter-hierarchical"" organism. In fact, its members are free to carry out the research that pleases them and to think in the ways that they wish to think, in any case within an academic norm that considers itself as being free from the constraints dictated by private interest groups. Until recently, such behavior was considered as a sort of ethic which arose out of the University conscience and dignity. The crumbling away of this ethic in the final decades of the 20 th century coincided with the rise of biotechnologies and the large-scale filing of patents relating to molecular genetics techniques that could be applied to the manipulation of living beings, by researchers in the public sector. The intrusion of the American private sector into public research laboratories, in the form of collaborations with transfer of ""sensitive"" information from the public to the private, has become such a worrying problem that drastic control measures have had to be taken. Within this context, the American federal government, in February 2005, issued a certain number of prohibitions targeting the National Institutes of Health (NIH) of Bethesda, particularly with respect to the retribution of researchers for services rendered to industry 88 . These stands call for thought concerning the place that is currently held in Universities with respect to fundamental research. Without arguing against the efficacy of major research institutes, it is nevertheless necessary to remember the part played by the University in this domain. The University is not only the place where knowledge, both as it is now, in its current state of advancement, and as it has been, it is also the place where knowledge must be created by fundamental research.",46.07559074246226,19.707122538975558

In addition, FEI capacity could also be improved through on-the-job public health practice and formal professional training.

Further, experience in emergency response activities is invaluable to improve the capacity of CDC workforce during complex investigations.

Organizations and professionals in the public health sector may not always succeed in preventing pandemics: as we have seen, they are well aware of this fact, and that is why emergency plans are developed in the first place. But this implies that, in principle, all organizations that provide basic services for society have to professionalize themselves in this specific area. One could describe this as a 'colonization' of non-health organizations through public health imperatives. This is, of course, not a completely new development if one considers, for instance, company doctors or health and safety officers. Furthermore, many large organizations have undergone a professionalization in areas that do not traditionally belong to their core activities, such as when they maintain legal, public relations or research departments, or when they offer childcare or psychological counselling to their employees. To some extent, this is a likely consequence of the 'functional differentiation of modern societies' (Luhmann 1997) : even if organizations are typically specialized in providing only one or two services, they have to take further social functions into account. What is new here is the kind of task, that is, preparing for pandemics in order to prevent the worst-case scenario-a complete breakdown of the system that would result from the absence of employees due to illness. In a society of organizations, the autopoiesis of society as whole cannot be separated from the autopoiesis of its organizations. Preserving society in a public health emergency depends on keeping organizations functional. ",43.25149446361024,18.38440647891626

Indeed, in evidence to a UK Parliamentary committee, David Fidler stated that:

In federal states, the legal relationship between federal and local government may constitute rights as a risk in the public health emergency field. On the one hand, a strong states' rights tradition can hamper, or be used as an excuse by, federal government in developing particular national preparedness measures. On the other hand, however, where federal government seeks aggressively to assert its power and interfere with protected human rights, a tradition of strong states' rights could be a bulwark against such abuse.88",51.09738072002555,21.404803197439698

Public health security is … the activities required, both proactive and reactive, to minimize vulnerability to acute public health events that endanger the collective health of national populations. Global public health security widens this definition to include acute public health events that endanger the collective health of populations living across geographical regions and international boundaries … .[G]lobal health security, or lack of it, may also have an impact on economic or political stability, trade, tourism, access to goods and services and, if they occur repeatedly, on demographic stability.3

So far, there have been over 11,000 non-local healthcare professionals, mobilized by the public health authorities from other parts of China, fighting against the epidemic in Wuhan. However, this is far from adequate for Wuhan given the severity of the epidemic. In addition to Wuhan, other cities in Hubei are in need of urgent external help as well with respect to health resources, as multiple localized outbreaks are taking place. On February 7, 2020, the National Health Commission of China (NHCC) initiated the ""One City Covered by One Province"" program, explicitly assigning a specific province to aid one city in Hubei. Two critical questions of operational nature remain, which cities, both in Hubei and other provinces, are most vulnerable to localized outbreaks, and how the public health authorities should balance the healthcare resources under stress to best fight the epidemic and minimize the risks?

(4) Broad public mandates for social distancing are also vital to help manage a key multiplier of COVID-19 fatality rates: a substantial fraction of patients require lengthy (on average 8 bed days) intensive care unit (ICU) support to survive acute respiratory distress, and uncontrolled spread of the disease is expected to generate at its peak far greater demand for ICU care than existing capacity can meet.(5; 2; 6) Public health experts have pleaded with officials to quickly mandate social distancing to flatten the curve of coronavirus infections -that is, reduce the peak caseload -before exponential case growth leads to hundreds of thousands or millions of deaths. In particular, it is important to keep peak levels low to prevent the fatality rate from rising to the levels seen in areas where hospitals are overwhelmed with cases. (7) In the United States, the emergence of the coronavirus has created a natural experiment in which elected officials face incredibly urgent and far-reaching policy decisions for which they typically have no personal experience or expertise, and for which the history of policy examples is either mere days old, or so dated as to be largely unknown except by public health experts. The most significant policy decisions of this kindboth in terms of their potential to mitigate the epidemic and their economic consequences -are mandates for social distancing through restrictions on public gatherings; closure or restriction of schools, restaurants, and other non-essential businesses; and orders for the public to stay at home.

The peak in other provinces appeared earlier, approximately on February 5. The possible reason is that the epidemic outside Hubei Province is less serious and easier to control.
