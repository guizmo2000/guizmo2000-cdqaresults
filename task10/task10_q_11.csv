Emerging infectious diseases have exacted heavy public health and economic tolls. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) rapidly decimated the region's tourist industry. Influenza A (H5N1) has had a profound effect on the poultry industry. The reason why Southeast Asia is at risk from emerging infectious diseases is quite complex. The region is home to dynamic systems in which biological, social, ecological, and technological processes interconnect in ways that enable microbes to exploit new ecological niches (22) . At the same time, the ASEAN countries are facing an epidemiological transition with increased morbidity and mortality from NCDs. NCDs are now responsible for 60% of deaths in the region. The problem stems from the ageing of the population, life-style behaviors (tobacco use, alcohol use, unhealthy diet, and inadequate physical activity) and environmental factors. The triple burdens of diseases Á persistent and emerging infectious diseases, NCDs, and injuries Á pose significant threats to the populations in this region. Disadvantaged populations (such as the poor, people living in rural or remote areas, etc.) Table 4 . Health workforce in ASEAN countries are the hardest hit Á NCDs account for a high proportion of deaths in ASEAN and particularly as a proportion of deaths in wealthier countries, but they also kill more people in absolute numbers in the less developed countries of ASEAN, with the apparent exception of Cambodia (23) . As Table 1 shows, NCD age standardized mortality rates ranged highs of between 680 per 100,000 population in Indonesia and Lao PDR to 708.7 in Myanmar and 720 in the Philippines, compared to much lower rates observed in Singapore (264.8), Vietnam (435.4) and Thailand (449.1). Also important to note are that total mortality rates are relatively low in ASEAN. Deaths from infectious diseases have steadily declined, and currently there are relatively small proportions of older people (between 6 and 15% of those aged 60 or over among ASEAN countries, see (24) . The WHO at the 65th World Health Assembly in 2012 agreed to adopt a global target of 25% reduction in premature mortality from NCDs by 2025 (25), a target that we hope will be vigorously pursued in ASEAN. We refer to NCD data with caution, as few countries in ASEAN have complete causes of death information systems Á among them, Singapore is the only country with reliable cause of death certification and coding (6) . ASEAN also faces a demographic transition to a greater share of the elderly as a proportion of total population. In 2015, the percentage of those aged 65 and over is estimated to be 7.1% among ASEAN countries, with the highest proportion of elderly in Singapore (13.7%) and Thailand (12.0%). By 2030, the share of elderly is expected to almost double to a regional average of 12.3% of total population (26) . With increasing life expectancies and share of the elderly without commensurate increases in birth rates, population aging has implications for financing UHC and how benefits packages will evolve in the next 20 years, given that healthcare consumption increases with age.",26.115805975139455,11.896767655053845

We shall call this version the constrained consequentialist approach. Lawrence Gostin offers an example of it in his influential Public Health Law: Duty, Power and Restraint. In introducing his account, Gostin writes: ""The prime objective of public health law is to pursue the highest possible level of physical and mental health in the population, consistent with the values of social justice."" He later expands on this claim by suggesting that the twin aims that motivate public health interventions are ""to advance human wellbeing by improving health, and to do so particularly by focusing on the needs of the most disadvantaged."" 23 These passages suggest that Gostin deviates from utilitarianism in two respects. While he believes, like the utilitarian, that interventions must promote individual well-being, his appeals to social justice and the needs of the most disadvantaged suggest that, unlike the utilitarian, he does not regard aggregate wellbeing as the sole determinant of the good, but instead believes that the distribution of well-being across the community should be incorporated into the theory of the good. Moreover, the claim that the objective of public health law is to pursue high levels of health in a manner that is consistent with the values of social justice leaves open the possibility that the pursuit of good outcomes may be side-constrained-that is to say, there may be certain means to pursuing those outcomes that are ruled out, regardless of how good their effects would be. The nature of the constraints will depend on the theory of social justice that one adopts in cashing out the framework. Notably Justifications for Non-Consensual Medical Intervention in claiming that public health ought to focus on the ""needs of the most disadvantaged,"" 24 Gostin himself seems to implicitly endorse a fundamentally prioritarian account of social justice. Some prioritarians set side-constraints on the pursuit of the good by claiming that our pursuit of general well-being should be constrained by the principle that we must not select any option in which the worst-off individuals will be worse off than the worst-off individuals in any alternative distribution. 25 A second approach to the justification of non-consensual IDC interventions treats the imposition of such interventions as an instance of justified self-defense. We may say that an agent is acting in self-defense if she is acting to prevent another (the attacker) from harming her. 26 In the context of IDC, it has been suggested that it may be legitimate to think of an infected (or potentially infected) individual as an attacker, and other members of the public as potential victims who may be justified in defending themselves against the attacker, by, for example, imposing an IDC intervention. 27 In what follows, we will not seek to adjudicate between constrained consequentialist and self-defense justifications for IDC interventions.",24.235937562407372,10.287779677299122

Given the nature of disease infections, the simple diary-based approach shall continue to be the most comprehensive method to collect details about face-toface interpersonal contacts in everyday life. The difficulties of data collection may be eased by the use of more technically advanced methods, such as online surveys. Nonetheless, because such surveys tend to undersample technically disadvantaged groups (who may also be more or less vulnerable to disease infections), one should pay special attention to the validity of statistical inferences based on data collected from the use of such methods. More country-specific findings are expected as an increasing amount of comparable diary-based probability survey data becomes available from other countries. For example, preliminary analyses show that the Taiwanese have a different cross-generational pattern of interpersonal contact.

Time of sampling therefore represents important information to incorporate in phylodynamic analyses because it allows calibration of phylogenies, and hence epidemic histories, of rapidly evolving pathogenies in calendar time units ). Molecular clock models that formalize the relationship between sequence divergence and evolutionary time have been extended specifically for this purpose, and models accommodating sampling time now represent the cornerstone of time-measured phylodynamics (Rambaut 2000; Shapiro et al. 2011) . Populations from which ""heterochronous"" sequence data can be obtained are colloquially referred to as measurably evolving populations (MEPs) (Drummond et al. 2003) , a concept that does not only apply to rapidly evolving pathogens but also extends to populations from which ancient DNA can be sampled (e.g., Hofreiter et al. (2001) ; Päabo et al. (2004) ; Shapiro et al. (2004) ; Molak et al. (2015) ). Not surprisingly, location of sampling has also received a great deal of attention because infectious disease transmission is an inherently spatial process. However, location in an epidemic network is not necessarily determined by geographical position, but may be more appropriately represented by position in a social or sexual network, the proximity to vector breeding sites, the movement of hosts or infectious agents through commerce, air travel, wind, or other factors (Smith 2005; Brockmann and Helbing 2013) .

The important geographic dispersion in our results demonstrates the necessity for studying the potential role that human mobility has in DENV transmission and outbreak duration and also a strong argument to study and clarify the role that asymptomatic cases might have in Dengue virus dispersion. Furthermore our data strongly suggest that the size of the areas considered for prevention and control of DF outbreaks needs to be revised and that it is necessary to integrate this knowledge into the planning of preventive and control measures, which usually are prone to using basic shapes such as circles or squares as geographic references in order to define limits, ranges, trajectories and points of origin. It is clear that human populations move normally across geographical areas and not only during holidays or vacations. According to our data, the magnitude of these displacements is larger than that considered as an administrative responsibility for local health services providers. This is relevant for DENV transmission if a large fraction of that mobile commuting population is also asymptomatic but viremic, facilitating with their movements the exposure of local uninfected mosquito populations with the virus, which might result in an increased geographical dispersion and persistence of the outbreaks due a continuous process of spreading and reintroduction of the virus to susceptible populations.",20.531254867400346,10.02291909345981

A longitudinal modeling analysis of birth cohorts born 10 years apart,"There is a substantial concern from policymakers worldwide on how to manage and care for this expanding vulnerable population, and a need for more detailed insights into how the care needs of these oldest-old populations are changing. This can be, at least in part, informed by evaluating whether they are living longer and with less disability across successive generations. Two major views on the trends of morbidity among older adults have been proposed. The first is the compression of morbidity hypothesis [9, 10] , which states that the age of onset of morbidity or disability can rise more rapidly than life expectancy (LE) [11] , thus resulting in a shorter period of morbidity prior to death. A contrasting theory, the expansion of disability hypothesis, posits that reductions in mortality (and thus, increases in LE) may result in a shift in frailty over successive cohorts, as individuals with worse health are now likely to survive longer than they would have in the past [12, 13] , resulting in populations of older individuals with higher rates of disability in older ages [12] [13] [14] [15] . Importantly, both of these theoretical viewpoints are focused primarily on understanding trends in morbidity and mortality among older adults ages 65-80, where the bulk of each occurs in most populations [11] . The ways in which these theoretical frameworks function in the oldest-old populations are unclear, as these high-longevity individuals have already far outlived their cohort's LEs. In addition, these two viewpoints are not necessarily opposing-different sub-populations may experience expansions or compression of morbidity at the same time [16, 17] , and different facets of health (disability, chronic diseases/multimorbidity, cognitive ability) may change in different directions across cohorts [16] [17] [18] .",18.317832114280762,9.643440992329046

We do not have a good estimate of the total species diversity of mammalian and avian viruses; however, we can get an indirect indication of the magnitude of the barrier between level 1 and level 2.

Critchlow 2010, personal communication) that of the virus species known to infect domestic animals (livestock and companion animals)-to which humans are presumably routinely exposed-roughly one-third are also capable of infecting humans. The species barrier exists: but it is clearly very leaky. Based on data from [25] , roughly 50 per cent of the viruses that can infect humans can also be transmitted by humans (level 3), and roughly 50 per cent of those are sufficiently transmissible that R 0 may exceed one (level 4). That a significant minority of (mammalian or avian) viruses should be capable of extensive spread within human populations (or of rapidly becoming so [35] ) is consistent with experience: there are several examples within the past hundred years alone (HIV-1, SARS, plus variants of influenza A) and many more in the past few millennia (e.g. measles, mumps, rubella, smallpox). It is noteworthy that the 'shape' of the pathogen pyramid for viruses is very different to that for other kinds of pathogen (bacteria, fungi, protozoa or helminths), of which much smaller fractions are capable of extensive spread in human populations (data from [25] ). The most straightforward explanation for this is the much more rapid evolution of viruses (especially RNA viruses), allowing them to adapt to a new (human) host much more quickly than other kinds of pathogen.",18.131128269437383,6.5406881063443425

China's health assistance has been perceived by some as opportunistic, largely as a demonstration of China's engagement in ""soft power"" and an attempt to enhance its access to natural resources and political favors by African countries. Others have attributed altruistic intent, aiming to support the advancement of the health of populations in the African continent with a ""no strings attached"" approach. Our overview demonstrated that despite the magnitude of China's health assistance, many questions remain regarding the scope of this aid, its effectiveness and the governance mechanisms that guide the conceptualization and implementation of such efforts. We also identified the need for a systematic and rigorous evaluation of the various elements of China's health assistance to African countries in order to gain a deeper understanding of how priorities and allocations for health aid are determined, how such aid fits within the specific African country's health strategies and to assess the effectiveness of such aid.

Despite the use of approved drugs for unindicated uses being a common and necessary practice in most settings, it is a practice that is not formally regulated, nor formally condoned, in many settings. The US FDA, however, has attempted to clarify the legitimacy of this practice by explicitly condoning the use of approved drugs for unindicated uses in prescribed circumstances. The FDA has noted that ""once a [drug] product has been approved for marketing, a physician may prescribe it for uses or in treatment regimens or patient populations that are not included in approved labeling"" and that ""unapproved"" or ""unlabeled"" uses may be appropriate and rational in certain circumstances [20] . Given this regulatory permissibility, some US scientists have postulated using drugs that have already been approved for the treatment of other diseases for the treatment of Ebola [21] . They argue that unlike experimental Ebola treatments, immunomodulatory drugs have already been approved (thus obviating the need for safety studies), are currently being produced as inexpensive generics, and are available even to countries with basic health care systems. While this proposal has yet to win WHO endorsement, it illustrates the value of having a regulatory regime that permits off-label clinical use outside of an EUA directive. Such an approach may allow for the use of the anti-influenza drug Favipiravir (T-705) as an emergency off-label anti-Ebola agent [22] , as is currently the case in France [23] , notwithstanding its planned testing as an anti-Ebola agent under clinical trial conditions.",19.41977919007325,6.796922716525637

The spatial heterogenity of populations, however, contributes to the dynamics of spread, and the availability of spatially-indexed mobility and disease data is increasing. Models that incorporate space may therefore provide better explanations for observed epidemiology and more accurate predictions of future outbreaks. Similarly, control interventions may be spatial in nature; for example, the imposition of quarantine zones, or culling of livestock around infected farms [17, 18] .

As shown in Table 1 , school closure alone was not particularly effective, but when combined with home quarantine, it reduced the total number of cases more than the sum of these two control measures alone. It should be noted that although the three control measures are applicable to different levels of aggregation (refraining from social activity is applicable to individuals, household quarantine is applicable to all members within households and school closure is applicable to all students), they are not independent of each other. For example, individuals under household quarantine automatically refrain from social activities, and students under household quarantine do not go to school. The overlap between control measures may explain the enhancing effect of combining measures. The combination of non-pharmaceutical measures with pharmaceutical measures needs to be investigated in the future, particularly as for infectious diseases with large R 0 , the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical measures was shown to be limited. ISTAM is a novel model for simulating the transmission of infectious disease. The two-level structure (separating between-AB and within-AB activities) makes ISTAM flexible such that it can be applied to novel circumstances. The concept of AB plays a key role: both the building of individual activity patterns and simulation within ABs depends on how well the ABs are defined and classified. The merits of simulation by ISTAM are: (1) ISTAM is straightforward and provides a process-based representation of the real world, (2) using ISTAM, it is easy to account for important factors, neglect less important factors and include random factors in the model and (3) ISTAM facilitates the modelling of human actions (both active and reactive) and the interaction between humans at fine scales. ISTAM, if fed with activity pattern data, can simulate effectively individuals' movements at between-AB and within-AB levels. Providing data sources are sufficient, the model can be extended readily to larger study areas although the effort involved in data collection and model implementation is likely to be substantial and timeconsuming.",20.132706670718296,9.775502578481948

This represents a fundamental shift from treating incoming mobility as exerting a force of infection on the resident population, to treating the resident and transient populations as distinct groups with disparate risks of infection.",18.222995145333037,8.784947204713303

Research on biobanks and medical databases provide opportunities for a broad spectrum of interests and applications in translational bioinformatics (TBI). Many countries plan to invest in health IT research by constructing biobanks and health information databases [1] . These projects make rapid improvements in this field. The ethical, legal and social needs of studies are integral concerns of the entire scientific community. A significant bioinformatics infrastructure effort that aims to construct high-capacity public health information databases is underway in Europe and the United States. For example, Biobank Norway will spend more than 13 million USD on the establishment of a biobank-based research infrastructure [2] . Many similar joint efforts on biobank infrastructure and research are available, in which governments around the world fund activities. Population-based health surveys and research biobanks gain much attention from TBI researchers and substantial international funding, such as the National Institute of Health in the United States, which is the largest funder of basic biomedical research in the world. Investments in the public health system enable large-scale surveys on medical issues to collect data and biological materials from large populations. The results of these surveys with the corresponding biomedical data or samples often turn into international open resources for TBI research. The Janus Serum Bank is an example of a useful biobank [3] . In this biobank, which includes 170,000 clinical samples, blood samples reserved for cancer research were collected through Norwegian health screening studies. Researchers in the field of biology, medical science, bioinformatics and health care systems will benefit from those types of biomedical databases and biobanks.

Unfortunately, currently prevailing models prioritize 'blockbuster products' that do not necessarily recognize a health rights framework or public health approach, and grossly fail to address population needs, especially for resource-limited settings, and are poorly suited for timely response to outbreak conditions [31] . Folayan et al. describe four major processes required to conduct research in resource-limited settings during outbreak conditions, including local access to products developed as a result of the research, capacity transfer to local researchers, development of competent local ethics committees, and empowerment of community members to actively engage in research design and implementation [90] . Public health organizations should work with the academic community to guide research priorities by taking into account the public health impact. In response to previous global health emergencies, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC) have collaborated to develop modular standard case report forms that can be used in multiple settings to promote faster data collection during infectious disease outbreaks [91] . A severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) observational study is being conducted globally in collaboration with ISARIC, the International Forum of Acute Care Trialists and the Platform for European Preparedness Against (Re-)emerging Epidemics to test the global research response capacity, estimate global SARI incidence, and understand barriers to the research processes [92] .",21.693575273584166,10.234267125249698

Overall poliomyelitis vaccination rates are high in both Cyprus and Poland (97 and 92%, respectively for the three doses, according to 2015 data [25] ), but both countries nonetheless have relatively small but still significant numbers of refugees and populations that are hard to reach in vaccination campaigns (e.g. Roma people) and which are therefore vulnerable in case of a poliomyelitis virus outbreak. Under such circumstances it is important to have well-functioning surveillance systems in place in order to identify potential poliomyelitis cases. Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) surveillance is regarded as the gold standard for detecting cases of poliomyelitis [26] ; it involves finding and reporting children with AFP; transporting stool samples for analysis; isolating and identifying poliovirus in the laboratory; and mapping the virus to determine the origin of the virus strain. According to WHO guidelines, environmental surveillance can be justified in some specific situations in addition to AFP surveillance [27] . Environmental surveillance involves testing sewage or other environmental samples for the presence of poliovirus [28] . Both countries have AFP surveillance systems in place.

We show the utility of the plug-and-play approach in the context of an investigation of measles transmission dynamics. Our novel methodology enables us to ask and answer questions that previous analyses have been unable to address. Specifically, we demonstrate that plug-and-play methods permit the development of a modelling and inference framework applicable to data from both large and small populations.

These results support an overwhelming risk from an EVD outbreak. The SIR model also indicated that the s, i, and r populations fluctuate periodically around their dynamic equilibrium points. These results support the idea EVD epidemics may break out periodically, though the disease will reach a dynamic equilibrium point with a shorter period between epidemics of progressively weaker intensity.

For example, adopt a diffusion approximation to enable successful implementation of a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach; this approximation breaks down in small populations. On the other hand, straightforward Bayesian approaches have been demonstrated for small populations with purely demographic stochasticity (Gibson & Renshaw 1998 ; however, these methods break down for large populations (Roberts & Stramer 2001; Beskos et al. 2006) or when environmental stochasticity is non-negligible ). Finally, exact methods based on numerical solution of the so-called master equations (Keeling & Ross 2008) are available, but limited to low-dimensional models and small populations.

However, as the value of preparation in generic TC skills is further demonstrated through student assessment, modeling by clinician mentors, mistake avoidance, [184] patient satisfaction, quality assurance, and reduced health disparities, the future physician's intrinsic human and professional motivation [202] to interact ever more effectively on behalf of ethnoculturally and socioeconomically unfamiliar and disadvantaged patients will provide the foundation for, and facilitate openness to, the development of personal transnational competence in migrant-health care.",18.981706736265135,9.077796297493059

This article discusses the lessons learnt with regard to health-related poverty alleviation in China with special reference to those still remaining impoverished by illness. Consolidation of the achievements reached and provision of basic needs to those still disadvantaged and in poor health will require a major improvement of accessibility to, and affordability of, health services.

Application of information technology and data science, like real time data acquisition, geospatial epidemiological modelling, big data analytics, and machine learning technology, in field of epidemiology paves the way to its transformation to digital epidemiology, which is conceptually more accurate and precise in nature [8, 9] .",18.770234116054503,9.422718134371365

Our sequence data were generated by different production systems that differ in number of farms, number of samples submitted, management practices, and health monitoring protocols. Because of that, information may be incomplete and interpretation of data might not always be straightforward. For example, the reason for sample collection (clinical outbreak or routine monitoring), sample composition (single versus pool of animals) and type of sample (serum or tissues) is not always clear. The lack of a denominator (total amount of animals sampled in a farm, total number of farms tested) does not allow for the calculation of risk indicators for disease occurrence. Data contribution by each system also varies with time. However, restricting the data to only the periods in which all systems contributed to the dataset would limit our ability to visualize long-term trends.

This model replaces the earlier 'epidemiologic triad' and 'causal web' models of disease risk, which paid inadequate attention to the multidimensional quality of factors that affect health and disease (27) , particularly the cultural, political, and economic factors that act as ultimate causes of disease (28, 29) . Instead, the socioecological model recognizes that a broad array of systems and interrelated determinants of health exist, acting either synergistically or antagonistically (16) . The model vertically expands the domain of epidemiological studies 'upward' to incorporate biological, behavioral, mental, social, and environmental systems and factors (such as policy and economic environments) as well as 'downward' to the molecular and genetic levels. Additionally, it extends the domain horizontally to consider trends over time, ranging from the developmental issues addressed by life course epidemiology to evolving associations among the various levels (16: 6). Epidemiologic transition theory provides the broad, longitudinal, and historical perspectives that the early models lacked (16) . In epidemiology, the increasing adoption of and reliance upon socioecological models has also opened up a spectrum of possibilities for investigations of disease risk that include social, cultural, policy, and economic factors, as well as how these factors have changed over time (5, 16) . The unique capacity of epidemiologic transition theory to identify ultimate causes in disease risk means that transition theory models can be usefully incorporated into socioecological models in epidemiology. As Fleischer and McKeown (16: 10) discuss, such incorporation would be particularly useful for social epidemiologists because it would shed additional light on the ways in which 'upstream', global determinants differentially impact the health-states of vulnerable, disadvantaged populations. Although the focus on singular disease conditions, their risk factors, and proximate causes is useful in some investigations, epidemiologists are gradually recognizing that addressing patterns of health-states might yield greater insights into more upstream, shared determinants and therefore have a profound impact upon population health (16) .",25.03372883249442,10.891435317269881

In the wake of Brexit and the 2016 United States (US) election, a new uncertainty has set in about whether the United Kingdom (UK) and the US will maintain their historic levels of support for global health research initiatives (Greenwood 2018) . Global development assistance for health has grown by only 1.2% annually since 2010, a sharp drop from the 11.3% annual increases seen throughout the 2000s, and continued limitations on growth are expected (Dieleman et al. 2016) . Globally, public funding of global health research has declined since the global financial crisis of 2008 (Chapman et al. 2016) ; existing analyses show that only a small percentage of global health research funds are allocated towards epidemiology and health policy and systems research, which is context-specific research that is especially important for LMICs (Abimbola et al. 2017) . Many observers worry about continued reductions in research funding opportunities for global health, as populist pressures may encourage countries to shift resources towards domestic priorities (Morrison 2012) . This global shortfall runs counter to the ""convergence plan"" of The Lancet's Global Health 2035 Commission, which calls for doubling research funding for diseases that disproportionately affect LMICs from US$3 billion to US$6 billion per year so that health status in LMICs can catch up to HICs within a generation (Ramesh 2013) .

Most studies of bronchiectasis don't specifically include dedicated fungal culture and most published reports are based on their incidental detection. As documented by recently published 'research priorities in bronchiectasis' from the EMBARC collaboration, work addressing fungi is both necessary and of importance in bronchiectasis [121] . A Spanish study reports that Aspergillus and Candida spp. together contribute the highest proportion of fungi isolated by culture from the bronchiectasis airway. Within the Aspergillus genus, A. fumigatus is the most common coloniser and other filamentous fungi such as Penicillium, Scedosporium and Fusarium are less frequently seen. Critically, chronic antibiotic use in this work was associated with prolonged colonisation by these fungi [82] . Data from the US bronchiectasis research registry (n = 1826) reports an incidence of 19% of Aspergillus spp. in their population [55] Two separate studies from the UK illustrate that A. fumigatus colonisation and/or sensitisation is positively correlated with NTM occurrence. The co-existence of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis and NTM infection predicts mortality in bronchiectasis [122, 123] . Culture-based identification, part of the routine diagnostic microbiology work up in bronchiectasis is inefficient for fungal detection because most fungal species do not grow on common laboratory media [124] . To overcome this, work employing next-generation sequencing (NGS) such as targeted amplicon sequencing and whole-genome shotgun metagenomics may reveal the true diversity of fungal microorganisms within the microbiome that may colonise and contribute to pulmonary pathology in bronchiectasis and as such should be a focus for future work [103, 104, 125] .

These species are ideal to monitor vector-borne diseases. In addition, wild caninds adapted to the human condition host innumerable parasites, bacteria and viruses, which in turn may contribute to density-dependent mortality.

The poor landscape mapping, rural and urban town planning, and especially the poor or nonexistent accessible roads to these communities are other contributing factors.

These relationships are critical for reliable and effective Emergency outbreak response and follow up epidemiological investigation, and for evidence policy-building regardless of the type of intervention [20, 21] . 2. Nurturing ""One Health and One world"" surveillance and response systems Infectious diseases primarily affecting animals can have direct and indirect impacts on humans including significant economic consequences. Two important factors can contribute to the proliferation of zoonotic diseases: the explosive growth of human and domestic animal populations, and the increasingly close physical proximity within which humans and domestic and wild animals live [6, 20] . Timely identification of current and future emerging microbial threats (on the order of SARS, the West Nile virus, and H5N1 avian influenza) will require an integrated international approach to disease surveillance. However, progress has been hampered by a variety of mining, environmental, climatic, socioeconomic, and political factors, in addition to a weak and fragile or nonexistent surveillance infrastructure and technology, and inadequate expertise in Africa. Success in Ebola control and containment requires a comprehensive and integrated strategy in human disease surveillance among the underserved populations that live in close contact with bat fruits, gorillas, and other wildlife animals. This strategy should incorporate capacity building, training, and empowerment of the local community by integrating simple data collection with basic laboratory diagnosis to identify the link between human outbreaks of the Ebola virus, and poaching, the consumption of bush meats, basic hygiene measures such as hand washing and cooking meat thoroughly, overall food safety in communities, and early warning of outbreaks in animals [20] .",19.275149608520437,9.504124608341574

This provides evidence that ring vaccination methods, such as those trialled in Guinea [45] , may be an effective way of delivering vaccines against Ebola in the context of limited supply or in hard-to-reach populations. Hospitalisation was found to be protective, but left substantial room for improvement. The association between reported funeral attendance and district-level epidemic trends highlights the continued need for improving access to and acceptability of safe burials of Ebola cases. More robust associations could be detected using case-control studies, but these are hard to coordinate during an emergency situation. In their absence, the analyses reported here have already provided key insights into the drivers of the epidemic. Heterogeneities in transmission made the road to Ebola elimination likely to be marked by episodic flare-ups [46, 47] . Ebola is controllable using the simple measures that have already been implemented in this outbreak, but complacency as case numbers decline could prolong the epidemic for months. Continued real-time data capture, reporting, and analysis are vital to track transmission patterns, inform resource deployment, and thus hasten elimination of the virus from the human population.

A conceptual framework for understanding a reservoir of infection has been established through various studies that have emphasized different aspects of zoonotic diseases. 1-4 However, empirical characterization of reservoirs often remains controversial and challenging. The most applicable and accepted way to investigate and define a reservoir emphasizes the annotation of a target group (Figure 1) , which is an explicitly defined population of interest in a dynamic and heterogeneous landscape (for example, humans at the livestock-wildlife-human interface). 4, 5 According to Haydon et al., 4 the target group is a matter of definition and may therefore be disconnected from the ecological reality. The target group provides a directionality to the study of a reservoir system. All other susceptible populations (non-target populations), which directly or indirectly connect epidemiologically to the target (Figures 1 and 2) , can be part of the potential reservoir. 4 For a non-target population to be considered an accepted functional reservoir, maintenance of a single pathogen in the population needs to be shown in combination with a feasible transmission route between the target and non-target populations. 4 Although the conceptual framework of a disease reservoir is already well-defined, applicable requirements for an evidence-based rejection or acceptance of a reservoir are currently missing. In particular, interdisciplinary standards on genetic and functional similarities of reservoir and human isolates of pathogens are nonexistent. Considering the increase in interdisciplinary research, we see the need to critically discuss and standardize the use of the term 'reservoir of infection' across different research fields to oppose the tendency of published scientific data to exaggerate positive results and hype certain areas of science. 6,7 Although we do not claim absolute standardization of empirical requirements to accept a reservoir across disciplines, we present a framework to serve as a basis for a pending discussion in the growing One Health community. The simplicity and functional orientation of the presented framework allows for straightforward application but does not negate more complex populations, as the same principles can be applied to multi-species systems and metapopulations ( Figure 2 ).",22.647741680452835,8.694650428283575

These policies drive away stigmatized subgroups and make it harder to engage them in the vital therapeutic and prevention alliances that enable implementation of successful health programs. Just as some health ministries outside the MENA region have adopted best practices from countries like Iran and Morocco, 5 the MENA region could also learn lessons from countries with similar cultural conditions on how to best engage and reduce high-risk behaviors among key populations within their borders. One notable example comes from Nigeria, where homosexuality remains criminalized, 19 yet also has well-established programs that collect data from and provides services to MSM populations. 20 Given the cultural climate and standing laws in Nigeria, it is not surprising that this group has been difficult to contact, trace and recruit into research and treatment cohorts. Hence, researchers and public health practitioners have recruited key community leaders to lead the outreach efforts to members of their communities. It is likely that, in MENA countries, high-risk social and sexual networks are also best accessed and followed with the help of community leaders and/or peers already integrated into these networks; and that these efforts can be best operationalized with respondent-driven sampling, snowball sampling strategies or post-testing counseling of newly diagnosed persons.",17.617884714888184,8.501249805907733

A connection between the target and the non-target populations must be established; 4 otherwise the non-target population remains a maintenance population with the potential to be a reservoir. Therefore, the determination of a feasible and somewhat permanent transmission route between the non-target and target populations is key to identifying a reservoir system (Figure 1 ). For multi-species reservoir systems, the transmission route between the target and non-target populations may be indirect (Figure 2 , connection between b and target), possibly incorporating different hierarchical levels of a nontarget community. 4, 61 The type of transmission route dictates the form of evidence needed to prove that a feasible transmission route exists between the reservoir and target. For simplicity, we define vectors as part of the transmission route, although under certain circumstances (for example, permanency or substantial amplification in the vector), they may act as part of the non-target community. 61 Four basic requirements need to be met to make a compelling argument for the existence of a feasible transmission route: (i) spatial (direct or indirect) and temporal connectivity between the reservoir system and the target population, (ii) pathogen involvement in this feasible transmission route, (iii) proof of viability of the pathogen during the proposed transmission route and (iv) a longitudinal approach that requires the isolation of a pathogen multiple times in a given transmission route (Table 1) .",19.073639822560004,8.112335176661718

Applied research should increase our understanding of the health system needs of schistosomiasis control, while development strengthens the capacity of the health system to meet the needs of disease control. In so doing, there are four important considerations. a) An important theme running through this paper is to shift away from the commercialisation of the public sector and move towards strengthening of the role and integrity of the public sector in schistosomiasis disease control. This is apparent in the strengthening of policy-making in government, intersectoral action for health, the importance of equity as a key value, the access to treatment, the provision of public goods and the strengthening of resource management and planning. These need to be broken down into specific measures, such as strengthening surveillance systems, urban and rural health insurance, and funding for public goods and services. b) An underlying value of the whole approach to the control of schistosomiasis is that of equity. On the one hand, this requires a reaffirmation of public service values around health systems based on improved and more equitable health and health care. On the other, it is a disease of poverty, the control of which needs to get to the foundations of that poverty.",20.462997254834107,8.931440242118573

Rather than choose two inbred lines or two phenotypically divergent individuals as founders of a genetic reference panel (recombinant inbreds), choose eight, or 25. Using multiple lines as founders of a set of inbred lines whose haplotypes can be replicated has been referred to as Interconnected populations multi-parent, advanced-generation inter-cross design, Complex Cross, and multi-parental RIL.

Additionally, other unexpected pathogens such as Anaplasma spp. and B. quintana (an agent causing Trench fever) were detected among UFI patients as well as Bor. miyamotoi in rodent populations. However, to date in-depth analyses as to how, when and where transmission occurs are lacking. Human, animal, and vector interactions play a major role in disease transmission and form a dynamic transmission cycle. Pathogens can spread from animal-toanimal or animal-to-human by several modes of transmission. Probably the most important method of transmission occurs during feeding by parasitic arthropods. This study employed NGS and metagenomics to characterize bacterial pathogens and understand their transmission in animal, human, and vector populations. Several pathogens were detected in rodent and vector populations indicating the complex ecology of bacterial pathogens and their reservoir hosts and vectors in the area close to where human activities occur which increase the risk of human-animal interface. The most apparent example is scrub typhus where O. tsutsugamushi was found in UFI patients, chiggers, and rodent populations. These data clearly illustrate the complex picture of pathogen transmission from animal reservoir hosts to humans via arthropod vectors. Local public health officials can effectively use the data to assist in understanding the seasonality of diseases such as scrub typhus and the populations most at risk. Information can be shared locally and preventive measures, such as repellents, can be used when appropriate. From this study, multiple bacterial pathogens known to cause human diseases in other locations were identified for the first time in Nan province.

Maximal cliques represent groups of populations in which all populations have similar allele compositions to each other. Then, mean genetic distance within each clique was calculated. The clique with the lowest average distance was selected and its populations were grouped together. Then, this clique was deleted from the network. Iterations were repeated until no maximal cliques remained in the network. Grouping of populations was carried out using different distance value cutoffs (1st, 5th, 10th, and 15th rank percentile of all distance values).

First, scarce genomic data are available for NAF populations in public databases (Henn et al. 2012) . As a consequence, there was limited overlap in SNP contents with the SNP array utilized, leaving us with as few as 114,567 SNPs for some components of the study. This circumstance forced us to use 1KGP population references to maximize SNP density in the comparisons. Along with the number of generations since admixture and the ascertained nature of the contents of the array, these conditions likely had direct impacts on the local ancestry estimates, the average lengths and the regions identified by the admixture scan. However, further studies will aim to improve this overlap by further WGS and/or SNP array genotyping of novel NAF samples to be able to refine future scans. The regions identified by the admixture scan are relatively wide, on the order of several Mb, which limits the precise allocation of ancestry peaks. Therefore, the genes highlighted by proximity to the detected peaks should be considered with caution. In this respect, the final data set had low or no coverage of centrosomes, offering no basis for local ancestry inference in those regions. Although this situation would have affected all ancestries equally, we excluded those regions from the analysis to avoid an upward bias in the average block length measures. Furthermore, the choice of reference populations for ancestry inference is a common concern in these studies. In our case, we balanced choosing a reference data set with sufficient genetic resolution to retain the minimal number of SNPs required for the analyses (>100K) with the use of EUR or SSA populations where NAF or Near East influences were absent or minimal, as both factors hamper local NAF ancestry inferences. In any case, a ubiquitous Berber substrate was recently found in both pre-Hispanic remains from the aboriginal Guanche people and samples from modern NAF populations, supporting a close genetic affinity between these populations (Rodr ıguez-Varela et al. 2017). Finally, even in the ideal scenario of having access to population data sets from all over the world, most natural populations are expected to represent heterogeneous groups as well. This heterogeneity was the justification for considering all available NAF data sets as a single population source in the model. However, we admit that the reference population sources utilized in the study constitute model simplifications.",18.582057917971024,8.049576535523448

While most studies on infectious disease ecology focus on the dynamics of a single host species and single pathogen, we acknowledge that more research is needed to address the complexities of multi host-pathogen dynamics [148] . Community ecology, with its emphasis on the composition of and interconnections between ecological communities, allows one to understand infectious disease dynamics in multi-pathogen, multi-host disease systems that occur across diverse scales (e.g., from within a single host, to between species, to between regions) [148] . Other topics of importance deserving further study in bat species of Western Asia include: effects of extreme weather (e.g., heat waves) on bat survival, including changes in the distribution of bat species (and associated pathogens) and changes in prey abundance or food resources that could alter reproductive patterns and disease transmission [149, 150] . For example, increased prevalence of Marburg virus (MARV) in Rousettus aegyptiacus colonies corresponded with defined periods of synchronized parturition (which resulted in an influx of immunologically-naive, juvenile bats), as well as an increased incidence of spillover into human populations [77] . If such virus-host associations exist in regional bat species, climatic changes may affect reproductive phenology in bats, and therefore the timing of peak viral spillover into human populations. A systems-wide, hypothesis-driven approach will allow for better identification of emerging disease risk factors, and more effective policy recommendations for reducing the disease transmission and spread [146, 148] .",16.621786596691692,9.051878286213308

If they are not shown to be cost eff ective, newer technologies must be developed that are. Clearly any policy or strategy that is developed needs careful risk assessment to ensure that low-income countries do not suff er from unfair trade restrictions, and that development, food prices, or food availability are not compromised. A careful balance must be struck between positive measures (access to increased funding) and negative measures (increased regulation). The World Bank estimates that the annual funding needed for 60 low-income and 79 middle-income countries to bring their animal infection prevention and control systems up to OIE and WHO standards ranges from $1·9 billion to $3·4 billion. 29, 61 To broaden the funding base outside the traditional donor base for one-health research and improve control strategies at the animal-human interface, high-income countries that are large livestock and poultry importers and exporters should be encouraged to contribute more to these eff orts. Although much of the work on global pandemic preparedness has focused on infl uenza viruses, there are parallels and lessons to be learned from global responses to other zoonotic viral infections that have spread in recent years outside their geographical zones as illustrated by Rift Valley fever. 62 Following the outbreak of Rift Valley fever, an arthropod-borne zoonotic EID in Saudi Arabia in 2000the fi rst such occurrence outside of Africa-there was a ban on imports of live animals from Somalia until 2009. The ban was only partly eff ective with animals from Somalia crossing to Saudi Arabia through other intermediate countries. Upgrading of port quarantine and livestock export facilities at Bossasso and Berbera, through Saudi investment in ensuing years, however, ensured that Somalia was able to export animals to more countries and gave importing countries the reassurance that animals being purchased were disease free and operations were in compliance with international OIE standards.

Keeping in mind that the equation inbred = low phenotypic variability can be misleading (Phelan and Austad, 1994) , in any case the characteristics of biological material are assumed to be maintained strictly constant between different populations of the same strain (low between-populations variability). We purposely avoid discussions about the causal factors explaining our results: the main point of this article is not to explain why, but to measure how much different populations of the same strain can differ in their life expectancy. The populations we analyzed can be considered.a typical sample of the biological material used in aging research: the animals were kept in SPF conditions by Charles River and by our Institute, they experienced the same dietary conditions throughout their life (during his life span a rat experiences at least 10 different food lots, so this source of variability cannot generate any systematic differences between populations). Other noncontrollable variations regarding holding sites, etc. during the 7 years of the overall duration of the study were randomly scattered among the populations: so it is extremely difficult (and perhaps without any real meaning) to emphasize one or more of these variations as causal factors of the observed variability.

It is therefore imperative that domestic dogs are prevented as far as possible from entering conservation areas that provide a refuge for wild and endangered canids; however it is not always possible to prevent incursions by domestic dogs into such areas. Evidence suggests that rabies risks to people and wild carnivores might be controlled by targeted vaccination of the reservoir host . Hampson et al. (2009) showed that 70% annual vaccination coverage is recommended as the target to ensure long term elimination of rabies in almost all demographic settings, including those with high population turnover; however data did show successful control of the disease at low levels of coverage (30-50%) for short term control, but turnover of domestic dogs in rural areas is high and therefore where vaccinations are carried out in pulses this turnover reduces herd immunity. Regular preventative vaccination programmes of domestic animal populations should be considered in communities surrounding conservation areas that are vulnerable to edge effects and anthropogenic pressures. This is the most sustainable, practical and cost effective long-term approach to protect wild dogs from rabies infection at the source (Flacke et al., 2013; Taylor & Nel, 2015) .

We do not attempt to give a comprehensive overview of this, but rather refer the interested reader to Anderson and Britton (2000) and Becker and Britton (1999) and references therein. Perhaps the most simple of these methods is the Reed Frost model which is appropriate for analyzing data from small epidemics, particularly from small group data, such as a household. This model rapidly becomes complicated as the size of the epidemic increases, restricting its utility to small outbreaks. More general modeling approaches exist that allow for larger populations, and inhomogeneous populations. These more general models can be generally used to estimate the final size of an epidemic and R 0 . Becker (1989) , Rida (1991) and Shao (1999) describe some approaches to these models. Becker (1976) and Ball and Donnelly (1995) describe how the initial period of a stochastic SIR model can be estimated by a branching process. Branching processes have been widely studied and their theory is well developed (see Guttorp, 1991 and references therein) . Estimation of R 0 is relatively simple with a branching process and one can also obtain estimates of the final size of the epidemic, as well as the probability of observing a major epidemic (defined as an epidemic that does not die out on its own). To implement this method one needs to know the mean of the serial interval, or have an epidemic with a long incubation time, which leads to clearly clustered data that can then be grouped into",20.424336438250876,10.068627764488575

In ecology, the predatorprey interactions have a long history and understanding the dynamics of such systems is the most interesting research topic among the scientists across the world. The study of eco-epidemiological systems is the investigation of ecological systems in the presence of epidemiological factors. In this regard, Anderson and May [5] were the first who paved the way of merging ecological and epidemiological systems. The term 'eco-epidemiology' was coined for such systems by Chattopadhyay and Arino [6] . Afterwards, the study of eco-epidemiological models and their biological significances have gained much attention among the researchers [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . In nature, species do not survive alone, they compete with the other species in the environment for space, food and predation. Understanding the effect of parasites on biodiversity and ecosystem dynamics is an important issue in conservation biology. The dynamics of host population can be regulated by disease, and also depend on the other members of the host's community, such as predators. Moreover, the shape and the community structure of an ecosystem can be dramatically changed by the predatory activities. The invasion of parasites into the host population may be prevented by predators. Due to these facts, the research on eco-epidemiological systems has become more important issue among the scientists worldwide.

It thus allows a holistic view on complex biological systems and to set up improved biological models, particularly if several different experimental parameters are integrated (for example protein interaction and expression profiling data). Although Systems biology is usually based on screening assays and thus starts without bias, in contrast to hypothesis-driven research, in most cases it eventually leads to a multitude of novel working hypotheses. Particularly interesting are hypotheses derived from bioinformatic concepts like network emergence, robustness and modularity, since it is currently completely unclear if and how they translate into biology. Systems biology-based approaches in infectious diseases are even more complex, as they investigate the interactions between the components of two distinct biological systems, pathogen and host. On the host side, cellular components which directly deal with the control of the infection, i.e. the innate and adaptive immune system, are of particular interest. For the understanding of the pathogenesis, pathogen products counteracting these cellular components are similarly important. By integrating all components of the immune system, Systems biology-based approaches might be able to generate better disease models than previous reductionist approaches focusing on only one or few pathogenic aspects.

The early response of the CD13 − cells was characterized by IL-10 secretion. However, both populations of DC did not produce type I interferon (IFN␣ or ␤). It is difficult to assess what role these DC may play in innate immunity to vaccination or infection since the cytokine profile arising from prolonged stimulation appears to promote Th1 type (both cell types produced IL-12) of immune response, i.e., suited to activation of adaptive rather than innate immune responses. There is a level of plasticity retained in these DC populations that may allow them to stimulate either Th1 or Th2 responses depending on the conditions of the initial stimulatory signals or these subsets of DCs may be integral to one or the other T helper cell response.

Circumstances facilitating spillover include direct contact with bats (bites, scratches, consumption of bats), contact with material contaminated by bat saliva, faeces or urine and amplification via intermediate hosts such as domestic animals or other wildlife species. Conservational actions are not only important to prevent spillovers, but also because emerging zoonotic viruses often lead to persecution of bats. In order to reduce the transmission risk of viruses from bats to human and livestock and to protect bat species at threat, educational efforts are needed. However, entrenched cultural and social components often act as barriers to efficient changes on how people think about and respond to bats. Whenever possible, educational efforts should be done in an informative, non-lurid way, presenting the facts rather than provoking additional fears to the already bad reputation of bats. Wherever possible, solutions should be found to enable the existence of bats in anthropogenic landscape, including the development of more affordable and readily available vaccinations (e.g. against rabies), and the reduction of potential contact between bats and humans and livestock. This however also includes that the natural habitats of bats need to be better protected to provide bat populations with sufficient space and to prevent range expansion into urban and suburban areas, where contact with humans and livestock may increase the risk of spillover events. Bat-borne viruses should be considered during bat conservation efforts, and it should be equally noticed that appropriate conservation measures may even reduce the risk of viral spillover from bat populations into human populations.",17.845634204735727,8.450849354174366

Living systems are hierarchically structured, where the traits of individuals arise from the interpretation of the environment by genes (so called genotype-phenotype maps; (Houle et al., 2010) ). Individuals interact within populations, where average trait values change through evolutionary and environmental processes (Burns, 1992; Frank, 2011; Pedersen and Tuomi, 1995) , and populations interact and evolve within multi-species communities (Weber et al., 2017) . As a result of this hierarchical structure, human activities affecting one level of biological organization can have unanticipated outcomes at another level (Gunderson and Holling, 2002; Melián et al., 2018) . For example, human activities that affect gene flow among populations can lead to the introduction of either beneficial alleles that help populations adapt to changing environments, or deleterious alleles that contribute to maladaptation of natural populations and thereby can potentially hinder conservation efforts (Leitwein et al., 2019) . Despite the long held view that evolution is a slow process, it is now well established that the pace of heritable trait change can be sufficiently fast to affect population dynamics, species interactions, and ecosystem processes -i.e. evolution can act at ecological time scales (Hairston et al., 2005; Stockwell et al., 2003) . The dynamics of species interactions in natural communities are hence not simply a product of past evolution. Rather, evolutionary processes can shape trait distributions of populations (i.e. mean and variance) at a pace that is highly relevant for many environmental problems.",19.167150457261542,8.05344039732763

In addition, the nature of the work undertaken by the mili tary and the environment in which it operates are likely to influence how and when MCMs are administered. For example, the military may consider immunizing troops with a new vaccine prior to deployment as the most effective means of protecting individuals and ensuring operational effectiveness in a high-risk environment. In contrast, the civilian authorities are more likely to treat with antibiotics after an outbreak has occurred rather than vaccinate large numbers of the public against a disease with a very low likelihood of a deliberate release (albeit very high impact), such as anthrax.",26.574245384173018,12.319863319191086

While this number is low, the worrisome features of the disease are its propensity to cause severe disease in patients with underlying conditions, including diabetes, renal disease, lung disease, or an immunocompromised state, and its apparent ability to readily spread within hospital settings. 2 In addition, MERS-CoV has been identified in camel populations throughout the Arabian Peninsula and Africa, [3] [4] [5] and epidemiological evidence suggests that it is periodically introduced into human populations. 6 Further, coronaviruses have a well-described propensity to mutate and recombine. 7 Consistent with this propensity, the genomic sequence of MERS-CoV has changed since it first entered human populations in 2012, but these changes have not enhanced the ability to effect human-tohuman transmission. 8 This lack of increased transmissibility is encouraging, but, on the other hand, the continued introduction into human populations from infected camels coupled with coronavirus mutability means that measures to prevent infection are important to develop anticipatorily.",16.20655458222518,8.600073218025182

This provides a comprehensive prologue to the overview of the coupled systems on networks in Section 3. Within the latter, we separately review dynamics in different types of networked populations, which are frequently viewed through the lens of physical phenomena (such as phase transitions and pattern formation) and analyzed with physicsbased methods (like Monte Carlo simulation, mean-field prediction). Based on all these achievements, we can capture how coupled disease-behavior dynamics affects disease transmission and spatial contact patterns. Section 4 will be devoted to empirical concerns, such as types of data that can be used for these study systems, and how questionnaires and digital equipment can be used to collect data on relevant social and contact networks. In addition, it is meaningful to examine whether some social behaviors predicted by models really exist in vaccination experiments and surveys. Finally, we will conclude with a summary and an outlook in Section 5, describing the implications of statistical physics of spatial disease-behavior dynamics and outlining viable directions for future research. Throughout, we will generally focus on preventive measures other than vaccination (such as social distancing and hand washing), although we will also touch upon vaccination in a few places.",22.12432040043169,9.854035083886213

A finite value of β accounts for the fact that better performing individuals are readily imitated, although it is not impossible to imitate one agent performing worse, for example due to imperfect information or errors in decision making. The authors studied their coupled ""disease-behavior"" model in well-mixed populations, in square lattice populations, in random network populations, and in SF network populations, and found that population structure acts as a ""double-edged sword"" for public health: it can promote high levels of voluntary vaccination and herd immunity given that the cost for vaccination is not too large, but small increases in the cost beyond a certain threshold would cause vaccination to plummet, and infections to rise, more dramatically than in well-mixed populations.

There is strong reason to suspect that biased sampling can have a profound influence on the inferences generated. For example, genetically unsampled sources of infection will not only remain undetectable, but their contribution will also be wrongly attributed to populations included in the sample (a problem akin to that caused by 'ghost populations' in population genetics [85] ). Moreover, inferred transmission dynamics can depend on the relative spatial and temporal density of sampling among host populations. Finally, stuttering chains within the target population can boost the frequency of cases (compare zones A and C in Figure 1 , main text) and, hence, the likelihood of detection under sparse sampling; if unaccounted for, this can lead to overestimation of cross-species transmission rates. These complexities can generate significant challenges for the investigation of reservoir-target systems because balanced, representative sampling, proportional to the incidence in each host, is rarely achievable.

It is perhaps largely because of the disadvantaged socioeconomic status along the Taihang Mountain range in China that we got this opportunity to witness the strength of this connection. Indeed, rural populations in China have been severely and are continually being disadvantaged. The Chinese National Tumor Prevention and Control Office conducted a nationwide cancer mortality survey in 1974-1976. 29 It identified several dozen of rural areas with extraordinarily high mortality rates of specific cancer, such as the Linxian-Cixian-Shexian region for esophageal cancer, Qidong County in Jiangsu province for liver cancer, and Qingan County in Jiangxi province for cervical cancer, and so on. This is the origin of so-called high-risk cancer regions in China. Most of these high-risk regions are located in remote or geographically disadvantaged mountainous areas with low levels of socioeconomic development, and the prevalent cancer is often infection-based, poverty-related cancer. During the 1970s, when chemical carcinogenesis theory was popular, strenuous efforts were made by scholars to identify chemical carcinogens in the local environment, and mass movements were launched to curb the suspected carcinogens. However, cancer rates of these high-risk regions had little or only moderate reduction. Only after rapid socioeconomic development began in the 1980s did significant reductions begin to appear, suggesting that cancer control among marginal groups depends on social progress as a whole.

Consequently, other elements of SRHR (eg, abortion, contraception, and comprehensive sexuality education for youth) became easy targets for political agendas already seeking to eliminate access to such services. Moreover, this separation has undermined efforts to firmly establish HIV and SRH service delivery in a human rights framework, prioritising bodily autonomy, sexual rights, and access to information and services, 150 which has been a contributing factor to violations of sexual and reproductive rights of women living with HIV, such as the use of forced or coerced sterilisation or abortion. 151 Although notable, if uneven, progress has been made in integrating services for the prevention of motherto child HIV transmission in broader SRHR approaches, 152 progress in addressing the SRHR needs of women, girls, and sexual minorities remains wholly inadequate. Even in highburden settings in subSaharan Africa, where a substantial number of women need services to prevent both unintended pregnancy and HIV, integrated services are rare. 153 Marginalised populations at increased risk of HIV infection (including sexual minorities) have additional SRHR needs that are often unaddressed by SRHR services that primarily cater to married or coupled women of reproductive age. 153 ",25.953875158944637,11.938624665291725

Without resorting to in-depth interviews with the relevant parties, the true causes may never be established by merely relying on statistical data. In fact, as the services provided by different airlines are not perfectly substitutable, there will always be a relatively disadvantaged airline that has lower revenue on a route than that of other members of the collusive group. In most instances, the only choice for a disadvantaged airline to increase its total revenue is to cut prices (owing to the elastic demand at the agreed price level). When all the airlines follow suit, a price war will break out. The base airline (with headquarters in the city) usually plays an important role in coordinating an agreement to end the war on the route out of that city. Our interviewees all expressed the view that the base airline should take the responsibility to call all the relevant parties in for talks. If this did not work, the station managers would report the case to their own top management for action, and communication at senior levels could then terminate a war. This suggests that, quite often, the end of a war implies the formation of a collusive agreement.

Epidemiologists are primarily concerned with public health, which includes the design of studies, evaluation and interpretation of public health data, and the maintenance of data collection systems. They are interested in studying questions such as (1) What is the spatial extent of the outbreak? (2) How does the disease progress and how can we control it? (3) How did the disease originate and how does this compare to past outbreaks? Such questions have been asked repeatedly throughout human history. The 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa is an example of an epidemic that has caused thousands of deaths, along with significant social and economic impact on the affected countries. 2 An important concern in epidemiology is to control an outbreak. With the advent of modern science, pharmaceutical measures have been widely used to control and prevent outbreaks. For example, vaccines have become a critical method of controlling, preventing, and possibly eradicating infectious diseases in host populations. Despite their success, nonpharmaceutical methods, such as quarantining and social distancing, continue to play a central role in controlling infectious disease outbreaks; they are especially important during an outbreak caused by an emerging pathogen.

But Capt. Chmiel said local health authorities have 'certain powers to quarantine people.'"" 46 Political, economic, social, and ethical issues are always being raised by these strategic measures. Individual rights have often been trampled in the name of public good. The liberty of outwardly healthy persons from lower classes has frequently been violated by isolating or segregating persons suspected of being infected. Marginalized groups of different ethnicities and races have been stigmatized and discriminated against. Quarantine has a line of continuity from the time of plague to the influenza A pandemic in 2009. 46 During plague and cholera outbreaks, the fear of discrimination and mandatory quarantine pushed the lowest social class and minorities to flee from affected areas. This contributed to a more rapid and wider spread of the disease as this regularly occurred in towns affected by deadly disease outbreak. In this global world, the fear caused by mass media can spread the disease farther and faster, playing a larger role than in the past. Entire populations or segments of populations are at the risk of being stigmatized. In the light of new challenges posed by twenty-first century that can lead to the spread of infectious diseases, quarantine, along with other public health tools, retains importance for public health preparedness. Vigilant attention is required to avoid the intolerance and injustice while implementing these measures. Regular, transparent, and comprehensive communications should be used to gain the public trust.

There are, however, a number of concerns about these studies. * Are exposures to formaldehyde high enough in these populations to assess possible effects? For example, are embalmers exposed 8 hours/ day, 5 days/week, or is their exposure much less? * Can exposure history be adequately documented? Are individuals with little or no embalming experience distinguishable from those with considerable exposure? Since few if any of the workers are exposed only to formaldehyde, what is the effect of exposure to these other agents? * Is exposure to formaldehyde in the same range as for other populations? The confidence we place in the findings from these studies depends largely on the ability to retrospectively estimate exposure. If exposure in these occupational groups is representative of other exposed populations, the conclusions may be indicative of potential risk to all exposed populations.

The Influenzanet network is composed of the United Kingdom, Sweden, Spain, Ireland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Italy, Portugal, and France.

Although there are some differences in the participatory surveillance systems presented in Figure 1 , these systems typically collect some background information at time of registration and send surveys to registered participants at regular intervals, usually weekly, to gather data on disease symptoms experienced during the previous week. The symptoms data are processed and presented using maps or other methods aimed at informing the public of influenza-like illness activity levels. Challenges to participatory surveillance include recruiting and maintaining participants, accuracy of self-reported data, developing a nationally representative sample, and specifically monitoring at-risk populations. Despite these limitations, data from these systems have been shown to have similarities in trends and peak timing when compared to reports from practitioner-based surveillance systems (Paolotti et al., 2014) .

Mathematical models in farm animal populations have been largely limited to offering guidance to veterinary decision making for pressing food protection, animal welfare and economic issues, such as those presented in outbreaks of bovine spongiform encephalopathy 16 or foot-and-mouth disease 17 . We propose that farm animal populations, coupled with mathematical models, are well-suited model systems to study infectious-disease population dynamics and problems that span several levels of organization and that are relevant to the control of human infectious diseases. We discuss the features, advantages and disadvantages of these systems and highlight research areas that might benefit from the knowledge generated by studying infectious disease dynamics in farm animal populations.",21.890713778683033,11.022032911223143

When family and community relationships are severed-as occurs with massive political upheaval, war, genocide, slavery, colonization, or catastrophic disasters-racial and ethnocultural groups may find themselves scattered and subject to further victimization and exploitation. For example, there continue to be massively displaced populations in Central and South America, the Balkans, central Asia, and Africa. When primary social ties are cut or diminished as a result of disaster, violence, or political repression, the challenge expands beyond survival of traumatic life-threatening danger to preserving a viable life, community, and culture in the face of lifealtering losses and suppression of those very factors needed to maintain (Garbarino & Kostelny, 1996; Rabalais, Ruggiero, & Scotti, 2002) . Ethnoracial groups that have been able to preserve or regenerate core elements of their original cultural norms, practices, and relationships within intact or reconstituted families may actually be particularly resilient to traumatic stressors and protected against the development of PTSD. For example, persons of Asian or African descent have been found to be less likely than those of other ethnocultural backgrounds to develop PTSD. Whether this is due to factors other than ethnicity per se, such as having cultural practices and beliefs that sustain family integrity and social ties, is a question that has not been scientifically studied and should be a focus for research (Pole et al., 2008) .",19.885253833443848,10.71108347013476

These housing systems are beneficial in decreasing the likelihood of disease transmission, but they also make it harder to detect infectious agents based on random screening protocols because the agent distribution is not uniform and the prevalence of infection may be far below 30%. Another problem with random screening techniques is the impracticality of selecting and testing animals from active research colonies without disrupting the ongoing research. For this reason, it is common to place sentinel animals into a colony for the sole purpose of health status testing. These animals are not assigned to any particular study, and under ideal circumstances they will be exposed to the same agents as the principal animals actually being used for research or breeding. Because they exist solely for the screening program, sentinels can be bled, sampled, or removed for nonsurvival testing at the discretion of the colony management without interfering with ongoing experiments.",17.86443534832404,8.427156966620903

Large datasets of parasites (mostly macroparasites) in multi-hosts systems have been collected in the course of these studies (see Poulin 2007b) . Several indices have been used to compare parasite communities between host populations (Poulin 2003 (Poulin , 2010 . The Jaccard index (Jaccard 1912 ) uses presence-absence data of parasites in different host populations to give an indicator of the similarity of this community. Other indices, more sophisticated, use prevalence data to compare parasite community (Boyle et al. 1990; Poulin 2007b) . In the context of host populations from the same ecosystem, the geographic distance between the host populations is controlled (geographic distances usually looked at in parasite community ecology are of the order of hundreds or thousands of kilometres). If the phylogenetic distance between host populations can be controlled, the similarities measured can estimate the EI between these host populations. These indices can therefore be used to build EI network as the value of the index between two parasite communities shared by two host populations (their similarity).

Furthermore, it hinders the curtailment of emerging and re-emerging infections by normalizing illnesses affecting marginalized populations. Risk discourses that attribute disease to intractable ''tradition'' label the sick as willfully dangerous and inferior (Briggs & Mantini-Briggs, 2003; Farmer, 1992) . The result is that these populations are blamed for their own infection, and their higher rates of illness confirm their inferiority and marginalization. Thus, sufficient investment in fighting diseases is only justified when they threaten wealthy populations, for whom infection is considered aberrant. As is evident from the 2003 SARS epidemic, international concerns about emerging infections are uni-directional: they are only of importance when they ''emerge'' from a poor population to threaten a wealthy one (Farmer, 2003) . Diseases such as tuberculosis have therefore been allowed to persist among the world's marginalized, contributing to these pathogens' mutation and drug resistance (Farmer, 1999) .",22.762047973073315,10.195643049854912

In case future outbreaks originate in Asia, Asian minorities living in Europe may be at higher risk of infection than general populations in Europe due to their own travel behavior or their contact with people from affected Asian countries. A Dutch study on travel behavior of Chinese living in The Netherlands showed that, in 2003, the year of the SARS outbreak, one third of Chinese respondents had traveled to Southeast Asia and one fifth had received guests from this region (de Zwart et al., unpublished manuscript).

Individuals and groups may project the risk of infection and death onto an ''Other'' in order to reduce the powerlessness experienced during a deadly epidemic (Crawford, 1994; Joffe, 1999) . In this process of othering, disease origins and risk of infection are explained through moralizing metaphors of cultural superiority so as to locate risk and responsibility among marginalized populations. Such discourses often define community membership vis-a`-vis one's relationship to modernity, a contemporary metaphor representing purity. Those who are labeled as unsanitary subjects (Briggs & Mantini-Briggs, 2003) threaten community health because of their cultural inferiority and thus their status as matter out of place (Douglas, 1966) . This othering is crucial to the maintenance of a healthy identity because the boundaries of the healthy self are never secure (Crawford, 1994) .

One of the reasons this situation exists is simply that communicable diseases make up a much larger proportion of the burden of disease in underdeveloped countries as compared to developed ones (see Box 3) (22) . A related problem is that research priorities are different in richer countries where chronic diseases are a priority than in poorer nations where infectious diseases and malnutrition are of greater concern. Even when chronic diseases constitute an important proportion of the burden of disease in developing (often middle-income) countries, research needs may be different from those in developed nations. Specifically, interventions to prevent chronic diseases, or to improve adherence to treatment once acquired, which may be successful in developed countries can be either not feasible or inappropriate (in cultural, social or economic terms) in developing nations. In addition, the development of vaccines in developed countries, for the control of communicable diseases, can be of little use in poorer nations, where they may be ineffective given the existence of different viral strains or bacterium.

Reputable captive programs (chapter 22) aim to retain 90% of genetic diversity over 100 years (Lacy, 2012) . however, this may not be sufficient in the long term as the small number of founders only represents a subset of the genetic diversity found in the wild (founder effect) and the 10% genetic diversity lost is irreversible. This loss of diversity can only be compensated for by the recovery of lost breeding lines through ""reinjection"" of viably preserved reproductive material (e.g., gametes) of founders into the captive population, addition of new founder individuals (or gametes) obtained from the wild, or inclusion of unrelated captive individuals to the breeding pool. as with wild populations, interconnectivity of captive populations should be maintained as much as possible, through regional and interregional exchange of animals or reproductive material. as the cost of genetic research continues to decrease, it will provide the possibility to assess the genetic makeup of all captive cheetahs, and thus the integration of animals of unknown origin into the cheetah breeding pool, if genetic evaluation determines that they represent a new breeding lineage.

This module measures QoL in terms of treatment quality (interactions with staff, quality of information) and treatment tolerability (effects on mood, disruptions daily life). These subscales can be used to assess effectiveness of new treatments/medications, to monitor quality of services, and to optimize patient treatment experiences. Research has shown that quality of treatment and its tolerability are predictors of treatment satisfaction (7) and willingness to persist with treatment (20) , the latter also shown in the present study.

Governments may decide to invest in the development of primary care and disease prevention services to maximize cost-benefit indices, or tertiary care and treatment may be prioritized for fund distribution. Judgments must also be made about investment in research and development of medications, technologies and vaccines. Resource allocation decisions about health services relative to other national services are necessary. These decisions are political and vary greatly by nation and ideologies (Coburn, 2004) . They are likely to influence health by determining what kinds of services are available, how accessible and affordable they are and what sectors of the population have access (Mehrotra, 2006) . National policies regarding other domains of public life, including welfare, education, social security, subsidized housing, and employment, are also likely to play an important role in determining both quality of population health, as well as distribution of health outcomes in the population (Marmot, 2002) . Finally, political ideologies at the national level have been hypothesized to influence health by differential support of welfare policies and recognition of and attention to the needs of the population (Franco, Alvarez-Dardet, & Ruiz, 2004) . For example, a recent study found a link among good governance measured by accountability, political stability, absence of violence, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law and the control of corruption and national HIV prevalence (Menon-Johansson, 2005; Widdus, 2005) Economic decisions regarding resource allocation and distribution are likely to influence population health through various pathways with resounding health effects. For example, Freudenberg and colleagues (2006) describe the impact of city, state and federal budget cuts on a TB/HIV/homicide combined epidemic in New York City during the 1980s and 1990s, which they term a ""syndemic"". These authors argue that budget cuts undermined the ability of city health and social service infrastructures to respond to health emergencies and emerging health threats; reduced education, policing and drug treatment services; and amplified social trends. These factors then contributed to increased risk of violence and disease in the population. Other authors have posited that national policies influence health through the mechanisms of social capital, empowerment and access to information, which are differentially accorded to populations living under different political economic systems (Franco et al., 2004) . Perhaps most relevant to globalization and health are arguments delineating relationships between government policies shaped by capitalist ideology and health outcomes mediated by increasing income inequalities and lowered social cohesion (Coburn, 2000; Muntaner & Lynch, 1999) . National governance therefore affects population health both through national-level and community-level pathways.",15.074823305816539,6.642420936657866

This scenario means shifting from a system in which essential health products are regarded as profi table commodities and it is left to the private sector to decide which ones to develop, to a system where medicines are deemed public goods, and where it is incumbent on the public sector to defi ne the public health priorities, and to create a conducive environment for product research and development, approval, and rational use. A governance system is needed to prioritise product development according to unmet health needs, and mechanisms that will allow diagnostics, drugs, and vaccines to be developed without an immediate fi nancial reward, but, as conditions might warrant, left on the shelves until the next outbreak occurs, or kept in reserve until bacteria become resistant to fi rst-line therapies. This arrangement is by sharp contrast with the current motive of maximising sales, which leads to massive overuse of some drugs, and necessitates regulation of the way drugs are deployed, prescribed, and used for instance to minimise the misuse of crucial antibiotics and prolong their lifespan. 78 The Ebola crisis off ered an opportunity to pilot a diff erent paradigm of health-needs-driven research and development, 79 as a collective action under public leadership and primarily fi nanced with public funds, allowing open access to data, resources, and research aids, building a shared evidence base of so far fragmented knowledge, mobilising the research community to contribute to problem solving through crowdsourcing, and managing creatively intellectual property for products to be available as public goods. Sadly, so far this has not happened; our current research and development ecosystem lacks the needed leadership and governance to prioritise research, resulting in fragmentation, diverging priorities, controversies over study design, 80 and now competition for access to study sites and patients. 81 Despite best intentions, we were unprepared this time again to overcome the systemic defi ciencies of our research and development model.

However, with the impending IMH prohibition on some primate research in the United States, and paralleled restrictions in other countries, this is a window that is potentially closing.

This might provide the necessary level to proceed to trials in human and Great Ape populations. So, one could also look at it through a shared vision-if human beings are willing to volunteer for phase one trials, which was highly evident in recent calls, then possibly retired chimpanzees could be coopted as well.

Crawford and Finn [39] provide a useful overview of the limitations of what they call ""crisis data""-the use of social and mobile data to understand disasters and other crisis events-of which a bioterrorism/ biological weapons attack would be relevant. Crawford and Finne discussed how social media data can provide important tactical information about a crisis and suggest potential response measures for that moment. They caution, however, that social media datasets represent a specific time point in an event, usually represented by a spike in Twitter messages or the use of particular hashtags. This focus can lead to a narrow conceptualization of the disaster, which leaves out an important understanding of the origin of the crisis or an understanding of the aftermath in which more of the impact and longer-term implications of the disaster is realized. Also Crawford and Finne pointed out that ""big data"" researchers often work in a very different context and location than those involved in the response and recovery in the midst of the disaster; therefore, the researchers can only mine a small fraction of the entire experience and effect of the disaster, leading to a partial and incomplete record of the event. Also Crawford and Finne noted that social media data is not always representative of a local population. For example, Twitter tends to be used by younger, wealthy, and more urban adult populations, meaning that infants, older, rural, and more marginalized populations may not be represented by Twitter posts ( [28] , p. S377). Also, most social media data lacks demographic information, such as age and sex, which is usually important in epidemiological studies. All of these factors could be a significant shortcoming for response planning in a bioweapons attack given that infants/children, older, rural, and more marginalized/developing country populations might be excluded from social media datasets and those populations are typically more vulnerable and could be significantly harmed by a bioweapons attack.",28.126280828367335,12.631908682403695

Firms also require accessibility to factors of production and markets. However, the infrastructure created to enhance accessibility also encourages mobility, which is essentially a behavioural attribute, and moreover one easily manipulated by price. Arguably it is the provision and ready availability of cheap mobility, best exemplified here by the growth of LCCs, which provides the basic challenge to the environmental dimension of sustainability.

WTO members are required to implement the 1995 Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) through national legislation recognising and enforcing pharmaceutical patents. 54 However, in many jurisdictions, these intellectual property protections have limited individuals' access to medicines. In response, governments have devised mechanisms to balance intellectual property protection with greater access to medicines. 85 Therefore, national legislation on medicines procurement or patentability criteria, as well as TRIPS flexibilities, have sought to expand social goals, while recognising private rights. 86 Yet further scope remains for countries to use the flexibilities that TRIPS provides to enable greater access to medicines. 87 Non-state actors can also provide a check on unreasonable exercise of government power. Civil society organisations are instrumental in demanding transparency and account ability from governing institutions. Non-state actors have a powerful voice in pushing governments and international institutions to use their legal tools in a manner that promotes justice and human rights, such as by protecting marginalised or disadvantaged populations.

A gender equity dimension is also present, as women tend to be further disadvantaged in their opportunities for physical activity where cities are not walkable. 259 This is another area in which laws and regulations that affect population health might lie well outside the usual reach of health ministries, thus requiring intersectoral cooperation. In a 2009 review of the evidence, WHO found that modifying the built environment, policies that reduce barriers to physical activity (such as walking, biking, and recreation), transport policies, and increased space for recreational activity were all effective interventions. 260 Examples of effective laws and regulations to increase physical activity include urban planning, land use management and zoning, transport policy (including taxes on car use, availability and accessibility of public transport, and bicycle and walking paths), and road and traffic control. 261 Local governments can play an important role because land use and zoning frequently fall under their remit. Local governments can implement building, zoning, and development regulations that encourage more physically active lifestyles: streets that are welcoming and safe for pedestrians and cyclists, facilities for public recreation (parks and playgrounds), and traffic calming measures. 15 The common theme among legal and regulatory interventions to prevent non-communicable diseases is that they promote small changes, across entire populations, for a mass impact. By simply changing a default option (eg, reducing salt in processed food, forbidding smoking in certain areas, or making public transport easier than car use), law has the power to facilitate profound changes in behaviour. Good laws can make healthier and safer behaviours the easier or normal choice. In conjunction with health promotion and awareness campaigns, countries can use law to support and encourage communities to resolve the problems arising from the shared risk factors of non-communicable diseases.",21.059917039437558,9.252085062232824

The dynamics of 12 rabbit populations enclosed by rabbit-proof fencing that exhibited 0, 40, 60, or 80% sterilization of females were studied in each of two locations in western and eastern Australia where climate patterns differed. Females born into treatment populations were trapped and sterilized to maintain the same overall sterility levels (Williams & Twigg, 1996) . Juvenile rabbits born into populations with sterilized females exhibited greater survivorship because of lowered competition for resources. This greater survival compensated for decreased fertility, but recruitment rates were ultimately constrained by environmental factors (e.g., depletion of vegetation). In populations with 80% sterility, reduced juvenile mortality did not compensate fully for lowered reproduction, smaller numbers of rabbits were recruited into these populations, and numbers subsequently declined. These results indicate that levels of sterilization with a genetically altered micorparasite have to reach at least 80% to achieve reductions in population density (Williams & Twigg, 1996) .",20.695628499560303,9.00305435106204

As health surveillance moves beyond the realm of government agencies, it is likely that a range of mechanisms will develop that allow for the prioritisation of rapid information sharing ahead of the specific interests of individual nations. This will, however, require international collaboration to take into account the diverse needs of different populations.

COVID-19, like tuberculosis, will almost certainly be associated with the medical poverty trap, in which poorer people have a higher likelihood of infection, disease, and adverse outcomes. Moreover, unemployed populations and informal or so-called zero-hours contract workers will experience further impoverishment, which increases risk of tuberculosis. 5 Amid the expanding COVID-19 pandemic, our plea on World Tuberculosis Day is that we do not forget the tuberculosis pandemic, which, at present, is still the leading cause of infectious disease mortality. We need to continue to mobilise funding for research for better tuberculosis diagnostics, vaccine development, novel therapeutics, equitable access to care, and innovative social protection interventions for tuberculosis-affected households. 5 We should drastically increase and sustain investment in health systems that are responsive to the needs of the poor and resilient to the threat of infections, especially those that are air-borne and require isolation facilities. We need to continue to inform, advocate for, and empower local communities and to lobby governments and policymakers to ensure that tuberculosis, as well as COVID-19, remain high on the global agenda.

Modern medical technology is available in the world market but at costs higher than most of the region's population can aff ord. Many traditional health practices persist alongside the use of new medical technologies and pharmaceutical products, presenting regulatory problems in terms of safety and quality. With increasing educational levels, ageing populations, and growing consciousness of human rights in the recently developing democratic environment, the demand for better care is increasing. Health systems in the region face more serious adjustment problems than ever before. 51 Health services have become an important industry, with a mix of public and private non-profi t and for-profi t actors, along with the growth of trade and medical tourism. The provision, fi nancing, and regulatory functions of the public sector have to adapt accordingly to these transformations. The need to restructure healthcare delivery and fi nancing systems becomes crucial to balance new demand and supply equilibriums. 52, 53 Countries in southeast Asia and their health system reforms can thus be categorised according to the stages of development of their health-care systems. A typology of common issues, challenges, and priorities are generated for the diverse mix of health systems of southeast Asia at diff erent stages of socioeconomic development (see webappendix pp 5-8). The pressures placed on national health-care systems by the recent demographic and epidemiological transitions that we have described are amplifi ed by the growing demands of an increasingly educated and affl uent population for high quality health care and the supply of the latest medical technology. Before the east Asian fi nancial crisis in 1997-98 and the recent global economic recession, an expanding middle class in the urban populations of the larger cities pushed their demand for high quality care into a booming private sector. As a result, market forces have turned many aspects of health care into a new industry in countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand, contributing to labour-force distortions for the production and distribution of health workers both within and across countries.",17.440949758522557,7.65246975245227

S-mediated virion attachment to a 9-O-Ac-sialylated surface would bring the HE catalytic site in proximity of some clustered receptors (which would explain the stimulating effect of S on HE esterase activity in the case of OC43 virions, but not observed for rMuCoV-OC43 HE + ) but at the same time would keep the virus-associated enzyme at ''arm's length'' from other receptor populations, readily accessible to soluble HEs (which would explain the inhibiting effect of S on esterase activity in the case of BCoV virions and the apparent lack thereof in the case of rMuCoV-BCoV HE + ) ( Figures  5C and 5D ). Thus, a distinction arises between clustered receptor populations that come within immediate reach of the HE esterase and that therefore would be cleaved by virion-associated HE as efficiently as by soluble HE and those that are kept out of reach of virion-associated HE as a result of S-mediated receptor-binding and that are therefore cleaved at strongly reduced rates or even rendered non-cleavable unless HE is provided with a functional lectin domain ( Figure 6 ). By virions grasping on to multivalent sialoglycoconjugates via the HE receptor-binding sites and ''drawing them in'' closer to the surface of the envelope, clustered receptors would yet become available to the HE esterase domain (Figure 6 ). Such a mechanism may be promoted by cooperativity among adjacent HE molecules and, membrane fluidity permitting, possibly even lead to redistribution of surface projections in the viral envelope, resulting in displacement of spikes, local recruitment of HEs, and formation of a ''receptor-destruction patch.'' Saliently, some receptor populations may be completely resistant to destruction even by virion-associated HEs with a functional lectin domain, such as the 2% of detectable O-Ac-Sias remaining after 48 hr of incubation with BCoV ( Figure 5D ). It is tempting to speculate that under natural conditions, the distinction between decoy and entry (Zeng et al., 2008) ; TREF, OC43 USA/1967 HE with the lectin CBS repaired (as in Figure 2C ).

In answer to such needs, systems genetics approaches utilize genetically diverse experimental models to recapitulate the population-wide variation seen across the human population and attempt to disentangle complex traits, such as immune responses [38, 39] . Specifically, by integrating not only pathologic and highthroughput molecular data, but also explicit information on the genetic composition of the experimental population, systems genetics seeks to identify genes and pathways of polymorphic genes that directly contribute to variation in responses to infection across genetically diverse populations, as well as for to further disentangle the underlying molecular signatures and pathways associated with various disease outcomes ( Figure 2 ). Furthermore, by explicitly contrasting the high-throughput molecular and phenotypic data across unique genetic backgrounds, robust virus-response signatures can be identified across host genetic backgrounds, attaining a better resolution of the dynamic and host regulatory responses that act in host-genetic background specific manners during infection.",19.553388899763434,8.098122348556918

Building Global Partnerships. The building of public private partnerships is proving to be one of the most effective global strategies to address the needs of disadvantaged populations living in the midst of neglected diseases [31] that are no longer considered to be a priority in industrialized nations [32] [33] [34] . If established in a balanced manner, public-private partnerships can bring together the power, resources, and experience from both the industrialized and the developing world to create synergies, define priorities, and find solutions. There are many examples of successful public private partnerships that have pooled their resources and have coordinated global strategies to increase the availability of scarce and expensive medical interventions for those that need them most. For example, the Global Alliance to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GAELF) consists of a partnership between academic and research institutions, advocacy and resource mobilization partners, country representatives, international development agencies and foundations, international organizations, nongovernmental development organizations, and private sector companies [35] . This group retains a ""light governance structure"" that provides the flexibility to focus on specific needs at regional and national levels [35] . Several attempts at regional or international partnerships in rabies prevention and control have occurred throughout the 20th century. For example, once oral vaccination of wildlife became a reality during the 1980s, the World Health Organization (WHO) held multiple consultations involving its global network of WHO Collaborating Centers for Reference and Research on Rabies for an organized approach towards red fox rabies elimination in Western Europe. The breadth and longevity of several other partnerships, such as the Rabies in the Americas Association, Latin-America National Rabies Directors Network (REDIPRA), Southern and Eastern Africa Rabies Group (SEARG), Rabies in Asia Foundation (RIA), Asia Rabies Expert Bureau (AREB), Africa Rabies Expert Bureau (AFROREB), and the recently created Middle East and Central Eastern Europe Rabies Expert Bureau (MEEREB), all demonstrate the utility of coalitions in successful information flow and regional health promotion in bringing support to local scientific and public health communities worldwide. As consistently observed by all existing rabies networks, basic education of people exposed to the risk of infection, the appropriate training of human and animal health professionals, and necessary advocacy by local health decision makers, are major milestones towards global rabies control. The North American Rabies Management Team is another recent example of professionals in Canada, Mexico, and the United States working together, sharing surveillance data, prioritizing applied research needs, and cooperating across the continent, in training and technology transfer, which allows the implementation of human and animal rabies control programs, achieving a drastic decrease of rabies cases in this region of the world.",30.7936832221312,13.380410092988305

Consequently, other elements of SRHR (eg, abortion, contraception, and comprehensive sexuality education for youth) became easy targets for political agendas already seeking to eliminate access to such services. Moreover, this separation has undermined efforts to firmly establish HIV and SRH service delivery in a human rights framework, prioritising bodily autonomy, sexual rights, and access to information and services, 150 which has been a contributing factor to violations of sexua and reproductive rights of women living with HIV, such as the use of forced or coerced sterilisation or abortion. 151 Although notable, if uneven, progress has been made in integrating services for the prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission in broader SRHR approaches, 152 progress in addressing the SRHR needs of women, girls, and sexual minorities remains wholly inadequate. Even in high-burden settings in sub-Saharan Africa, where a substantial number of women need services to prevent both unintended pregnancy and HIV, integrated services are rare. 153 Marginalised populations at increased risk of HIV infection (including sexual minorities) have additional SRHR needs that are often unaddressed by SRHR services that primarily cater to married or coupled women of reproductive age. 153",26.550230222529812,12.180918523823543

Current surveillance and early warning capacity for Canada's remote Aboriginal population, is underdeveloped (Furgal, 2008; Furgal and Prowse, 2008; Parkinson et al., 2008) . The fundamental challenge, as note, is the inadequacy of health data for planning: data sources that do exist are often inconsistent, sometimes based on faulty calculation methods, and are of limited coverage, baseline data do not exist for some health conditions and universally accepted measures, collection methods and techniques vary over time limiting the possibility for longitudinal analyses, surveillance among small populations limits analytical capacity for identifying significant changes and thresholds, and culturally and locally specific indicators have not been developed. These problems are compounded by challenges to institutional memory and high staff turnover in Aboriginal health systems noted in Sections 5.3 and 5.4. Early warning and surveillance capacity in Canada's urban centres is generally more advanced, and information on a range of emerging health risks is available to urban Aboriginal populations as part of broader health initiatives.

In addition to the genetic mapping approaches described above, genetic reference populations provide a novel and powerful overlay to systems biology approaches. Integrating variant disease pathologic, virologic, and transcriptional responses to virus infection, across a range of genetically distinct host backgrounds, allows for the direct assessment of the role of genetic variation on host response networks ( Figure 5 ). Systems genetics incorporates genetic complexity to explain differential disease responses. An advantage of genetically tractable, yet complex experimental systems such as RI panels, is the ability to explicitly integrate host genetic (A), virologic (B), and transcriptional responses (C) in order to identify polymorphic genetic loci (D) that contribute to differential virologic responses, and to develop transcriptional networks (E) that shed mechanistic insight into these polymorphic responses.",17.39667335303768,7.7671287109777385

Thus, systems biology has developed into a new field that aims to understand the complexity of pathogen-host interactions by using computational integration of high-throughput experimental data, and by modeling molecular networks via bioinformatics. Intrinsic to this approach is the idea that biological systems display ""emergent properties"" which are complex patterns that arise from a multiplicity of relatively simple interactions. Therefore, a major objective of the systems biology approach with regard to infectious disease is to be able to make predictions about the dynamic behavior of biochemical networks involved during infection with any pathogen [151] . Thus, while small-scale studies look only at one side of the interaction, system biology gives a global perspective of the events.",17.664281158067812,7.302987197981586

Choosing an iRCT is not 'doggedly insisting on gold standards'; 3 rather, successful iRCTs will speed up responsible mass-scale delivery of tested vaccines. Only some rough estimate of efficacy levels would enable health ministries to match vaccine penetration to herd immunity needs. Only robust trial outcomes would lend earlier credibility to calls on the public to undergo the vaccination and on donors to invest large amounts to buy and deliver vaccines. In this circumstance, non-iRCT designs risk mistaking confounders for vaccine effects or missing a true effect of the vaccine due to inadequate power. We might vaccinate a large population only to discover that we have burdened or harmed them for little or no protection. 22 Sceptical populations might later come to distrust even countermeasures that had been properly tested before rollout. 23 Alternatively, if the cluster-randomized trial's size or duration is increased to keep It valid in settings of fluctuating and unpredictable incidence, then more time and more infections in the trial will typically be required before it can draw a conclusion.

While the interests of marginalised populations were better addressed and the dignity of minority groups much more respected under such a government, there were many situations in which the state imposed sacrifices on vulnerable populations as an apparently inevitable price to be paid in the name of 'economic development'.

Thus, no matter how many synonymous changes have been introduced into the genome, a virus synthesized in the infected cell will have the same structure and will encode the same replication proteins as the wild-type virus, but it may be substantially disadvantaged in terms of proliferation. Such a variant of a human pathogenic virus may enter the host by its normal route and replicate poorly, but still allow the host to mount an immune response strong enough to induce lasting protective immunity. In other words, a human virus with altered codon usage or altered codon pair usage could possibly serve as a vaccine. Recoding viral genomes, a process that we call 'synthetic attenuated virus engineering' (SAVE), may be a new and rapid route to discover vaccine candidates and prevent viral disease. Indeed, polioviruses harboring underrepresented codons or underrepresented codon pairs are attenuated in CD155 tg mice.

That is, although the dehumanized virus can replicate in HeLa cells, once released it has enormous problems in spreading to other cells. It should be noted that we have analyzed the sequences of the codon-deoptimized viruses for the emergence of higher-order structures that could have impeded replication.

This aim can only be achieved if incoming refugees feel welcome and not the subject of stigmatisation or persecution. 7 Experience from around the world shows that many refugee groups-eg, Myanmar's Rohingya minority-have long been deprived of essential health care in their home countries, and arrive in host countries in extremely poor health. These poor baseline health conditions might be exacerbated by provision of inadequate health services at refugee reception or processing centres, which can thus become a risk to the collective health of host populations. For example, conditions in Australia's Nauru and Manus Island detention centres for off shore processing have resulted in outbreaks of infectious diseases. 21 By contrast, the strong system of vaccination surveillance in Germany identifi ed low measles immunisation in incoming refugees to Lower Saxony; measures are being taken to vaccinate arriving groups, illustrating how evidence can be used to reduce health inequalities in refugees and host communities. The European Vaccine Action Plan 2015-2020 22 details the importance of equitable access to vaccination and to encourage access for refugees and migrants with culturally appropriate services. 7 High-income countries have all the experience, knowledge, and resources to fi nd cost-eff ective solutions to health challenges that might arise from incoming refugees, as well as the institutional strength and innovative capacity to integrate and harness the potential socio economic benefi ts of these incoming groups. Innovative solutions to strengthen the control of infectious diseases in refugee populations could include mobile diagnostic and surveillance units similar to the Find and Treat service for tuberculosis for homeless and disadvantaged people in London. 23 These solutions could also include an integrated support function for psychosocial care and new public-private partnerships for health surveillance, delivery of messages about health promotion and phone-based incentives, and signposting of essential health services. Lessons could be learnt from the large US refugee resettlement programme 17, 24 and their electronic disease notifi cation system used since 2006, which has improved the timeliness and accuracy of infectious disease notifi cations. However, further studies should include economic analyses that account for longterm outcomes for conditions, such as latent tubterculosis infections, detected in incoming refugees. Sweden, where more than 100 000 refugees were taken in during 2015, is trialing creative approaches to integrate refugee communities, improve health literacy, and ensure adequate access to health services. Sweden has introduced many fast-track schemes to integrate refugees (particularly from Syria), who are already medically trained, into the labour market, thus addressing many diffi culties associated with staff shortages, language barriers, and cultural sensitivity. 25 However, for interventions to be eff ective, improved coordination and cooperation is needed by European countries. Additionally, there is a need for a more integrated and well managed role for humanitarian nongovernmental organisations to provide services for refugees in the absence of adequate provision by government and local authority agencies. In 2015, an important step was taken in this direction with the publication of a joint statement-by European countries, the European Commission, and WHO-addressing the health needs of incoming refugees to Europe 26 and the development of a patient health record that will be piloted at borders to evaluate refugees' medical needs and to reconstruct their medical history. 27 A joint technical statement by UNHCR, WHO, and UNICEF on vaccination for refugees entering Europe provides further support to harmonise and develop consistent standards in the continent. These eff orts are important and build on the continuing work of WHO's Europe Public Health Aspects of Migration in Europe project, 28 which has developed both evidence-based guidance and a series of tools to assist countries to assess and address the health needs of migrant and refugee populations. Unfortunately, the eff ectiveness of these initiatives continues to be limited by the insuffi cient fi nancial and political commitment to improve cross-border coordination for the health needs of refugees.",19.98638587805183,8.502507110083034

However, internet-based surveillance does not provide an alternative to traditional surveillance systems. Rather, these systems are an extension of traditional systems. The societal eff ect and extent of spread of infectious diseases within a community cannot be measured by any one surveillance system. 43 Surveillance systems should be fl exible, built with models that incorporate several means of collecting information, and integrate information from other sources to create a comprehensive understanding of and approach to addressing emerging problems. 86 Further more, addressing emerging infectious diseases is con tingent on their recognition as global, rather than regional, issues. A global response requires concerted international approaches to strengthen the capacity of emerging infectious diseases surveillance systems worldwide. Future research needs to focus on how to use internet-based surveillance systems to complement existing systems.",20.14944175935716,9.583554043570416

Given quick, accurate, and relatively affordable sequencing becoming a reality, personalized medical data may be merged with public data systems for the purposes of public health planning (environmental and pathogen surveillance; disease response), and research alluding to population stratification in respect to medications. Many of the strategies to care just mentioned face logistic challenges in obtaining suitable genomic information in a timely enough fashion to guide diagnosis and prescriptions (including drug and lifestyle modification), and delivering it broadly enough to cover populations. Placing genomic information in an electronic medical record (covering all citizens) would facilitate this kind of personalized medicine. If the patient's entire genome were part of his or her medical record, then the complexities of acquiring a DNA sample, shipping it to a sequencing laboratory and waiting for the readout would be replaced by an electronic query. That data inquiry would still need clinical interpretation. However, the safeguards necessary to maintain the integrity of the model include challenges to access and control of the data medium or repository, the accuracy and long-term stability of the data, and clinical rigor in analysis and interpretation. It is likely that a number of ongoing debates about the application of clinical genetics will reemerge, such as the conceptual targets of screeningwhere there is a predisposition or risk of a traitto the application of direct tests for a haplo-or phenotype. Currently, clinical genetics is offered to patients who receive pre-and post-test genetic counseling. Clinical genomics would likely require a substantial infrastructure review to provide this coverage for populations, with access to not just offered to clinical staff, but also those utilizing commercial genomic sequencing.

Individuals residing in slums rank low on the social gradient and political agendas. The lower the socioeconomic position a person occupies, the worse the health and the lower the life expectancy. Some of the specific social determinates that affect health include the wealth index of the household, the employment of the head of the household, the presence of the mother to care for the children, the level of social support, the degree of crowding within the home, the educational attainment of the mother, food security, access to clean potable water, sufficient sanitary facilities, and available close-by quality health services and schools. Slum dwellers score low on these determinates. These social determinates of health are largely responsible for the great differences in the types of morbidities, the severity of illnesses, and the level of access to treatment for them. Although country-level disparities are readily apparent, many statistics internal to a nation merely dichotomize by urban versus rural. This hides the slum outcomes in the urban figures, thereby worsening the urban figures and making rural dwellers a bit better off than all those who live in the city. Yet in reality, rural dwellers fair better than those who live in slums, but far worse than those urbanites that do not live in slums [81] . Household-level factors, combined with an overarching lack of recognition from local and national governments, manifested through lack of land rights, exclusion from census, and lack of investment in schools and health care centers delivers the message of ''no worth''; the ultimate in exclusion.

The first group of measures, extended to include age, is described in the present chapter, and the second group of measures is described in Chap. 7. It is important to distinguish between measures of inequality in the distribution of a health measure, such as among ages, geographic areas, and general population groups, and measures of the differences in a health measure among various socioeconomic groups in a population for the purpose of determining the degree of causation between them. The latter may involve not only different measures but also causal inferences, value judgments, and differences in interpretation. While most recent research has focused on variations in the health status of socioeconomic groups within countries, in the discussion that follows in this chapter, I focus mainly on variations in health status among countries and among general populations.

Given that any government measure aimed at protecting public health involves moral judgements that are legitimated through political processes (Leichter, 2003; Oliver, 2006) , the infectious risk posed by wild animals to agricultural production and human populations is undoubtedly both a political and a moral issue. But the moral dimensions of this issue, and the development of policy responses to it, are deeply contested and heavily influenced by media representations of the link between human health, animals and the environment.

In impoverished parts of American cities, school health education and provision is an increasing trend, which often includes the addition of clinics, especially aimed at targeting adolescents and their problems (Fitzpatrick and LaGory 2011) . A National Assembly of School-Based Health Care acts as a co-ordinating and advice centre for these school-based clinics which have grown from 20 in 1980 to currently over 2000 in 44 states. Research has shown that schools with clinics have fewer disciplinary problems, course failures, and school absentee rates, as well as better health (Smith 2013) .",22.45890270333355,10.46621346008085

A good diet, with a variety of vegetables and fruit, and adequate amounts of each, is essential to maintaining health, for malnutrition leads to ill-health and also vitamin deficiencies which can lead to diseases. There is still controversy over these issues, but a meta-analysis of research findings confirmed a linear relationship between stroke risk and low fruit and vegetable consumption, with latest research suggesting that well over six portions of fruit and vegetables a day are needed to obtain the necessary vitamins (Qu et al. 2014) .

Instead, the real power of transmissible vaccines likely lies in their ability to improve vaccine coverage in populations of livestock and wildlife where direct vaccination of a significant proportion of the population is excessively costly or even impossible in many cases. Although transmissible vaccines have not yet been used in this capacity on a large scale, a recombinant transmissible vaccine has been developed to protect wild rabbit populations against myxomatosis [9] and to interrupt the transmission of Sin Nombre hantavirus in reservoir populations of deer mice [6] . Similar approaches could be used to develop transmissible vaccines against invasive wildlife diseases, such as West Nile virus [27] , to protect threatened wildlife populations from infectious disease [28] or to eliminate diseases like rabies from wild reservoir populations. The models we have studied here are obvious simplifications designed to make a first-pass estimate at the potential benefits that may be realized by using weakly transmissible vaccines.

One of the ways in which this environmentalembodiment relationship occurs is by the shortening of telomeres, which are rather like a cap on the end of chromosomes that protects the DNA during replication (Epel et al. 2004 ). This reduction is associated with higher levels of ill-health and predisposition to many diseases in later life. A recent pioneering study of 9 year old Afro-American children who had suffered chronic stress from their upbringing in poverty, unstable families and who were subject to harsh parenting and maternal depression, revealed a shortening of their telomeres compared to children from more affluent and nurturing backgrounds (Mitchell et al. 2014) . So these disadvantaged children are likely to experience what amounts to premature aging and morbidity through degraded physical functions that make them more prone to disease. But the effect was not uniform. This association between the social environment and telomere length (TL) was also moderated by the extent of genetic variation in the subjects within the neurotransmitter pathways of the serotonin and dopamine genes that control the extent of pleasure and excitement responses. So some of the subjects had a genetically influenced higher likelihood of sensitivity. It was shown that those with highest sensitivity levels were more affected by their environment, having the shortest TL when exposed to these stressful environments. But they had the longest TL when exposed to advantaged environments. The researchers suggest that this points to the presence of a genetic predisposition in the responses to the social environment. The children with high sensitivity levels get even worse off from the poor nurturing and environment, but have greater benefits from better conditions. Yet those with limited genetic sensitivity may not be so affected by the negative social environment, which may explain why some people survive the highly disadvantaged area and their resilience enables them to subsequently flourish. Yet the general effect is that the children have their biological structure damaged by the stressful social environment of their upbringing, leading to future health problems. These findings mean that children in these areas are not simply disadvantaged because of locally poor educational opportunities to improve their life. Their negative environment effectively ages them and makes them more liable to ill-health. This recent research provides justification for early childhood interventions providing effective nurturing, creating less stressful environments to reduce the probability of what amounts to physical damage in epigenetic processes. The research has moved the known correlations between childhood disadvantage and future ill-health to causal relationships, although not all will be affected to the same extent.",20.10819037865226,8.732542465515122

For MDG2, increased enrollment of boys and girls in primary school has reached 90 percent in developing countries, so this target is also being reached. Box 16.2 indicates 1. Promoting development -During the past decade, health has been recognized as a key driver of socioeconomic progress, and more resources than ever are being invested in health. Yet poverty continues to contribute to poor health, and poor health keeps large populations in poverty. Health development is directed by the ethical principle of equity: access to life-saving or health-promoting interventions should not be denied for economic or social reasons. Activities are aimed at health development with priority to health outcomes in poor and disadvantaged countries or vulnerable groups. The Millennium Development Goals addressing poverty reduction and other programs preventing and treating chronic diseases, and the neglected tropical diseases are cornerstones of the health and development agenda. 2. Fostering health security -Great threats to international health security arise from outbreaks of emerging and epidemic-prone diseases. These are occurring in increasing numbers, fueled by rapid transportation, urbanization, environmental mismanagement, the way food is produced and traded, and the way antibiotics are used and misused. Shared vulnerability to health security threats demands joint action to collectively defend against outbreaks. Collective security is crucial to identify and control potential pandemics. This was strengthened by newly revised International Health Regulations (2007) , and absorption of lessons learned from the HIV, SARS, and subsequent pandemics. 3. Strengthening health systems -For health improvement to help reduce poverty, health services must reach poor and underserved populations, especially those in neglected rural and urban slums. Health systems in many parts of the world are unable to do this, so strengthening of health systems is a high priority. This includes addressing the provision of adequate numbers of appropriately trained staff, sufficient financing, suitable systems for collecting vital statistics, with access to appropriate technology and essential drugs, with priority on local primary care. 4.

WHO generates authoritative health information, in consultation with leading experts, to set norms and standards, articulate evidence-based policy options, and monitor the evolving global health situation. 5. Enhancing partnerships -WHO works with the support and collaboration of many partners, including UN agencies and other international organizations, donors, civil society and the private sectors. The role of donors in advancing health in developing countries must encourage national governments to increase their allocation and commitment to health as a priority. WHO uses the strategic power of evidence to encourage partners implementing programs within countries to align their activities with best technical guidelines and practices, as well as with the priorities established by member countries. 6.

It was composed of two subscales, a six-item subscale looking at possible changes in life's priorities as a result of SARS and a nine-item subscale looking at the circumstances that helped contribute to coping with the SARS situation. The first subscale looked at the importance of health, relationship with the family, friends and colleagues, work and spiritual beliefs in their lives. The second subscale explored the importance in helping them cope with the SARS situation of clear communication of directives and disease information about SARS, precautionary measures taken at work, being able to give feedback to management, the support of a supervisor/ manager/head of department, colleagues and family, being able to confide in someone and religious convictions.",22.36551627031257,7.450248528062816

Since then, there have been several participatory surveillance systems for influenza developed for different countries (see Figure 1 ). In 2008, Influenzanet, a European-wide consortium for monitoring influenza-like illness using participatory surveillance systems was established (Paolotti et al., 2014) . The Influenzanet network is composed of the United Kingdom, Sweden, Spain, Ireland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Italy, Portugal, and France. The consortium aims ''to rapidly identify public health emergencies, contribute to understanding global trends, inform data-driven forecast models to assess the impact on the population, optimize the allocation of resources, and help in devising mitigation and containment measures'' (Paolotti et al., 2014) . Although there are some differences in the participatory surveillance systems presented in Figure 1 , these systems typically collect some background information at time of registration and send surveys to registered participants at regular intervals, usually weekly, to gather data on disease symptoms experienced during the previous week. The symptoms data are processed and presented using maps or other methods aimed at informing the public of influenza-like illness activity levels. Challenges to participatory surveillance include recruiting and maintaining participants, accuracy of self-reported data, developing a nationally representative sample, and specifically monitoring at-risk populations. Despite these limitations, data from these systems have been shown to have similarities in trends and peak timing when compared to reports from practitioner-based surveillance systems (Paolotti et al., 2014) . Furthermore, data from these systems have also been used to assess vaccination coverage and inform epidemiological models for influenza-like illness (Paolotti et al., 2014; Wó jcik et al., 2014) .",27.402577330102744,11.468229343792377

Thus, no matter how many synonymous changes have been introduced into the genome, a virus synthesized in the infected cell will have the same structure and will encode the same replication proteins as the wild-type virus, but it may be substantially disadvantaged in terms of proliferation. Such a variant of a human pathogenic virus may enter the host by its normal route and replicate poorly, but still allow the host to mount an immune response strong enough to induce lasting protective immunity. In other words, a human virus with altered codon usage or altered codon pair usage could possibly serve as a vaccine. Recoding viral genomes, a process that we call 'synthetic attenuated virus engineering' (SAVE), may be a new and rapid route to discover vaccine candidates and prevent viral disease. Indeed, polioviruses harboring underrepresented codons or underrepresented codon pairs are attenuated in CD155 tg mice. Infection of these mice with a sublethal dose of codon-or codon pair-deoptimized viruses induced an immune response that protected the animals against a lethal dose of the wild-type virus 4, 5 .",24.468533071608764,11.196735894139605

Three types of poultry farming are practiced on the Galápagos Islands: smallscale backyard meat chickens (1-40 birds per farm) (Fig. 2) , small to medium-scale egg layers, and medium to relatively large-scale commercial broiler operations (2000-4000 birds) (Fig. 3) . Currently, there are 23 broiler chicken farms on Santa Cruz, 6 on San Cristobal, and 4 on Isabela. In the past Wve to ten years, poultry production has intensiWed due to demand from the growing human population and tourist industry. Under Galápagos law, broiler chickens, brought to Galápagos at 1-5 days of age, must be unvaccinated and certiWed as healthy by approved aviculture facilities on the Ecuadorian mainland. Currently, no livestock vaccinations are permitted on the Galapagos Islands (David Cruz, SIC-GAL, personal communication). Feral populations of chickens exist on Santa Cruz, Isabela, San Cristobal, and Floreana. In addition to the risk of introducing disease into native Galapagos avifauna, waste from domestic poultry operations may have detrimental eVects on local plant and animal communities in the Galapagos due to nutrient enrichment and water contamination. In 2001, the Saint Louis Zoo and the University of Missouri -St. Louis, in cooperation with the Galápagos National Park Service and the Charles Darwin Research Station, initiated an avian disease surveillance program in the Galápagos Islands. This monitoring serves to identify pathogens that pose a particular risk to native populations and helps to target certain pathogens for future disease surveillance. A similar approach to identifying high-risk pathogens has been performed for killer whales (Orcinus orca) (Gaydos et al., 2004) .

Many times these are disease prevention and control strategies, such as vaccination and treatment of individuals or populations, or personal protective measures, such as wearing gloves and masks for humans facing zoonotic diseases. The idea is to rerun the model under different conditions or assumptions to see how the risk changes in response to intervention actions. Sensitivity analysis-the process of examining the impact of the variation in individual model inputs on the model outputs in a quantitative risk assessment-is often performed to accomplish this. Many times, cost is entered into the equation as well in order to conduct cost-benefit analyses of different management options. The result is a very powerful tool for management authorities to analyze not only risk, have little evidence-based information for pathogenesis in captive wildlife, or for how transmission may occur across the species barriers. This is another large data gap that affects the consequence assessment and presents further opportunity to support research on both the ecology and pathogenesis of these agents beyond the normal domestic animal realm. There is evidence that there is some level of risk of RVF transmission to US livestock from the importation of wildlife species. While the number of imports that are most likely to provide a risk of RVF transmission are relatively few compared to the overall large volume of imports, the consequences of a transmission event would be extensive. Because of this risk, we have recommended investment in further areas of research and further risk reduction measures.",16.25039308161054,7.655035828666685

While we will all be at risk during a pandemic-something that Battin et al.

Some of this vulnerability may come from the characteristics of the particular disease, for example, whether the disease strikes the young, people who already have underlying health conditions, or pregnant women. Some of this vulnerability also will likely arise from social and economic vulnerability. There is increasing recognition of the importance of including vulnerable populations in planning for emergencies and of developing understandings of vulnerability that are inclusive of social and economic vulnerability (Campbell et al. 2009; Hutchins et al. 2009; World Health Organization 2013b) . In an analysis of 37 pandemic plans published from 2001 -2006 , Uscher-Pines et al. (2007 found that references to vulnerability tended to focus on biological or medical risk (in 20 plans) and that where reference was made to social disadvantage it was in the plans of high-income countries. Furthermore, it has been argued that the dominance of scientific, political, and legal discourses in pandemic plans, over social, cultural, and ethical discourses, serves to obscure the needs and interests of disadvantaged populations (Garoon and Duggan 2008 ; see also Bennett and Carney 2014; Carney and Bennett 2014) .",29.700251445206213,12.587880588334077

These two measures would decrease human exposure to H5N1 and decrease likelihood of mixing of H5N1 with human-specific viruses. The WHO specifically recommends workers involved in the culling of poultry flocks take protective measures to decrease exposure to bird excrement. Protective clothing and gear as well as proper cleaning of surfaces must be employed. The WHO also reports that poultry workers in areas with outbreaks should receive antiviral drugs as prophylaxis. Proper reporting to local and state officials is a must when cases of avian influenza are found in humans. Public health is dependent on the dissemination of pertinent information. Officials need to assess the virology of circulating animal and human infections to best assess vaccination needs and other protective measures. 6 To date there has been no evidence of efficient humanto-human transmission of H5N1 virus.

In support of this we previously observed a dose-dependent decrease in the virus-specific CD8 + T cell response generated following intranasal infection (Parks, G. D. and Alexander-Miller, M. A.,2002) . In this report we tested the hypothesis that the negative regulation of the immune system extended to other lymphocyte populations. These studies were focused on the possibility that there was a systemic effect of infection that extended to lymphocyte populations other than those directly responding to infection. We found that a high, but non-lethal, virus dose resulted in a significant increase in the percent of lymphocytes staining positive for active caspase 3 in the spleen. While caspase 3 activation has been shown to occur during T cell activation in the absence of apoptosis (Alam et al.,1999; Miossec et al.,1997; Sabbagh et al.,2004; Wilhelm et al.,1998) , our findings argue against this interpretation as 1) there was a considerable decrease in CD4 + , CD8 + and B cell numbers in the spleen in high versus low dose infected mice and 2) there was an increase in active caspase 3 + cells within the naïve T cell populations. Thus our data support the interpretation that the active caspase 3 detected following infection with high dose virus is a marker for cells undergoing apoptosis. In support of this we see increased staining for 7AAD in mice receiving the high dose of virus (data not shown). The increased apoptosis in lymphocytes following high dose i.n. vaccinia virus infection was not restricted to the spleen as a similar effect was observed in the mediastinal lymph node (data not shown).

Second, the dissemination of improved tools for constructing complex models, conducting simulations, and sharing the results, together with greater access to ever cheaper mass computing power, will empower the community to work together in building and utilizing better and bigger models. Finally, the changes already in progress in the way students are educated, with the inclusion of more statistics, mathematics, and computer programming at various stages of secondary, college, and post-graduate education, will make it easier for new investigators to incorporate these methods into their research activities, just as the familiarity of newly minted MDs and PhDs with 'omic' technologies has led over the past decade to the facile inclusion of such methods into their projects.

Sufficient political resolve to implement effective counter-measures is crucial to tackle the resistance problem. An important prerequisite is to increase the public awareness of the resistance problem and to put it higher on European and national political agendas. This is hampered by the lack of quantitative data on the impact of resistance on public health. Hence, the first priority is to obtain these data (Fig. 3) .

The colour scale from yellow to red indicates the need for low-to high-priority research, respectively. Infection prevention measures include hygiene-control and isolation policies in hospitals and vaccination programs in the community and veterinary sector. Antibiotic development implies the need for better technologies in order to develop new antibiotics and alternative strategies. Antibiotic use refers to prudent use in the hospitals, restricted use in the community (i.e. better compliance with the prohibition of over-the-counter sales of antibiotics), and therapeutic use only in the veterinary sector. Standardized evidencebased guidelines and education programs for healthcare professionals and the public are needed to implement intervention measures. Well-designed standardized surveillance programs are needed to study the cost-effectiveness of intervention measures in the hospital, the community, and other resistance reservoirs such as the veterinary sector. Resistance levels, in turn, should be linked to relevant outcome parameters like mortality, morbidity, economic costs of resistance, and cost-effectiveness of intervention measures. Finally, resistance dynamics should be analysed in relation to intervention measures using mathematical modelling, and the spread and mechanisms of resistance should be addressed by coupling resistance data to the genetic background of the strains. otics. For these intervention strategies, research is needed that can be translated into evidence-based guidelines to be implemented by the EU. Finally, much more fundamental knowledge is required to understand the spread and fitness of resistant bacteria at a genetic level.

Strategies at the individual level for increasing immunization coverage include community-based educational campaigns to improve attitudes and increase motivation for receiving vaccine; at the provider level, education of providers to encourage immunizations, improving patient-provider interactions, broadening the provider base to include additional nurses and pharmacists, and adoption of standing orders for immunization administration; and at the structural level, promoting wider availability of and access to vaccine.

Although personalized treatments can help save the lives of sick people, prevention applies to all. ""Precision prevention"" may be helpful in using both science and limited resources for targeting prevention strategies. For example, recent data suggest that knowing the speed with which people metabolize nicotine, based on genetic and other factors, could lead to personalized smoking-cessation interventions. Another approach to precision prevention is increased screening of people at greater risk for cancer. Family health history is an inexpensive tool for identifying individuals and families that require earlier and more intensive screening for breast and ovarian cancer. 5 Although whole genome sequencing in healthy populations will require more evidence for its utility, there is an emerging list of genomic applications that merit a targeted public health approach to find people with selected genetic conditions (e.g., hereditary breast/ovarian and colorectal cancers and familial hypercholesterolemia). Collectively, these conditions affect around 2 million people in the U.S., with evidence-based interventions that are poorly implemented in health care. 6 In addition, new biomarkers promise to improve the understanding of disease natural history. For example, epigenetics 7 is providing insights into the impact of the environment on gene expression throughout life with the possibility of targeted interventions. There is also strong suspicion that cumulative epigenetic changes due to environmental stressors may explain population health disparities in the burden of various diseases among disadvantaged populations. 8 Measuring neighborhood-specific epigenetic alterations can potentially be used to investigate causes for health disparities. However, although the field of epigenetics is promising for public health, much more work is needed in developing, validating, and using the right platforms in population studies. 8 Biomarkers are only one of many avenues for identifying high-risk populations for intervention. Public health programs already use targeted approaches, for example, by recommending screening for hepatitis C in people born from 1945 through 1965, and identifying people with prediabetes. Public health policies that will enhance lower sugar intake, weight control, and increased activity levels across the population could be accompanied, but not replaced, by more-targeted efforts to find people with prediabetes based on age, family history, and BMI. As technologies mature, there will be increasing opportunities for additional targeting for a wide variety of disease-prevention efforts.",28.433261638799213,11.301176228197034

Similar to the improvement of hygiene in humans, the fragmentation of a large population into a number of poorly connected subpopulations also alters the circulation of the pathogen and can be responsible for disease emergence in wildlife populations. Indeed, continuous populations favour the spread of the pathogen agent, conferring early infection on the young rarely leading to severe diseases. In contrast, in small isolated populations, the pathogen agent frequently disappears and the isolation of the host population prevents its rapid reintroduction. During the disease-free period, young animals lose their maternally derived protections without encountering infection. When the pathogenic agent is re-introduced, most individuals are fully susceptible and most infections are severe. Although in the past, it was accepted that population fragmentation reduced the level of infection of the population and thus reduced the impact of the pathogen (Hess 1994 (Hess , 1996 , more recent studies have shown that fragmentation also destabilizes the whole host-pathogen interaction.

Aiming to identify priorities for sustainable design, to frame environmental information, and to create a body of information about the impacts of buildings on the environment, the green building assessment systems are a type of indicators revealing key characteristics of important subsystems and elements of concern. As shown in Fig. 1 , the green building rating systems usually cover from global environmental impacts to indoor impacts (Burnett, 2007) . In recent years, these systems are expanding to assess neighborhoods, communities and cities (Sharifi & Murayama, 2013) . Understanding the green building rating systems is of great importance for urban planning and design (Retzlaff, 2008) . Buildings are an important part of the sustainable development and their environmental, economic and social impacts on cities are obvious. Although the environmental concern in urban planning is being given increasing attention, it remains secondary to economic and social priorities. Green building assessment systems rank environmental performance relative to typical practices, design codes, planning and engineering standards. Thus these rating systems can provide evidence for planning or policy system to judge the sustainability of buildings and to reduce the chance of arbitrary decisions (Yudelson, 2008) .",17.659866770356256,7.765786157138423

Indeed metagenomic and transcriptomic screens do find much viral derived material but generally dismiss this as often silenced junk. However, the regulatory consequence of this material and its ability to modify information networks is just now starting to receive serious attention. When persistent viral states and populations are disturbed, such as from the introduction of new species, the introduction of feral members, new interactions between groups, or commercial growth of large virus-free and homogeneous populations, we often observe large and devastating consequence to populations that do not harbor the virus. All populations in our virus-dominated world have thus been virus molded.

For example, following weather-related disasters there is a differential impact on deaths and well-being by gender, while children and the elderly, who are more likely to be based in and around the home, are more likely to be affected by flooding events with a rapid onset [35]. Indigenous populations are also likely to be greatly impacted due to their occupation of economically and politically marginal areas and fragile ecosystems [36]. Such variability needs to be incorporated into the development of any policies or interventions to improve adaptive capacity. There is evidence to suggest that individual weather-related extreme events can facilitate adaptations such as policy and regulatory change, as immediately afterwards the policy climate may be more conducive to change [37]. Yet pressure for a quick recovery and short-term risk reduction can actually result in greater vulnerability to future events [38, 39].

Here, we present a PHC research agenda shaped by regional PHC stakeholder perspectives, and reflect on disparities between the presently sparse evidence base and national evidence priorities. Across each of the five recommended focus areas, a major boost to PHC systems research and research capacity in the Pacific region is critical. The organisation of PHC services is chronically understudied in these small island nations and work across any PHC research domain would represent new knowledge and value add to the evidence base. We encourage a process of codesign between researchers, end-users and decision makers to align PHC research priorities from the outset. We also advocate for use of pragmatic but rigorous research methods that account for PHC system complexity, to accelerate regional learning and transferability of successful interventions.

We were therefore limited by the small Delphi panel size (only 22/179 (13%) invited participants agreed to join and 14/22 (64%) original panel members completed rounds 2 and 3). The initial response rate is reflective of response rates previously achieved by web-based Delphi research,24 and is a notable drawback of this virtual method of engagement that should be considered alongside benefits of efficiency and geographical reach. We were thus unable to highlight regional variation in priority evidence needs and reliably determine the areas of concordance and discordance between the literature-informed evidence gaps and stakeholder research priorities. The inability to include China stakeholders represents a significant limitation, particularly given the predominance of evidence from China PHC systems. Alternative approaches to engaging China PHC stakeholders in priority setting activities, including roundtable discussions or the face-to-face nominal group technique, are proposed in the future. Lack of expert panel representation from Pacific Island countries in the latter stages of the Delphi process also weakens the geographic relevance of identified research priorities. Clearly, the findings would need to be corroborated with both deeper engagement with panel members (perhaps through in-depth interviews) and broader engagement with a larger number of stakeholders from across the region.",32.331134596012326,13.351607592393757

The experiments demonstrated high basal STAT4 levels in NK cells (Fig. 5A). The trait was unique to NK cells, with only low proportions of total lymphocytes and T cells expressing STAT4 and only doing so at lower levels, and NK cells retained their unique high levels of STAT4 throughout infection (Fig. 5A). In contrast, all populations isolated from uninfected mice were low for STAT1, but expression in the NK cells was always slightly lower (Fig. 5B). Following LCMV infection, the total lymphocyte and T cell populations rapidly elevated STAT1 expression, with 80 to 95% of the populations expressing high levels of STAT1 by 40 h after infection (Fig. 5B to D). The peritoneal NK cells also had STAT1 levels induced during the infection, but in comparison to the other populations, there was a delay, requiring upwards of 8 to 16 h longer than total lymphocytes and T cells to reach 50% high levels of STAT1-expressing cells (Fig. 5B to E).

The morning session of the first day began with lectures of Bailin Hao (Fudan University, China) and John Findlay. Hao proposed a composition vector approach to analyze prokaryote phylogeny without sequence alignment. It is a systematic way of inferring evolutionary relatedness of microbial organisms from the oligopeptide content, that is, the frequency of amino acid K-strings in their complete proteomes. The method circumvents the ambiguity of choosing the genes for phylogenetic reconstruction and avoids the necessity of aligning sequences of essentially different lengths and gene contents. It can incorporate the effect of lateral gene transfer to some extent and leads to results comparable with the bacteriologists’ systematics as reflected in the Bergey’s Manual of Systematic Bacteriology. Findlay introduced a new tool for folding prediction and a new system for ligand delivery. He designed and used diagnostic amino acid residue fingerprints to predict protein structures and functions. The main interest of his laboratory is to examine the structure and mechanism of action of membrane proteins, particularly receptors and transport systems. The principle techniques used, dependent on the exact project, include protein chemistry, electrophysiology, molecular biology, protein mutation and expression, general membranology, and biophysical analysis (NMR, X-ray, and EM).

Andy Brass (University of Manchester, UK) presented numerous computational challenges involved in developing a computational infrastructure to meet the needs of systems biology. The challenges range from the technical demands of capturing and sharing data and meta-data from genome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome experiments to how we can provide an environment in which researchers can formulate and explore hypotheses across different “-omics” data types. He explored these issues, and described some of the systems they were developing to meet these data capture and integration needs, focusing particularly on the areas of data standards, ontology, and e-Science.",17.640784678698,8.317464067781117

As mentioned, the concept of public health is far from being static; it demonstrates a flexibility that guarantees a perpetual adaptation to new forms of risks attributable to the determinants of health. On the one hand, this flexibility is a consequence of the evolution of the notions of health, well-being, and illness, which are recognized as multifactorial phenomena. On the other hand, it is the result of developments in informational and biomedical technologies (50). As such, the flexibility of public health may allow it to embrace new research tools, such as genomics. However, how can this innovative tool be utilized to reach the public health objectives of protection, prevention, promotion, and surveillance? In order to insure its appropriate use, it is essential to take into account the State’s powers and responsibilities and to decide on the most suitable model of governance for this new biomedical research asset.

Thus, migrant research is chronically underfunded as research agencies are reluctant to award grants where rigorous methodology does not exist.3 Most studies on migrant mental well-being in Japan were community-based and used convenience or snowball sampling. Unsurprisingly, study populations were small, as half of studies enrolled less than 119 participants and only one publication included explicit sample size calculations.64 The study with by far the largest sample size, used government survey records from Hamamatsu, Ibaraki Prefecture, to study the social connectedness of 1252 Brazilians migrants.65 There were also four retrospective surveys of institutional medical records over several years identified by our study.27 52 54 60 Taking into account the difficulty of sampling, samples were viewed as often justifiable to measure specific communities but representative cross-sections of entire migrant populations. In contrast, in their systematic review of immigrant women in the perinatal period, Kita et al surveyed more than 10 studies with large samples sizes that reviewed Japanese medical or governmental records.46 Improving the rigour in migrant health research in Japan will require more analyses of health records and secondary analysis of government administered surveys like the large-scale surveys including migrants that are regularly carried out in the European Union.81

Population models are central to our efforts to assess the numerical and ecological status of species and threats posed by climate change. Models, however, are crude caricatures of complex ecological systems. So how do we construct reliable assessment models able to capture processes essential to predicating the impacts of global change on population viability without getting tied up in their vast complexities? We broach this question and demonstrate how models focusing at the level of the individual (i.e., agent-based models) are tools for developing robust, narratives to augment narratives arising purely from empirical data sources and experimental outcomes. We do this in the context of nesting social groups, foraging for food, while exhibiting territoriality and group-switching behavior; and, we evaluate the impact of disease on the viability of such populations. 7 laboratory at the microcosm scale [7], but for populations of most vertebrates such 8 microcosm studies are not applicable, and we need to resort to the mesocosm level [8] or 9 use alternative methods to obtain insights. One of these methods is to build simulation 10 models that incorporate demographic, spatial, movement, and other relevant behavioral 11 and community processes, and then compare simulations of these models across various 12 scenarios [9] or outcomes with and without epidemiological processes added to the mix. 13 We take this latter approach and our primary aim is to develop a tool that can be used 14 to study the impact of disease on colonial populations and metapopulations [10] . This 15 tool must be comprehensive enough to include critical processes needed to address 16 questions that will extend our current knowledge in significant ways.

If the interventions planned are too weak, the epidemic will not cease and the surge capacity of healthcare systems will be surpassed, leaving many individuals requiring hospitalization out of the attention they need. Furthermore, once policy makers realize the insufficiency of the interventions put in place, the epidemic may have spread up to a point such that only the most severe interventions will be of real use.
