Chronic bronchitis, pulmonary emphysema, and bronchial asthma may all be associated with airflow limitation; therefore, exacerbation of asthma may be associated with the pathophysiology of COPD. Furthermore, recent studies have suggested that the exacerbation of asthma, namely virus-induced asthma, may be associated with a wide variety of respiratory viruses. COPD and asthma have different underlying pathophysiological processes and thus require individual therapies. Exacerbation of both COPD and asthma, which are basically defined and diagnosed by clinical symptoms, is associated with a rapid decline in lung function and increased mortality. Similar pathogens, including human rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, and coronavirus, are also frequently detected during exacerbation of asthma and/or COPD. Immune response to respiratory viral infections, which may be related to the severity of exacerbation in each disease, varies in patients with both COPD and asthma. In this regard, it is crucial to recognize and understand both the similarities and differences of clinical features in patients with COPD and/or asthma associated with respiratory viral infections, especially in the exacerbative stage. In relation to definition, epidemiology, and pathophysiology, this review aims to summarize current knowledge concerning exacerbation of both COPD and asthma by focusing on the clinical significance of associated respiratory virus infections.",51.31122119510326,20.632686300570303

In Iran, the first cases of COVID-19 were officially announced between February 19 and 23, 2020 and it soon became clear that Iran is one of the countries that is worst-hit by COVID-19 outbreak (1, 2) . It is now evident that most cases of COVID-19 disease develop mild respiratory and constitutional symptoms (3), while some cases are asymptomatic (3, 4) . Involvement of other organs, including liver and kidneys has been reported in patients with COVID-19 (5). Many questions remain unanswered about associations and presentations of COVID-19. Shohada-e-Tajrish Hospital, a university hospital located in Tehran, Iran, was designated as one of the main centers providing diagnostic and healthcare services for patients suspected to be infected with the new virus. Here, we share our experience regarding computed tomography (CT) findings suggestive of COVID-19 disease among patients who underwent radiologic investigation due to traumatic injuries. Several trauma patients had findings on their chest and/or abdominal CT scans, which were suggestive or highly suggestive of COVID-19 (1). The findings were noted in the lung bases that were visible on an abdominal CT scan or on a clinically indicated spiral CT scan of the chest. The most frequent mechanisms of injury were fall and car accident. Conscious patients did not report dizziness or loss of consciousness before the trauma and most of them did not have any symptoms related to COVID-19 (e.g., fever, shortness of breath). To our knowledge, there is no study or report about the possible association between COVID-19 and trauma in the lit-erature. So, the mentioned observations could be just a coincidence, but this association could still be proposed as a research objective. The importance of this finding is that CT characteristics of COVID-19 could be seen in patients who were admitted to the hospitals not due to COVID-19 related symptoms, but because of chest and abdominal trauma. This issue should be considered by health care workers serving trauma patients and it should be kept in mind that during an outbreak of respiratory infections, in particular COVID-19 disease, every attempt should be made to protect the health and safety of the staff even when providing care for trauma patients.",43.41477469500079,20.51850954456787

Coronaviruses in fowls, as exemplified by the highly contagious IBV in chickens, can be highly lethal to young chicks. IBV is the etiological agent of infectious bronchitis, an avian disease that is mainly associated with upper respiratory and urogenital tract infections in adult chickens, and to a lesser extent, nephrogenic infections, or inflammation of the kidneys [6, 7] . The impact of IBV infection is also emphatically increased as a consequence of its enhancement of diseases associated with lethal co-infections by bacteria and mycoplasmas [8, 9] . Domestic animals such as cats and dogs are also susceptible to coronaviruses. Feline coronaviruses, especially feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV)-a mutation of Feline Enteric Coronavirus (FECV), may induce lethal diseases in cats [10] , while canine coronavirus (CCoV) infections, which cause canine enteric illness in dogs, are prevalent as well [11] . In larger livestock like pigs and cattle, on the other hand, coronaviruses and arteriviruses typically establish enteric infections. An infection or outbreak can cause severe economic losses from the death of young offspring, lifelong impact on the yield of animal produce such as eggs and milk, weight losses and the general health of the population. Bovine coronavirus (BCV), for example, causes Winter Dysentery (WD) in adult cows and diarrhea in young calves [12] .",38.92471700293884,18.227530867696533

It is becoming evident that a number of factors, including multiple microorganisms, often act synergistically to create a certain clinical picture. This is particularly evident in, for example, complex respiratory and enteric diseases. Known major respiratory viruses include porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), swine Influenza A virus (swine AIV), and pseudorabies virus (PRV); porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) are also believed to be involved [1, 2] . It is highly plausible that other viruses could be of importance as well, but they have been overlooked. Some reasons for this could be that diagnostic labs are not searching actively for them, because they are not believed to be involved in respiratory diseases, or because they have not even been discovered yet. Additionally, it is known that the combination of viruses and/or bacteria, as well as different management and environmental factors, are of importance.

However, SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be caused by a novel coronavirus not seen before.

Smoking, periodontitis, and microbiomes-all prominent environmental risk factors for RA-interact with mucosal surfaces including the lungs, oral mucosa, and gastrointestinal tract [4] . It is thought that these local tissue stresses on the mucosa lead to post-translational modification of peptides involved in RA pathogenesis [2, 5, 6] . Initial respiratory virus infections usually involve both the oral mucosa and the lungs, and this may be relevant to the generation of immune responses potentially associated with RA development. Previous studies suggest that RA exhibits seasonal tendencies, whereby RA onset is more frequent in winter [7] , and relapses are more frequent in summer [8] . Thus, we hypothesized that respiratory viral infections that exhibit seasonality may be associated with RA development. This hypothesis is supported by studies investigating other autoimmune diseases [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Multiple sclerosis which exhibits seasonal tendencies has been associated with upper respiratory picornavirus, rhinovirus, and influenza infections [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] .

However, it is important to note this is not specific to COVID-19. Indeed, one review stated that the WHO does not currently recommend corticosteroids in other viral diseases, like Dengue as the 'glucocorticoid-mediated stimulation of the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal axis can also drive lymphocytopenia, or it may promote exaggerated pro-inflammatory responses that eventually cause a worsening of the pathogenic condition'. These are unprecedented times for the medical community and although evidence suggests a potential role for the use of NSAIDs and corticosteroids in COVID-19 treatment, caution should be exercised until further evidence, specific to this infection strain, emerges.

Also, a stronger immune response in women could affect this difference [33] . Stronger immunity to pathogens in women is associated with lower viral loads and lower prevalence of infections than in men, but it may also be associated with increased severity of disease symptoms [34] . For example, HIV-positive women tend to exhibit less circulating HIV RNA than HIV-positive men, but they are reportedly at a 1.6-fold higher risk of developing AIDS [35] . Fatality following exposure to pathogenic influenza A viruses is higher in women [36, 37] .

Use of subjective fever as criteria for respiratory illness rather than use of a measured temperature may have also decreased our ability to detect respiratory illnesses. We also did not conduct surveillance before 17 weeks gestation, and, therefore, it is possible that some women had infections earlier in pregnancy that we were not able to identify in our study. Gestational age dating was limited by lack of first-trimester ultrasound; however, 5-weekly prospective home surveillance minimized maternal recall error of last menstrual periods. Illness episode severity measures, such as radiographic evidence of pneumonia or use of supplemental oxygen, were not evaluated because medical records of healthcare visits were not reviewed in this study. We were also unable to assess medical comorbidities in the participants, given the lack of access to primary or antenatal care in the study region. Other limitations include lack of detection of bacterial pathogens in this study. Human rhinovirus infections have been shown to augment respiratory bacterial colonization and infection; therefore, it is possible that bacterial infections may be contributing to the described febrile illnesses and play a role in the relationship with LBW. Mid-nasal samples were only obtained once weekly, and brief episodes of viral shedding, as commonly observed in adults with pre-existing immunity, could have been missed. The association of virologic factors, such as viral load or subtype, with disease severity, were also unable to be assessed due to a lack of a method to quantify rhinovirus by our RT-PCR assay and our limited ability to sequence the majority of the isolates. The study was performed within a single geographic locale with specific demographics and risk factors, compromising generalizability. Finally, because this is an observational study, we were unable to assess for a causal association between rhinovirus febrile respiratory illness and LBW.

Media use promotes healthy practices as it provides a means of communicating and explaining healthcare-related knowledge to the population [22] . The population is positively or negatively influenced by media in addition to medical staff and family members relative to critical behavioral decisions such as being vaccinated. For example, pregnant women using the Internet are influenced by other pregnant women's positive experiences with vaccinations [23] . Health information seeking behavior and use of media significantly influence healthy lifestyles, early diagnosis, and sensible disease management [24] . Meanwhile, vaccination rates were higher with female respondents that have high income levels, or underlying diseases. Those suffering from chronic diseases were more attuned to the significance of disease prevention. Respondents sought disease-related information more often than those that are healthy. Such tendencies regarding information seeking promoted disease prevention behavior such as being vaccinated, consistent with results of previous studies [15, 17] .

We only investigated the primary infection of influenza virus, and in this situation, the aged mice were more resistant than the young mice. But in the clinic, many factors might contribute to severe outcome after IAV infection, such as secondary opportunistic bacterial infections [61] . Moreover, our results support the hypothesis that the ""cytokine storm"" is one of the main cases of the high mortality rates in highly pathologic viral infections, such as SARS and H5N1 infections, in the young people rather than the aged population [23, 25] . Aging is a continuum of changes that are progressive with time. The decline of immune functions with ageing might also be a gradual and progressive process. Therefore, from young to ageing, there is a gradual decline in the strength and speed of the host immune responses against viral infections. For some highly pathogenic viral infections, the excessively strong immune responses initiated in the young host might be harmfully for the host because of severe pathological damage. On the other hand, low strength of immune responses in the aged host might result in viral persistence. However, during the whole continuum changes, there might be a balance point where the moderate immune responses are still capable to clear the infection while with reduced pathologic damage, which are beneficial for the host. This model is illustrated in Fig.7 . This balance point might vary with different virus, infecting dose and route.",42.74051275961608,19.30947129020645

As many as 40% of patients hospitalized with influenza-like illness are reported to be infected with more than one type of virus. However, it is not clear whether these infections are more severe than single viral infections. Mathematical models can be used to help us understand the dynamics of respiratory viral coinfections and their impact on the severity of the illness. Most models of viral infections use ordinary differential equations (ODE) that reproduce the average behavior of the infection, however, they might be inaccurate in predicting certain events because of the stochastic nature of viral replication cycle. Stochastic simulations of single virus infections have shown that there is an extinction probability that depends on the size of the initial viral inoculum and parameters that describe virus-cell interactions. Thus the coinfection dynamics predicted by the ODE might be difficult to observe in reality. Results: In this work, a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) model is formulated to investigate probabilistic outcomes of coinfections. This CTMC model is based on our previous coinfection model, expressed in terms of a system of ordinary differential equations. Using the Gillespie method for stochastic simulation, we examine whether stochastic effects early in the infection can alter which virus dominates the infection. Conclusions: We derive extinction probabilities for each virus individually as well as for the infection as a whole. We find that unlike the prediction of the ODE model, for similar initial growth rates stochasticity allows for a slower growing virus to out-compete a faster growing virus.",43.25567762082747,18.68145145981586

Prevalence of Underlying Diseases in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19: a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"The key problems surrounding this novel virus are as follows: diagnosis, mode of transmission, long incubation period (3 to 14 days), predicting the number of infected cases in the community, and insufficient protection resources due to its pandemic specification (15, 18) . The accurate transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown, since various factors impact its transmission. Moreover, infection of family clusters and healthcare workers indicate the human to human transmission of the disease and its contagiousness, which makes the condition more complicated (19, 20) . Since SARS-CoV-2 is a newly identified pathogen, there is no pre-existing immunity to it in the human community, also there is no definitive cure to interrupt or reduce its astonishing spread. These ambiguities make the condition more serious for vulnerable members of the community, which include individuals with immune problems, co-existing comorbidity and elderly people. Despite the novelty of the topic, there are a lot of proposed studies about history, transmission route, urgency of responding, pathogenic potential characteristics and prevention strategies but there are still some underlying diseases that have remained unknown (21) . According to the current analysis, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, kidney disease, smoking, and COPDs were among the most prevalent underlying diseases among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. In terms of pre-existing medical conditions, cardiovascular diseases had the highest prevalence among diseases that put patients at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 threats. Decreasing the proinflammatory cytokines, which leads to a weaker immune function may account for this condition (2, 22) . It is worth noting that similar results were found regarding MERS (23) . We also found that smokers are more susceptible to Coronavirus infections, especially to the most recent species. Various reasons may justify this happening. It has been mentioned that smokers have unregulated ACE2 in remodeled cell types, which is consistent with results of SARS studies. However, factors such as amount of smoking, the duration of smoking, and the duration of smoking cessation also play a role. In some previous studies on MERS-CoV-2 it has been shown that dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4), which is the specific receptor for this virus, had a higher rate of expression in smokers and COPD patients (24) . Although the results of the current analysis indicate that smoking can be an underlying factor that makes people susceptible to COVID-19 complications, in some studies, especially COVID-19 related studies, no strong evidence has been found regarding the correlation of COPD and smoking with being infected with this new virus. But the important point that must be taken into consideration is that the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection is more severe in COPD cases and smokers (25) . As mentioned in the results section, patients with malignancies are more in danger than those without any tumor. Anticancer treatments such as chemotherapy and surgery put this group into an immunosuppressive state and subsequently at higher risk of MERS-CoV-2 infection (26) . Among those with malignancies, lung cancer patients seems to be more susceptible, and they must follow guidance on restricting any contact with possible infected zones or individuals for their safety (14) . Possible risk factors for progressive and severe illness may include the above-mentioned factors but are not limited to them; pregnancy and old age are other risky conditions, which should be monitored meticulously. However, there is no clear evidence about the risk of transmission of COVID-19 to the newborn during vaginal delivery or transmission via breastfeeding but care and protection of newborns against possible exposure to infection or contaminated conditions such as maternal breast contamination must be observed. Since MERS-CoV-2 is an emerging virus, no specific treatment is currently available (27, 28) , and pathophysiology of this condition is still unknown. Therefore, general prevention measures such as the following should be followed: Washing hands frequently and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, and mouth with contaminated hands, avoiding close contact ,especially with those who have fever, coughing or sneezing, avoiding contact with live animals and consuming raw animal products (29) . There are some responsibilities for health policymakers in this critical condition: Screening of travelers, triage all patients on admission and immediately isolating all suspected and confirmed cases, providing protective gear, preparing local guidance and instructions for people, especially for high risk groups (30, 31) . To the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis that estimates the prevalence of underlying diseases in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Given that most studies on CoVID-19 are in an early stage, and there are some limitations such as small number of studies, and reports being restricted to China and a few other countries, due to the pandemic nature of the disease, specific patterns should be introduced for different groups, including people with underlying diseases, to minimize the harm. Based on the experiences gained on this disease during this short time, a strong recommendation for all people, clinicians, and policymakers is to guide people to protect themselves to avoid being exposed to SARS-CoV-2, whenever possible (32) . Another very important advice to patients with underlying diseases during the epidemics like the one caused by the novel virus is to follow guidance on travel restrictions.

Approximately 25 percent of pregnant women who develop pneumonia will need to be hospitalized in critical care units and require ventilatory support [16] . Although bacterial pneumonia is a serious disease when it occurs in pregnant women, even when the agent(s) are susceptible to antibiotics, viral pneumonia has even higher levels of morbidity and mortality during pregnancy [18] . As with other infectious diseases, the normal maternal physiologic changes that accompany pregnancy-including altered cell-mediated immunity [19] and changes in pulmonary function-have been hypothesized to affect both susceptibility to and clinical severity of pneumonia [20] [21] [22] . This has been evident historically during previous epidemics. The case fatality rate (CFR) for pregnant women infected with influenza during the 1918-1919 pandemic was 27%-even higher when exposure occurred during the 3rd trimester and upwards of 50% if pneumonia supervened [23] . During the 1957-1958 Asian flu epidemic, 10% of all deaths occurred in pregnant women, and their CFR was twice as high as that of infected women who were not pregnant [24] .

Acute pre-school wheeze and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) are other common causes of emergency visits with possible viral etiology. There is an increasing prevalence of these airways diseases, rising treatment costs, and therefore virus-induced respiratory illnesses are a heavy burden for patients and the community 4, 5 .

In particular; asthma development has been linked to wheezing-associated respiratory viral infections in early life. To understand underlying mechanisms of viral-induced airways disease; investigators have studied respiratory viral infections in small animals. This report reviews animal models of human respiratory viral infection employing mice; rats; guinea pigs; hamsters and ferrets. Investigators have modeled asthma exacerbations by infecting mice with allergic airways disease. Asthma development has been modeled by administration of virus to immature animals.

Viral epidemics are a socio-economic burden that causes short-and long-term costs for disease diagnosis and treatment as well as a loss in productivity by absenteeism. These outbreaks and their socio-economic costs underline the necessity for a precise analysis of virus-host interactions, which would help to understand disease mechanisms and to develop therapeutic interventions. The combination of quantitative measurements and dynamic mathematical modeling has increased our understanding of the within-host infection dynamics and has led to important insights into viral pathogenesis, transmission, and disease progression. Furthermore, virus-host models helped to identify drug targets, to predict the treatment duration to achieve cure, and to reduce treatment costs. In this article, we review important achievements made by mathematical modeling of viral kinetics on the extracellular, intracellular, and multi-scale level for Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Hepatitis C Virus, Influenza A Virus, Ebola Virus, Dengue Virus, and Zika Virus. Herein, we focus on basic mathematical models on the population scale (so-called target cell-limited models), detailed models regarding the most important steps in the viral life cycle, and the combination of both. For this purpose, we review how mathematical modeling of viral dynamics helped to understand the virus-host interactions and disease progression or clearance.

Our findings, from a population consisting of crowded households, lower levels of maternal education and fewer children attending school compared to other household transmission studies, suggest that differences in socio-demographic, cultural and environmental contexts influence household transmission risk factors, including the source of household introduction. As we actively surveyed all women of childbearing age for pregnancy, our cohort is generalisable to households with young infants in Southern Nepal, a region representative of rural South Asia [17] . In the Sarlahi district during the study period, an estimated 25% of the population were below the poverty line and approximately 30% of infants were born low birthweight and 20% preterm [26, 27] . Households in our study were crowded with over one-third containing >4 people per room and multiple family units frequently living in a single structure. The average population is young; the median age in the Sarlahi district was 20 years [18] . Eighty-four per cent of households used indoor biofuel cookstoves and half contained latrines. Young demographics, crowded housing conditions and socio-economic factors may influence the patterns of respiratory (a and b) . Each row represents an individual, each unfilled symbol represents 1 day of symptoms, black filled symbols represent positive specimen collection and varying symbols represent household member type. Index cases are those whose symptoms first appear before the initial RSV-positive specimen. [36] . This socio-demographic, environmental and cultural context should be considered when implementing preventative strategies for the control of respiratory viral illness, such as vaccines, antivirals, hygienic measures and physical barriers. For example, there are multiple RSV vaccines targeting diverse populations from infants and children to pregnant women and other adults in various stages of clinical trials [10] . Because the immune systems of neonates generally do not respond well to primary vaccination, immunizing mothers and other household members has been proposed as a method to protect vulnerable young infants from RSV [37] . While a model of Kenya transmission data supports immunizing school-age children to diminish transmission of the virus to infants, our study suggests that in rural South Asia, preschool-age children are more likely to transmit respiratory viruses to other household members [38] . This suggests that a 'one-size fits all' approach to RSV vaccine implementation, or other respiratory viral transmission prevention measures, may not be effective as transmission dynamics may differ across global settings.",46.536812357544896,20.016188747042417

HRV infections can pose severe health risks in patients with pre-existing airway conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma or cystic fibrosis. This may relate to the observation that HRVs are not limited to the upper respiratory tract but also infect the lower respiratory tracts [4] . Two receptor groups have been defined for the species A and B viruses. The minor group viruses comprise twelve members utilizing low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) proteins for cell entry, and the major group uses the intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) [5] . These infections are typically pH-dependent and require the passage of viruses through acidic endosomal compartments.

Using a simple transmission model that incorporates age-stratified social mixing patterns, we present a novel method for characterizing the transmission potential of subcritical infections, which have effective reproduction number R<1, from readily available data on the size of outbreaks. We show that the model can identify the extent to which outbreaks are driven by inherent pathogen transmissibility and pre-existing population immunity, and can generate unbiased estimates of the effective reproduction number. Applying the method to real-life infections, we obtained accurate estimates for the degree of age-specific immunity against monkeypox, influenza A(H5N1) and A(H7N9), and refined existing estimates of the reproduction number. Our results also suggest minimal pre-existing immunity to MERS-CoV in humans.

Furthermore, the limited cancer patient population described in this first report from the literature, was curiously characterized by the lack of individuals receiving anticancer immunotherapy. Indeed, only chemotherapy and surgery were cited among treatments received by patients in the month prior to developing COVID-19. Maybe, this could simply be due to the casualty of a small sample, or otherwise, it could suggest that cancer patients receiving immunotherapy are less prone to develop COVID-19 or to be admitted in hospital due to severe coronavirus symptoms. Currently, we are aware of the probably higher incidence of misdiagnosed coronavirus infections compared with that reported and updated every day; it is likely that a great portion of healthy and young population develop COVID-19 with mild symptoms, not requiring hospital admittance and thus escaping the laboratory confirmation of the disease [7] .

More specifically, in the last few decades, the emergences of several zoonoses such as avian influenza (AI) H5N1 or H7N9, the middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) in the Arabic peninsula, Q-fever in the Netherland or Ebola in Western Africa have each time been considered as unprecedented events. We understand some of the reasons for these emergence events retrospectively, but we fail to predict them adequately. These emergences of zoonoses are of particular human health concerns. They caused several hundred human infections with high fatality rates and AI and MERS, for example, could gain the capacity to transmit between humans, and to cause epidemics of unknown magnitude and impact. We argue that the failure to predict these emergences may be due to two main reasons. First, predictions are most often based on what is currently known of a disease and its risk factors where it circulates, but we fail to consider factors that could be important in different areas or under different conditions. Second, gradual changes in anthropogenic, environmental and wildlife factors are difficult to monitor, and the result of their potential interactions through different conditional feedback loops are inherently difficult to predict. Recognizing these challenges, the FAO publication ""World Livestock 2013: changing disease landscapes"" [2] proposed to structure the understanding and mitigation of emerging zoonoses by considering the pressure, state and response framework used in environmental sciences. The description and understanding of pressures is somewhat larger than the classical focus on risk factors, as it entails looking at broad-scale spatio-temporal pattern of changes in generic anthropogenic, environmental and wildlife drivers of change. For example, the description of changes in animal trade networks in response to new socioeconomic conditions may influence a broader set of diseases that can transmit through those trade networks. Similarly, political and socio-economic instability and migration crises have disruptive implications for many human and animal diseases alongside other environmental and wildlife factors. Studying the state strives to understand how changes in pressures have resulted in disease outcomes, or may influence disease outcome in the future. It is disease-specific and aims towards a fine understanding of the mechanisms by which changes in those anthropogenic, environmental and wildlife drivers may influence the emergence, spread or persistence of a particular disease. Finally, the response looks at the different options of intervention at the pressure or state level to prevent emerging zoonoses or to mitigate their impact [2] . In this paper, we discuss different sets of pressures that can be linked to emerging zoonoses, taking avian influenza as an example. Pressures typically include anthropogenic (trade of live animals and animal products, distribution of farms and livestock, farming practices, farmers' behavior, product price and farmer's income, hunting practices, game animal transport, short-term mobility and migration of populations, socio-economic instabilities, state of veterinary services, regulation), environmental (climatic variables, land-use, land-cover, habitat connectivity) and wild-host related drivers (wildlife or vector distribution and population dynamics, vector capacity, reservoir capacity).",42.29694857216202,17.34748318896406

The political commitment for prevention activities will often be less than that for a reactive response elicited by the emergence of a terrifying new infectious disease. However, political support may be improved if surveillance is made to be, and appear, more cost-effective, by focusing on specific diseases 22 in population subgroups who live in ecologically fragile hotspots. 14, 21 There is substantial overlap between areas considered to be hotspots for zoonotic disease spillover and those considered hotspots for HIV, perhaps the best known zoonotic virus. 14, 53 This overlap opens a real possibility of merging attempts to detect zoonotic disease spillover with pre-existing population-based systems that have been used to investigate the HIV epidemic for several decades. For example, the Demographic and Health Surveys Program is implemented globally in settings without high-quality civil registration and has extensive experience in collecting integrated biological-behavioural surveillance data in community settings. 54 Integrated surveillance will never be a viable alternative to traditional clinical disease surveillance for assessing active viral infections. Rather, it can serve to complement virus detection efforts, by potentially identifying pandemic threats before the need for large-scale clinical intervention. As current behaviours may not reflect the behaviours that originally exposed the individuals who are found seropositive to the virus of interest, both current and lifetime behaviours need to be investigated. This is the strategy that has proved successful in identifying subtle exposure risks in the field of HIV, such as backloading of syringes with drug solution by injecting drug users. 55 In identifying specific behavioural risk factors, integrated biological-behavioural surveillance will be most effective when the reported syndromic symptoms are recent, e.g. occurring in the previous 12 months, and their probable association with a zoonotic virus can be confirmed by a positive serological test result.",43.43363268246717,19.568711293485396

The early increase of proinflammatory mediators and the augmented levels of IFN-γ explain the ability of L. rhamnosus CRL1505 to diminish viral replication while the improved production of IL-10 would lead to a beneficial modulation of the immune-coagulative response which results in a reduced severity of lung damage.

Despite the Chinese authorities have announced relevant policies and actuating principles in a strategic manner, the COVID-19 outbreak has posted an emerging serious challenge for the mental health services in China. There are some limitations that need to be addressed. First, several online mental health services have been constructed across different areas, however, unified national management and coordination policies are still inadequate, which could result in uneven distribution and wastage of medical resources, let alone evaluating the efficacy of these services. Second, online mental health services are the predominant assistance measure and therefore, some people (e.g., older adults) who may have limited access to smartphones and the broadband internet, may benefit less from the services [42] . Third, frontline health professionals may have limited time and energy to access to these services due to heavy workload. Fourth, based on experiences of SARS outbreak, some patients and health professionals would be traumatized by the COVID-2019 outbreak and still suffer from persistent psychiatric symptoms even after the outbreak [43] .

Moreover, the higher health care expenditure of the households reduces investment for nutritional food for the family members, investment for farming or business, and the children education.

When analyzing a pandemic outbreak one must view the impact on the economy as a whole. One study presented at a forum conducted by the Australian Center for Economic Research on Health performed an in-depth analysis of a pandemic influenza and its alteration of global economic output [32] . This study by Sidorenko et al. divided a potential pandemic into four scenarios: mild, moderate, severe, and ultra, with each based on the mortality rate of a possible pandemic and their resulting economic consequences [32] . These divisions are necessary when analyzing a hypothetical pandemic because the potential economic impact varies depending on the severity of the virus. The estimated death total in the United States for these four scenarios would be 20, 201, 1,000.9, and 2,018.9 (in thousands), respectively. These estimates are multiplied by 2x to 10x if estimating mortality in developing countries. Examining the estimates for the economic impact in the US alone, the estimated reductions in gross domestic product (GDP) for these four categories are −0.58%, −1.38%, −3.00%, and −5.50%, respectively [32] . Globally, a mild pandemic like the current 2009 H1N1 virus would cost USD $330 billion or 0.8% GDP. An ultra pandemic, akin to the 1918 Influenza A virus, is estimated to have a substantial global economic impact with a cost of USD $4.4 trillion or 12.6% GDP [32] . The astounding economic cost is a result of decreased productivity, changes in behavior (i.e., avoidance of public places, going to work, etc.), adjusted interest rates, inflation, and shear shock to the public and society. Specifically, in an ultra pandemic the study estimated an additional 2.22% rise in inflation in the United States, a 9.6% decrease in exports, and −101 basis point reduction in short-term interest rates [32] . Given that the US is a first world society with a modern health care system capable of combating a potential pandemic, these totals are even more pronounced when looking at projections for the developing world. In sum, the developing world death rates and GDP reductions would be far greater than the US. The economic impact in the developing world would be substantial due to the shock from human loss of life as well as the flow of capital from emerging markets to ""safe havens"" such as the US and the EU [32] . While the ultra pandemic is an extremely rare event one never hopes to encounter, these astounding numbers underscore the need for rapid targeted treatments. The emergence of antiviral resistant strains indicates the need for the harnessing of DNA synthesis as a means to develop target therapeutics to replace current antivirals. These de novo DNA-based therapeutics could be customized to sequences as they are isolated in the field, allowing for adaptability of treatment.",40.92694071527444,15.919930431829322

As reported herein, four pregnant women were confirmed to have the COVID-19 infection in our medical center, which is designated as one of the treatment centers for pregnant women with the COVID-19 infection. Importantly, we found neither SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic positivity nor immediate evidence of symptomatic COVID-19 among the infants born to the symptomatic, test-positive mothers.",66.13064858055857,26.208554053881382

Respiratory viral pathogens were present in 75.1% of our samples, which is largely higher than other studies in which from 37% to 48% of the samples were positive [20, 21, 22, 23] . These differences could be due to seasonality, environmental factors, socio-economic status and certainly to the high specificity of our inclusion criteria. Indeed, in the study by Brittain-Long et al. all respiratory infections regardless of symptoms were included; Druce et al. included hospitalized cases in their study only for 5 months of the year. In our study, we defined ILI as fever and cough with at least two of listed symptoms (sore throat, rhinorrhea, headache and muscular pain, for a maximum duration of 3 days). Among infected patients, FLUAV (27.3%), HRV (24.8%) and RSV (21.2%) were the most common pathogens detected. We found that patients presenting to clinics with ILIs were more frequently children less than 5 years (49.2%). Viral etiology was also more frequent in patient in this age group (54.0%) and coinfections were statistically more frequent when compared to patient $5 years (P-value = 0.02). These data were very similar to a previous study from Ravaoarinoro et al. in which 54% of ARI in hospitalized infants less than 10 years had a viral etiology [17] . We found that RSV was the most common virus in children under 5 years. The likelihood of detecting RSV was higher in this age group, compared to those $5 years (OR = 10.1). The importance of RSV as etiological agent for ILIs in children might have an impact in hospitalized children with upper and lower respiratory tract infections as observed by El Hajjee et al., and Dicarlo et al.

There is no valid information available on pregnant women and their complications. But given previous epidemics (SARS and MERS), as well as mental and physical changes during pregnancy (2) , pregnant women are more likely to be affected by the virus. On the other hand, the Coronavirus epidemic has created stress and anxiety for pregnant women in different parts of the world. Concern and stress in pregnancy are associated with side effects such as preeclampsia, depression, increased nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, preterm labor, low birth weight, and low APGAR score (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . In the Coronavirus pandemic, pregnant women cited the following reasons for their concerns: -Many pregnant women have had a birth plan before the pandemic, but are currently worried about how their families (mothers) will be present, given the urban and quarantine constraints; moreover, even if there is no inter-urban restriction, they may be worried about their families being infected during transportation. -Many pregnant women do not go to visit their physicians due to concerns that they may be exposed to the Coronavirus in the hospital environment or on the way to the hospital and may be post-term. Or on the contrary, due to stress and worry they want an early termination and elective cesarean section. -Many pregnant mothers are employed and constantly use sodium hypochlorite and alcohol detergents to control and prevent the virus, which can lead to poisoning. Some other pregnant mothers might become highly stressed and anxious, and overuse these detergents. Increasing mothers' awareness about the transmission of Coronavirus, risk factors, and red flags, as well as providing tele-counseling for pregnancy care and tele-triage could help reduce their anxiety and worry.

Indeed, detecting their existence on the field is not easy, due to complex networks of indirect effects making it difficult to infer underlying processes. Field studies are however essential as experimental systems are oversimplified and require an existing suspicion of interaction between the studied parasites. In addition, only studies in natural populations can give access to infection and co-infection probabilities. In other words, before studying their mechanisms in the lab, interactions of interest must be identified in the field. Main difficulties encountered in field studies are methodological. Many confounding factors can create statistical associations between parasites even if there is no true biological interaction between them, which may alter conclusions about the importance of interspecific interactions [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] . A similar transmission mode, for example, can alone increase the risk of co-infection. The excess of positive associations found in strongylid communities in domestic horses, ruminants and macropod marsupials is in particular likely to be due to the common habit of these hosts feeding on pastures contaminated with the larvae of a number of nematode species [41] [42] [43] . In addition, environmental, behavioural or host-specific factors can be associated with both types of infection and influence epidemiological and geographic patterns of infection and disease. Among such common risk factors, some have long been recognised, such as sexual behaviours for sexually transmitted diseases (e.g., [44] ), socio-economic status for infections particularly prevalent in poor regions such as helminth infection and malaria [45] , or age for many diseases (e.g., [46] ). As apparent associations between two infections may be due to common risk factors, they are crucial to identify and to take into account in the analysis.

As the first virusbased vaccines have been approved by the FDA, their evaluation as early line treatments instead of last line becoming more likely. The immunogenicity of in situ administered viral vectors acts as a double-edged sword. The activation of DCs by viral vectors through recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns by pattern recognition receptors, such as TLRs, obviates the need for adjuvant (161, 162) . Moreover, type I IFN-driven antiviral immunity is characterized by a T H 1 response. Therefore, strong CTL responses are generated against TAAs that are delivered by viral vectors, as these are sensed as viral antigens. However, this immunogenicity entails that immunity is also build against viral components. This antiviral immunity precludes repeated injection of the viral vaccine, hampers prolonged transgene expression, neutralizes the vaccine and hinders the strength of TAA-specific cellular immunity (163, 164) . Importantly, most of the clinically evaluated vectors like pox-and adenoviral vectors, show pre-existing immune responses in the host (165) . A careful review of the literature on the topic of pre-existing immunity to viral vectors, suggests that this is indeed a hindrance. How preexisting immunity impacts on the viral vaccine efficacy depends on the natural immunity to the vector. In essence all viral infections can elicit robust B and T cell memory responses (166) , which can reduce antigen delivery by the viral vector due to neutralizing antibodies (167) . Moreover, the pre-existing antiviral response will lead to rapid vector clearance and as such reduce exposure of the heterologous antigen (TAA) to the immune system. Finally, the immune response could focus on the strong viral antigens and ""ignore"" the co-expressed TAAs via the process of ""epitope dominance."" Importantly, several approaches have been applied to avoid the downsides of pre-existing vector immunity, such as the use of vectors derived from non-human sources or from rare serotypes (83, 168) . An alternative approach is provided by the ""prime-boost"" regimen in which two different recombinant viral vaccines expressing the same TAA are used consecutively (169) . What's more, one can also alter the viral surface epitopes (envelope or capsid proteins) that might elicit neutralizing antibodies (170, 171) . The inhibitory effect of preexisting immunity can also be avoided by masking the viral vector inside DCs as discussed in the section on adenoviral-based vaccines (172) . Besides, mucosal or high dose vaccination have also been shown to overcome pre-existing immunity problems (164, (173) (174) (175) . A recent study showed that COX2 inhibitors, such as Celecoxib, can prevent the generation of neutralizing antibodies to vaccinia, allowing repeated administration without losing infectivity (176) . Pre-existing immunity is however not an issue for all virus-based vaccines. For instance, the majority of the population has never been in contact with lentiviruses, making their vector derivatives attractive candidates for further vaccine development. Therefore, it may not be a surprise that the only lentiviral vaccine (LV305) that has been clinically evaluated in a handful of trials, all showed improved and durable responses in sarcoma patients (109, 110) .",39.09071348590554,16.47167853781596

Thus, healthier persons will move towards better socioeconomic positions, compared to less healthier, leading to inequalities. (b)""Social causation"" proposes that a range of unequally spread material, psycho-social and behavioural factors, give rise to inequalities in health outcomes [6, 7] . Material factors include varying income levels and investments across infrastructure beneficial to the community. Psychosocial factors are the chronic stresses that arise from perceptions and experiences of personal status in an unequal society. Behavioral factors are, for example, the higher rates of smoking observed in poorer groups that lead to differential rates of diseases and mortality [8, 9] . (c) A ""life course perspective"" suggests that a multitude of factors across the life span (e.g. maternal malnutrition during fetal period, poor educational facilities in childhood, occupations with physical hazards etc.) determine and manifest disease trends observed over time. The ecosocial approach attempts to integrate these ecological, social and biological factors in disease causation through a dynamic process of their 'embodiment' i.e. ""we literally incorporate biological influences from the material and social world"" [10, 11] . There are several biological pathways that explain how social environment gets 'embodied' on health. One is the 'stress biology approach' whereby stress leads to chronic stimulation of the hypothalamo-pituitaryadrenal axis and the resultant hormonal changes increase risks of hypertension, insulin resistance, and hyperglycaemia [6] . The other relates to the advancing field of epigenetics, i.e. non-genetic modifiers of gene expression that are transmitted to future generation. They provide an explanation as to how environmental effects convert to lasting physiological changes and behavioral changes. An example is how psychological stress alters DNA methylation and histones in stress-sensitive brain regions such as the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex. These changes modulate subsequent gene expression [12] . Another pathway is through modifications of telomeres in dividing somatic cells. Telomeres are DNA repeat sequences, which together with accompanying telomere-binding proteins, cap and protect chromosome ends. Their length shortens with each cycle of replication, which is an expression of accelerated ageing as this process ultimately leads to a loss of capacity to replicate. It has been shown that lower socio-economic groups demonstrate shortening of the length of telomeres, thus suggesting that these groups acquire features of accelerated ageing with its consequences [13, 14] .",42.17664293476083,18.410985364614408

Such respiratory virus infections contribute to morbidity and mortality for a number of reasons. Firstly, HCT recipients suffer from prolonged immunosuppression and a lack of both humoral and T cell-mediated immunity impairs viral clearance (Kohlmeier and Woodland, 2009; Schmidt and Varga, 2018) . In addition, these patients are usually antibody-depleted and the strength of the conditioning regimen and the ongoing immunosuppressive therapy diminishes the antiviral immune response further. Moreover, the type of graft may have an impact on the immune response and pediatric HCT recipients may also be immunologically naïve because of their age. Secondly, viral factors shape the outcome. Respiratory viruses vary in their pathogenicity, i.e., they cause more severe disease compared with other viruses.

Answering this question requires accurate forecasting the spread of confirmed cases as well as analysis of the number of deaths and recoveries. Forecasting, however, requires ample historical data. At the same time, no prediction is certain as the future rarely repeats itself in the same way as the past. Moreover, forecasts are influenced by the reliability of the data, vested interests, and what variables are being predicted. Also, psychological factors play a significant role in how people perceive and react to the danger from the disease and the fear that it may affect them personally. This paper introduces an objective approach to predicting the continuation of the COVID-19 using a simple, but powerful method to do so. Assuming that the data used is reliable and that the future will continue to follow the past pattern of the disease, our forecasts suggest a continuing increase in the confirmed COVID-19 cases with sizable associated uncertainty. The risks are far from symmetric as underestimating its spread like a pandemic and not doing enough to contain it is much more severe than overspending and being over careful when it will not be needed.

For example, in 2009, there was much interest in whether morbid obesity (or obesity in general) was predictive of worse outcome in infection with the novel pandemic strain of influenza A/H1N1 [34] .The primary goal was to improve estimates of clinical prognosis, although observations about prognosis could later be used to generate causal hypotheses for further testing. Similarly, observations of disparate rates of severe outcomes by geography within New York City did not initially involve causal judgments about why certain areas had worse outcomes, although they could be used to guide enhancement of services in areas with worse outcomes [35] . Even for a well-understood disease like polio, it may be necessary to identify unusual demographic patterns of mortality in order to understand and respond effectively to an outbreak [36] . Prognostic exercises such as these cannot suffer from confounding bias because no causal interpretation is attached to the conclusions. They can, however, suffer from selection bias. Returning to the Ebola context, one might wish to know whether pregnant women infected with Ebola are at greater risk of death from Ebola infection than other cases [37] , for example, in order to give them greater supportive care. If the probability of entering the database depends on whether an Ebola patient is pregnant and on whether she ultimately dies of the infection, then the probability of death given pregnancy will likely differ in the database from the value in the population of direct interest for a clinical or public health decision maker. If the goal of analysis is to inform public health decision makers on the value of efforts to prevent infection in pregnant women, then the population-wide CFR among pregnant women is the value of direct interest. If, on the other hand, the goal of analysis is to inform health care providers at a treatment center to make a better clinical decision based on an accurate prognosis of the patient presenting to them, the quantity of direct interest is the probability of death among pregnant women in the population they encounter-those admitted to the treatment center.

In general, the presence of adventitious agents, i.e., microorganisms that may have been unintentionally introduced into the manufacturing process, needs to be assessed vigorously during vaccine manufacturing (52) . Since production of viral vector based vaccines is a complex process that often requires a multitude of components of human or animal origin, such as cell substrates, porcine trypsin or bovine serum, the need to exclude contaminants requires extensive testing during various steps of the manufacturing process. Indeed, several examples for contaminants in viral vaccines, such as porcine circovirus contaminations in rotavirus vaccines, have highlighted the reality of this risk (53) . These factors make production of viral vector based vaccines a highly complex and comparatively cost-intensive process. If the viral vector is derived from a virus able to infect humans, the effect of pre-existing immunity on vector immunogenicity has to be addressed. Depending on the vector, this effect may or may not hamper immune responses, as was the case for Ad5 and MV vectors, respectively (see above). Dampening of immune responses by pre-existing immunity may necessitate time and cost intensive screening procedures before clinical trials and compromise the use of a given vector for further indications in the same vaccinee.",32.63894150672468,13.619390135073058

It has been suggested in work by others that IPS and BO are consequences of early inflammation, and recent data support this hypothesis (Versluys et al, Translational and Clinical Immunology, 2018) . Respiratory viral infections early in the peri-transplant period may result in inflammation leading to development of IPS and BO post HSCT. Objectives: The primary objective of this study was to determine whether pre-transplant respiratory viral infection or colonization increase incidence of IPS and BO. We hypothesized that patients who acquire respiratory viral infections in the peri-transplant period have increased incidence of IPS and BO. Methods: We abstracted and analyzed clinically collected data and compared the frequency of post-transplant respiratory viral complications with the presence of upper respiratory viral infections within 30 days prior to transplant. A Broncho alveolar lavage (BAL) or a nasal swab were used to identify upper respiratory viral infections. Epstein Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and other upper respiratory viral infections were tested in 181 patients, transplanted between 2008 and 2018. Outcomes studied included IPS, BO, transplant associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), graft versus host disease (GVHD), and overall survival (OS). Patients who did not have a BAL or a nasal swab within 30 days prior to transplant were excluded. Results: Forty seven of 181 patients had a positive BAL or nasal swab prior to HSCT (group A). There were 53 documented respiratory viral infections in group A. Two tested positive for either coronavirus, herpes simplex virus (HSV) or para-influenza virus, 3 tested positive for adenovirus, human herpes 6, influenza, or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), EBV and CMV were detected in 9 patients, 1 patient had human metapneumovirus and there were 16 rhino virus infections documented prior to HSCT.

The EU has established a common European response to the outbreak of COVID-19, focusing on public health sectors and socio-economic impact particularly mobility and economy in the European Union (EU, 19th March 2020). Italy is the most severely impacted country in the EU. The EC support for the Sendai Framework identifies health as one of the issues interlinked with DRR (EC Web, 2020). Yet it is unclear whether the EU response to COVID-19 features coordinated involvement by DRR-related agencies and mechanisms. The opportunity for integration may be possible through the Integrated Political Crisis Response (IPCR). The IPRC provides a flexible crisis mechanism for supporting the presidency of the Council of the European Union in dealing with major natural or man-made crosssectorial disasters, as well as acts of terrorism. The IPCR works through common Monitoring and Information-sharing (EU, 2016).",46.634995573548025,19.331466940865557

Of special interest to this review, several clinical studies have proposed a role for respiratory viral infection in precipitating as well as contributing to the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive lung disease. Perhaps the strongest disease association for virus-induced lung disease exists for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), 7 a member of the Paramyxoviridae family that commonly infects the bronchial airways of infants and adults, causing severe bronchiolitis in a subpopulation of individuals. 8 A number of prospective case-controlled studies provide evidence that severe RSVinduced bronchiolitis in early infancy constitutes a significant risk factor for the subsequent development of childhood asthma. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] Putative etiological associations have also been made for other respiratory viruses, but most of these (especially human metapneumovirus [hMPV] , rhinovirus [RV] , human parainfluenza virus [hPIV] , adenovirus, and coronavirus) are more likely associated with exacerbation of existing disease. 14 Furthermore, a number of clinical studies suggest that respiratory viral infections are the major trigger for exacerbations of asthma and COPD. [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] This association has been confirmed experimentally using mouse models that have demonstrated that viral infection can cause features of inflammatory lower airway disease in susceptible strains of mice. 22, 23 However, these observations did not fully develop a causal relationship between respiratory viral infection and chronic airway disease or define the precise mechanism by which viral infections contribute to the development and persistence of this type of disease.",43.98932103412098,19.03556136125188

The economic fall-out from COVID-19 appears to be profound, at least $20 trillion in a few short weeks, and may exceed the 2008-2009 Great Recession. The direct costs of COVID-19 travel bans, social distancing, and other responses are merely one aspect. Far more devastating is the uncertainty that has gripped capital markets. Declining economic activity and large drops in capital markets have a mutually reinforcing impact, undermining the capacity of heavily indebted businesses and households to cover their debts. Uncertainty is the primary driver of such crises, and stems in large measure from lack of close coordination and science-based decision-making. Were there more certainty, households, investors and other economic agents would be less inclined to panic. COVID-19 appears certain to become a very costly lesson that DRR does indeed save many more multiples in avoided costs than its initial investment. An additional point in this regard is that health is a critical infrastructure. The resilience of critical infrastructure is well identified in DRR literature (e.g. [18, 19] ). Resilience is fostered not just by sciencebased decisions and coordination, but also via redundancy to ensure buffer capacity when a particular system collapses [20] . Disaster-illiterate economic policy tends to see redundancy as inefficiency. But in order to cope with COVID-19 and alleviate -if not prevent -future emergencies, supply chains for at least some critical items need to be more local. In tandem, governments and private businesses will have to broaden their crisis planning to ensure timely availability of items essential to limiting pandemic risks.",44.51432830191531,18.415995768049434

Gradually, stricter government regulation and vigilance systems have been implemented and enforced, along with social distancing among the people. However, the open border among the EU countries has helped in spreading the disease to Spain, France, Germany and Switzerland, as well as to the UK. The European Union (EU) has been surprisingly slow in coordinating a response to the outbreak. High rates of infection and deaths eventually prompted the European Commission to coordinate a common European response to the outbreak. The response includes resolute action to reinforce the country's public health sectors and mitigate the socio-economic impact in the European Union.

As presented in this review, precipitation, humidity, temperature, and airflow can be determinants of virus infection and transmission; however, despite robust investigation of the effects of these environmental factors, inconsistencies and uncertainties in the data remain. It is possible that meteorological determinants play greater roles in some geographic regions than others, or simply that differences in experimental design affect outcomes and data interpretation. Nonenvironmental effects, including but not limited to seasonal changes in behavior, family and social structures, and pre-existing immunity, could also be playing a role in respiratory virus transmissibility and rates of infection.

Women typically have different gender-assigned roles than do men-even when they are pregnant. They prepare meals, are caregivers for the sick, and often help to prepare the dead, in addition to the daily work of childcare, and, in many areas of Africa, fetching water and firewood, washing clothes, and ensuring the availability of daily provisions for the family, as well as engaging in subsistence farming (Avotri and Walters 1999; WHO 2007) . Broader structural factors and power relations influence women's ability to access health care services even under normal conditions. Women who are pregnant are at an especially high risk for becoming infected with EVD, and then having poor clinical outcomes, for several reasons. Depending on the community norms of their particular ethnic group, women, and pregnant women perhaps even more so, typically have less mobility than do other members of the society, are often dependent upon men or more senior women for decisions related to seeking health care, are poorer than men, and have less access and control over economic resources (Coulter 2009 ). There are frequently concomitant biological factors which may make pregnant women even more susceptible such as anemia, altered immunity due to pregnancy or reduced health over their life course, low body mass index (BMI), malnutrition and poor nutritional quality of the diet, and other complications of pregnancy including diabetes and hypertensive diseases. Pregnant women may spend more time in health care settings, such as clinics and hospitals, due to the pregnancy itself or due to monthly visits with their young children, or as they accompany others seeking care, and thus have greater exposure to nosocomial transmission of all diseases, not simply Ebola. Pregnant women may also have fewer treatment options or choice of medications because of potential teratogenic effects on the fetus and, if postpartum, due to breastfeeding. As was seen in previous Ebola outbreaks in Uganda and Democratic Republic of the Congo, women are often placed at greater risk for infection due to gender specific roles and activities, particularly those related to funerary practices, which have been well-studied in these previous outbreaks and have taken on a prominent role in gender-specific risk (Anoko 2014; Barbato 2014; Hewlett and Amola 2003; Segers 2014; World Health Organization 2007) .",43.65098587377164,18.869236452342594

This decision process should take into account the social and economic impact of the potential health effects that would ensue. In order to begin establishing a framework for incorporating immunotoxicology data in the risk assessment/ management process, it is necessary to identify the social and economic impact of infectious diseases in the general population. While precise information is not readily available, several sources indicate these to be significant and that even small changes in infectious disease frequency has a major impact. The impacts associated with mortality, and to a lesser extent morbidity, from common pathogens such as influenza and pneumonia, have been determined and can serve as a basis in the risk management process. Deaths have the most costly impact on society. In 2006, the age-adjusted death rate for influenza and pneumonia was 0.3 and 17.5 per 100,000, respectively (ALA, 2010a). Together these infections were ranked as the ninth leading cause of death in the U.S. for all ages in 2010 as deaths due to these diseases decreased by 6.7% from 2009 to 2010 (Heron, 2013) .

Notably, these observations in COVID-19 patients are similar to those who suffered from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during the 2003 epidemic. There may be a biological mechanism behind this epidemiological anomaly. 17 Several kinds of vaccines and antiviral drugs that are based on S protein have been previously evaluated. Du et al. showed vaccines can be based on the S protein include full-length S protein, viral vector, DNA, recombinant S protein and recombinant RBD protein. Considering that, in the in vitro study, antiviral therapies are design based on S protein include RBDeACE2 blockers, S cleavage inhibitors, fusion core blockers, neutralizing antibodies, protease inhibitors, S protein inhibitors, and small interfering RNAs. 18 There are some recombinant compounds such as IFN with ribaverin which has only limited effects against COVID-19 infection. 1 The receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 has a higher affinity for ACE2, while it is a lower affinity for SARS-CoV. 1, 19 Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and its homologue ACE2, belongs to the ACE family of dipeptidylcarboxy dipeptidase. However, their physiological functions are varied. On the other hand, ACE2 serves as the binding site for COVID-19. Based on this information, Gurwitz suggested using available angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1R) blockers, such as losartan, as therapeutics for reducing the severity of COVID-19 infections. 20 At present therapy is based on identifying and developing monoclonal antibodies that are specific and effective against COVID-19 combines with remdesivir as a novel nucleotide analog prodrug that was used for the treatment of the Ebola virus disease. 17, 21 To understand the rate of virus spread among people, it is crucial to figure out whether COVID-19 is mutating to improve its binding to human receptors for infection considering its high mutation rate.

Methods: Ethnographic interviews were first conducted to identify the common psychological and behavioral responses to the outbreak. This was followed by a case-control study of 235 consecutive pregnant women recruited during the SARS epidemic, and a historical cohort of 939 pregnant women recruited a year before the outbreak. Both cohorts completed standardized rating scales on depression, anxiety, and social support. Results: Women in the SARS cohort adopted behavioral strategies to mitigate their risk of contracting infection. However, pregnant women tended to overestimate the risk of contracting SARS and nearly a third of the women were homebound. The anxiety level of the SARS cohort was slightly higher than that of the pre-SARS control. No statistical difference was found between the depression levels of the two cohorts. Conclusion: The improved social support experienced by pregnant women during SARS might have buffered the stress associated with an outbreak.

For instance, age is the strongest risk factor for CVD and the effect of aging on immune function may be equally important for COVID-19 suceptibility and severity. Exemplary of this, the effect of age on the immune system is exemplified by low protective titers among 50% of adults older than 65 who receive the influenza vaccine (30, 31) . Other traditional CVD risk factors such as diabetes and hyperlipidemia impact immune function, and conversely, dysregulated immunologic status corresponds with elevated risk of incident CVD (32) (33) (34) (35) . Thus, prevalent CVD may be a marker of accelerated immunologic aging/dysregulation and relate indirectly to COVID-19 prognosis. An increased frequency of adverse CVD events post COVID-19 infection might also play a role in prognosis, similar to other viral infections such as influenza with mechanistic underpinnings which are complex, multi-factorial, and bi-directional (36, 37) . In addition, COVID-19 infection may trigger pathways unique to this pathogen which contribute to outcomes in CVD patients. For instance, higher expression of ACE2 in patients with hypertension and CVD has been postulated to enhance susceptibility to SARS-CoV2, although the data are conflicting and without clear suggestion for treatment ( Figure 1 ) (5) .

First, the MVS could serve as a starting point to identify broad host factor targets for developing broad-spectrum anti-viral drugs. Most of the existing anti-viral drugs are based on the one-drug-one-bug philosophy, which is inefficient and ineffective because viruses often mutate to develop drug resistance and novel viral strains can emerge from animal carriers. Instead, developing anti-viral drugs that target host factors involved in multiple respiratory viral infections could provide protection against a broader group of viruses and be more effective against novel strains. Second, the IMS score can be used clinically to distinguish influenza infections, regardless of whether there is concurrent bacterial pneumonia, which could help clinicians to determine whether to initiate antiviral treatments in patients with potential co-infections. Third, the IMS score can be used as a more objective measure of a vaccination response.

We find that 54.3% of EID events are caused by bacteria or rickettsia, reflecting a large number of drugresistant microbes in our database. Our results confirm that EID origins are significantly correlated with socio-economic, environmental and ecological factors, and provide a basis for identifying regions where new EIDs are most likely to originate (emerging disease 'hotspots').

These are school age children who have a history or family history of atopy. Their wheezing may or may not be triggered by a viral infection, but they have a strong probability of continued wheezing into adolescence or adulthood. It is in this group that one would be able to detect chronic inflammatory changes in the airways.

Initial reports identified two species of snakes that could be a possible reservoir of the COVID-19. However, to date, there has been no consistent evidence of coronavirus reservoirs other than mammals and birds [10, 18] . Genomic sequence analysis of COVID-19 showed 88% identity with two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses [19, 20] , indicating that mammals are the most likely link between COVID-19 and humans.

This is supported by cases that occurred within families and among people who did not visit the wet animal market in Wuhan [13, 21] . Person-to-person transmission occurs primarily via direct contact or through droplets spread by coughing or sneezing from an infected individual. In a small study conducted on women in their third trimester who were confirmed to be infected with the coronavirus, there was no evidence that there is transmission from mother to child. However, all pregnant mothers underwent cesarean sections, so it remains unclear whether transmission can occur during vaginal birth.

Primary cultures of murine alveolar epithelial cells provide a robust in vitro model to perform mechanistic studies that can be correlated with in vivo studies to identify cell type-specific factors that contribute to pathology within the alveoli of the lung during viral infection. In this study, we established an in vitro model to compare the responses of type I (ATI) and type II (ATII) alveolar epithelial cells to infection by respiratory viruses used in murine models: mouse-adapted severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV, v2163), murine coronavirus MHV-1, and influenza A (H1N1) virus, strain PR8. Murine alveolar cells cultured to maintain an ATII cell phenotype, determined by expression of LBP180, were susceptible to infection by all three viruses. In contrast, ATII cells that were cultured to trans-differentiate into an ATI-like cell phenotype were susceptible to MHV-1 and PR8, but not mouse-adapted SARS-CoV. Epithelial cells produce cytokines in response to viral infections, thereby activating immune responses. Thus, virus-induced cytokine expression was quantified in ATI and ATII cells. Both cell types had increased expression of IL-1β mRNA upon viral infection, though at different levels. While MHV-1 and PR8 induced expression of a number of shared cytokines in ATI cells, there were several cytokines whose expression was induced uniquely by MHV-1 infection.

Two weeks after ovalbumin sensitization, mice were challenged with oval- bumin aerosols; 24 hours later, airway responsiveness (AR) to inhaled methacholine, levels of ovalbumin-specific IgE, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were examined. Results: Neither influenza A virus (H 1 N 1 nor H 3 N 2 ) alone nor ovalbumin sensitization alone caused changes in AR or IgE. However, ovalbumin sensitization after inoculation with either influenza A virus increased AR and levels of ovalbumin-specif- ic IgE.

Because presentation with pathognomonic signs and symptoms is unusual, molecular diagnosis and immunoassays play an important role in diagnosis. In settings where resources are limited, this may retard identification of the etiological agent that is responsible for the clinical presentation. To compound problems of delays in diagnosis, infection with respiratory viruses usually occurs rapidly after contact with respiratory secretions of infected individuals. Transmission may occur between individuals and in some cases as a result of interspecies infection. Moreover, respiratory viruses, such as influenza virus A, readily mutate their genomes to generate viruses that have new properties of disease pathogenesis.

Medical complications including infection are more frequent in pregnant women with diabetes, although most risk occurs in women with preexisting diabetes. 52 Overall, there is a four-fold increased risk of infection pre-and post-partum in insulin-dependent diabetic pregnant women. 53 Examples of increased risk include colonization and infection with group B streptococcus and post-cesarean wound infections. 54, 55 Unfortunately, the older literature does not always clearly distinguish between risk for pregnant women with preexisting DM and risk in women without DM prior to pregnancy, and increased risk cannot always be extrapolated for gestational diabetes. For example, solely gestational DM may not represent an increased risk for perinatal infection with group B streptococcus. 56 By contrast, the risk of urinary tract infection, particularly due to Gram-positive organisms, is increased in pregnant women with both preexisting and gestational DM. The frequency of urinary tract infections is decreased by good glucose control. 57 The risk of periodontal disease is also increased in all diabetic pregnant women, with a rate of 4.8% to 9.0% in gestational diabetes, and an even higher prevalence of 30.5% in women with preexisting diabetes. 58 physiologic changes uTerine decidual and SyncyTioTrophoblaST producTion of ido The amino acid tryptophan appears to be an important proliferation signal for T lymphocytes.

By contrast, Lescure and colleagues report the viral RNA kinetics of two patients who developed late respiratory deterioration despite the disappearance of nasopharyngeal viral RNA. It would be interesting to know whether viral RNA load in lung tissue, or a surrogate sample such as tracheal aspirate, mirrors the decline in nasopharyngeal shedding. Nevertheless, this observation suggests that these late, severe manifestations might be immunologically mediated and has obvious implications for the potential to use immune-modulatory therapies for this subset of patients.

Also, chloroquine phosphate has shown some efficacy in treating COVID-19-associated pneumonia. 1, 9 It's important to consider that clinical safety and efficacy of remdesivir and chloroquine have not been established yet by well-designed phase 3 clinical trials and any potential use risk vs benefit balance should considered before using such agents to avoid any toxicity, complications or side effects from such treatment.",39.42021304052444,16.873881258452734

To limit the virus spread, those in the USA are canceling both smaller (∼100 people) and large meetings, researchers are limiting their travel both overseas and within the country, and student college and graduate school visit weekends are being postponed or stopped altogether. Still, there is much uncertainty about how to proceed and what other measures should be taken. Since the outbreak began in China, Chinese scientists have already faced many of the questions that those of us in other locations are now asking. We therefore asked several Chinese scientists to discuss the strategies that they are pursuing to limit the impact of the virus both on their research and on society. Some of the actions taken by the scientists and the government under this extreme situation may have a long-term influence and shift our future research and funding paradigm. We anticipate that their perspectives will be valuable to the community. global lifethreatening concern in recent days. The war against COVID-19 there has now reached the most critical moment, as confirmed COVID-19 cases have peaked for several days, and almost all the people in Wuhan City have been screened for suspected case identification (as of late February). We cannot imagine how people there are sacrificing to control the spread of COVID-19. As alumni of Wuhan University that is located in the center of Wuhan city, we became deeply saddened and worried as we watched the entire city cope with an unprecedented emergency situation. We wanted to provide a glimpse of what chemical biologists have been working on, from the perspective of scientists in China. In the past 40 days, we have heard more stories of hope and resilience than of worry and grief in China, where 1.4 billion people are doing their best to bring this serious outbreak under control. Right now, the epidemic situation outside Hubei is gradually improving, and the situation inside Hubei has shown signs of stabilization. It is noteworthy that although it is mandated that most people have to stay at home as a quarantine procedure, scientists in China have been increasingly devoted to combating COVID-19, with several clinical trials currently underway. As for scientists throughout the world, researchers in China are making extraordinary efforts toward rapid advancement of diagnostic and treatment approaches, and are doing so under highly challenging personal circumstances with extensive restrictions on not only travel, but day-to-day activities. As mentioned by WHO officers, Chinese scientists have been extremely professional in the face of this epidemic and have made their findings rapidly available to researchers around the world to coordinate global efforts to characterize, treat, and mitigate the spread of COVID-19. One team led by Yongzhen Zhang from Fudan University completed the deep sequencing of COVID-19 and made its whole genome sequence publicly available on January 10, 2020. 1 Medical experts, virologists, structural biologists, and medicinal chemists have made significant contributions in areas such as epidemic prevention and control, patient treatment, virus classification and traceability, structure analysis, and clinical drug development. The current progress relied on the rapid development of science and technology, as well as the dedication of scientific researchers. During the epidemic, almost all industries not related to any antiepidemic efforts were halted due to the lock down of transportation and lack of manpower. It has been extremely difficult to complete highlevel scientific research under such an extreme situation.",39.58032241986246,16.12549467120685

Earlier reports on viral infections of camelids produced two main classifications: those causing disease and those not causing disease (nonpathogenic viral infections). 11 The result has been a priority list of major viral infections and those of minor significance to the health of camelids (Box 1). Reviews 12, 13 have also listed some of the major viral infections affecting camelids. Although the classification was useful, it is important to recognize that these reviews tended to reflect the status of some viral infections on a regional basis, which established a bias against a more global understanding of the real and potential effects of viral infections upon camelids, and thus limited the extent of diagnostic surveillance worldwide. Another approach to classifying the causes of overt disease would be to look at the viral infections that occur within the camelid species (alpacas, llamas, dromedaries) and those that can be acquired from other animal species via interspecies spread (Fig. 1) . 14 This type of approach uses risk as a criterion for assisting in infection control and disease diagnosis.",44.25333396761719,18.450098809194426

However, there are a few important points that need consideration-1. As caregivers, it is our utmost responsibility to protect ourselves from getting infected while managing these patients. Therefore, all heathcare personnel engaged in the care of COVID-19 patients must observe necessary precautions at all times. All of them should be trained in donning, usage, and doffing of the personal protective equipment in accordance with the existing practice guidelines. 2. The hospital systems need to ensure preparedness for dealing with large volume of COVID-19 patients, many of whom would need ICU care and/or acute cardiac care. Appropriate protocols for rapid diagnosis, triage, isolation, and management of COVID-19 patients with CV complications should be developed and well-rehearsed. Rapid triaging and management of these patients is crucial, not only to allow efficient utilization of healthcare resources but also to minimize exposure to caregivers. There are already reports highlighting delays in delivering acute cardiac care due to extra precautions that need to be observed in view of COVID-19 [14] . Efforts should be made to minimize such delays. 3. Strong emphasis should be placed on avoiding unwarranted diagnostic tests (e.g. cardiac troponin, echocardiography, etc.) in these patients. This is required to minimize unwarranted downstream diagnostic/therapeutic procedures which would further strain the already stretched healthcare resources and would also subject caregivers to added risk of exposure to the infection. The American College of Cardiology has released an advisory discouraging random measurement of cardiac biomarkers such as troponins and natriuretic peptides [15] . It urges all the clinicians to reserve these assays for circumstances in which they would actually meaningfully add to the management of the patients with COVID-19. The American Society of Echocardiography has also issued a similar advisory regarding the use of echocardiography in these patients [16] . 4. The individual hospitals may also have to reconsider risk-benefit ratio of primary percutaneous intervention vs fibrinolysis in patients with COVID-19 who present with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. 5. There has been a concern regarding the safety of ACE inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. These agents upregulate expression of ACE2 in various tissues, including on cardiomyocytes [17] . Since SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 to gain entry into human cells, there is a potentially increased risk of developing COVID-19 or developing more severe disease in patients who are already on background treatment with ACEi/ARB. However, to date, no experimental or clinical data have emerged to support these concerns. At the same time, the risks of discontinuing these therapies are well known. Therefore, several leading professional societies have strongly urged to not discontinue clinically-indicated ACEi/ARB therapy in the event the patient develops COVID-19 [18, 19] . 6. Clinicians caring for these patients also need to be fully aware of the potential CV side-effects of various therapies used for treating the viral infection. Additionally, various anti-retroviral drugs have significant interactions with cardiac drugs, which need to be considered and appropriate dose modification done. More recently, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and azathioprine have been proposed as potential therapeutic options, based on preliminary evidence [20] . Both these drugs are known to prolong QT interval and due caution must be exercised when prescribing these agents. Their combination is best avoided and even when using chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine alone, daily electrocardiogram for monitoring QT interval is warranted, esp. in patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction and in those receiving another drug with potential to prolong QT interval.",40.59639640343029,16.613685461800728

Whether these children are more vulnerable to the acquisition of HRV, or whether they have more symptomatic illness related to HRV, remains to be elucidated. In patients with a chronic respiratory condition, only the need for oxygen was predictive for HRV; cough and shortness of breath were not only associated with the detection of HRV, but also with the detection of other respiratory viruses.

It remains unclear at this time whether these laboratory test alterations are a sign for pre-existing liver diseases in patients with a more severe course of infection, whether they rather reflect liver damage caused by the virus itself, or whether they mirror a severe inflammatory response (hypoalbuminemia) with disseminated intravascular coagulation (thrombocytopenia).

At the national and international level, travel restrictions have been implemented for regions with the highest COVID-19 incidence currently, but these recommendations and polices are likely to rapidly change and warrant close monitoring. Patients with potential symptoms of COVID-19 with recent travel to areas of higher incidence (China, South Korea, Japan, Iran, and Italy based on the most recent CDC data) should be asked to wear a standard surgical mask as soon as they are identified and be placed in a private room with the door closed, ideally an airborne isolation room (negative-pressure room). 3, 7 It is important to note that travel history criteria for testing for COVID-19 will change as community-based spread is emerging within the United States and patients living in or with recent travel to areas where COVID-19 has been confirmed should be considered for testing as well. Any concern for possible COVID-19 should immediately prompt notification of institutional infection prevention and control as well as local or state health departments. Healthcare personnel entering the room should use standard precautions, contact precautions (gown and gloves), airborne precautions (with N95 respirator), and eye protection (goggles or a face shield). Testing has been performed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) but is now more widely available in state and city laboratories and is becoming available commercially. It is important that more common respiratory illnesses (influenza, etc.) are also ruled out. What should we tell our patients based on our current knowledge? First, this is a rapidly evolving area with new information emerging on a daily basis. Therefore periodically checking on recommendations from leading national and international health organizations, such as the CDC or the World Health Organization (WHO), is the most important way for both patients and physicians to stay informed with accurate information. Second, it is important to realize that the majority of cases (80+%) have been mild, the fatality rate for COVID-19 is lower than prior coronavirus outbreaks, and the proportion of severe/fatal cases may be an overestimate as milder or asymptomatic cases are likely under-reported. 15 Third, there are currently no specific recommendations for people on immunosuppression, such as IBD patients. Prior IBD research has found that viral infections are more likely among patients on immunomodulators (such as 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine) than those on biologics but it is unclear if this can be extended to COVID-19. 16 There are no data currently about the impact of immunosuppressive agents, although one of the largest case series from China did note that 2 patients with immunodeficiency (not further specified) had non-severe disease. 8 17 Last, the best measures to decrease the risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 are the same as standard practices against any viral illness. These include good hand hygiene with alcohol-based hand sanitizers or soap and water, covering your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing, limiting touching your face, avoiding close contact with anyone with influenza-like and/or upper respiratory symptoms, and staying home if you are sick.",40.0384941982277,17.59646518930462

Both cause major infection-related morbidity and mortality around the world. Tuberculosis was the leading cause of mortality from an infectious disease worldwide in 2018, causing 1·2 million deaths. 1 COVID-19 has infected more than 300 000 people and caused over 13 000 deaths in the first quarter of 2020 alone. 2 Both COVID-19 and tuberculosis can present with respiratory symptoms, and diagnosis and treatment of people with tuberculosis, or tuberculosis and COVID-19 co-infection, are likely to be compromised during the COVID-19 pandemic. Older people and those with comorbidities are at increased risk of severe disease and adverse outcomes in both diseases. 3, 4 And, as we are discovering for COVID-19, both diseases have considerable social impact-including stigma, discrimination, and isolation-in addition to the economic impact from country productivity losses and catastrophic costs to individuals and households. 5 There are also stark differences. While tuberculosis is a slow pandemic and has accompanied humankind for millennia, 6 the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19 is new and spreading rapidly around the world. Tuberculosis has been labelled a pandemic many times over the past three centuries, whereas this is the first COVID-19 pandemic. Children are less severely affected by COVID-19, whereas 1·1 million children had tuberculosis disease in 2018, of whom 200 000 died. 1 The vast majority of cases and deaths from tuberculosis occur in low-income and middle-income countries, whereas high-income countries have low rates. 1 By contrast, Europe became the second epicentre of COVID-19 after China, which might explain, in part, why COVID-19 can be expected to mobilise more global resources and person-power in a year than tuberculosis has in decades. However, underprepared and vulnerable countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Central and South America might soon see substantial rises in COVID-19 cases and deaths, and concerted, collective action must be taken now to avoid catastrophe. 7 There are many unknowns. The clinical and epidemiological interactions of COVID-19 with tuberculosis (with or without HIV) are likely to be highly complex. Simply put, tuberculosis transmission might rise because of increased respiratory symptoms associated with COVID-19, or decline owing to COVID-19-related self-isolation and quarantine. There is increasing recognition of the millions of people treated for tuberculosis who have residual, long-term lung damage 8 who are likely to be at a higher risk of severe disease and death from COVID-19.

COVID-19, like tuberculosis, will almost certainly be associated with the medical poverty trap, in which poorer people have a higher likelihood of infection, disease, and adverse outcomes. Moreover, unemployed populations and informal or so-called zero-hours contract workers will experience further impoverishment, which increases risk of tuberculosis. 5 Amid the expanding COVID-19 pandemic, our plea on World Tuberculosis Day is that we do not forget the tuberculosis pandemic, which, at present, is still the leading cause of infectious disease mortality.

As demonstrated in this report, the development of mild COVID-19 illness was insidiously initiated and persisted for a long period. The prolonged duration of SARS-CoV-2 detection in naso-oropharyngeal specimens of the COVID-19 patients with mild illness is of concern in epidemic areas.

First, collectively, Africa needs a unified continent-wide strategy for preparedness and response. The strategy must be comprehensive, and member states, donors, and partners should immediately commit to releasing financial resources to support country-customised implementation plans derived from the strategy. To help develop a common strategy that will allow for effective coordination, collaboration, and communication, the African Union Commission, Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), and WHO, in partnership with African countries, have established the Africa Taskforce for Coronavirus Preparedness and Response (AFTCOR). The partnership has six work streams: laboratory diagnosis and subtyping; surveillance, including screening at points of entry and cross-border activities; infection prevention and control in healthcare facilities; clinical management of people with severe COVID-19; risk communication; and supply-chain management and stockpiles. Because mitigating the potential spread of COVID-19 in Africa will require rapid detection and containment, the laboratory work streams of AFTCOR, Africa CDC, and WHO are working closely to expeditiously scale up diagnostic testing capacity linked to enhanced surveillance and monitoring-eg, at the beginning of February, only two countries in Africa had the diagnostic capacity to test for COVID-19. However, as of Feb 25, 2020, more than 40 countries would have been capacitated to accurately diagnose COVID-19 infection, thanks to the coordination efforts of AFTCOR. 6 As testing becomes more available, it is possible that more cases might be detected. Second, any effective preparedness and response strategy for COVID-19 requires a committed political will; as such, the African Union Commission, Africa CDC, and WHO convened, on Feb 22, 2020, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, an emergency meeting of all ministers of health of 55 member states to commit to acting fast and collectively to develop and implement a coordinated continent-wide strategy. AFTCOR taskforce was formed, and a continent-wide strategy was endorsed at the end of the emergency meeting, with a call for strong coordination of efforts. To prevent the occurrence of a social, health security, and economic tragedy, actions agreed at the emergency ministerial meeting will need to be acted on quickly, before any additional COVID-19 cases are introduced to the continent, and result in sustained human-tohuman transmission. The potential social, economic, and security devastation that COVID-19 could cause in Africa should be enough of an incentive for African governments to invest immediately in preparedness for the worst-case scenario. Third, commitment and release of financial resources from partners and donors before a crisis hits Africa will help anticipate demand and address supply chain management, mapping, and stockpiling of COVID-19 response needs, such as large quantities of personal protective equipment, gloves, surgical masks, coveralls, and hoods, and medical countermeasures like antiviral agents.

Most of the existing anti-viral drugs are based on the one-drug-one-bug philosophy, which is inefficient and ineffective because viruses often mutate to develop drug resistance and novel viral strains can emerge from animal carriers. Instead, developing anti-viral drugs that target host factors involved in multiple respiratory viral infections could provide protection against a broader group of viruses and be more effective against novel strains.

In this study, we determined whether symptomatic respiratory viral infections after lung transplantation induce circulating exosomes that contain lung-associated self-antigens and assessed whether these exosomes activate immune responses to self-antigens. METHODS: Serum samples were collected from lung transplant recipients with symptomatic lower-and upper-tract respiratory viral infections and from non-symptomatic stable recipients. Exosomes were isolated via ultracentrifugation; purity was determined using sucrose cushion; and presence of lung self-antigens, 20S proteasome, and viral antigens for rhinovirus, coronavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus were determined using immunoblot. Mice were immunized with circulating exosomes from each group and resulting differential immune responses and lung histology were analyzed. RESULTS: Exosomes containing self-antigens, 20S proteasome, and viral antigens were detected at significantly higher levels (p < 0.05) in serum of recipients with symptomatic respiratory viral infections (n = 35) as compared with stable controls (n = 32). Mice immunized with exosomes from recipients with respiratory viral infections developed immune responses to self-antigens, fibrosis, small airway occlusion, and significant cellular infiltration; mice immunized with exosomes from controls did not (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Circulating exosomes isolated from lung transplant recipients diagnosed with respiratory viral infections contained lung self-antigens, viral antigens, and 20S proteasome and elicited immune responses to lung self-antigens that resulted in development of chronic lung allograft dysfunction in immunized mice.",38.24457058950371,16.382170692835622

It is a negotiated outcome, often evidence informed e midway between an opinion-based policy that uses selected evidence or untested views, and an evidence-based policy that has sound evidence at the heart of the policy choice. 8, 9 With chronic disease, a complex interplay of risk factors is heavily influenced by underlying socioeconomic, cultural, political and environmental determinants. Precise epidemiological evidence supplied by surveillance systems is, by itself, unlikely to be sufficient input to drive a healthy public policy decision to deal with chronic disease. 9 Existing surveillance systems may also be too narrow in what they collect. They may be limited to a particular set of epidemiological indicators of chronic diseases or risk factors that do not fully capture all the aspects or the full consequences of interventions, limiting the basis on which interventions can be judged and justified, particularly given the links between health and socio-economic determinants. If this is the case, the challenge with traditional surveillance systems is to link with other data sources to provide the information needed to understand the range of factors influencing chronic diseases, and to supply information for the broader arguments that we want to make.",52.52586997052226,19.08792439128029

Cardiac arrest occurs in about 3% of inpatients with pneumonia. 21 Risk factors of cardiac events after pneumonia include older age, pre-existing cardiovascular diseases, and greater severity of pneumonia at presentation. 22 Coronary heart disease has also been found to be associated with acute cardiac events and poor outcomes in influenza and other respiratory viral infections. [22] [23] [24] In this study, increased high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I during hospitalisation was found in more than half of those who died. The first autopsy of a 53-year-old woman with chronic renal failure in Jinyintan Hospital showed acute myocardial infarction (data not published; personal communication with a pathologist from the Chinese Academy of Science). About 90% of inpatients with pneumonia had increased coagulation activity, marked by increased d-dimer concentrations. 25 In this study, we found d-dimer greater than 1 µg/mL is associated with fatal outcome of COVID-19. High levels of d-dimer have a reported asso ciation with 28-day mortality in patients with infection or sepsis identified in the emergency department. 26 Contri butory mechanisms include systemic pro-inflammatory cytokine responses that are mediators of atherosclerosis directly contributing to plaque rupture through local inflammation, induction of procoagulant factors, and haemodynamic changes, which predispose to ischaemia and thrombosis. [27] [28] [29] In addition, angiotensin converting enzyme 2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, is expressed on myocytes and vascular endothelial cells, 30, 31 so there is at least theoretical potential possibility of direct cardiac involvement by the virus. Of note, interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates in heart tissue has 32 The level and duration of infectious virus replication are important factors in assessing the risk of trans mission and guiding decisions regarding isolation of patients. Because coronavirus RNA detection is more sensitive than virus isolation, most studies have used qualitative or quantitative viral RNA tests as a potential marker for infectious coronavirus. For SARS-CoV, viral RNA was detected in respiratory specimens from about a third of patients as long as 4 weeks after disease onset. 33 Similarly, the dura tion of MERS-CoV RNA detection in lower respiratory specimans persisted for at least 3 weeks, 34, 35 whereas the duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection has not been well characterised. In the current study, we found that the detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA persisted for a median of 20 days in survivors and that it was sustained until death in nonsurvivors. This has important implications for both patient isolation decision making and guidance around the length of antiviral treatment. In severe influenza virus infection, prolonged viral shedding was associated with fatal outcome and delayed antiviral treatment was an independent risk factor for prolonged virus detection. 36 Similarly, effective antiviral treatment might improve outcomes in COVID-19, although we did not observe shortening of viral shedding duration after lopinavir/ritonavir treatment in the cur rent study.

First, there is increasing evidence that severe infections with RSV and PIV in infancy can alter lung development and physiology to increase the risks of subsequent wheezing and asthma. Second, infections with common cold viruses and influenza commonly precipitate wheezing symptoms in children and adults who already have established asthma, and RV appears to be the most important virus in producing exacerbations of the disease. The principal mechanisms by which this occurs appears to be viral replication in epithelial cells, triggering a cascade of inflammation involving granulocytes, macrophages, T cells, and secreted cytokines and mediators. The inflammatory process, although essential to clear the infection, augments pre-existing airway inflammation in asthma, leading to increased airway obstruction and lower respiratory tract symptoms.

There was no mention about the death rate among pregnant women with COVID-19, however, the case fatality rate among MERS-pregnant patients was about 35% and was not statistically different when compared to the overall MERS case fatality rate [7] . In the MERS cases, 40% had C-section and this is much lower than 100% C-section rate in the case of COVID-19. This difference may reflect a variance in the practices between different countries. Another difference is the high fetal demise rate of 30% among pregnant women with MERS compared to 0% among COVID-19. The fetal demise rate among 12 pregnant women with SARS was 25% [8] .

Early identification of COVID-19 is important for the patients as well as the healthy population. Currently, the patients should be isolated for treatment from the healthy people for controlling the epidemic. It has been reported that chest CT is superior to RT-PCR in sensitivity for early detection of COVID-19. 22 Based on the epidemiological characteristics, clinically-diagnosed cases with typical CT features were treated with the same therapy in Hubei Province to offset the effects of possible false negative of the new coronavirus nucleic acid tests. 13 In our study, 44% and 36% pregnant women presented initial onset of fever in either laboratory-confirmed or clinicallydiagnosed group, which was less common than 87.9% in the nonpregnant population in the study by Guan et al. 11 and consistent with the previous study enrolling 9 pregnant women with COVID-19. 17 Currently, fever served as the basic screening flag in China. Absence of typical symptoms increased the difficulty of the surveillance in the pregnant population. Furthermore, the physiological findings about leukocytosis and elevated neutrophil ratio due to adaptations to gestation could further complicate the situation. Nevertheless, no pregnant women were admitted to ICU. Compared with the previous studies, 11 it may be one of the reasons there were more cases of pregnant women categorized as mild or common type in clinical context. As with unenhanced chest CT imaging of pregnant women during the epidemic in Wuhan, low dose technique was implemented with the DLP ranging from 50 to 150 mGy cm for diagnostic imaging in our study, which was safe for the fetuses. 23 Sixteen pregnant women were performed with post-partum CT in our study. As with the CT features associated with COVID-19 pneumonia, the common characteristics in the pregnant group included pure GGO, GGO with consolidation or reticulation, and complete consolidation with predominantly peripheral distribution and bilateral lung involvement, which were similar to those of the non-pregnant group in our research as reported in the previous studies. 19 , 20 , 24 There were overlaps in imaging findings between COVID-19 and other viral infections, such as the coronavirus SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV pneumonia, as well as H1N1, H5N1, and H7N9 infections. 19 , 20 The patterns of GGOs or GGO with the above features in predominantly peripheral distribution will facilitate the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. 20 The above imaging findings could be mostly explained by a recently published research on the pathological investigation of COVID-19. 25 Diffuse alveolar injury superimposed with cellular fibromyxoid exudates and hyaline membrane formation was identified on pathology. Other findings included pulmonary edema and interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates (dominated by lymphocytes). Therefore, we have the GGOs, consolidations, and reticulations which indicate fibromyxoid exudates, the interstitial edema and the lymphocytes infiltrate resulting in the lymphopenia inside the blood. The more common consolidation and relatively higher TSS in the laboratoryconfirmed and clinically-diagnosed pregnant women suggested the more severity in pregnant women, except for three laboratoryconfirmed pregnant women showing no abnormalities related with COVID-19 pneumonia at CT. Therefore, there is no doubt that the CT study did a big favor in structuring the clinical treatment strategy for the pregnant women as we hoped. Fortunately, the infants were all normal without any evidence of vertical transmission from women with COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy, which was consistent with the prior research by Chen et al. 16 While compared between the two pregnant groups, the consolidation were more frequent in the clinically-diagnosed group with a relatively higher TSS of 4 ·8 (SD 3 ·5), indicating relatively more severe lung involvement resulting from delayed treatment prior to a laboratory confirmation. Cases with initial negative RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 but high clinical suspicion were also reported in previous studies, and the SARS-CoV-2 was positive after repeated tests. 12 , 13 For the clinically-diagnosed patients, it is speculated that samples from the lower respiratory tract via lavage and repeat tests may be helpful to rule out the false negative results. Fortunately, the laboratory-negative cases with typical imaging findings were supposed to receive the same treatment protocol as the positive ones in China. Pleural effusion was identified in 6/16 (38%) and 6/25 (24%) patients in the laboratory-confirmed and clinically-diagnosed pregnant groups, which was more than that in the study by Song et al. 20 This phenomenon could be attributed to a common finding within 1-24 h of normal delivery. 26 Compared with adults, fewer children are infected with SARS-CoV-2. Nine children younger than 14 years out of 1011 patients were reported by Guan et al. 11 Our study revealed that the non-specific abnormalities (pure GGO or consolidation) distributed without peripheral predominance at CT unlike the adults. However, when superimposed with other pathogen infections, the pulmonary involvement was more severe, as simultaneous infection of RSV and SARS-CoV-2 in one child was detected in our study. Nevertheless, it was difficult to distinguish if the consolidation was associated with COVID-19 pneumonia, since the consolidation and pleural effusion were also common in pure RSV infection. 27 The contact history and clinical symptoms of fever or cough may be helpful for the surveillance.",54.50560172029337,22.349496176538864

As of February 18, 72,532 cases were laboratory-confirmed and clinically-diagnosed, and 6242 were suspected in China. 8 The reproductive number (R0), defined as the expected number of secondary infectious cases generated by an infectious case in a susceptible population, is estimated to 3.77. 9 Recent publications have depicted the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. 2 , 3 , 7 , 9-11 The definite diagnosis of COVID-19 is expected with the novel coronavirus nucleic acid positive in swabs, sputum, or secretions from the lower respiratory tract, or blood by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR). However, the new coronavirus nucleic acid kits are in short supply and time-consuming in manipulation. Furthermore, false negatives may exist in some cases due to the insufficient viral materials in the specimen. Recent studies have reported the cases with initial SARS-CoV-2 negative but typical CT findings, 12 , 13 however, most of them turned out to be positive after repeated tests for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. Therefore, chest CT imaging plays a critical role in the surveillance and diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia with a higher sensitivity and efficiency than the chest X-rays do. Guan et al. also reported that 76.4% cases with viral pneumonia findings at CT were verified COVID-19. 11 Based on the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia, patients with typical CT imaging features in Hubei Province will be grouped as clinicallydiagnosed cases, contributing to the total number of confirmed diagnosis according to the ""Diagnosis and Treatment for COVID-19 Pneumonia (Fifth Trial Version)"" released by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China since February 12, 2020. 14 Pregnant women are more susceptible to infectious diseases due to the immune suppression. 15 Previous studies found that there was a male-dominated tendency and few cases occurred in children for COVID-19 pneumonia. 3 , 9 To the best of our knowledge, there are few published data involving the clinical and chest CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women and children. 16 , 17 In this present study, the clinical and chest CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia were investigated for the pregnant women and children in comparison with non-pregnant adults from two centers. The CT features were further compared between the laboratory-confirmed and clinically-diagnosed pregnant groups, which could favor the surveillance and diagnosis.",48.09851998616691,19.624204390101657

Simultaneously, data from the State Council Information Office in China suggest that more than 90% of health-care workers in Hubei province are women, emphasising the gendered nature of the health workforce and the risk that predominantly female health workers incur. 5 The closure of schools to control COVID-19 transmission in China, Hong Kong, Italy, South Korea, and beyond might have a differential effect on women, who provide most of the informal care within families, with the consequence of limiting their work and economic opportunities.

Experience from past outbreaks shows the importance of incorporating a gender analysis into preparedness and response efforts to improve the effectiveness of health interventions and promote gender and health equity goals. During the 2014-16 west African outbreak of Ebola virus disease, gendered norms meant that women were more likely to be infected by the virus, given their predominant roles as caregivers within families and as front-line health-care workers. 7 Women were less likely than men to have power in decision making around the outbreak, and their needs were largely unmet. 8 For example, resources for reproductive and sexual health were diverted to the emergency response, contributing to a rise in maternal mortality in a region with one of the highest rates in the world. 9 During the Zika virus outbreak, differences in power between men and women meant that women did not have autonomy over their sexual and reproductive lives, 10 which was compounded by their inadequate access to health care and insufficient financial resources to travel to hospitals for check-ups for their children, despite women doing most of the community vector control activities. 11 Given their front-line interaction with communities, it is concerning that women have not been fully incorporated into global health security surveillance, detection, and prevention mechanisms. Women's socially prescribed care roles typically place them in a prime position to identify trends at the local level that might signal the start of an outbreak and thus improve global health security. Although women should not be further burdened, particularly considering much of their labour during health crises goes underpaid or unpaid, incorporating women's voices and knowledge could be empowering and improve outbreak preparedness and response. Despite the WHO Executive Board recognising the need to include women in decision making for outbreak preparedness and response, 12 there is inadequate women's representation in national and global COVID-19 policy spaces, such as in the White House Coronavirus Task Force. 13 If the response to disease outbreaks such as COVID-19 is to be effective and not reproduce or perpetuate gender and health inequities, it is important that gender norms, roles, and relations that influence women's and men's differential vulnerability to infection, exposure to pathogens, and treatment received, as well as how these may differ among different groups of women and men, are considered and addressed. We call on governments and global health institutions to consider the sex and gender effects of the COVID-19 outbreak, both direct and indirect, and conduct an analysis of the gendered impacts of the multiple outbreaks, incorporating the voices of women on the front line of the response to COVID-19 and of those most affected by the disease within preparedness and response policies or practices going forward.",45.0786035809808,18.069366326318438

However, data describing the incidence and impact of common respiratory viruses other than influenza virus in pregnant women are extremely limited. The article by Hause et al in this issue of The Journal of Infectious Diseases provides a prospective description of respiratory viral disease in women seen at an outpatient obstetrical clinic during their second or third trimesters of pregnancy, based on symptoms noted by the women themselves [1] . The authors evaluated women from a large urban outpatient clinic for viral causes of acute respiratory symptoms and the clinical extent of disease when participants presented for medical care. Although the study did not evaluate the incidence of respiratory disease in this population by prospective enrollment of a pregnant cohort, this information provides a relevant end point for future epidemiology studies, as well as vaccine trials. The most significant finding of their study was that over one third of women with symptoms of acute respiratory illness had disease consistent with lower respiratory tract disease, which the authors defined as difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, wheezing, or cyanosis. Morbidity associated with these symptoms and signs was considerable and associated with a variety of respiratory viruses. Of note, this study evaluated asymptomatic pregnant women as well, allowing for comparisons of respiratory viruses detected in women with and without symptoms. The study population reflected the contemporary make-up of pregnant women in the United States, with a median age of 31 years and a broad representation of racial and ethnic backgrounds.

This is important in the PID setting where many patients present with pre-existing viral illness. However, our definition of viral clearance and the small numbers of patients with viral infection at time of transplantation make it difficult to determine the effects of serotherapy dose on clearance of pre-existing viral infections.

However, the more complex models that will be discussed later are often built around multiple components that are parameterised as probability distributions. For example, the curves in Fig. 5 and the solid line in Fig. 6 illustrate the types of skewed distribution that are often used to better describe the observed lengths of, for example, the incubation or symptomatic periods of infectious diseases, particularly when these have been sampled from a large enough number of infected individuals in a population to arrive at a sufficiently robust result. Thus, the length of any one individual's incubation period will differ from those of others with some durations (those closer to the average) more frequently observed than others. Clearly, incubation periods of less than zero would be meaningless and use of the lognormal avoids these. Further, the lognormal, and other potentially skewed distributions such as the Gamma, capture well the distribution of the duration of the positive values, probably because incubation periods depend on a wealth of multi-factorial influences (not always well understood) acting multiplicatively, such as the differing pre-existing genetic backgrounds and immunological susceptibilities of individuals to particular viruses, their age and underlying fitness in terms of any pre-existing co-morbidities, and their nutritional and socio-economic conditions; and any variations in the pathogenicity of the particular virus or microorganism, the dose of virus received by an individual and the route of infection. Incubation periods can vary enormously between different infectious agents both in terms of average incubation period and the degree to which this varies between individuals; for example, the mean (and variances) for influenza, SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV), and smallpox have been estimated to be about 1.3 days (0.5 days 2 ), 4.6 days (15.9 days 2 ), and 11.6 days (3.34 days 2 ), respectively. Appropriately parameterising such aspects can be hugely important to modelling the dynamics (e.g. the rate and extent of spread) of particular infections and the potential impact that different public health control options might have. The extent to which they can be accurately reflected in more complex models can be extremely important and will be discussed later.",50.943716870988794,20.65718878064144

Starting with the 1918 pandemic, pregnant women have been identified to be at higher risk for severe morbidity and mortality due to influenza, compared with nonpregnant adults [2] . In the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic, pregnant women with influenza, particularly during the third trimester, were demonstrated to have increased disease severity, as well as higher rates of secondary bacterial pneumonia and increased risks of inpatient and intensive care unit admissions, compared with nonpregnant adults [3] . These risks extended to the fetus, with higher rates of stillbirth, miscarriage, and preterm birth observed with influenza virus infection during pregnancy [4] . Overall, inactivated influenza vaccination has been found to be safe, immunogenic, and effective in prevention of influenza in pregnant women [5] . Despite concerns about a relatively immunocompromised state during pregnancy, pregnant women were shown to achieve serologic protection rates generally comparable to those for nonpregnant adults [5] . The recorded epidemiologic data from the early part of the 2009 pandemic resulted in pregnant women receiving priority for vaccination in the United States and other countries, and international prioritization of influenza vaccination during pregnancy by the World Health Organization [5] [6] [7] . This recommendation was based mainly on the benefits for the pregnant women themselves. Recently, 3 large prospective controlled clinical trials again demonstrated the effectiveness of maternal influenza immunization to prevent disease in pregnant women [8] [9] [10] . These studies also demonstrated reduction of influenza incidence among infants born to vaccinated women, another important benefit of maternal immunization. Potential benefit of influenza vaccine to the fetus was only documented in Nepal, 1 of 3 clinical trials sites, where influenza was present nearly year-round and the prevalence of low birth weight and preterm birth was high, representative of the South Asian population [9, 11] . In that study, the frequency of low birth weight was significantly lower among infants born to vaccinated women. This birth-weight effect was more pronounced during periods of high influenza virus circulation and when matching of circulating virus to the vaccine strain was present [12] .

Several types of vaccine candidates have been developed, including inactivated virus, subunit peptides, nonreplicating and replicating vectored vaccines, and live attenuated vaccines [23] . No RSV vaccine candidate, however, has entered for wide-scale clinical studies. The other major virus, rhinovirus, has 1100 serotypes, and development of a vaccine is not considered to be possible at the moment. In everyday life, the only way to prevent respiratory viral infections is to understand their transmission [21, [24] [25] [26] and to try to prevent transmission through hygiene measures.

Given the propensity of these emerging infections to rapidly cause severe respiratory failure in many patients and, in the case of COVID-19, the high transmission rate of the virus and unclear overall case-fatality rate, the critical care response should be part of a larger pandemic plan to reduce transmission and prevent deaths. These preparations for the COVID-19 outbreak should involve the provision of ECMO in sufficiently resourced settings. Careful patient selection for ECMO is needed because patient age and comorbidities appear to influence outcomes in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Moreover, several variables, such as reversibility of the pulmonary disease process, risk of secondary pulmonary infections, and the role of antiviral drugs and other disease-modifying factors, might affect outcomes with ECMO.

The median age of patients co-infected with HRV/RSV was significantly lower than that of patients with single HRV-A or HRV-C infection. Furthermore, more children with dual infections had shortness of breath than those with single infections. Common causes of shortness of breath are asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary edema, and pneumonia. 28 Because the prevalence of asthma is low in Chinese children, 29 shortness of breath can be assumed to be an indication of CAP severity. In addition, in the HRV-A positive group, more children with co-infections had three severe indices and respiratory failure than those with single HRV infection (5:1 and 9:4, respectively). These differences between HRV single infection and HRV/RSV co-infections may be attributed to the RSV infection.

In this report we suggest that patients with systemic lupus erythematous might be especially prone to severe COVID-19 independent of their immunosuppressed state from lupus treatment. Specially, we provide evidence in lupus to suggest hypomethylation and overexpression of ACE2, which is located on the X chromosome and encodes a functional receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. Oxidative stress induced by viral infections exacerbates the DNA methylation defect in lupus, possibly resulting in further ACE2 hypomethylation and enhanced viremia. In addition, demethylation of interferon-regulated genes, NFκB, and key cytokine genes in lupus patients might exacerbate the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and increase the likelihood of cytokine storm. These arguments suggest that inherent epigenetic dysregulation in lupus might facilitate viral entry, viremia, and an excessive immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Further, maintaining disease remission in lupus patients is critical to prevent a vicious cycle of demethylation and increased oxidative stress, which will exacerbate susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection during the current pandemic.

[3] Since 2002 there have been two other global outbreaks of highly-pathogenic coronaviruses: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). While SARS and MERS are not identical to SARS-CoV-2 in their genetic structures or clinical manifestations, the recent outbreaks of these viruses may provide insights on the effects of COVID-19 in the context of pregnancy. The literature on SARS and MERS in pregnancy are limited to a handful of case reports and series. [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] Many of these cases involved severe morbidity including the need for intensive care and cardiorespiratory support. Notably, there were cases of maternal mortality associated with SARS and MERS infection. The only published case-control study showed that pregnant women with SARS experienced worse outcomes than nonpregnant women of similar age. [10] Reports varied with respect to the effects of SARS and MERS on pregnancy outcomes. Spontaneous abortion has been reported among women infected with SARS and MERS in the first trimester.4 As well, stillbirth, intrauterine growth restriction, and preterm birth have been reported in pregnancies affected by SARS and MERS in the second and third trimesters. [4, 9] It is important to note, however, that a number of pregnancies had good outcomes despite maternal infection with SARS or MERS. [6, 7, 8] Broadly speaking, and drawing upon our knowledge of other respiratory illnesses in pregnancy, adverse It remains to be seen whether the effects of COVID-19 on pregnant women and their fetuses will be similar to those of SARS and MERS. To date, the reported case-fatality rate for the general population infected with COVID-19 is lower than that of either SARS or MERS (estimated at 1%-2% vs. 9%-10% and 35%-40%, respectively). Similarly, by now, there have been over 60 cases of pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 in China and the vast majority of these women have had mild to moderate pneumonia. [11, 12, 13, 14] To date here has been one case of severe maternal morbidity secondary to COVID-19 reported. [12] This 31-year-old woman was infected at 34 weeks gestation and went on to experience severe respiratory compromise and multi-organ dysfunction requiring extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The pregnancy outcomes of the reported cases have been largely good, [11, 12, 13] with spontaneous and iatrogenic preterm labour being the most commonly reported adverse pregnancy outcomes. One stillbirth has been reported and this occurred in the case of severe maternal illness reported by Liu et al. [12] Given the limited data, it is too early to determine if higher rates of adverse outcomes are expected in pregnant women infected with COVID-19. As with SARS and MERS, pregnancy outcomes are likely to be strongly correlated with degree of maternal illness. [12] There has been no evidence of vertical (mother-to-infant) transmission found in any cases of SARS, MERS, or COVID-19. Additionally, analyses of amniotic fluid, serum, placenta, and breastmilk from pregnant women confirmed to have SARS or COVID-19 infection have found no detectable viral RNA, [8, 13] further supporting that vertical transmission is unlikely. Importantly, maternal infection with SARS, MERS, or COVID-19 has not been associated with teratogenicity. However, because of the small number of reported cases of infection during the first trimester (when embryogenesis occurs), risk of congenital anomaly associated with COVID-19 cannot be completely excluded.",51.424416412325236,22.129284908666246

Higher rates of stillbirth, miscarriage, and preterm birth were additionally observed with A/H1N1 pandemic influenza infection during pregnancy [8] . Epidemiologic data do not clearly support an increased risk of acquisition of infection; rather the risk is in progression to severe disease once infected [9] . However, a recent systematic review emphasized the relatively low quality of available information on the incidence rate of severe influenza in pregnant women [10] . The mechanisms underlying severe influenza in pregnancy remain unclear and could involve both anatomic and physiologic changes increasing the risk of respiratory failure, reduced immune control and increased inflammatory responses [9] . Enhanced natural killer (NK) cell and T cell responses to influenza infection were observed in pregnant as compared to non-pregnant women, suggesting that suppression of cell-mediated immune responses is unlikely to be a major contributor to disease severity [11] . Mouse studies suggest a role for impaired migration of anti-viral CD8 T lymphocytes to the lungs [12] . Increased proinflammatory responses of monocytes and dendritic cells to in vitro influenza infection were observed in pregnant as compared to non-pregnant women, suggesting a role for immunopathologic responses [13] . Influenza vaccine is safe, immunogenic and efficacious in pregnancy, as has been demonstrated in several randomized clinical trials [14] [15] [16] [17] . Few studies have evaluated the role of respiratory viruses other than influenza during pregnancy [18] . However, recently, two maternal influenza immunization trials have conducted secondary analyses of respiratory illness data during pregnancy to describe the incidence of maternal respiratory disease due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) during pregnancy [14, 16] . In Nepal, where women with a fever and respiratory symptoms had a nasal swab collected, RSV prevalence was low at 0.2%, with an incidence of 3.9/1000 person-years overall [19] . In South Africa, RSV prevalence based on the presence of respiratory symptoms was much higher at 2%, or an incidence of 14.4-48.0 cases per 1000 person-years overall [20] . Rhinovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza viruses 1-4, and human metapneumovirus have also recently been detected in cases of respiratory viral infections in pregnant women [21, 22] . Rhinovirus is described as a cause of influenza-like illness in several studies in pregnant women, and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronaviruses have been shown in case reports to be associated with severe disease in pregnant women [23, 24] . Other respiratory viruses were commonly detected in Nepal in women with fever and respiratory symptoms, with the most common being rhinovirus [22] . Health care-seeking was also common, ranging from 0% to 33% depending on the viral etiology. In a region of the world with limited access to medical care, this was a notable finding. Additionally, rhinovirus and human metapneumovirus infections with fever and respiratory symptoms during pregnancy both were found to be associated with increased risk of fetal growth restriction, manifested as low birth weight or small-for-gestational-age births [21] .

On the other hand, pregnant women also have hormonal and physiologic changes including increasing levels of estradiol and progesterone and decreased pulmonary reserve and increased cardiac output that may contribute to reduced pathogen control and more severe clinical symptoms. As discussed below, emerging evidence suggest a central role for pathogenspecific mechanisms rather than processes common to multiple pathogens (Fig. 1 ).

However, the realization of the objective of reducing this form of risky behaviour is likely to rest, in large part, upon a legal framework. Legal measures can regulate where and to whom tobacco can be sold, where it can be consumed, how it is marketed and/or displayed, the information which is provided upon the packaging and the extent to which it is taxed.

A wide range of these viruses affect the respiratory tract of transplant recipients, including adenovirus, influenza, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus. 6 During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, a multicenter cohort study of 83 pediatric solid organ transplant recipients with influenza revealed no deaths. 7 A large multicenter retrospective cohort of pediatric solid organ transplant recipients evaluated the incidence and mortality of hospital-associated respiratory virus infections (rhinovirus/enterovirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and coronavirus) in the first year after pediatric solid organ transplant. 8 Despite an overall incidence of 14.5%, death after a respiratory viral illness was quite low at 4% and only 2 of the deaths were felt to be related to the respiratory viral infection. 8 Whether or not cardiothoracic organ transplant recipients are exposed to a higher risk of infection from COVID-19, especially if freshly transplanted during the pandemic when frequency of exposure is evolving and their immune system responses are at the weakest, remains uncertain.",53.18931839280978,22.186505654402367

We only found a similar study that focused on detecting unrecognised respiratory viral infections in preterm neonates admitted after delivery. In this prospective study, which had a design similar to ours, Bennett et al. 13 observed that 52% of the 60 preterm neonates tested for viral detection had positive results during their stay. This group of neonates had longer lengths of stay, prolonged respiratory support, and a higher incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In our patients, the proportion of bronchopulmonary dysplasia was also greater in infants in whom a virus had been detected, but the group of children that tested negative for viruses had a greater gestational age, a circumstance that may lead to misinterpretation of the results. The proportions of the viruses detected by Bennett et al. differed somewhat from ours, with a high prevalence of RSV, parainfluenza virus and hMPV, especially in the winter. Rhinovirus was detected in only 27% of the patients. The lower incidence of viral infections by RSV or influenza in our group may have been due to our meticulous adherence to the preventive measures against nosocomial infections. We agree with Bennett in thinking that while there are descriptions of outbreaks of viral respiratory infections in NICUs, these studies substantiate the importance of systematic surveillance for detecting infections that would otherwise not be recognised. Preterm infants may present few or atypical symptoms, and the detection of viral infections may have profound clinical consequences.

The patient described here also had a mild and self-limiting illness. Although asymptomatic and mild manifestations of previous epidemic-associated coronaviruses (SARS and MERS) occur (6,7), these appear to be substantially more common in COVID-19.

In the ""contain"" phase of the UK COVID-19 response, early case identification was reliant on epidemiologic (not severity) criteria. The public health guidance at the time of this case was that travellers to Veneto and Lombardy were considered at risk.

A further limitation was the collection of swabs only in cases of febrile respiratory illness; asymptomatic or afebrile infections would not have been captured.

By contrast, chest CT might have a high diagnostic value because of its typical images of virus infection, high accuracy with a low false negative rate, and time efficiency. Therefore, we recommend that, in addition to using nucleic acid tests as the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, relevant clinical examinations are done, including blood counts and chest CT and a comprehensive evaluation of a patient's medical history, epidemiological exposure, and symptoms. All nine pregnant women in this study underwent a caesarean section. Indications for a caesarean section included severe pre-eclampsia, a history of caesarean sections, and fetal distress. Importantly, uncertainty about the risk of intrapartum mother-to-child transmission by vaginal delivery was another reason for carrying out caesarean sections. Four of the nine patients had preterm labour. However, the causes of premature birth were not related to COVID-19 pneumonia: one patient had severe pre-eclampsia, one had a history of two stillbirths, one had a history of two caesarean sections and irregular contractions; and one had premature rupture of the membrane for about 12 h and suspected intrauterine infection. Moreover, one neonate in our study had a birthweight of 1880 g at 36 gestational weeks plus 2 days, and this case was complicated by preeclampsia. Furthermore, the time period from onset of COVID-19 pneumonia to admission was only 3 days for this patient; therefore we reasoned that the fetal intrauterine growth restriction was more likely to be a symptom associated with pre-eclampsia.

Major determinants of dengue pathogenesis include virulence of the infecting DENV strain, host genetic factors, and pre-existing host immune responses from prior infection(s) with a different DENV serotype (Halstead and Yamarat, 1965; Messer et al., 2003; Nguyen et al., 2008; OhAinle et al., 2011; Rico-Hesse et al., 1997) .

We find that 54.3% of EID events are caused by bacteria or rickettsia, reflecting a large number of drug-resistant microbes in our database.

According to the role of viruses for inflammation and involvement of inflammation in COPD pathogenesis, studying the presence of viral infections in the airway of high-risk persons is important. The most human respiratory viruses associated with exacerbations of COPD are divided into two categories [1] : Major viruses: human rhinovirus, influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [2] , Minor viruses: parainfluenza virus, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus and adenovirus [8] .

Infectious disease outbreaks such as COVID-19, as well as other public health events, can cause emotional distress and anxiety. These feelings of distress and anxiety can occur even in people not at high risk of getting sick, in the face of a virus with which the common people may be unfamiliar.

As in South and Southeast Asia countries, also in Italy, there are similar problems in medical staff due to high workload and intermittent lack of protective devices. In addition, some slight form of racism is demonstrated against health care professionals who potentially have a higher risk of being infected and between non-front-line medical staff towards front-line medical staff. We don't have to forget the many doctors and nurses were infected and many of them died due to COVID-19 infection. Also in Italy, local people also have high levels of stress due to no firm estimate of how long pandemic will last and how long our lives will be disrupted or whether or not we or our loved ones will be infected. Previous research has revealed a profound and wide spectrum of psychological impact that outbreaks can inflict on people (Lima et al., 2020) . New psychiatric symptoms in people without mental illness can occur or aggravate the condition of those with pre-existing mental illness and cause distress to the caregivers of affected individuals (Kelvin and Rubino, 2020) . Most health professionals working in isolation units and hospitals very often do not receive any training for providing mental health care (Lima et al., 2020) . Barbisch et al.

Although some of the recently discovered respiratory viruses (e.g., coronaviruses of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, SARS, and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, MERS) have gained a lot of publicity (10), common respiratory viruses still have remarkably more impact on human health worldwide. Viral URI is usually mild and selflimiting, but the universality of the disease causes remarkable economic impact and burden (11) . In addition, URI is often complicated by bacterial infections such as AOM, acute sinusitis or pneumonia requiring antibiotic treatment (12) . In high-resource countries, public concern over viral epidemics can greatly affect and lead to increased economic costs. For example, the 2009 influenza A/H1N1 pandemic resulted in an increase in parent-initiated visits due to respiratory symptoms for healthy infants in their first year of life (13), probably because of increased parental anxiety. Yet, the influenza pandemic had no impact on the overall viral epidemiology of respiratory infections in these infants.",41.59192919115925,16.917078218691014

We have proposed two hypothetical models, passive competition and active deletion, for this attrition. The passive competition model suggests that during heterologous virus infection, pre-existing memory CD8 T cells inevitably have to compete with newly generated pathogenspecific CD8 T cells for structural niches and/or survival factors such as cytokines, and eventually some memory CD8 T cells would lose this battle and die off. Virus-specific memory CD8 T cells also have to compete with T cells expanding homeostatically in response to lymphopenic environments, which are often induced during virus infections. The passive competition scenario may be exemplified in a study by Chapdelanie et al., in which an enhanced Mycobacterium bovis-specific CD8 T cell response, due to over-expression of IL-15, resulted in more profound attrition of pre-existing Listeria monocytogenes-specific CD8 T cells [104] . The active deletion model suggests that pre-existing memory CD8 T cells undergo a bystander apoptosis and get killed off by cytotoxic factor(s) released during the early phase of new virus infection. Thus far, our experimental data with mice suggest that the majority of virus-specific memory CD8 T cell attrition is a consequence of the active deletion model (Fig. 3 ) [103, 106] .",41.127131038719796,15.64602226399882

Examples of immunologically related obstacles include instances where prior exposure to a given pathogen predisposes the host to more severe disease manifestations upon re-infection (as has been proposed in the case of dengue virus) or where earlier vaccine development efforts inadvertently lead to severe adverse events following infection with the targeted pathogen (such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV )). In each of these cases, the adverse events that follow a secondary immune exposure are believed to be the result of immunopathologic responses that result from the nature of the immune response elicited by the initial exposure to pathogen-derived antigens (by either infection or vaccination). Given that the mechanisms underlying these immunopathologic processes are incompletely understood, the development of vaccines that are highly immunogenic but not similarly inclined to elicit immunemediated adverse consequences represents a substantial challenge (especially given the very high expectations for vaccine safety). An additional immunologically related challenge relates to the observation that certain organisms encode antigens that resemble constituents of the human host. For example, in the case of Neisseria meningitidis group B, the bacterial polysaccharide resembles those found on certain human cell lineages, thus raising concerns about whether polysaccharide-based vaccines successfully developed for group B N. meningitidis might yield undesirable autoimmune responses. 33 An additional distinct, but important, practical barrier to new vaccine development relates to the prevention of diseases that are threats to pregnant women or their offspring (where immunization of the pregnant woman might be able to protect the neonate). Although a number of inactivated vaccines are either routinely recommended for use in pregnant women (e.g., inactivated influenza vaccine) or can be used in pregnant women for pre-or postexposure prophylaxis for those at risk of infection (e.g., inactivated hepatitis A vaccine and recombinant HBsAg vaccine), the development of new vaccines specifically for use in pregnant women or the study of new vaccines in pregnant women has been impeded by concerns arising from potential litigation that might follow the appearance of a congenital abnormality in a child born to a mother who was vaccinated while pregnant. 34 Given the 2-3% prevalence of congenital abnormalities, the practical difficulties in proving the safety of a new vaccine specifically administered to pregnant women, and the current litigious environment surrounding vaccines, the development of new vaccines to address important infections of pregnant women and their neonates (e.g., group B streptococcus: GBS) faces significant challenges.",41.02321472672695,16.845178715565062

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is undermining this sense of security because it is proving both highly transmissible (like H1N1) and not too deadly (unlike Ebola). The result is a relatively easily transmitted virus with a case fatality rate currently estimated as well above that of the seasonal influenza. With its high transmissibility and rapid global circulation, COVID-19 is being compared with the deadly Spanish flu outbreak of 1918. 1 On 30 January, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern. Since erupting in China, it has claimed thousands of lives there, and has now spread globally, causing infections, death and growing alarm. The WHO's initial focus was on managing droplet and contact transmission, but it has since recognized the role fomites play as well. 2 Fomites are important because while populations generally protect themselves from clearly observable droplet transmissions (coughing, sneezing), being invisible, fomite transmission is regularly overlooked both in hospitals and communities. 3e5 Consequently, during the community saturation phase, fomite transmission may play a larger role than droplet transmission as a mechanism in emergent infectious diseases. 3e6 In this paper we argue that by implementing enhanced Traffic Control Bundling (eTCB), 6 an extension of the TCB deployed by Taiwan during the 2003 SARS outbreak, countries can interrupt the community-hospital-community transmission cycle, thereby limiting COVID-19's impact.",39.096287983610544,16.470028060956803

Jackson et al. examined the relationship between early-life virus-induced wheeze and asthma development in an at-risk (parents have a history of respiratory allergy/asthma) cohort of children (COAST study [81] ). They showed that RV infections conferred the greatest probability (odd ratio = 9.8) for asthma development by age 6 [82] . Respiratory viral infections are also the cause of most asthma exacerbations. The precise mechanisms by which viral infections make asthma worse are still poorly understood. One reason for this is the difficulty inherent in repeatedly sampling the lower airways and accurately measuring the presence of infectious virus during an exacerbation. Nonetheless, inhibiting viral replication and reducing virus-induced inflammation is a sensible approach and treatments that stimulate anti-viral immunity are a potential therapy. Unlike the immune-blocking approaches described earlier, the aim here is to precisely stimulate innate anti-viral immunity thereby limiting replication and inhibiting production of asthmogenic immune mediators. The idea is that Toll-like receptors detect infection and induce expression of innate anti-viral interferons which play a key role in reducing viral load via induction of anti-viral molecules directly and initiation of a type-I immune response that antagonizes type-2 immunity and associated pulmonary allergic inflammation. The major caveat to an immune-stimulatory approach is the potential to promote inflammation and cause worse disease. Clearly, the anti-viral/immune-regulatory versus inflammatory profile of any drug in this category will need to be meticulously assessed pre-clinically before moving into human asthma trials.",38.917515554553646,16.414321888967585

Given the lack of clinical studies on antiviral treatment in pregnant women, it is difficult to recommend these drugs. Considering the physiological adaptations to pregnancy in pregnant women, conservative treatment should be provided [28]. When treating pregnant women infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the preferred protease inhibitor is lopinavir/ritonavir [29]. Among type 1 interferons, there is evidence supporting the safe use of interferon-β1a, which is used to treat multiple sclerosis, in pregnant women. Although one report showed that the incidence of spontaneous abortion increased in pregnant women who used interferon-β1a, there was no statistically significant difference with the incidence in control individuals [3031]. Therefore, the use of antiviral drugs can be considered after a comparison of risks and benefits of the drugs.

As a result, earlier clinical trials were almost exclusively performed using HAd5 vectors.8 However, although HAd5 vectors were highly efficacious in pre-clinical studies, they did not perform as anticipated in clinical trials due to pre-existing HAd5 immunity in the participants from natural exposure. Adenoviruses are some of the pathogens that can cause the common cold and a significant proportion of the human population have antibodies against these viruses due to past infections naturally acquired in the community, notably during childhood.9,10 These natural exposures can be responsible for long-lasting immunity (pre-existing immunity) that can interfere with HAd-based vaccines. In a phase I trial, individuals with pre-existing HAd5 immunity mounted lower immune responses compared with participants without pre-existing immunity.5 Pre-existing immunity to HAd5 was even associated with undesirable effects beyond neutralization of the benefits intended from vaccination. The negative impact of pre-existing HAd5 immunity was illustrated in the infamous STEP trial during which a lower frequency of individuals with high HAd5 Ab titers developed a cellular response to the transgenes (HIV Gag, Pol and Nef). Furthermore, pre-existing HAd5 immunity was associated with an increase in HIV acquisition in vaccinated participants in comparison to the placebo.7 Pre-existing HAd5 immunity was not taken into account in pre-clinical studies as animals used in these studies, such as mice and NHPs, are not naturally infected by HAd5 or other human Ads.

This was achieved through consultation with partners in Guinea, as well as a review of existing published reports on zoonotic diseases in Guinea. The second step was to determine the list of priority zoonotic diseases. This was achieved by conducting a literature search for the zoonotic diseases likely to be present or of high risk of emergence in Guinea, comparing the diseases identified via peer-reviewed and “grey” literature publications to available ministerial reportable disease lists, and holding a facilitated roundtable discussion among the ministries to add or remove diseases from consideration, and then prioritize. During the roundtable discussion, held in November 2015, we convened representatives from MOH, MOL, and MOE to categorize the different zoonotic diseases as emerging, epidemic-prone, or endemic in Guinea, as well as review the factors to be considered for prioritization in the Guinean context. Examples of factors included the economic and/or social impact of the disease, the case fatality rate in humans and/or animals, the overall health burden or morbidity caused by the disease, and implications for trade. Facilitators started the discussion by mentioning common zoonotic diseases and asking each Ministry (MOH, MOL, MOE) to present their perspectives related to the different factors. Participants were encouraged to provide supporting evidence on potential priority zoonotic diseases, including national statistics on prevalence, distribution, economic impact, and case fatality rate, where available. Disease information from international normative sources, such as WHO and OIE, was used alongside national data when considering the various factors.

The respiratory diseases resulting from these viral infections represent one of the main causes of death in developing countries.1 A more thorough understanding of respiratory viruses, their epidemiology, as well as medical impact on the communities they affect will delineate the path toward eventual treatments and future abatement of the illnesses. While symptoms of many respiratory viruses are similar, the viruses themselves are characteristically unique. Categorically, viruses are grouped based on similarities such as the nature of their nucleic acid genome, envelope presence, overall size, and even capsid uniformity.2 This review focuses on the following families of RNA viruses: Orthomyxoviridae, Paramyxoviridae and Pneumoviridae, Picornaviridae, and Coronaviridae. Orthomyxoviridae comprise negative (–) sense single-stranded (ss) RNA viruses that are segmented, enveloped, and includes the influenza viruses (see Table 1). Paramyxoviridae and Pneumoviridae are also (–)ssRNA viruses, but are non-segmented and enveloped, and include parainfluenza virus (PIV), human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and human metapneumovirus (HMPV). The Picornaviridae family, which contains positive (+)ssRNA viruses are non-enveloped; the key members include the rhinoviruses and enteroviruses. Lastly, the Coronaviridae are (+)ssRNA enveloped viruses, which include, chiefly, human coronavirus (HCoV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) CoV.3 Young children, the elderly, and patients with compromised cardiac, pulmonary, or immune systems are at greatest risk for serious disease associated with these RNA virus respiratory infections. In a 10-year study, over 85% of acute respiratory viral infections in critically ill children admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit were caused by either a picornavirus, RSV, PIV, or HMPV (see Figure 1).4 Other DNA viruses such as adenovirus can be the source of respiratory infections but will not be discussed here.",38.015660596565716,17.095733626123973

Different studies have shown that in swine workers the prevalence of subjects with detectable serum anti HEV immunoglobulin G (IgG) is higher than in general population [13], but data regarding seroprevalence might be affected by the different kits used for the analysis, showing significant variability in levels of sensitivity. Therefore, the real incidence of HEV infection in the general population and among workers cannot be estimated yet and further research is needed.

During the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa in 2014–2016, thousands of people were infected and many of them died due to the viral infection [1]. EVD is generally considered as an endemic disease in Africa. However, its spread can be broadened through travel to all parts of the world. It is known to be transmitted from humans, bats, rodents, and chimpanzees to humans. Ebola virus belongs to the Filoviridae family [2]. Ebola virus has a negative sense RNA genome that encodes 7 different proteins and is surrounded by an envelope that contains the virally expressed glycoprotein (GP). There are five species of Ebola virus including, Zaire ebolavirus, Sudan ebolavirus, Tai Forest ebolavirus, Bundibugyo ebolavirus and Reston ebolavirus, all of which were named after the places where they were first discovered [3]. Ebola virus GP is associated with viral attachment to the host cell receptor prior to viral entry into the cells [45]. To date, neutralizing antibodies targeting Ebola virus GP have been reported to be somewhat effective at reducing the severity of Ebola virus infection and disease progression in animal models and humans. For example, when Ebola virus-infected monkeys were treated within 24 hours following Ebola virus challenge with ZMAb (composed of three monoclonal antibodies [MAbs] against Ebola virus GP), all survived from Ebola virus infection, while all monkeys without ZMAb treatment died within five days of viral infection [67] Furthermore, ZMapp (Mapp Biopharmaceutical) treatment is known to be effective at reducing mortality rates in patients infected with Ebola virus [8]. Despite the severity of Ebola virus infection, there are currently neither preventive vaccines nor therapeutic drugs readily available for use. Thus, development of vaccines or more effective drugs against Ebola viral infection is highly demanding.",23.262038632620783,12.175890824731482

We speculate that the increased expression of ACE2 in the lungs of smokers could partially contribute to the severe cases of COVID-19 that have been observed in this population. In support of this hypothesis, mice that were engineered to express high levels of human ACE2 succumbed to infections with a related coronavirus more quickly than mice that expressed low levels of human ACE2 9 . Nonetheless, the relevance of increased ACE2 expression as a driver of disease susceptibility in humans or for SARS-CoV-2 remains to be demonstrated. Chronic smokers may exhibit a number of co-morbidities, including emphysema, atherosclerosis, and decreased immune function 86 , that are also likely to affect COVID-19 progression. While the effects of smoking can last for years, smoking cessation causes an improvement in lung function and an overall decrease in disease burden 86 . Interestingly, quitting smoking also leads to a normalization of respiratory epithelial architecture 87 , a decrease in hyperplasia 88 , and a downregulation of ACE2 levels.

After adjusting for country economic status, proportion of older population and aligning the epidemic trajectories of the highest hit countries, the intriguing observation of a significant association between BCG use and lower COVID-19-attributable mortality remained discernable.",38.55272748070489,16.52585832575098

COVID-19 is marked by its rapid progression from mild to severe conditions, particularly in the absence of adequate medical care. However, the physiological changes associated with COVID-19 are barely understood. In this study, we performed untargeted metabolomic and lipidomic analyses of plasma from a cohort of COVID-19 patients who had experienced different symptoms. We found the metabolite and lipid alterations exhibit apparent correlation with the course of disease in these COVID-19 patients, indicating that the development of COVID-19 affected patient metabolism. Moreover, many of the metabolite and lipid alterations, particularly ones associated with hepatic functions, have been found to align with the progress and severity of COVID-19. This work provides valuable knowledge about blood biomarkers associated with COVID-19 and potential therapeutic targets, and presents important resource for further studies of COVID-19 pathogenesis. : medRxiv preprint 4 critical illness, metabolic and lipid abnormalities are commonly observed, which are believed to contribute to physiology and pathology.

Knowledge of the interplay between molecular-scale virus-receptor interactions, single-cell viral replication, intracellular-scale viral transport, and emergent tissue-scale viral propagation is limited. Moreover, little is known about immune system-virus-tissue interactions and how these can result in low-level (asymptomatic) infections in some cases and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in others, particularly with respect to presentation in different age groups or pre-existing inflammatory risk factors like diabetes. A critical question for treatment and protection is why it appears that the severity of infection may correlate with the initial level of virus exposure. Given the nonlinear interactions within and among each of these processes, multiscale simulation models can shed light on the emergent dynamics that lead to divergent outcomes, identify actionable ""choke points"" for pharmacologic interactions, screen potential therapies, and identify potential biomarkers that differentiate response dynamics. Given the complexity of the problem and the acute need for an actionable model to guide therapy discovery and optimization, we introduce a prototype of a multiscale model of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in lung and intestinal tissue that will be iteratively refined. The first prototype model was built and shared internationally as open source code and interactive, cloud-hosted executables in under 12 hours. In a sustained community effort, this model will integrate data and expertise across virology, immunology, mathematical biology, quantitative systems physiology, cloud and high performance computing, and other domains to accelerate our response to this critical threat to international health.",32.99545135779548,13.716614780219187
