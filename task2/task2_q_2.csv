In Iran, the first cases of COVID-19 were officially announced between February 19 and 23, 2020 and it soon became clear that Iran is one of the countries that is worst-hit by COVID-19 outbreak (1, 2) . It is now evident that most cases of COVID-19 disease develop mild respiratory and constitutional symptoms (3), while some cases are asymptomatic (3, 4) . Involvement of other organs, including liver and kidneys has been reported in patients with COVID-19 (5). Many questions remain unanswered about associations and presentations of COVID-19. Shohada-e-Tajrish Hospital, a university hospital located in Tehran, Iran, was designated as one of the main centers providing diagnostic and healthcare services for patients suspected to be infected with the new virus. Here, we share our experience regarding computed tomography (CT) findings suggestive of COVID-19 disease among patients who underwent radiologic investigation due to traumatic injuries. Several trauma patients had findings on their chest and/or abdominal CT scans, which were suggestive or highly suggestive of COVID-19 (1). The findings were noted in the lung bases that were visible on an abdominal CT scan or on a clinically indicated spiral CT scan of the chest. The most frequent mechanisms of injury were fall and car accident. Conscious patients did not report dizziness or loss of consciousness before the trauma and most of them did not have any symptoms related to COVID-19 (e.g., fever, shortness of breath). To our knowledge, there is no study or report about the possible association between COVID-19 and trauma in the lit-erature. So, the mentioned observations could be just a coincidence, but this association could still be proposed as a research objective. The importance of this finding is that CT characteristics of COVID-19 could be seen in patients who were admitted to the hospitals not due to COVID-19 related symptoms, but because of chest and abdominal trauma. This issue should be considered by health care workers serving trauma patients and it should be kept in mind that during an outbreak of respiratory infections, in particular COVID-19 disease, every attempt should be made to protect the health and safety of the staff even when providing care for trauma patients.",42.13741452069586,15.229224313361218

A substantial proportion of patients have persistent infiltrates weeks after LRI onset. Mittl et al. found that in 81 patients hospitalized with CAP, 33% had delayed resolution of pneumonia [7] , but this was not associated with mortality. Bruns et al. found that in 288 patients hospitalized for CAP, 47% had infiltrates 28 days after onset of CAP and delayed resolution of CAP was associated with more severe disease [8] , although progression of infiltrates was not associated with mortality. Lisboa et al. found that in 457 ICU patients, rapid progression of CAP, as defined by >50% increase in CXR infiltrates from baseline to 48 hours, was a stronger predictor of shock and mortality than bacteremia [6] . While all of these prior investigators found that radiographic changes are common during the course of LRI, their conclusions regarding the relationship between radiographic changes and mortality vary. We believe that the reason for this variability in conclusions between prior reports is due at least in part to differences in patient selection and analytic methodology (S1 Discussion). Our population was ideal for testing the validity of RSI as we focused on a well-defined population of patients who had a high baseline risk for mortality and who had early LRI, similar to Lisboa et al [6] . Mortality in pneumonia can range from 7% in non-immunocompromised inpatients with CAP [33] to >50% in immunocompromised patients with pneumonia [34] [35] [36] . By studying RSI in a population of patients with a high baseline risk of mortality after PIV-associated LRI [18] [19] [20] , we ensured that we had a sufficiently high event rate to measure the effect of LRI progression on mortality. In addition, our focus on early LRI allowed us to preserve the potential for us to capture the full magnitude of worsening radiologic severity. Our use of longitudinal assessments with extended Cox models employing time-varying covariates gave us greater power to measure the effects of LRI progression on mortality due to the ability to precisely measure the progression of radiologic severity while accounting for changing severity and without introducing bias.",36.70943074117357,14.824198840474974

Subsequently, on March 12, 2020, 125,048 cases and 4,614 deaths were reported. Coronavirus is an enveloped RNA virus, from the genus Betacoronavirus, that is distributed in birds, humans, and other mammals. WHO has named the novel coronavirus disease as COVID-19.

The disease is named due to the similarities to the SARS outbreak in China of 2002, which was also caused by a coronavirus. However, SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be caused by a novel coronavirus not seen before. Alongside uncertainty related to infection aetiology and outcomes, emerging concerns relate to the use of common non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroids. The Belgian Federal Agency for Medicines and Health Products released a statement on 16th March 2020 stating 'It is well known that NSAIDs and corticosteroids can lead to serious complications'. Equally, a report by French Authorities suggested the use of ibuprofen in COVID-19 patients was detrimental to patient condition and recovery. NSAIDs are often used for the management of mild pain in cancer patients; hence, this topic is of particular importance to these patients. We, therefore, sought to gather information on the use of NSAIDs or corticosteroids and COVID-19, through systematic review of existing literature.",38.85977356002469,14.085826692635901

COVID-19 is a self-limiting disease in more than 80% of patients. Severe pneumonia occurred in about 15% of cases as revealed in studies with large cohorts of patients. The gross case fatality is 3.4% worldwide as of February 25, 2020. This rate is 4.4% for patients in Wuhan, 4.0% for patients in Hubei and 0.92% for patients outside of Hubei. The exceedingly high fatality in Wuhan might be explained by the collapse of hospitals, a large number of undiagnosed patients, suboptimal treatment or a combination of these. Up to date, we still do not have any specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents but an anti-Ebola drug, remdesivir, may hold the promise. As a nucleotide analog, remdesivir was shown to be effective in preventing MERS-CoV replication in monkeys. Severity of disease, viral replication, and lung damage were reduced when the drug was administered either before or after infection with MERS-CoV [10] . These results provide the basis for a rapid test of the beneficial effects of remdesivir in COVID-19. Other antiviral agents worthy of further clinical investigations include ribavirin, protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir, interferon α2b, interferon β, chloroquine phosphate, and Arbidol. However, we should also bear in mind the side effects of these antiviral agents. For example, type I interferons including interferon α2b and interferon β are well known for their antiviral activity. Their beneficial effects at an early phase of infection are well expected. However, administration at a later stage carries the risk that they might worsen the cytokine storm and exacerbate inflammation. Notably, steroids have been experimentally used widely in the treatment of SARS and are still preferred by some Chinese physicians in the treatment of COVID-19. It is said to be capable of stopping the cytokine storm and preventing lung fibrosis. However, the window in which steroids might be beneficial to patients with COVID-19 is very narrow. In other words, steroids can only be used when SARS-CoV-2 has already been eliminated by human immune response. Otherwise, SARS-CoV-2 replication will be boosted leading to exacerbation of symptoms, substantial virus shedding, as well as increased risk for nosocomial transmission and secondary infection. In this regard, it will be of interest to determine whether the report of fungal infection in the lungs of some patients in Wuhan might be linked to misuse of steroids. Nevertheless, the screening of new pharmaceuticals, smallmolecule compounds and other agents that have potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects will successfully derive new and better lead compounds and agents that might prove useful in the treatment of COVID-19.",50.391262767544774,18.950696108481274

We included a population-based sample consisting of all children aged <16 years who were admitted with acute RTI, although the vast majority were aged <5 years. We used a compound severity score combining several outcome measures. Although this score has not been validated, it fit the routines at our department and rather rigorously defined severe disease, and provided reliable risk factor estimates. We confirmed that independent risk factors for both severe HMPV and RSV infections were the presence of chronic diseases and a history of prematurity. Children aged 12 to 23 months had a three-fold increased risk of developing severe HMPV infection, and those aged !24 months had a nearly four-fold increased risk. Among RSV-infected children, infants less than six months had a nearly double risk compared to older children. Having one or more chronic diseases doubled the risk in both virus types, but due to a significant co-variation, our data set could not be used to identify which chronic diseases more precisely increased the risk. Prematurity with a gestational age less than 36 weeks increased the risk of severe HMPV infection three-fold, as shown by others [31] , and severe RSV infection for approximately 50%. However, prophylactic use of palivizumab in high-risk children may have confounded this risk estimation in relation to RSV. Hence, in hospitalized children, our data confirm the findings from other studies that particular age groups, prematurity and the presence of chronic diseases independently increase the risk of developing severe LRTI among children with HMPV infection [2, 17, 18, 29, [31] [32] [33] and RSV infection [18, 24, [27] [28] [29] [30] .",32.44182063350375,13.337430165442361

This is an excellent example of how a high-quality clinical study can make a major difference in policy setting. Several important clinical features of COVID-19 have also been documented in this study. First, an attack rate of 83% within the family context is alarmingly high, indicating the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. Second, the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in this family range from mild to moderate, with more systematic symptoms and more severe radiological abnormalities seen in older patients. Generally, COVID-19 appears to be less severe than SARS. Third, an asymptomatic child was found to have ground-glass opacities in his lung and SARS-CoV-2 RNA in his sputum sample. This finding of asymptomatic virus shedding raises the possibility for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from asymptomatic carriers to others, which is later confirmed by others [2] . Finally, the presentation of diarrhea in two young adults from the same family also suggests the possibility for gastrointestinal involvement in SARS-CoV-2 infection and fecal-oral transmission. The study has set the stage for the control and management of COVID-19 [1] .

In response, the National Health Commission of China [5] has established crisis psychological intervention teams across many Ivyspring International Publisher psychiatric hospitals in Hubei province and other parts of China [6] . This inevitably places increased pressure on the already inadequate mental health resources in China. For instance, the proportion of psychiatrists and doctors in psychiatric hospitals was 2.15 per 100,000 in 2016 [7] , which is considerably lower than that in most developed countries [8] . The mental health emergency response and deployment of expert teams from psychiatric hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak may further deplete mental health services across psychiatric hospitals. In China, the public psychiatric hospitals are either run by the Ministry of Health, or by the public security and civil affairs systems. Apart from regular psychiatric services, psychiatric hospitals in the public security and civil affairs systems provide services in the areas of forensic psychiatry, substance dependence and psychiatric rehabilitation. Compared to those run by the Ministry of Health, these hospitals are usually located in suburban areas with poorer protective equipment and training for infectious diseases, which is associated with higher risk of the COVID-19 transmission. Some measures should be adopted to resolve these challenges. For example, outpatient visits need to be reduced in psychiatric hospitals, admission criteria should be tightened, and the length of hospitalization should be shortened [9] .",35.99535790089066,16.91106714458419

Compared with the previous two epidemics (SARS and MERS), the case fatality rate was lower and approximately 2% in COVID-19, and only less than 15% of patients would seek hospital services. However, the case fatality rate of SARS and MERS was 10% and 34%, respectively (18) . Results of a study in China revealed the overall case fatality rate of 2.3% for COVID-19 (27) and some studies reported case fatality rate of 0.9% in Beijing (28) . In another study, Jung and colleagues reported a confirmed case fatality risk of 5.3% to 8.4% for COVID-19 (23) . However, due to the rapid spread of COVID-19, there is a higher number of death cases in the recent pandemic (N=3043, up to 02 March 2020) compared to SARS and MERS (N=1871) (29) . There is a poor prognosis for the disease in middle and older aged patients (28) . In a study on 44672 confirmed cases in China, case fatality rate was highest in the group of over 80 years (14.77%), followed by the age group between 70 to 80 years (7.96%) and no mortality was reported in age group below 10 years (30) . Even though death outcome is uncommon in young people, a few deaths are reported in this age group in China and Iran. Availability of and access to healthcare facilities has likely contributed to increase in death outcome. As a probable explanation for the difference between fatality rate in Wuhan (3%) and other provinces (0.7%) in China, death rates are likely affected by shortage in health resources due to increasing number of patient who had sought diagnosis and treatment services in the early phase of the epidemic in Wuhan (31).",44.467683752348705,16.59915969842646

Although a 30-bed ward in an infectious disease hospital in Wuhan was established for psychiatric patients on 3 February 2020, the rapidly escalating number of cases has led to a severe shortage of hospital beds. As an alternative, isolation wards have been established in psychiatric hospitals for psychiatric patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19, but this option could increase the risk of hospital-acquired infection especially if there is inadequate capacity for infection control in these hospitals [1] . Another option is to establish specific quarantine facilities for clinically stable psychiatric patients with mild-moderate symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Gymnasiums, exhibition centers and sports centers have been converted into 'Fang Cang' (temporary quarantine hospital facilities) for infected patients with mild symptoms [14] (Figure 1 ). In conclusion, the COVID-19 outbreak has raised numerous challenges for psychiatric hospitals in China to safely manage patients' major psychiatric disorders in addition to preventing and treating COVID-19.

Prevalence of Underlying Diseases in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19: a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"The key problems surrounding this novel virus are as follows: diagnosis, mode of transmission, long incubation period (3 to 14 days), predicting the number of infected cases in the community, and insufficient protection resources due to its pandemic specification (15, 18) . The accurate transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown, since various factors impact its transmission. Moreover, infection of family clusters and healthcare workers indicate the human to human transmission of the disease and its contagiousness, which makes the condition more complicated (19, 20) . Since SARS-CoV-2 is a newly identified pathogen, there is no pre-existing immunity to it in the human community, also there is no definitive cure to interrupt or reduce its astonishing spread. These ambiguities make the condition more serious for vulnerable members of the community, which include individuals with immune problems, co-existing comorbidity and elderly people. Despite the novelty of the topic, there are a lot of proposed studies about history, transmission route, urgency of responding, pathogenic potential characteristics and prevention strategies but there are still some underlying diseases that have remained unknown (21) . According to the current analysis, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, kidney disease, smoking, and COPDs were among the most prevalent underlying diseases among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. In terms of pre-existing medical conditions, cardiovascular diseases had the highest prevalence among diseases that put patients at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 threats. Decreasing the proinflammatory cytokines, which leads to a weaker immune function may account for this condition (2, 22) . It is worth noting that similar results were found regarding MERS (23) . We also found that smokers are more susceptible to Coronavirus infections, especially to the most recent species. Various reasons may justify this happening. It has been mentioned that smokers have unregulated ACE2 in remodeled cell types, which is consistent with results of SARS studies. However, factors such as amount of smoking, the duration of smoking, and the duration of smoking cessation also play a role. In some previous studies on MERS-CoV-2 it has been shown that dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4), which is the specific receptor for this virus, had a higher rate of expression in smokers and COPD patients (24) . Although the results of the current analysis indicate that smoking can be an underlying factor that makes people susceptible to COVID-19 complications, in some studies, especially COVID-19 related studies, no strong evidence has been found regarding the correlation of COPD and smoking with being infected with this new virus. But the important point that must be taken into consideration is that the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection is more severe in COPD cases and smokers (25) . As mentioned in the results section, patients with malignancies are more in danger than those without any tumor. Anticancer treatments such as chemotherapy and surgery put this group into an immunosuppressive state and subsequently at higher risk of MERS-CoV-2 infection (26) . Among those with malignancies, lung cancer patients seems to be more susceptible, and they must follow guidance on restricting any contact with possible infected zones or individuals for their safety (14) . Possible risk factors for progressive and severe illness may include the above-mentioned factors but are not limited to them; pregnancy and old age are other risky conditions, which should be monitored meticulously. However, there is no clear evidence about the risk of transmission of COVID-19 to the newborn during vaginal delivery or transmission via breastfeeding but care and protection of newborns against possible exposure to infection or contaminated conditions such as maternal breast contamination must be observed. Since MERS-CoV-2 is an emerging virus, no specific treatment is currently available (27, 28) , and pathophysiology of this condition is still unknown. Therefore, general prevention measures such as the following should be followed: Washing hands frequently and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, and mouth with contaminated hands, avoiding close contact ,especially with those who have fever, coughing or sneezing, avoiding contact with live animals and consuming raw animal products (29) . There are some responsibilities for health policymakers in this critical condition: Screening of travelers, triage all patients on admission and immediately isolating all suspected and confirmed cases, providing protective gear, preparing local guidance and instructions for people, especially for high risk groups (30, 31) . To the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis that estimates the prevalence of underlying diseases in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Given that most studies on CoVID-19 are in an early stage, and there are some limitations such as small number of studies, and reports being restricted to China and a few other countries, due to the pandemic nature of the disease, specific patterns should be introduced for different groups, including people with underlying diseases, to minimize the harm. Based on the experiences gained on this disease during this short time, a strong recommendation for all people, clinicians, and policymakers is to guide people to protect themselves to avoid being exposed to SARS-CoV-2, whenever possible (32) . Another very important advice to patients with underlying diseases during the epidemics like the one caused by the novel virus is to follow guidance on travel restrictions. These groups must be aware of their high-risk situation and comply with all health guidelines such as hand hygiene, face care, and restricting social interactions. In addition, to reduce the morbidity and complications of COVID-19 in different populations, especially patients with the mentioned underlying diseases, we recommend clinicians and policymakers to launch diagnostic procedures for such individuals first so that proper treatments can be designed and followed to ensure they are protected within epidemic regions (33) .",40.90799049658326,15.545774902581787

Factors of particular importance in the prediction rule, including poultry exposure history, fever, shortness of breath and leukopenia, agreed generally with findings reported from previous epidemiological and clinical studies [4] . We had chosen the model with the best performance in terms of both the high sensitivity and area under the ROC curve, which were also maintained in the validation samples, to identify patients having a high risk for the infection at their initial clinical presentation so as to optimize resources during an epidemic. As generally recognized by previous reports, most laboratory-confirmed cases of A(H7N9) have had a high risk of disease progression and fatality [3, 5] . Early initiation of antiviral treatment and provision of a suitable level of intensive care have been identified as important factors in determining the final outcome of patients hospitalized with A(H7N9) virus infection [24] . Our decision tool allows an initial risk assessment to be performed by frontline physicians in a setting where simple laboratory and radiographic examination may not be readily available, based only on simple information obtainable from the history and physical examination. In a setting with greater resources, the risk estimation of those deemed to have a non-trivial risk at step 1 could be further refined by the availability of simple radiographic and laboratory testing results. The scoring system also helps to categorize those being predicted as high-risk into different risk strata to facilitate further clinical decision-making (including the need for further work up, admission decision and ward allocation, initial treatment regimen, level of care and monitoring, and so on) before a definitive diagnosis based on RT-PCR can be available, often at a much later time. Despite the current belief that A(H7N9) virus may not be readily transmitted from person to person, [3, 10] the existence of limited person-to-person transmission in a close contact setting [25] also carries an implication for this risk stratification tool to better inform isolation decision and practice.",34.404016001312044,14.022143575698967

In response to this unprecedented outbreak, which has already produced a higher number of infected cases and mortality within the first 6 weeks of its declaration than the entire outbreak of SARS-CoV in 2003, 2,3 a rapid infection control response is essential to contain and mitigate the risk of nosocomial transmission and outbreak. In the SARS-CoV outbreak, almost 60% of nosocomial acquisition of SARS-CoV occurred among HCWs 4 ; therefore, it is critically important to implement proactive infection control measures among HCWs, and these measures must be planned in advance. In Hong Kong, a cosmopolitan city of 1,104 km 2 with a population of 7.45 million in southern China, we are at a high risk of importation of infected cases from mainland China. Therefore, we progressively stepped up our infection control measures by widening the clinical and epidemiological criteria of surveillance for early recognition and isolation of index cases according to the evolution of the epidemic. In particular, having visited a hospital in mainland China was introduced as an epidemiological criterion for surveillance on day 17 of our infection control preparedness measures, even though COVID-19 was confined to Wuhan, Hubei Province, until day 20. 2 The criteria of previous hospital visit was included because it had previously been determined to be a risk factor for SARS acquisition in China. 14 Under the surveillance program, of 42 cases of COVID-19 were identified in Hong Kong, 36 were immediately isolated in AIIR upon admission. During the SARS outbreak, the median time between index patient admission and patient isolation was 4.5 days (1-13 days), according to a review of literature. 4 At the same time, we enhanced the infection control measures by implementing standard, contact, droplet, and airborne precautions for suspected or confirmed cases. We stepped up the use of PPE among HCWs performing aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs), even when caring for patients without clinical features and epidemiological exposure risk in the general wards. Performance of AGPs such as endotracheal intubation, open suctioning, and use of high-flow oxygen was a risk factor for nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV among HCWs. 15 In addition, provision of surgical masks to all HCWs, patients, and visitors in clinical areas was implemented on day 5. Although wearing a surgical mask alone was not clearly associated with protection from acquisition of SARS-CoV, wearing a surgical mask by either HCWs or patients reduces the risk of nosocomial transmission of pandemic influenza. 16, 17 The combination of hand hygiene with face masks shows statistically significant efficacy against laboratory-confirmed influenza in the community, as illustrated in a systematic review and meta-analysis. 18 Hand hygiene among HCWs and patients was promoted and enforced during the COVID-19 epidemic. 19, 20 With this bundle of infection prevention measures, we were able to maintain zero nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 after the importation of first confirmed case on day 22 in Hong Kong.",36.35690687570162,12.951504520233625

Among such individuals, cancer patients represent a large subgroup at high risk of developing coronavirus infection and its severe complications. A recent nationwide analysis in China demonstrated that, of 1590 COVID-19 cases from 575 hospitals, 18 had a history of cancer (1 vs 0.29% of cancer incidence in the overall Chinese population, respectively), with lung cancer as the most frequent diagnosis [5] . Patients with cancer were observed to have a higher risk of severe events compared with patients without cancer (39 vs 8%; p = 0.0003). Moreover, cancer patients who underwent recent chemotherapy or surgery had a higher risk of clinically severe events than did those not receiving treatment. With the limit of a small sample size, the authors concluded that patients with cancer might have a higher risk of COVID-19, and poorer outcomes, than individuals without cancer. As a consequence, they recommended to consider an intentional postponing of adjuvant chemotherapy or elective surgery for stable cancer in endemic areas [5] .",51.87692414075109,21.387841272577546

Furthermore, the limited cancer patient population described in this first report from the literature, was curiously characterized by the lack of individuals receiving anticancer immunotherapy. Indeed, only chemotherapy and surgery were cited among treatments received by patients in the month prior to developing COVID-19. Maybe, this could simply be due to the casualty of a small sample, or otherwise, it could suggest that cancer patients receiving immunotherapy are less prone to develop COVID-19 or to be admitted in hospital due to severe coronavirus symptoms. Currently, we are aware of the probably higher incidence of misdiagnosed coronavirus infections compared with that reported and updated every day; it is likely that a great portion of healthy and young population develop COVID-19 with mild symptoms, not requiring hospital admittance and thus escaping the laboratory confirmation of the disease [7] . Cancer patients undergoing treatment with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 or anti-CTLA-4 immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) currently used in everyday practice to treat solid tumors such as melanoma, lung cancer, renal carcinoma, urothelial cancers and head and neck carcinoma constitute a growing oncological population [8] .

CRS is characterized by elevated levels of IL-6, IFN-γ and other cytokines, provoking consequences and symptoms related to immune activation, ranging from fever, malaise and myalgias to severe organ toxicity, lung failure and death. In parallel, one of the most important mechanism underlying the deterioration of disease in COVID-19 is represented by the cytokine storm, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome or even multiple organ failure [16] . The cytometric analyses of COVID-19 patients showed reduced counts of peripheral CD4 and CD8 T cells, while their status was hyperactivated. In addition, an increased concentration of highly proinflammatory CCR6+ Th17 in CD4 T cells has been reported, and CD8 T cells were found to harbor high concentrations of cytotoxic granules, suggesting that overactivation of T cells tends to contribute to the severe immune injury of the disease [17] . Moreover, the pathological findings associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome in COVID-19 showed abundant interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate in the lungs, dominated by lymphocytes, once again implying that the immune hyperactivation mechanisms are at least partially accountable for COVID-19 severity [17] .

The overall incidence rate of ICI-related pneumonitis ranges from 2.5-5% with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy to 7-10% with anti-CTLA-4/anti-PD-1 combination therapy [12] . The dominant radiological pattern of lung immune-related adverse events (irAEs) is organizing pneumonia, but ICI-related pneumonitis could exhibit a variety of patterns, also including nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis [13] . Despite being rarer than other irAEs, pneumonitis is the most fatal AE associated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor therapy, accounting for 35% of treatment-related toxic deaths [14] . Considering that underlying lung disease, particularly including interstitial pneumopathy, is considered a risk factor for ICI-related pneumonitis, it could be reasonable taking into account the risk of treating patients while they are developing an initial form of COVID-19.

Most experienced staff should look after the patient, in order to minimize contamination to few personnel only. Since conventional methods of Non-invasive mechanical ventilation (CPAP/BiPAP) are inadvisable due to aerosol generation, it is suggested to secure a definitive airway with extreme precaution (2) . Pre-oxygenation can be performed with a Bag Valve Mask device with positive end expiratory valve and a viral filter, if available. It is recommended to form a good facemask seal with both hands, while making sure not to deliver any positive breaths (2) . Induction and relaxant medications should be administered at a maximum dose in order to prevent cough or gag reflex during the procedure (3). A video laryngoscope should be used so as to avoid having the operator position their face close to the patient. The most senior physician should at-tempt maintaining the airway, in order to maximally ensure first pass intubation success; however, in a failed airway scenario, attempts should be made to establish a surgical airway immediately. The endotracheal tube (ETT) should be positioned at a predetermined depth and secured properly. Avoid auscultation attempts to prevent instrument contamination, and look for bilateral chest rise or end tidal capnography waveform. If available, a viral filter should be connected to the adapter of the ETT, and another should be placed at the exhalation port of the ventilator (2) . A plastic transparent sheet can be placed over the patientâȂŹs head and chest to prevent droplet spread (4). All contaminated instruments should be placed in a transparent bag for immediate disposal and/or decontamination. The ARDSnet (acute respiratory distress syndrome network) protocol should be followed for patient ventilation. In case of poor PaO2/FiO2(PF) ratio (<150), place the patient in prone position (5) . Allow for permissive hypercapnia (pH > 7.2), if hemodynamics remain stable (6, 7) . Do not give fluid boluses and maintain the patient in negative balance (8) .

Prior studies have demonstrated that people aged 65 years old and with at least one underlying medical condition were at high risk of severe influenza-related complications [20] .The finding of apparent lower risk of developing severe SARI associated with reported antibiotic use prior to hospital admission is interesting and concerning. One potential explanation is that a proportion of SARI cases caused by bacterial pathogens, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib), were sensitive to the antibiotics taken, and thus patients had initiated partially effective treatment before hospitalization. However, our data showed that even among the 281 influenza-infected SARI patients, those who reported taking antibiotics before hospitalization were also less likely to develop severe SARI than those who did not (3%, 4/136 vs. 16%, 12/77; p = 0.001). The issue of appropriate antibiotic use deserves further investigation. In our study, the antibiotic use prior to hospitalization was self-reported, and thus ascertainment of antibiotic use may have been biased. Further, it is unclear what proportions of antibiotic use were appropriate versus inappropriate. Antiviral treatment within 2 days of influenza illness onset reduces the probability of influenza-related serious complications, including mortality in adults, and the duration of influenza virus shedding [21] [22] [23] [24] . A meta-analysis showed that neuraminidase inhibitor treatment of hospitalized adults with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection reduced mortality, even when treatment was started after 2 days of illness onset [24] . A retrospective study of hospitalized adults with seasonal influenza in Hong Kong, Beijing, and Singapore reported that neuraminidase inhibitor treatment was independently associated with reduced mortality [25] . The US CDC advises that all patients with suspected or confirmed influenza who are hospitalized, present with severe illness, or are at higher risk for influenza-associated complications regardless of illness severity should receive early antiviral treatment [26] . In our study, while 1,114 (62%) of the 1790 SARI patients were hospitalized within 2 days of illness and thus would have potentially benefitted from early antiviral treatment, only 5 received oseltamivir treatment during their hospitalization. In China, oseltamivir is not prescribed routinely and is usually only administered when hospitalized patients with confirmed influenza are in critical condition. This practice delays treatment to well beyond the time when it would decrease illness severity.",30.1353445954508,13.961581345159336

Chen et al., found that LDH had significantly increased in most patients, while albumin had decreased, but ALT and AST showed no significant changes (11) . The mentioned val- ues were also reported for patients with MERS-CoV, where elevated ALT, AST and LDH was observed (6) . Another study indicated that 2-11% of patients with COVID-19 had liver co-morbidities and 14-53% of cases had abnormal ALT and AST levels during progression of COVID-19 disease (12) . Furthermore, Shi et al. studied patients whose COVID-19 diagno- sis was confirmed by computed tomography (CT) scan while in the subclinical phase and found that incidence of AST abnormality among these patients was significantly lower than those diagnosed after the onset of symptoms (13) . Therefore, liver injury is more prevalent in severe cases compared to mild cases of COVID-19. In another report, Yang et al. found no difference in the incidence of abnormal liver function between survivors (30%) and non-survivors (28%) (9) . Liver damage in mild cases of COVID-19 is often transient and can return to normal without any special treatment (12) . We have found that the number and percentage of WBC, LYM and NEU were significantly different between positive and negative RT-PCR cases for COVID-19/or SARS-CoV-2. In comparison to the normal range, we found low WBC and LYM counts in patients with positive RT-PCR COVID-19, whereas NEU counts were higher in these patients. In previous reports, low LYM and WBC counts were found in most patients, which is in line with our study (14) . Laboratory studies showed leucopenia with leukocyte counts of 2.91 ÃŮ 109 cells/L, 70.0% of which were NEU (15) . Therefore, our result suggests that NEU might not be affected with SARS-CoV-2 in the initial phase of the disease. It also suggests that SARS-CoV-2 might mainly act on lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes, as does SARS-CoV. Virus particles spread through the respiratory tract and infect other cells, inducing series of immune responses, and causing changes in number of peripheral white blood cells such as lymphocytes (11) . Some studies suggest that a substantial decrease in the total number of lymphocytes indicates that coronavirus affects many immune cells and inhibits cellular immune function (11) . Tsui and others reported that high neutrophil count on admission of COVID-19 patients, and elevated LDH level were independent predictors of an adverse clinical outcome (16) . In the present study, ROC curve was used to analyze the specificity and sensitivity of different variables in suspected COVID-19 patients. The AUC of laboratory parameters such as ALT, CRP, AST, LDH, and NEU indicated that they could be used to predict the presence of COVID-19 disease, while those of albumin and WBC were below the reference line of ROC curve, indicating that they were poor predictors of the disease. The data is in line with results reported by Wang et al. (17) and Gao et al. (4) . In the current study, the AUC of CRP, ALT, LDH, urea and NEU were above 0.80; thus, they are effective and have very good predictive value for predicting COVID-19. It seems that, some blood laboratory parameters could be used in screening cases with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19. Considering the significant difference in laboratory parameters evaluated in this study between the 2 groups, one can hope to model or predict the results of coronavirus testing based on routine laboratory tests.",39.421035344159776,13.545815405661525

This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of laboratory parameters in predicting cases with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19. Methods: This diagnostic accuracy study was conducted on suspected COVID-19 patients, who presented to Behpooyan Clinic Medical center in Tehran (Iran) from 22 February to 14 March, 2020. Patients were divided into two groups based on the results of real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19, and the accuracy of different laboratory parameters in predicting cases with positive RT-PCR was evaluated using area under the ROC curve (AUC). Results: Two hundred cases with the mean age of 41.3± 14.6 (range: 19-78) years were studied (0.53% male). The result of RT-PCR for COVID-19 was positive in 70 (35%) cases. Patients with positive RT-PCR had significantly higher neutrophil (NEU) count (p = 0.0001), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (p = 0.04), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p = 0.0001), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (p = 0.001), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (p = 0.0001), and Urea (p = 0.001) levels in serum. In addition, patients with positive RT-PCR had lower white blood cell (WBC) count (p = 0.0001) and serum albumin level (p = 0.0001) compared to others.

In this regard, body temperature might not be an adequate screening as it can potentially miss travelers incubating the disease or travelers concealing fever during travel and contribute to the importation of the virus to the countries of destination. Therefore, travel restrictions to and from high risk areas [1] and/or 14-day quarantine [15] of people coming from high risk areas are recommended to prevent possible importation of COVID-19. Currently, RT-PCR is a reliable test in detecting both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 [6, 8] .

We found a heavy skew of infection towards older age groups, with substantially fewer children infected. This pattern could indicate agerelated differences in susceptibility to infection, severe outcomes, or behaviour. However, a substantial portion of the patients in our database are travellers, a population that is usually predominantly adults (although does not exclude children). Furthermore, because patient data in our dataset were captured by the health system, they are biased towards the more severe spectrum of the disease, especially for patients from mainland China. Clinical reports have shown that severity of COVID-19 is associated with the presence of chronic conditions, 16, 17 which are more frequent in older age groups. Nevertheless, we would also expect children younger than 5 years to be at risk of severe outcomes and to be reported to the healthcare system, as is seen for other respiratory infections. 18 Biological differences could have a role in shaping these age profiles. A detailed analysis of one of the early COVID-19 clusters by Chan and colleagues 19 revealed symptomatic infections in five adult members of the same household, while a child in the same household aged 10 years was infected but remained asymptomatic, potentially indicating biological differences in the risk of clinical disease driven by age. Previous immunity from infection with a related coronavirus has been speculated to potentially protect children from SARS, 20, 21 and so might also have a role in COVID-19. In any case, if the age distribution of cases reported here was to be confirmed and the epidemic were to progress globally, we would expect an increase in respiratory mortality concentrated among people aged 30 years and older. This mortality pattern would be substantially different from the profile of the 2009 influenza pandemic, for which excess mortality was concentrated in those younger than 65 years. 21 In our dataset, we saw a rapid increase in the number of people infected with COVID-19 in several provinces of China, consistent with local transmission outside of Hubei province. As of Jan 31, 2020, province-level epidemic curves are only available by date of reporting, rather than date of symptom onset, which usually inflates recent case counts if detection has increased.

Notably, other lines of evidence suggest that local transmission is now well established outside of Hubei province, because travel increased just before the Chinese New Year on Jan 25, 2020, and before implementation of the travel ban in Wuhan. 22 Accordingly, our own data include evidence of transmission clusters in non-travellers, with, for instance, a second-generation transmission event reported in Shaanxi on Jan 21, 2020.",40.31634181969631,14.642447214639624

This pattern is well known [23] , and is to be expected from current government policy, which targets elderly and/or high-risk groups for influenza vaccination. It is consistent with the observed pattern of higher resource use in vaccinated patients in the highrisk group in the present study; since vaccinated individuals were older and had more risk conditions than unvaccinated individuals, they are likely to have more fragile health and thus to need more healthcare. As vaccinated and unvaccinated groups are significantly different, outcomes cannot be directly compared and the data should be interpreted with caution. The only population in which vaccinated and unvaccinated groups could be compared is the sub-group aged 65 years and older, as according to current policy all individuals in this age group should receive seasonal influenza vaccination. Among this group, the ILI-related mortality rate among vaccinated individuals was 25% lower than the mortality rate among unvaccinated individuals. This is consistent with a protective effect of influenza vaccination. The effect size was similar to that reported by previous studies in this population group, which have reported reductions of 33-62% in hospitalisations, 27-39% in hospitalisations for acute and chronic respiratory illness and 39-54 in all-cause mortality [24] [25] [26] . Multivariate analysis indicated that patients categorised as high-risk had a disproportionate risk of hospitalisation. However, high-risk individuals who had also been vaccinated had a lower risk of hospitalisation than individuals who were high-risk alone. Similarly, patients who were high-risk had a higher probability of >1 GP visit, whereas patients who were high-risk and vaccinated had a lower probability of >1 GP visit. These findings suggest that vaccination may help to reduce the risk of hospitalisation and additional GP visits in high-risk groups. This demonstrates the clear benefit of vaccination of high-risk individuals and the rationale for ensuring that coverage in this group of individuals be reinforced, as coverage in those younger than 65 years is below target. Low vaccination coverage places individuals at risk of serious complications and death because they are not being vaccinated against influenza. However, although our results show clearly that vaccinated high-risk patients in the database had lower rates of additional GP visits and hospitalisations than unvaccinated high-risk patients in the database, there may be potential for confounding by differences in health-seeking behaviour that could not be captured in the database or accounted for in the analysis. For example, surveys in adults with asthma [27] and parents of high-risk children [28] at single UK GP practices have identified lack of awareness, barriers to access and health beliefs as factors influencing influenza vaccine uptake. Such factors could have the potential to confound our results if they also affect patients' readiness to seek treatment (for example, patients who wait until severe symptoms develop before presenting for medical attention may require higher levels of intervention than patients who present early). Our analysis would not be able to identify such potential confounding factors, and this is a limitation of the study. A recent case-control study using GPRD data in people at low risk for influenza in the UK found that influenza vaccination reduced the risk of influenza (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.60, 0.91) when given within 4 months before seasonal influenza outbreaks [29] . However, despite the authors' attempt to minimise confounding, they identified a residual confounding effect in that a group of people in the study with annual vaccinations in multiple years were also consistently more likely to develop influenza than those who received fewer annual vaccinations [29] . This may indicate that this group had predisposing medical conditions that made them simultaneously more likely to seek influenza vaccination and also at higher risk of influenza.",37.90712605194734,13.501195903090338

COVID-19 is now rapidly spreading worldwide, and this letter is written as the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a global emergency on January 31st amid concerns about a growing outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. Most of the published articles on COVID-19 have highlighted lungs as the main organ involved in the disease, while few articles have reported SARS-CoV-2 involvement in other organs, including liver and kidneys, which can impair the metabolism and excretion of the medications taken to treat the disease. According to Zhang et al. the incidence of hepatic abnormalities significantly increases after infection with COVID-19 and during the course of the disease, which may indicate the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the liver or side effects of the medications used by patients (1) . Also, Xu et al. have reported steatosis and liver injury in the liver biopsy of a patient with COVID-19 (2) . In addition to liver injuries, some articles have also reported an increased incidence of acute renal injury following COVID-19, which could be due to the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the inflammation induced by the disease, or a synergistic effect of both on kidneys (3, 4) . Additionally, Cheng et al. have reported that patients with acute renal injury have a higher mortality rate compared to other patients (3) .

Medicines currently prescribed to treat COVID-19 include Oseltamivir, Lopinavir / Ritonavir, Ribavirin, and Chloroquine Phosphate or Hydroxy Chloroquine Sulfate. All of these medicines are metabolized in the liver. Most of the metabolites derived from Oseltamivir, Ribavirin and some of the metabolites of Lopinavir / Ritonavir, Chloroquine Phosphate and Hydroxy Chloroquine Sulfate are found in the urine due to renal excretion. Therefore, injury to the liver and kidneys can impair metabolism, excretion, dosing and expected concentrations of the medications, which can increase the risk of toxicity using the aforementioned medications. According to the reports, liver and kidneys can be damaged in patients with COVID-19, which may make reaching the therapeutic dose of the medicines difficult and increase the risk of adverse drug reactions in patients. As a result, frequent and careful monitoring of liver and kidney functions in patients with COVID-19 can lead to early diagnosis of liver and kidney disorders, and also help in achieving the optimal therapeutic concentrations and reducing the risk of adverse drug reactions.",45.93292801748382,16.90647717537714

Lymphocytes were below the normal range (lymphocyte count <1.1 × 10 9 /L) in all patients, and two patients showed lymphopenia (lymphocyte count <1.0 × 10 9 /L). Both leucocytes and platelet counts were below the normal range (white blood cell count <4 × 10 9 /L, platelet count <100× 10 9 /L) in the mother in Case 4 (shown in Table 1 ). The mother in Case 3 developed anemia (hemoglobin 83 g/L) and dyspnea 5 days after being admitted. There was a significant increase of the level of C-response protein in all pregnant mothers. Coagulation function and blood biochemistry of all the mothers were normal. Five respiratory pathogens (Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, Respiratory syncytial virus, Adenovirus, and Coxsackie virus) and the nucleic acid of influenza viruses A and B of all patients were negative (laboratory findings shown in Table 1 ). An RT-PCR assay confirmed that the throat swab of the four pregnant women were positive for COVID-19. Abnormalities in chest CT images and bilateral involvement were detected among all pregnant women. A cesarean section was performed for three patients in the acute phase of the disease while one patient underwent vaginal delivery because of the onset of labor. Four full-term infants were born. All infants were isolated from their mother immediately after birth. We describe the clinical course of these four infants (laboratory findings shown in Table 2 ). Three mothers of the infants recovered from their COVID-19 infections and were released 3-5 days after delivery. However, one mother suffered severe dyspnea after delivery which required respiratory support-she did, however, survive.

Using publicly available event-date data from the ongoing epidemic, the present study investigated the incubation period and other time intervals that govern the epidemiological dynamics of COVID-19 infections. Our results show that the incubation period falls within the range of 2-14 days with 95% confidence and has a mean of around 5 days when approximated using the best-fit lognormal distribution. The mean time from illness onset to hospital admission (for treatment and/or isolation) was estimated at 3-4 days without truncation and at 5-9 days when right truncated. Based on the 95th percentile estimate of the incubation period, we recommend that the length of quarantine should be at least 14 days.

Perhaps we will learn some important lessons from these patients, so as to inform our efforts going forward. For instance, should AngII be used for all COVID-19 patients in shock? Should it be considered earlier in the course of disease, perhaps as a first-line vasopressor? Finally, and more controversially, should we evaluate the modulating effects of AngII on ACE2 for the treatment of COVID-19 in patients without shock? AngII use has been described at sub-pressor doses, and multiple studies have shown that higher levels of MAP may not be harmful.

Depending on the CFR value, the government response toward COVID-19 may vary, and estimates of CFR can also influence the strictness of policy judgement and the extent of containment and mitigation measures. For instance, a well-known CFR estimate for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong in 2003 was approximately 17% [3] , roughly indicating that one out of five diagnosed cases would die of the disease. SARS containment measures were implemented as early as possible due to high estimates of CFR.

However, there are three technical obstacles that should be addressed to appropriately measure this risk. First, division of the cumulative number of deaths by that of cases tends to underestimate the actual risk because deaths that will occur have not yet observed, and so the delay in time from illness onset to death must be addressed. Second, the observed dataset of reported cases represents only a proportion of all infected individuals and there can be a substantial number of asymptomatic and mildly infected individuals who are never diagnosed. Third, ascertainment bias and risk of death among all those infected would be smaller when estimated using shorter virus detection windows and less sensitive diagnostic laboratory tests. In the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, health authorities must cope with the uncertainty in the risk of death from COVID-19, and high-risk individuals should be identified using approaches that can address the abovementioned three problems. Although COVID-19 involves mostly mild infections among the majority of the general population, the risk of death among young adults is higher than that of seasonal influenza, and elderly with underlying comorbidities require additional care.",49.591457181611744,17.887484797044277

In Japan, there was a large cluster of confirmed cases (n = 218 as of 14 February 2020) who acquired infection of COVID-19 on a cruise ship (all passengers were tested for infection using RT-PCR). Most passengers are 60 years of age or older-a group which frequently have comorbidities. Out of 218 cases, there are 10 critically ill patients as of 15 February 2020. Assuming that one out of five critically ill patients dies of infection, the risk of death among these high-risk individuals is approximately 1%. Considering that many patients have just developed illness and will manifest complications in a matter of 7-10 days [18] , there could be additional critically ill patients in the future. Thus, from a matter of plausibility, it is likely that the IFR among elderly with underlying comorbidities is 1% or greater. Considering this, and also the population-average in Table 1 , the risk of death among young adults would be smaller than that of older adults, e.g., at most 0.1%-0.2%. Whether to perceive this estimate as severe or moderate is a matter for discussion, but we consider 0.1%-0.2% among young adults to be unusually high.

Current guidelines suggest the use of various severity scores such as CURB-65 and pneumonia severity index (PSI) in order to classify patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) [3] . In 2016, the third international consensus definitions for sepsis and septic shock proposed a new definition and a scoring system based on sequential (sepsisrelated) organ failure assessment (SOFA) score instead of systemic inflammatory response (SIRS) criterion [4] , which has been used to define sepsis for a long time [5] . In addition, the Sepsis-3 task force proposed the quick SOFA (qSOFA) as a simpler scoring system for the initial screening of patients at high risk for sepsis [5, 6] . However, debates about the performances of existing classifications are still ongoing.",34.35995372541252,14.01867876591907

The first was a visitor (ninth patient) who stood briefly (1-2 min) beside the bed of the index patient. None of the other 7 of the isolated people who had been in the GW at this time were infected. The other 2 MERS patients (tenth and eleventh patients) were identified among a group of people who were not initially isolated. One (tenth patient) had been admitted in the same ward area and the other (eleventh patient) had been admitted in another ward on the same floor (Fig. 3) . There was no contact or overlap of space between the two patients and the index patient. We checked the movements of these two patients and found no possible indirect transmission via contact with the virus-shedding environment before we cleaned the GW area. Both patients were admitted to the orthopaedic department, and they and the index patient had only one thing in common: they were cared for by the same nurse (tenth patient) or same resident and intern (tenth and eleventh patient). Further retrospective analysis verified the routine nurse's round for all patients in the same ward station and the routine rounds of the doctors who cared for orthopaedic patients on the same floor on the same evening. Before tenth and eleventh patients were isolated, they had walked freely around all areas of the hospital; therefore, numerous instances of contacts or possible viral shedding into the environment were suspected. To protect against further transmissions by infected patients, we closed the hospital over 1 month. During this period, a total of 1019 of people were isolated; (Hospital employees were 267) 69 were isolated at the hospital, 950 were isolated at home; 220 (Hospital employees were 65) were under active daily surveillance for 3 weeks. However, there was no subsequent MERS transmission in these people (Fig. 2) . Table 2 shows a comparison of variables between the ED and GW groups. The ED group had a higher percentage of high-risk (14.5%) and intermediate-risk (11.8%) people than the GW group (2.8 and 0.9% respectively). People in the ED group had had more frequent direct contact with the index patient. Otherwise, in the GW only 8 people (1 patient, 1 visitor and 6 HCPs) were categorized into the high-risk group and 96.3% of people were classed as low risk. The overall attack rate was 0.4% in the ED and 1.4% in the GW. For the high-risk group, the attack was higher in the GW (16.7%; l/6) than in the ED (3%; 1/33).

We found a heavy skew of infection towards older age groups, with substantially fewer children infected. This pattern could indicate agerelated differences in susceptibility to infection, severe outcomes, or behaviour. However, a substantial portion of the patients in our database are travellers, a population that is usually predominantly adults (although does not exclude children). Furthermore, because patient data in our dataset were captured by the health system, they are biased towards the more severe spectrum of the disease, especially for patients from mainland China. Clinical reports have shown that severity of COVID-19 is associated with the presence of chronic conditions, 16, 17 which are more frequent in older age groups. Nevertheless, we would also expect children younger than 5 years to be at risk of severe outcomes and to be reported to the healthcare system, as is seen for other respiratory infections. 18 Biological differences could have a role in shaping these age profiles. A detailed analysis of one of the early COVID-19 clusters by Chan and colleagues 19 revealed symptomatic infections in five adult members of the same household, while a child in the same household aged 10 years was infected but remained asymptomatic, potentially indicating biological differences in the risk of clinical disease driven by age. Previous immunity from infection with a related coronavirus has been speculated to potentially protect children from SARS, 20, 21 and so might also have a role in COVID-19. In any case, if the age distribution of cases reported here was to be confirmed and the epidemic were to progress globally, we would expect an increase in respiratory mortality concentrated among people aged 30 years and older. This mortality pattern would be substantially different from the profile of the 2009 influenza pandemic, for which excess mortality was concentrated in those younger than 65 years. 21 In our dataset, we saw a rapid increase in the number of people infected with COVID-19 in several provinces of China, consistent with local transmission outside of Hubei province.

One important epidemiological measure of severity is case fatality risk (CFR), which can be measured using three different approaches, by estimating (i) the proportion of the cumulative number of deaths out of the cumulative number of cases at a point in time, (ii) the ratio of the cumulative number of deaths to the cumulative number of infected individuals whose clinical outcome is known (i.e., the deceased or recovered), and (iii) the risk of death among confirmed cases, explicitly accounting for the time from illness onset to death [9] . Estimating the CFR using the ratio of deaths to confirmed cases (cCFR), with an adjustment of the time delay from illness onset to death (i.e., method (iii)), can provide insight into severity of the disease, because the naïve CFR based on method (i) tends to be an underestimate due to the real-time nature of the growth of fatal cases. For example, during the early stage of an epidemic, failing to right-censor cases with respect to the time delay from illness onset to death may lead to underestimation of the CFR.

Using a mathematical model of screening effectiveness, with preliminary estimates of COVID-19 epidemiology and natural history, we estimate that screening will detect less than half of infected travellers in a growing epidemic, and that screening effectiveness will increase marginally as growth of the source epidemic decelerates. We found that two main factors influenced the effectiveness of screening. First, symptom screening depends on the natural history of an infection: individuals are increasingly likely to show detectable symptoms with increasing time since exposure. A fundamental shortcoming of screening is the difficulty of detecting infected individuals during their incubation period, or early after the onset of symptoms, at which point they still feel healthy enough to undertake normal activities or travel. This difficulty is amplified when the incubation period is longer; infected individuals have a longer window in which they may mix socially or travel with low probability of detection. Second, screening depends on whether exposure risk factors exist that would facilitate specific and reasonably sensitive case detection by questionnaire. For COVID-19, there is so far limited evidence for specific risk factors; we therefore assumed that at most 40% of travellers would be aware of a potential exposure. It is plausible that many individuals aware of a potential exposure would voluntarily avoid travel and practice social distancing-if so, the population of infected travellers will be skewed toward those unaware they have been exposed. Furthermore, based on screening outcomes during the 2009 influenza pandemic, we assumed that a minority of infected travellers would selfreport their exposure honestly, which led to limited effectiveness in questionnaire-based screening. The confluence of these two factors led to many infected people being fundamentally undetectable in our model. Even under our most generous assumptions about the natural history of COVID-19, the presence of undetectable cases made the greatest contribution to screening failure. Correctable failures, such as missing an infected person with fever or awareness of their exposure risk, played a more minor role.",32.443302662968534,12.461424951881135

Answering this question requires accurate forecasting the spread of confirmed cases as well as analysis of the number of deaths and recoveries. Forecasting, however, requires ample historical data. At the same time, no prediction is certain as the future rarely repeats itself in the same way as the past. Moreover, forecasts are influenced by the reliability of the data, vested interests, and what variables are being predicted. Also, psychological factors play a significant role in how people perceive and react to the danger from the disease and the fear that it may affect them personally. This paper introduces an objective approach to predicting the continuation of the COVID-19 using a simple, but powerful method to do so. Assuming that the data used is reliable and that the future will continue to follow the past pattern of the disease, our forecasts suggest a continuing increase in the confirmed COVID-19 cases with sizable associated uncertainty. The risks are far from symmetric as underestimating its spread like a pandemic and not doing enough to contain it is much more severe than overspending and being over careful when it will not be needed.

For example, if group A is non-hospitalized patients and group B is hospitalized patients, an odds ratio of death less than 1 may not imply a beneficial effect of hospitalization on the odds of death. Similarly, a relative CFR greater than 1 may not imply that hospitalization is harmful. We use the estimation of the causal impact of hospitalization on mortality as our example throughout this section. Note that exactly the same reasoning applies to assessment of another intervention or to a comparison of two interventions, for example, a comparison of treatment at Center A versus treatment at Center B.",24.842917649982333,10.299137992822414

The second source of bias is confounding. Severity of disease will likely affect the probability of hospitalization and the probability of death. As a common cause of the exposure of interest (hospitalization) and the outcome (death), disease severity is a confounder of the causal effect of hospitalization on death. If hospitalization is offered to especially severe cases or-in the setting of extreme triage-to especially mild cases, then hospitalization would spuriously appear harmful (if hospitalization went to especially severe cases) or beneficial (if it went to especially mild cases). There may be other confounders of this effect besides disease severity. Individuals living in rural areas may be at greater risk of mortality (e.g., due to malnutrition) and also less likely to be hospitalized (due to longer travel time to hospital). Place of residence (or travel time to hospital) in this setting would be a confounder of the effect of hospitalization on death. The standard approach to reducing confounding is to stratify, restrict, or adjust for prognostic factors that affect the propensity to receive the treatment (in this case to be hospitalized) [27] .

Preoxygenation with the standard bag-valve mask oxygenation followed by rapid-sequence intubation has been proposed in non-severely hypoxaemic critically ill patients requiring tracheal intubation to reduce the risk of aspiration and desaturation. However, a previous study reported that 23% of patients had SpO 2 <90% during intubation. 3 Thus far, more than 80000 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in China.

The case fatality risk is an estimate of the proportion of patients with a specifi c disease who have died; however, both the numerator and denominator of this estimator are elusive. [2] [3] [4] Case detection is typically skewed towards patients with severe disease; laboratory-based case ascertainment can vary geographically and temporally; and there are delays between onset, death, and report ing, potentially leading to overestimation or under estimation of fatality risk. 2, 4 Much work has been done to refi ne estimates of case fatality risk in the wake of the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome and the 2009 infl uenza pandemic. 2 Diff erent denominators have been con sidered, including patients who have been admitted to hospital, 5 symptomatic cases, 5 and all individuals with serological evidence of infection. 6 From a statistical point of view, survival analysis provides an appropriate framework to quantify case fatality with right-censored outcome data. 2, 5 In The Lancet, Hongjie Yu and colleagues assess the clinical severity of human infection with avian infl uenza A H7N9 virus on the basis of data from 123 patients with laboratory-confi rmed infection who were admitted to hospital between March and May, 2013, in mainland China. 5 They estimate that the fatality risk for all ages was 36% (95% CI 26-45), and note that nearly all patients were admitted to an intensive care unit, received mechanical ventilation, or died (83%, 76-90). 71 (58%) of the patients were aged at least 60 years, and fatality risk was higher for these individuals (49%, 36-63) than for younger patients (18%, 6-29; p=0·0019), as is typical of infl u enza infection. 6 To obtain an estimate of symptomatic case fatality risk, Yu and colleagues 5 extrapolated the total number of symptomatic individuals infected with avian infl uenza A H7N9 virus on the basis of the number of mild cases detected through routine infl uenza-like illness surveillance in Shanghai and Nanjing-the most aff ected cities. They estimate that the symptomatic case fatality risk could be between 160 (95% CI 63-460) and 2800 (1000-9400) per 100 000 symptomatic cases.

Inadequate empirical treatment was also a predictor of early mortality in patients with high risk source.

Patients with treatment failure of the initial antibiotic had a longer mean hospital stay than those without (15.3 vs. 10.9 days) and a higher proportion were admitted to ICU (21.3% vs. 9.0%). Treatment failure was also associated with septic shock, and a higher proportion of patients with treatment failure required mechanical ventilation (21.8% vs. 8.9%), blood pressure support (fluid resuscitation: 19.6% vs. 8.0%) or parenteral nutrition (7.3% vs. 3.0%), and suffered acute renal failure necessitating replacement therapy (4.6% vs. 0.9%).

The face masks can be divided into N95 respirators and surgical masks, and both have different uses. The N95 respirator is designed with filtration requirements to prevent inhalation of small airborne particles and minimize leakage from the facial seal. 14 As such, it protects the wearer from the inhalation of viral particles. Surgical masks are often fitted loosely but can prevent respiratory droplet transmission and prevent hand-to-face contact. They are considered to be more effective in preventing spread from an infected person wearing the mask to another than in protecting the wearer from infection. In a randomized clinical trial, the use of N95 respirators and surgical masks were found to have comparable outcomes in protection from influenza virus in outpatient settings 14 ; however, N95 respirators are the preferred option when dealing with PUIs or COVID-19 patients.",36.12806680462033,13.191178967371034

However, a substantial number of studies included measures of fatality and it might be argued that fatality ratings are in fact assessments of value (i.e., severity) rather than measures of expectancy. Indeed, in many studies which used fatality measures, these were explicitly introduced as measures of severity of disease. Such a claim certainly has some degree of content validity, since most people would consider diseases they believe to be potentially fatal also as serious, even if from a purely structural-systematic perspective, probability of death ratings clearly refer to an expectancy-, not to a value-element. However, even when these ratings were counted as measuring severity, it seemed that severity was not generally considered to be an integral part of the risk concept, but was more often presented as a separate entity. This was also emphasized by the fact that only one study actually used the multiplicative term specified by the HBM and PMT [40] , i.e., the product of probability and severity. All these deviations from standard definitions of risk occurred mostly without any explanation of the rationale behind them -even in cases where models such as the HBM or PMT had been referred to in the theory sections of the papers.

[1] [2] [3] In the recent guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, risk assessment metrics were broken down into ten criteria in three categories. 4 The three categories are (1) properties of the virus including potential for transmissibility; (2) properties of the population including preexisting immunity and the seriousness profile of human infections; and (3) ecology and epidemiology in animals and humans. The second category includes one of the most difficult criteria to assess, but the most important in terms of public health impact, 4 namely the clinical severity of human infections which includes measures such as the case fatality risk. 5 The seriousness of infections has major implications for the potential overall severity of an influenza pandemic. 3 However, it is challenging to assess severity because typically the most serious illnesses associated with infection have a much higher probability of being detected and laboratory-confirmed compared to mild illnesses. 6 Human infections with the novel influenza A(H7N9) virus were first identified in China in February-March 2013, and the initial laboratory-confirmed cases all occurred in patients with serious illness. [7] [8] [9] The earliest laboratory-confirmed cases were clustered around the Yangtze river delta while more recent laboratory-confirmed cases have occurred in neighbouring provinces to the south and north. 10, 11 The majority of laboratory-confirmed cases occurred in urban areas in persons reporting recent exposure to live poultry, 11 investigation of live poultry markets in Huzhou found high prevalence of infection in poultry, 12 and closure of live poultry markets appears to have been effective in controlling outbreaks. [12] [13] [14] Intensive follow-up of more than 2,500 close contacts of laboratoryconfirmed cases identified just four potential secondary A(H7N9) virus infections, 11 consistent with very low human-to-human transmissibility. Pre-existing immunity to A(H7N9) virus is likely to be low in all age groups of the general population. 15 While initial estimates of clinical severity focused on the clinical severity and risk of fatality among the laboratory-confirmed cases, [8] [9] [10] this may give an incomplete picture of the clinical severity of influenza A(H7N9) virus infections. 16 As the outbreak has continued, it has become clear that undetected cases of milder symptomatic infections have occurred. First, assuming that there is no immunity across all ages, the pattern in age-specific incidence of serious cases is not consistent with presumed patterns in exposure, implying that severity increases with age and that many undetected mild infections have occurred in adults. 17 Second, six of the 131 laboratory-confirmed cases as of May 28, 2013 have been identified via national sentinel influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance (including the most recent case, reported on May 28), which is a population-wide system for measuring patterns in consultation rates of patients with ILI and conducting virologic testing for influenza virus infections in a subset of patients. 18, 19 Of the six cases with ages ranging from 2-26y, only one had pneumonia while the other five cases had uncomplicated illness. As this surveillance system is based on a sampling approach, laboratory confirmation of the six cases implies a substantial number of unconfirmed symptomatic infections with mild to moderate severity. Here, our objective is to assess the clinical severity profile of cases of human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus based on available information to date, in order to inform assessment of potential pandemic risk. We estimated the clinical severity profile in terms of the risk of fatality, mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit (ICU) admission among hospitalised cases, and the risk of fatality among symptomatic cases.",38.20456394854983,15.887708207531077

Because of this underascertainment, the confirmed-case fatality risk would apply neither to hospitalised cases (in whom the risk of fatality is higher), nor to mild symptomatic cases of A(H7N9) virus infection.

Several abnormalities also have been observed including cellular immune deficiency, coagulation activation, myocardia injury, hepatic and kidney injury, and secondary bacterial infection. 16 In the majority of cases of severe disease and death, lymphopenia and sustained inflammation have been recorded. Notably, these observations in COVID-19 patients are similar to those who suffered from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during the 2003 epidemic. There may be a biological mechanism behind this epidemiological anomaly. 17 Several kinds of vaccines and antiviral drugs that are based on S protein have been previously evaluated. Du et al. showed vaccines can be based on the S protein include full-length S protein, viral vector, DNA, recombinant S protein and recombinant RBD protein. Considering that, in the in vitro study, antiviral therapies are design based on S protein include RBDeACE2 blockers, S cleavage inhibitors, fusion core blockers, neutralizing antibodies, protease inhibitors, S protein inhibitors, and small interfering RNAs. 18 There are some recombinant compounds such as IFN with ribaverin which has only limited effects against COVID-19 infection. 1 The receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 has a higher affinity for ACE2, while it is a lower affinity for SARS-CoV. 1, 19 Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and its homologue ACE2, belongs to the ACE family of dipeptidylcarboxy dipeptidase. However, their physiological functions are varied. On the other hand, ACE2 serves as the binding site for COVID-19. Based on this information, Gurwitz suggested using available angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1R) blockers, such as losartan, as therapeutics for reducing the severity of COVID-19 infections. 20 At present therapy is based on identifying and developing monoclonal antibodies that are specific and effective against COVID-19 combines with remdesivir as a novel nucleotide analog prodrug that was used for the treatment of the Ebola virus disease. 17, 21 To understand the rate of virus spread among people, it is crucial to figure out whether COVID-19 is mutating to improve its binding to human receptors for infection considering its high mutation rate. Any adaptation in the COVID-19 sequence that might make it more efficient at transmitting among people might also boost its virulence. 22 The COVID-19 is expected to become less virulent through human to human transmissions due to genetic bottlenecks for RNA viruses often occur during respiratory droplet transmissions. 3",34.147263129891584,15.313248292723864

Third, our estimates of the number of symptomatic A(H7N9) cases, by two methods, were based on extrapolation from the sentinel ILI network, and required a number of simplifying assumptions including complete ascertainment of hospitalised A(H7N9) cases and no changes in health-care seeking behaviour in late March and early April 2013 (Appendix).

Such information may be available from serologic studies in future. 41 Finally, clinical information on some laboratory-confirmed cases was not available, and standardized collection and sharing of clinical data would aid risk assessment and treatment. 42 In conclusion, our estimate of a symptomatic case fatality risk of between 160 and 2,800 deaths per 100,000 symptomatic cases places A(H7N9) below the severity of A(H5N1), 43 but above the severity of A(H1N1)pdm09. 44 We are not aware of comparative data on the symptomatic case fatality risks of seasonal influenza viruses but we speculate that they are of a similar order of magnitude to A(H1N1)pdm09. As with seasonal influenza, the severity of A(H7N9) increases with age. These findings will inform risk assessment and health policy during the current A(H7N9) outbreak, and preparations for a potential resurgence in human infections towards the end of 2013. 11 Our framework could be used for pandemic risk assessment of future avian influenza viruses that cause disease in humans.",33.50428781971428,14.180793511100436

Abstract: Background: The rapid spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a zoonotic beta-coronavirus entitled 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), has become a global threat. Awareness of the biological features of 2019-nCoV should be updated in time and needs to be comprehensively summarized to help optimize control measures and make therapeutic decisions. Methods: Based on recently published literatures, official documents and selected up-to-date preprint studies, we reviewed the virology and origin, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathology and treatment of 2019-nCoV infection, in comparison with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. Results: The genome of 2019-nCoV partially resembled SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and indicating a bat origin. The COVID-19 generally had a high reproductive number, a long incubation period, a short serial interval and a low case fatality rate (much higher in patients with comorbidities) than SARS and MERS. Clinical presentation and pathology of COVID-19 greatly resembled SARS and MERS, with less upper J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, and more exudative lesions in post-mortems.

Radiotherapy is delivered to nearly 50% of cancer patients, a particularly vulnerable group given their older age, frequent comorbidities, and underlying cancer diagnosis. 2 Prostate cancer is frequently treated with radiation and the most common solid tumor in men; it is a heterogeneous disease where timely therapy is indicated for some cases, and where watchful waiting, active surveillance, or deferral of treatment could be acceptable for others. 3, 4 Given the current epidemic crisis, delaying radiotherapy treatment (which requires multiple visits to healthcare facilities) for prostate cancer patients may potentially reduce the risk of iatrogenic exposure to COVID-19. At the healthcare system level, when clinically appropriate, reducing visits conserves limited hospital resources (e.g. personal protective equipment (PPE)) for use by health-care workers who will have to care for the potentially vast number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The decision to delay life-saving cancer treatment in a time of a resource-intensive pandemic represents a clinical conundrum without modern precedent. In these exigent circumstances, guidelines as to how to manage patients who present with prostate cancer would be valuable for the practicing clinician.

Instead, here we chose to investigate the hospitalization fatality risk, i.e. the risk of death among hospitalized cases, for two reasons. First, mild infections are less likely to have been detected, both for A(H7N9) and A(H5N1), and therefore the risk of death among medicallyattended and laboratory-confirmed cases would be quite different, potentially by orders of magnitude, to the symptomatic case fatality risk (i.e. the risk of death among symptomatic cases of A(H7N9) virus infection). Second, mild cases identified through sentinel influenzalike illness surveillance or contact tracing should have a substantially lower risk of mortality than serious cases admitted with pneumonia, and a single estimated case fatality risk would misrepresent this heterogeneity. We therefore estimated the hospitalization fatality risk using a non-parametric approach that accounted for the competing risks of death or discharge, as well as right-censoring of the outcomes of patients still hospitalized. 18 We estimated 95% confidence intervals for the hospitalization fatality risk by using bootstrap estimates of the asymptotic variance with 1000 replications. 18 All statistical analyses were conducted using R version 3.0.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).",37.86269622256796,14.628997731443786

Notably, the death rate associated with COVID-19 is also considerably higher compared with the most recent WHO estimate of seasonal influenza mortality rate of less than 0.1%, and may reach much higher rates in elderly patients, those with comorbidities, and absent efficient intensive care support (13) . While other zoonotic coronaviruses, including the 2002-2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), had higher associated case fatality rates of 9.6% and 34.4%, respectively (15), COVID-19 has resulted in many more deaths than both of these prior outbreaks combined, an issue that is in part related to the greater infectivity and higher attack rate of this virus, leading to a larger number of infected patients (15, 16) . Uncertain and inconsistent disease ascertainment have resulted in variability in reported case fatality rates for several reasons, including: 1) the disease may be asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic in a large proportion of patients (15) , 2) inadequate testing capabilities in most geographies, leading to frequent underdiagnosis, especially in patients with less serious illness, and 3) complications and death often ensue much later than contagion (typically between 2 and 3 weeks after infection). Notably, the appraisal of SARS-CoV-2 infection may be further complicated by asymptomatic infection in a sizable portion of individuals (as many as 20%), which may significantly contribute to further spread of infection (17) The (18), although knowledge of the clinical feature of the disease is evolving daily (1, 19) . In severe cases, COVID-19 may present as pneumonia, the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with or without both distributive and cardiogenic shock, to which elderly populations with preexisting medical comorbidities are the most vulnerable (1, 6, 19, 20) . Notably while rates of concomitant infections with other viruses and bacterial superinfections in preliminary data appear low (15) , patients with the most severe clinical presentations are likely still at risk for co-infections, and unsurprisingly, worse outcomes have been noted in such cases (20, 21) . Children account for the minority of laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China and appear to be less susceptible to severe disease, possibly due to stronger innate immunity, fewer comorbidities, differences in maturation of viral receptors, and/or prior exposure to other coronavirus species (22) .

For instance, age is the strongest risk factor for CVD and the effect of aging on immune function may be equally important for COVID-19 suceptibility and severity. Exemplary of this, the effect of age on the immune system is exemplified by low protective titers among 50% of adults older than 65 who receive the influenza vaccine (30, 31) . Other traditional CVD risk factors such as diabetes and hyperlipidemia impact immune function, and conversely, dysregulated immunologic status corresponds with elevated risk of incident CVD (32) (33) (34) (35) . Thus, prevalent CVD may be a marker of accelerated immunologic aging/dysregulation and relate indirectly to COVID-19 prognosis. An increased frequency of adverse CVD events post COVID-19 infection might also play a role in prognosis, similar to other viral infections such as influenza with mechanistic underpinnings which are complex, multi-factorial, and bi-directional (36, 37) . In addition, COVID-19 infection may trigger pathways unique to this pathogen which contribute to outcomes in CVD patients. For instance, higher expression of ACE2 in patients with hypertension and CVD has been postulated to enhance susceptibility to SARS-CoV2, although the data are conflicting and without clear suggestion for treatment ( Figure 1 ) (5) .

Respiratory droplets and contact are the main routes of transmission of COVID-19 [2] . However, the fetal-oral routes may also be a potential human-to-human transmission [3, 4] . Admittedly, recent studies have reported the detection of the virus (SARS-COV-2) in feces [4] [5] [6] . SARS-COV-2 infects human cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [7] , and the expression of ACE2 in the small intestine is significantly higher than that in the lung [8] . In theory, the intestine is the target organ for SARS-COV-2 infection. In fact, diarrhea as a bowel symptom is not rare in COVID-19 patients. Although the occurrence of diarrhea is not as high as that of fever and cough, it may be the first symptom of COVID-19. Here, we summarized the occurrence of diarrhea that are currently publicly available (Table 1) . A total of 2506 COVID-19 patients were included, of which 145 had diarrhea before admission and the overall occurrence of diarrhea was 5.8% (145/2506). In our own data, the occurrence of diarrhea is 6.3% (4/64) (not yet published). Differential occurrence of diarrhea across studies may be due to different criteria for determining diarrhea. Another possible reason is that the patient's bowel movements were not listed as the focus of observation. In general, diarrhea is not a common symptom in patients with COVID-19. More attention is needed because diarrhea is a reminder that SARS-COV-2 invades the intestine. In autopsy reports of patients with COVID-19, staged narrowing and expansion of the small intestine may be a more intuitive warning [9] . Future research should focus on how long SARS-COV-2 persists in the feces of COVID-19 patients with diarrhea. This helps to better manage discharged patients and to properly dispose of the patients' feces, thereby avoiding potential sources of SARS-COV-2. Clinicians, especially digestive physicians, should pay close attention to the atypical symptoms of COVID-19 and take personal protection against the feces of patients. When discharged from home, patients with COVID-19 should pay special attention to hand hygiene and avoid sharing toilets with family members. In addition, we remind the public not to panic, but to prevent it scientifically.",36.12210614554276,13.474857836219334

Based on the genetic sequence identity and the phylogenetic reports, COVID-19 is sufficiently different from SARS-CoV and it can thus be considered as a new betacoronavirus that infects humans. The COVID-19 most likely developed from bat origin coronaviruses. Another piece of evidence that supports the COVID-19 is of bat origin is the existence of a high degree of homology of the ACE2 receptor from a diversity of animal species, thus implicating these animal species as possible intermediate hosts or animal models for COVID-19 infections [20] . Moreover, these viruses have a single intact open reading frame on gene 8, which is a further indicator of bat-origin CoVs.

According to our example (Table 1) , we currently assume that most HCWs will present high-risk of COVID-19 transmission to patients and each other given the possibility of an asymptomatic disease presentation, their high likelihood of COVID-19 exposure, known inadequate PPE and insufficient SARS-CoV-2 testing nationally (Table 1) .

Given the high attack rate [77] [78] [79] and prolonged aerosolization of this virus, [20] augmented infection control and containment training for OR, ICU and floor teams is necessary. [73, 80] Teams should seek to minimize AGPs and limit the length of these procedures whenever possible. For example, anesthesia may consider avoiding bag-mask ventilation, employing rapid sequence intubation techniques, and applying intratracheal or intravenous lidocaine to avoid postoperative coughing.

At the time of manuscript submission: there is known COVID-19 community spread with unknown disease prevalence; 1% of patients develop symptoms 14 days after exposure; among patients who develop symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 incubates for a median of five-days during which time viral shedding occurs; ~15% of COVID-19-positive individuals are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic throughout the course of their disease; ~20% of patients with COVID-19 will have exhibit false negative SARS-CoV-2 tests. Therefore, there is justification for a conservative assessment of patient-risk for COVID-19. Despite this judicious approach, a ""low-risk"" patient could still be COVID-19 positive, particularly if the patient is not reliable, does not report breaches in quarantine or positive symptoms, or is asymptomatic with a false-negative test. Improved COVID-19 test sensitivity and faster specimen processing, analysis and result generation may be reasonably feasible and could substantially improve management of patient-level risk. **: Surgery-and post-surgery-specific risks may diverge according to this algorithm.

In addition to six known strains of coronaviruses that are infectious to humans, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was detected recently in Wuhan, China [3, 4] . Like the other two highly pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also caused severe respiratory illness and even death. Moreover, the population's susceptibility to these highly pathogenic coronaviruses has contributed to large outbreaks and evolved into the public health events, highlighting the necessity to prepare for future reemergence or the novel emerging viruses [5] . Similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is initiated by zoonotic transmission likely from bats and spreads rapidly among humans [6] . The basic reproduction number (R0) of person-to-person spread is about at 2.6, which means that the SARS-CoV-2 infected cases grow at an exponential rate. As of February 07, 2020, 57,620 cases of the SARS-CoV-2 have been reported in China, including 26,359 suspected cases, and a sustained increase is predictable. The initial patient cluster with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported Wuhan pneumonia with unknown aetiology, which bore some resemblance to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality. Moreover, High concentrations of cytokines were recorded in plasma of patients requiring ICU admission, such as GCSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα, suggesting that the cytokine storm was associated with disease severity [7] . A retrospective clinical study indicated the risk of fatality among hospitalized cases at 4.3% in single-center case series of 138 hospitalized patients [8] , and the infection fatality risk could be below 1% or even below 0.1% in a large number of undetected relatively mild infections [9] . However, It is challenging to judge the severity and predict the consequences with the information available so far. Since no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19 is currently available, supportive cares, including symptomatic controls and prevention of complications remain the most critical therapeutic regimens, especially in preventing acute respiratory distress syndrome [10] . Although the control of SARS-CoV-2 still presents multiple challenges in the short term, more potent antiviral drugs are urgent to be developed [4] . At present, some drugs are effective in eliminating SARS-CoV-2 and improving symptoms. The most promising antiviral drug for SARS-CoV-2 is remdesivir that is currently under clinical development for the treatment of Ebola virus infection [11] . However, the efficacy and safety of remdesivir for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia patients need to be assessed by further clinical trials. In addition, in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, Tranditonal Chinese medicines have received broad adoption, especially in treating cases of mild symptoms [12] . Lianhuaqingwen (LH), a Chinese patent medicine composed of 13 herbs, has played a positive role in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. A retrospective analysis of clinical records was conducted in the SARS-CoV-2 infected patients at Wuhan Ninth Hospital and CR & WISCO General Hospital. LH combination could significantly relieve cardinal symptoms and reduce the course of the COVID-19 [13] , making it successively included in the Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Pneumonia (On Trials, the Fourth/Fifth/Sixth/Seventh Edition) issued by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China and also recommended by 20 provincial health commissions including Hubei, Beijing, and Shanghai as well as National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine for the treatment of COVID-19. Moreover, LH exerted broad-spectrum effects on a series of influenza viruses by inhibiting viral propagation and regulating immune function and achieved similar therapeutic effectiveness with Oseltamivir in reducing the course of H1N1 virus infection [1, 14, 15] . Notably, the anti-influenza activity of LH in infected mice might depend on the regulation of cytokines, particularly in cytokine storm associated cytokines, such as IP-10, MCP-1, MIP1A, and TNF-α [1] . In the present study, we evaluated the antiviral and anti-inflammatory efficiency of LH against a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 from Guangzhou in vitro.",38.30686080693991,17.301368064522016

It is important to mention here that although the cerebral damage may complicate a COVID-19 infection, it appears that it is the widespread dysregulation of homeostasis caused by pulmonary, renal, cardiac, and circulatory damage that proves fatal in COIVD-19 patients. With that being said, a dominant cerebral involvement alone with the potential of causing cerebral edema in COVID-19 can take a lead in causing death long before systemic homeostatic dysregulation sets in. Access of the COVID-19 virus to the brain via the transcribrial route, as described previously for other CNS targeting pathogens, 7 could have been the case in a recently reported patient with hyposmia and the cases of acute respiratory failure in COVID-19, 5 which needs to be further elucidated by isolating the SARS-CoV-2 virus from the zones that are in proximity to the olfactory bulb. It is expected that the differences in the sequence of spike proteins between COVID-19 virus and SARS-CoV ( Figure 2A ) will enable scientists to identify epitopes in COVID-19 virus for the development of monoclonal antibodies against this virus. With the recent COVID-19 outbreak, there is an urgent need to understand the neurotropic potential of the COVID-19 virus in order to prioritize and individualize the treatment protocols based on the severity of the disease and predominant organ involvement.

Young age, prematurity, female sex, household crowding, and genotype were identified as significant determinants of hMPV severity. We observed that previously established patient risk factors for severe RSV disease, such as prematurity and young age, were also applicable to hMPV [6, 10, 25] . Age <6 months was associated with hMPV hospitalization, and prematurity was associated with severe disease among those hospitalized. However, prematurity was not a risk factor for RSV hospitalization in our model. Palivizumab prophylaxis among children with a history of prematurity may have masked some of its effect. It should also be noted that, in Quebec, children with complex medical histories (including prematurity) are referred to pediatricians for outpatient care. Consequently, the proportion of children born prematurely among our pediatric clinic patients (10.1%) was higher than that of the Quebec population (7.3%) [26] . Furthermore, despite systematic training and recruitment reminders, clinic physicians may have preferentially approached patients they considered at risk, such as those with a history of prematurity or comorbidities.

In addition, oxidant pollutants in air can impair the immune function and attenuate the efficiency of the lung to clear the virus in lungs.

In order to reduce the risk of exposure to SRAS-CoV-2 infections, elective surgery should be postponed as much as possible (for example no recent episodes of gallstone disease, kidney stones, uterine fibroids, cataracts, knee and hip replacement surgery, etc.). 1.2 Establish a full-time intubation team. Generally, there should be 2 to 3 groups of fixed personnel to perform tracheal intubation for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. It is recommended to rotate between groups at regular intervals (usually 14 days of quarantine) to avoid excessive fatigue of medical staff and reduce risk of infection. 1.2.1 Endotracheal intubation in emergency and limited-surgery patients (usually progressive malignancies) Preparation of operating room: Anesthesia and surgery for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients should be performed in an isolated negative pressure operating room as far as possible. Patients and medical staff must enter the operating room after the negative pressure system is activated. If there is no negative pressure operating room, you must choose an operating room with special access channels and relatively independent spatial locations. Avoid the central air conditioning and ventilation system during the operation, turn off the purification system during the operation, and perform complete disinfection after the operation. 1.2.2 Preparation of patients and anesthesiologist: Patients enter the operating room to wear medical surgical masks, then remove the patient masks before the intubation until all things are ready，and try yours best to reduce the direct exposure of the patient's respiratory tract to the operating room.

Nevertheless, based on the assumption that viral RNA load correlates with high levels of viral replication, 5 there are important insights to be gained from this time-course analysis. Currently, our understanding of the relationship between viral RNA load kinetics and disease severity in patients with COVID-19 remains fragmented. Zou and colleagues reported that patients with COVID-19 with more severe disease requiring intensive care unit admission had high viral RNA loads at 10 days and beyond, after symptom onset. 4 Unfortunately, it is unknown when in the course of their disease these patients deteriorated. By contrast, Lescure and colleagues report the viral RNA kinetics of two patients who developed late respiratory deterioration despite the disappearance of nasopharyngeal viral RNA. It would be interesting to know whether viral RNA load in lung tissue, or a surrogate sample such as tracheal aspirate, mirrors the decline in nasopharyngeal shedding. Nevertheless, this observation suggests that these late, severe manifestations might be immunologically mediated and has obvious implications for the potential to use immune-modulatory therapies for this subset of patients. This finding is consistent with recent reports that corticosteroids were beneficial for acute respiratory distress syndrome, 6 and possibly those with COVID-19. 7 With more detailed data such as those provided by Lescure and colleagues, the use of viral RNA load to suggest potential clinical strategies to treat COVID-19 could be exploited.",32.55339019763354,11.266555458741975

Are we different, like Europe?","The infection by the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has taken the dimension of a pandemic, affecting more than 160 countries in a few weeks. In China, although containment measures have significantly reduced new cases of COVID-19, in other countries, this reduction has not been similar. In Colombia, despite the implementation of the rules established by the national government, exists an elevate concern both for mortality and for the limited capacity of the health system to respond effectively to the needs of patients infected and requiring intensive care by the respiratory complications associated with this infection. 1 The data collected so far on the number of infected people and the evolution of the epidemic are imprecise. Even though to date in Colombia (March 19, 2020) there are no deaths yet, nor patients in intensive care by COVID-19, the diagnoses of infection by SARS-CoV-2 have increased (Fig. 1) . In this country, since the first case was reported (March 6, 2020), the number of infected patients follows an exponential trend, like other countries in the region, except Ecuador, with a lower incidence. If this trend continues, in a week (until March 26, 2020) or two (April 2, 2020), there will be 2581 and 40,535 infected patients, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2 . 1, 2 According with the Knowledge of this infection so far, the high-risk age groups are among the people over 60 years of age, primarily due to the burden of disease and the complications that this infection generates in them. Regarding to the current COVID-19 data available from Colombia, the proportion of patients in that age group is 15%, and of them, 4.7% needing hospitalizing, proportion which is lower than in other age groups. Additionally, as of March 19, most cases are imported (64%). 3 On the other hand, according to the official reports of the World Health Organization (updated to March 19, 2020), in Latin American countries the first cases of mortality by COVID-19 occurred in Argentina after the 12th day of the first case was diagnosed, and in Panama was the first death was reported after the sixth day. This situation differs from European countries, where COVID-19 associated deaths started until after the 23rd of the first diagnosis (France). Additionally, the reports curve of some European countries has a slower start compared to Latin American countries. This situation may be due to a higher degree of alertness in this region, motivated by the experiences of European and Asian countries, leading to earlier diagnostic tests (early detection). Additionally, in Europe, at the beginning of the infection, the diagnoses were oriented to people with symptoms.",38.18776307591106,13.253059583215979

Together with our social, occupational, and personal life, the new corona virus poses novel challenges for all physicians, including dermatologists. Despite the virus not being dermatotropic, several skin conditions have emerged, mainly as a result of prolonged contact to personal protective equipment and excessive personal hygiene. Pressure injury, contact dermatitis, itch, pressure urticaria, and exacerbation of pre-existing skin diseases, including seborrheic dermatitis and acne, have been described. We have focused on the dermatologic aspects of COVID-19 infection, so that dermatologist may be aware of the skin complications and the preventive measures to be taken in the COVID-19 pandemic.

Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 5 Because diseases with epidermal barrier interruption could enhance the virus acquisition through indirect contact (5), dermatology patients might be at an increased risk for developing the infection. This suggests that dermatology departments and private offices should develop appropriate preventative measures. (5). Use of a sanitary mask itself may not be sufficient protection from the virus transmission, so that goggles should be used to decrease the risk of conjunctival contamination. COVID-19 has a relatively low-resistance to disinfectants. As a result, a variety of regimens have been proven effective, ranging from 75% ethanol, peracetic acid, chlorine, and UV disinfection to a hot water bath at 56°C(132.8°F) for 30 minutes (4).",35.4066085278699,14.801596133996865

This necessitates increased vigilance and testing in outpatient diabetes and general medicine clinics for COVID-19 and a lower threshold for hospitalization of these patients. In this regard, an unreported disturbing observation by the authors is that an increasing number of diabetic patients are cancelling their routine visits to diabetes clinics. This development along with the increased stress associated with social isolation and lack of physical activity provides a fertile ground for worsening glycemic and blood pressure control, further predisposing these vulnerable patients to COVID-19 infections. As suggested by the ADA and AACE it is imperative that we alert the health care community and the public regarding the increased risks of this progressing pandemic in diabetic patients. Also, as suggested by these Societies adherence to CDC guidance J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f regarding social isolation is vey important in persons with diabetes.

increased risk of developing COVID-19 or developing more severe disease in patients who are already on background treatment with ACEi/ARB,0.1981477353133341,-1.452707052230835,0.7899613380432129,99aa5576-f00f-414b-85b5-6f1dd275e17c,custom_license/Original Article,"The overall management principles for patients presenting with COVID-19 who develop CV complications or who have pre-existing CVD are same as for any other patient without COVID-19. However, there are a few important points that need consideration-1. As caregivers, it is our utmost responsibility to protect ourselves from getting infected while managing these patients. Therefore, all heathcare personnel engaged in the care of COVID-19 patients must observe necessary precautions at all times. All of them should be trained in donning, usage, and doffing of the personal protective equipment in accordance with the existing practice guidelines. 2. The hospital systems need to ensure preparedness for dealing with large volume of COVID-19 patients, many of whom would need ICU care and/or acute cardiac care. Appropriate protocols for rapid diagnosis, triage, isolation, and management of COVID-19 patients with CV complications should be developed and well-rehearsed. Rapid triaging and management of these patients is crucial, not only to allow efficient utilization of healthcare resources but also to minimize exposure to caregivers. There are already reports highlighting delays in delivering acute cardiac care due to extra precautions that need to be observed in view of COVID-19 [14] . Efforts should be made to minimize such delays. 3. Strong emphasis should be placed on avoiding unwarranted diagnostic tests (e.g. cardiac troponin, echocardiography, etc.) in these patients. This is required to minimize unwarranted downstream diagnostic/therapeutic procedures which would further strain the already stretched healthcare resources and would also subject caregivers to added risk of exposure to the infection. The American College of Cardiology has released an advisory discouraging random measurement of cardiac biomarkers such as troponins and natriuretic peptides [15] . It urges all the clinicians to reserve these assays for circumstances in which they would actually meaningfully add to the management of the patients with COVID-19. The American Society of Echocardiography has also issued a similar advisory regarding the use of echocardiography in these patients [16] . 4. The individual hospitals may also have to reconsider risk-benefit ratio of primary percutaneous intervention vs fibrinolysis in patients with COVID-19 who present with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. 5. There has been a concern regarding the safety of ACE inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. These agents upregulate expression of ACE2 in various tissues, including on cardiomyocytes [17] . Since SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 to gain entry into human cells, there is a potentially increased risk of developing COVID-19 or developing more severe disease in patients who are already on background treatment with ACEi/ARB. However, to date, no experimental or clinical data have emerged to support these concerns. At the same time, the risks of discontinuing these therapies are well known. Therefore, several leading professional societies have strongly urged to not discontinue clinically-indicated ACEi/ARB therapy in the event the patient develops COVID-19 [18, 19] . 6. Clinicians caring for these patients also need to be fully aware of the potential CV side-effects of various therapies used for treating the viral infection. Additionally, various anti-retroviral drugs have significant interactions with cardiac drugs, which need to be considered and appropriate dose modification done. More recently, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and azathioprine have been proposed as potential therapeutic options, based on preliminary evidence [20] . Both these drugs are known to prolong QT interval and due caution must be exercised when prescribing these agents. Their combination is best avoided and even when using chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine alone, daily electrocardiogram for monitoring QT interval is warranted, esp. in patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction and in those receiving another drug with potential to prolong QT interval.",38.40259034418744,13.010121906243649

The SARS-CoV-2 virus shares 79.5% of the genetic sequence of SARS and has 96.2% homology to bat coronavirus. 4 The intermediate animal vector between bats and humans for SARS-CoV-2 is currently unknown but has been linked epidemiologically to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. 5 Although initially a zoonotic virus, SARS-CoV-2 is now spread human-to-human with higher infectivity than MERS and SARS but a lower fatality rate. 3 The clinical presentation of COVID-19 can range from mild non-specific respiratory symptoms to severe organ dysfunction such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that can lead to death. 1,6,7 Most cases of COVID-19 appear to be mild with the most common symptoms being fever (83-98%), cough (46-82%), myalgia/fatigue (11-44%) , and shortness of breath (31%). 7 Risk factors for more severe illness requiring hospitalization appear to be older age and having underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, lung disease and cardiovascular disease. 7 Early reports suggest that for more severe cases the median time from first symptom onset to the development of shortness of breath and/or need for hospitalization ranged from 5 to 8 days. 6-8 Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, it is reported that 5 to 26.1% have required admission to the intensive care unit. 6, 8 The reported fatality rate for hospitalized COVID-19 patients has ranged from 1.4 to 15%. [6] [7] [8] The incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 appears to average 5.2 days but may range from 2 to 14 days and potential asymptomatic infection has been reported. 7, 9 Of note for gastroenterologists, patients may complain of gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea or diarrhea. 7 In the prior SARS coronavirus outbreak, diarrhea was reported in up to 25% of patients. 11 Interestingly, the cell entry receptor ACE2 appears to mediate entry of SARS-CoV-2 (similar to SARS) and has been demonstrated to be highly expressed in small intestinal enterocytes. 11 ACE2 is important in controlling intestinal inflammation and its disruption may lead to diarrhea. 11 The reported frequency of diarrhea among COVID-19 patients has varied from 2 to 33% and was one of the prominent symptoms reported by the first case in the United States. 11,12 SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the stool of COVID-19 patients. 12, 13 So while COVID-19 appears to primarily spread through respiratory droplets and secretions, the gastrointestinal tract may be another potential route of infection, highlighting importance of personal protective equipment during endoscopy. Further, some of the more common laboratory findings described in COVID-19 patients include liver function test abnormalities. In addition to leukopenia (reported in 9-25% of cases) or leukocytosis (24-30%), elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase have been seen in up to 37% of cases. [7] [8] [9] More recent descriptions of patients in China also noted around 10% of patients were also noted to have elevated total bilirubin levels. 8 Gastroenterologists should be aware of these potential gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19.",41.1695124931905,18.149760669442085

However, based on the local COVID-19-burden, a sharp separation of ""clean"" and ""dirty"" wards/hospitals may not be sustainable, although recent evidence provides somewhat reassuring data regarding the absence of environmental contamination with SARS-CoV-2 RNA of inanimate surfaces outside patient rooms. 20 Wherever possible, patients with chronic liver disease requiring inpatient care for non-COVID-19 causes should be admitted to COVID-19-clean wards or hospitals. As these institutions may not be able to provide specialised hepatology-care, similar to our recommendations on outpatient care, we recommend that specialised centres provide easily accessible contact information to facilitate immediate hepatology consultations. However, due to the contagiousness of the virus, patients with underlying liver disease will become infected and will subsequently require inpatient care for COVID-19.

The potential of becoming infected can be reduced by a systematic and integrated approach that assesses infection risk. The latter leads to an acceptable choice of materials and techniques for personal protection and prevention of cross contamination to other patients and staff. We present a protocolized approach that uses diagnostic criteria to clearly define benchmarks from the medical history along with clinical symptoms and laboratory tests. Patients can then be rapidly assigned into one of three risk categories that direct the choice of protective materials and/or techniques. Each hospital can adapt this approach to develop a system that fits its individual resources. Educating medical staff about proper use of high risk areas for containment serves to protect staff and patients. ,41.2574142029483,17.546660720677135

Both cause major infection-related morbidity and mortality around the world. Tuberculosis was the leading cause of mortality from an infectious disease worldwide in 2018, causing 1·2 million deaths. 1 COVID-19 has infected more than 300 000 people and caused over 13 000 deaths in the first quarter of 2020 alone. 2 Both COVID-19 and tuberculosis can present with respiratory symptoms, and diagnosis and treatment of people with tuberculosis, or tuberculosis and COVID-19 co-infection, are likely to be compromised during the COVID-19 pandemic. Older people and those with comorbidities are at increased risk of severe disease and adverse outcomes in both diseases. 3, 4 And, as we are discovering for COVID-19, both diseases have considerable social impact-including stigma, discrimination, and isolation-in addition to the economic impact from country productivity losses and catastrophic costs to individuals and households. 5 There are also stark differences. While tuberculosis is a slow pandemic and has accompanied humankind for millennia, 6 the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19 is new and spreading rapidly around the world. Tuberculosis has been labelled a pandemic many times over the past three centuries, whereas this is the first COVID-19 pandemic. Children are less severely affected by COVID-19, whereas 1·1 million children had tuberculosis disease in 2018, of whom 200 000 died. 1 The vast majority of cases and deaths from tuberculosis occur in low-income and middle-income countries, whereas high-income countries have low rates. 1 By contrast, Europe became the second epicentre of COVID-19 after China, which might explain, in part, why COVID-19 can be expected to mobilise more global resources and person-power in a year than tuberculosis has in decades. However, underprepared and vulnerable countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Central and South America might soon see substantial rises in COVID-19 cases and deaths, and concerted, collective action must be taken now to avoid catastrophe. 7 There are many unknowns. The clinical and epidemiological interactions of COVID-19 with tuberculosis (with or without HIV) are likely to be highly complex. Simply put, tuberculosis transmission might rise because of increased respiratory symptoms associated with COVID-19, or decline owing to COVID-19-related self-isolation and quarantine. There is increasing recognition of the millions of people treated for tuberculosis who have residual, long-term lung damage 8 who are likely to be at a higher risk of severe disease and death from COVID-19. Because of extreme pressures on health systems, exacerbated by COVID-19, people with tuberculosis are likely to face decreased access to diagnostic and treatment services, which might also result in adverse outcomes.",42.30277702417443,15.544159574034456

Given this risk, and without universal rapid viral testing, we must acknowledge that every admission and delivery present real risk for infection to our front-line healthcare workers. As such, ideal practice, if adequate supplies are able to be obtained, would involve universal PPE including N95 masks for all COVID-19 positive deliveries, whether vaginal or cesarean, as well as for those with unknown COVID-19 status until disease status can be determined through testing. Surgical masks should also be provided for all team members on the inpatient service and for all patients presenting to labor units, and worn at all times. 6 Until adequate PPE supplies exist, we can reasonably expect our obstetrical and anesthesiology providers to become ill and exit the workforce at an accelerated rate.

Without appropriate protection and rapid testing, we should expect institutions to take measures to safeguard their workforce that previously would have been inconceivable in modern society.

Such uncertainty and unpredictability of pandemic outbreak of infectious disease from its clinical presentation, infectious causes, epidemiological features, fast transmission pattern, seriousness of public health impact, novelty, scale, implication for international public health, and underprepared health facilities to address the pandemic outbreak of COVID-19 have considerably high potential for psychological fear contagion as well and often result in prevalent multitude of psychological problems such as fear, anxiety, stigma, prejudice, marginalization towards the disease and its relation of all people ranging from healthy to at-risk individuals to care-workers (Mak et al., 2010) . Mass quarantine could cause a sense of collective hysteria, fear, and anxiety in health workers working in hospitals, inpatient and outpatient care, large tertiary care centers, community based hospitals, primary care settings, nursing homes, assisted living facilities and all isolation units. The medical health-care workers who are exposed and in direct contact with the confirmed and suspected coronavirus cases are vulnerable to both high risk infection and mental health problemsworried, scared, experiencing bereavement and trauma. With the advent of COVID-19 in Pakistan, medical workers have been under physical and psychological pressure including high risk of infection, inadequate equipment for safety from contagion, isolation, exhaustion, and lack of contact with family. The severity is causing further mental health problems which not only effect medical workers' decision making ability but could also have long term detrimental effect on their overall well-being. The unremitting stress medical health-care workers is experiencing could trigger psychological issues of anxiety, fear, panic attacks, posttraumatic stress symptoms, psychological distress, stigma and avoidance of contact, depressive tendencies, sleep disturbances, helplessness, interpersonal social isolation from family social support and concern regarding contagion exposure to their friends and family. The sudden role reversal from a J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f healthcare provider to the COVID-19 confirmed or suspected patient potentially lead to sense of frustration, helplessness, and adjustment challenges in healthcare professionals. Fear of labeling, stigmatization and discrimination potentially impede healthcare workers intent to seek counselling and psychotherapeutic interventions (Zheng, 2020) .

However, the risk from COVID-19 exposure varies significantly from patient to patient, making treatment tailoring important now more than ever. Second, physicians have to get used to a new working activity, which implies the use of tele-consultation services when feasible, and reducing the number of visits by means of customizing treatment delivery (three or two-weekly as opposed to weekly, oral or subcutaneous alternatives as opposed to intravenous administration). Also, in view of a visit a telephonic ""previous day"" triage could help, in order to avoid the access of symptomatic patients to oncologic wards. Third, protection of patients and physicians is paramount in order to keep providing the best service in a safe way.",36.92468386128208,13.88829264076681

Appropriate patients should be vaccinated with both pneumococcal and infl uenza vaccines, and cigarette smoking should be stopped in all at-risk patients. Even for the patient who is recovering from CAP, immunization while in the hospital is appropriate to prevent future episodes of infection. The evaluation of all patients for vaccination need and the provision of information about smoking cessation are now performance standards used to evaluate the hospital care of CAP patients. If there is uncertainty about whether the patient has recently been vaccinated, it is probably best to give a pneumococcal vaccination because repeat administration, even more often than recommended, is not generally associated with an adverse reaction. 106 Hospital-based immunization is recommended. One study found that among 1633 patients with pneumonia treated in the hospital, 62% had been hospitalized in the preceding 4 years. 107 In addition, 80% of these patients had a high-risk condition that would have qualifi ed them to receive pneumococcal vaccine.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was first described in 1968 (Zitterkopf, 2008) . Bacterial culture on chromagar requires greater than 24 hours for MRSA growth. Meanwhile, the patient being tested should be in isolation, since MRSA transmission in 24 hours from person to person may be as high as 5% to 15%, depending on the distance between the two individuals. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with probes to identify the mecA gene, which encodes methicillin resistance, can decrease the turnaround time for detection to 2-4 hours and is more sensitive than culture. Since this screening assay is currently not reimbursed for hospitalized patients, this effort to reduce MRSA prevalence in the hospital becomes an exercise in cost avoidance. The additional cost for caring for a patient with an MRSA infection ranges from $27,000 to $35,000 per patient compared to a patient with methicillinsensitive S. aureus (Zitterkopf, 2008) . The rate of subsequent MRSA infection after identification of MRSA colonization is approximately 30% (Davis et al., 2004) . The dilemma rests in the ethical question related to who should be screened. There are two viewpoints. The first approach would screen all hospitalized patients at the time of admission. The other approach uses targeted active surveillance, only screening patients at a high risk for MRSA colonization or infection. Examples of high-risk groups are listed Table 9 .3. The goal of each of these screening programs is to eradicate MRSA from the patient to reduce the risk of subsequent MRSA infection during the hospitalization. Healthcare workers at the hospital and the patient's relatives are usually not included in these MRSA screening programs since the goal of the program is not complete eradication of MRSA in a community. The carbapenem-hydrolyzing -lactamase known as K. pneumoniae carbapenemase produces a resistant strain associated with a higher mortality in infected patients compared to patients infected with carbapenem-sensitive strains. The use of surveillance cultures can identify the population of asymptomatic colonized patients and enhance the effectiveness of a carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae infection prevention program (Calfee and Jenkins, 2008) .

This reasoning, however, does not explain why the elderly who are also at high risk of infection with human coronaviruses, are not immune. Another potential reason for decreased severity of the disease in children is that pre-existing chronic medical conditions such as cardiovascular diseases may predispose adults to more severe outcomes (Guan et al., 2020; Wu and McGoogan, 2020) . In this regard, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that plays role in cardiovascular disease, has been identified as a functional receptor of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Wrapp et al., 2020) , and its potential immaturity in children has been proposed to underlie the reduced disease severity (Dong et al., 2020) , but there is currently no supporting evidence to substantiate this claim. There is also a possibility that differences in the maturity of the immune system underlie the different immune responses to an infection. As such, activation of the innate immune system in the early phase of SARS-CoV infection has an important role in the control viral replication (Chen et al., 2010) . In the elderly, the innate immune system is less efficient and its ability to respond to infections is diminished, resulting in greater vulnerability of older adults to severe outcomes of infectious diseases (Boe et al., 2017) . It is thus plausible that the immune system in the young is more effective in responding to COVID-19, reducing its severity. However, neither of these possibilities really explain why children seem relatively immune (or at least resilient) to COVID-19 but not to influenza or measles and this question is essential to answer. This apparent resilience of children to COVID-19 brings up important ideas that are necessary for the research and medical communities to properly address, and not only in relation to the current pandemic. One is that responses to disease are heterogeneous within a population. Two is that we should be exploiting the causes of this heterogeneity to help patients recover more quickly.",38.72131645001094,15.030233759293875

Several institutions have recommended interim precautions to screen new donors. The US Food and Drug Administration has suggested considering a donor's history of travel to areas of outbreak, cohabitation with infected individuals, or diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 within the 28 days before recovery of donor tissue. 2 Similar measures have been taken by the Global Alliance of Eye Bank Associations and by the Joint United Kingdom Blood Transfusion Services Professional Advisory Committee to rule out potential donors. 3, 4 The European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation has recommended excluding potential donors who have been diagnosed with COVID-19, and waiting at least 21 days before donation in those with a history of high-risk travel or contact. 5 In Italy, where the COVID-19 outbreak is spreading rapidly, the national transplant centre has taken stronger measures and has recommended testing all potential tissue and stem-cell living donors, as well as dead donors, through real-time RT-PCR assays of nasopharyngeal swab samples (or bronchoalveolar lavage in deceased individuals). 6 Faecal microbiota transplantation is a novel treatment that has rapidly earned a major role in the management of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection because of its clear advantages over antibiotics. 7 It is becoming increasingly more widespread and standardised around the world. Last year, an international expert panel, including several authors of this Comment, released recommendations on how to screen faecal microbiota transplant donors, including a medical history and blood and stool examinations. 8 Given the global COVID-19 outbreak, we, as an international group of experts in faecal microbiota transplantation and stool banking, believe that recommendations to update (at least temporarily) the screening of stool donors are urgently needed, as the risk of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 by faecal microbiota transplantation might be higher than that in other tissue transplants. Evidence has shown that the SARS-CoV-2 can be found in faeces, and that stool samples can remain positive for the virus even when it is no longer detectable in the respiratory tract, suggesting the possibility of a faecal-oral route of transmission. 9 This concept is supported by the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms in some patients affected by COVID-19. 10 Another relevant issue is that faecal microbiota transplantation is not classified in the same way worldwide, as some countries regulate these transplants as a drug (eg, the USA, the UK, and France), some as a tissue (eg, Italy), and others do not provide specific regulation (eg, Australia). 8 This discrepancy results in a confusing scenario, in which some countries will apply rules for human cells, tissues, or cellular or tissue-based products, and others will not, potentially contributing to the spread of the infection. A more alarming issue is represented by the uncontrolled practice of homemade faecal microbiota transplantation, which is widespread among patients who want to try this treatment for indications outside of clinical guidelines or clinical trials. 11 To prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission, we propose additions to the current donor screening measures. In all countries, before each donation, physicians should screen for two main items: the presence of typical COVID-19 symptoms (including fever, fatigue, dry cough, myalgia, dyspnoea, and headache) within the previous 30 days; and the donor's history of travel to regions known to be affected by COVID-19 or close contact with individuals with proven or suspected infection, within the previous 30 days. If either of these items is positive, the potential donor should either be rejected or tested with RT-PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2. In endemic countries, the RT-PCR assay should be considered in all donors, even if they are asymptomatic or do not have a history of high-risk travel or contact. Alternatively, donor stools should be stored and quarantined for 30 days before use, and released only if the donor has not developed symptoms. Finally, stool banks should retrospectively check the health status of the donor before using frozen faeces, according to local epidemiology, to avoid further potential spreading of SARS-CoV-2. These suggestions should be tailored to local health-care organisations, and should be updated accordingly as further insight into COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 is gained.",36.08894914632036,13.677476792889314

Seven of the women delivered their babies by cesarean section and two by vaginal delivery. All three neonates delivered vaginally (including two who were twins) had an Apgar score of at least 9 and negative nucleic acid test. Yudin and colleagues 7 reported a pregnant woman with SARS at 31 weeks of gestation; the patient stayed for 21 days in the hospital and did not require intensive care admission or ventilatory support, and a healthy baby girl was delivered by vaginal birth. It is unknown whether vaginal delivery increases the infection risk. Further research is needed to assess the risk and to produce guidelines for delivery times and methods in patients with COVID-19.",37.8513497335997,12.265635215058959

Title: COVID-19 in Endoscopy: Time to do more?,"We believe it is important to use full PPE for all endoscopic procedures while in a pandemic such as this especially in areas with community spread, because no one is truly low risk given our ongoing difficulties with testing. A study from China showed that no medical staff working in high-risk departments who wore N95s and practiced strict hand hygiene regardless of patient's infection status became infected 5 . Ideally, an N95 and face shield should be used with other standard PPE for all endoscopy cases, and PAPR for known COVID-19 positive cases if the case absolutely cannot be deferred. The suggestion to use PAPRs for COVID-19 positive patients is born from China's anecdotal experience during endoscopic endonasal procedures where infection spread was apparently not controlled with N95 and only possible after use of PAPRs. We fully appreciate that PPEs are currently in tight supply; however, with careful conservation the above may be possible. It starts with only doing procedures that are absolutely necessary. PPE use should be tightly regulated. Our hospital has gathered all masks and face shields and are having every provider sign one out each day as needed. Before this, we had a PPE station in the unit where the provider signed out masks using their ID, employee number, and patient medical record number. The mask can be reused as long as it is functional, not soiled, and not used in a suspected or COVIDpositive patient. It is important to cover the N95 to prevent soiling. We prefer a face shield for this purpose because surgical masks are also running low throughout the country. A guide to proper extended use and reuse is provided at the CDC. 6 Proper donning and doffing practices should also be followed. 7 It is important to remove the face shield and N95 after dirty gloves are removed without touching the front of the shield or mask (with careful hand washing following mask removal). The face shield should be cleaned with disinfectant wipes before storage. UV-C light can be effective at disinfecting masks and should be considered. Each PPE should be stored in its own paper bag labeled with the provider's name; therefore, one bag may be for N95 and another for the face shield. If the use of N95 with all high-risk procedures is not possible, COVID-19 testing to better risk stratify patients before all endoscopy cases may be considered as an alternative. Ultimately, testing all patients before high-risk procedures such as endoscopy is likely the best approach; however, this will depend on significant expansion of testing capabilities. Hopefully, the development of point-of-care testing with rapid results and increasing testing availability will make this a reality soon.",39.3603601922746,16.187746427908976

N95s are recommended for high-risk patients undergoing any endoscopic procedure with a standard surgical mask recommended for low risk patients. However, we believe there is a spectrum of risk-severity that is regional and temporal in nature. In a pandemic where asymptomatic transmission is known to occur, significant undertesting continues, and society is expected to practice extreme physical distancing with closure of all nonessential businesses, are there any truly low-risk patients? Remember that COVID-19 is thought to be at least 3 times as contagious as the flu virus, and the majority of cases are thought to occur by asymptomatic transmission.

Mass Casualty Incident Planning Coronavirus Outbreak, is Radiology Ready? Mass Casualty Incident Planning","In late December 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) was announced in Wuhan, China 3 . Although rigorous attempts were made to confine the disease, this infection has continued to spread throughout the world. At the date of this publication, there are confirmed COVID-19 cases in 162 countries worldwide with growing concern that the infection will quickly reach pandemic proportions. As per Bruce Aylward, head of a World Health Organization (WHO) expert mission to China, the world is ""simply not ready"" to contain this outbreak. 4 China's extraordinary measure of instituting a quarantine in Wuhan and surrounding areas afforded the world a few months of lead time to prepare. However, according to the Dr. Tom Frieden who is the former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a coronavirus pandemic is inevitable. 5 The number of confirmed cases and patient deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have already exceeded those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS). 6 Healthcare systems worldwide should be prepared for an unusually high volume of patients in the next few months. This will include patients with COVID-19 in addition to patients requiring emergent care for other illnesses. Rapid diagnosis is essential for efficient patient triage. The RT-PCR test kits disseminated by the CDC are considered the gold of standard for COVID-19 diagnosis 7 , but several studies have shown that a negative initial PCR does not exclude COVID-19 infection 8, 9 . Additionally, it may take up to 48 hours to receive the final results, which limits the utility of this diagnostic test during initial triage of these patients in the emergency setting. In a recent study published in Radiology, based on a retrospective study of 1014 patients, the diagnostic sensitivity of chest CT for COVID-19 is significantly greater than that of RT-PCR (98% vs 59%), but the specificity is limited (25%) 7 . Proposed explanations for the decreased sensitivity of RT-PCR include low viral load, immature development of RT-PCR technology, and suboptimal clinical sampling. This study concluded that chest CT can be used as a screening tool for COVID-19 in cases with a high pretest probability, as evidenced by patients demonstrating clinical manifestations compatible with COVID-19 infection. Therefore, it is expected that there will be a significant interest in increasing in the number of imaging studies ordered for suspected cases of COVID-19 from both Emergency Medicine Department and Inpatient services. Given the low specificity of CT for diagnosing COVID-19, the American College of Radiology (ACR) does not recommend the use of CT for screening or as a first-line test for diagnosing COVID-19. 10",37.551490488106786,15.230574575920077

The only way to control this disease is to cut-off the route of transmission. After the confirmation of human-to-human transmission, the Wuhan Municipal Government announced travel restrictions in Wuhan, and population migration in Hubei Province continues to be monitored. The entire country is actively trying to prevent the spread of the epidemic. At the beginning of the epidemic, there were insufficient hospital beds for the patients in Wuhan, and a large number of patients were required to self-isolate at home. However, patients with COVID-19 under home isolation will transmit the virus to other people in the house via human-to-human transmission.

Given the propensity of these emerging infections to rapidly cause severe respiratory failure in many patients and, in the case of COVID-19, the high transmission rate of the virus and unclear overall case-fatality rate, the critical care response should be part of a larger pandemic plan to reduce transmission and prevent deaths. These preparations for the COVID-19 outbreak should involve the provision of ECMO in sufficiently resourced settings. Careful patient selection for ECMO is needed because patient age and comorbidities appear to influence outcomes in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Moreover, several variables, such as reversibility of the pulmonary disease process, risk of secondary pulmonary infections, and the role of antiviral drugs and other disease-modifying factors, might affect outcomes with ECMO. In addition to careful patient selection, strict adherence to standard intensive care management practices and infection control protocols should be among the primary goals of care.",45.412058838597176,19.15867716365748

GUIDELINES FOR THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA. SPANISH SOCIETY OF PULMONOLOGY AND THORACIC SURGERY (SEPAR),"The severity of CAP is initially assessed on the basis of prognostic factors to decide the most appropriate care setting-outpatient treatment, hospitalization, or ICU-and to identify the most appropriate empiric antibiotic treatment. A series of risk factors associated with increased morbidity and mortality were identified using a classic meta-analysis. These factors can be grouped as follows: a) patient-dependent factors, such as age and comorbidity; and b) factors related to the CAP episode, such as clinical, analytical, and radiographic findings. 6 Since no single prognostic factor is capable of predicting death with sufficient sensitivity or specificity, multivariate analysis is used. Such analysis makes it possible to identify independent risk factors with predictive value. 79 In the past decade, various authors have devised prediction rules for estimating the risk of death in patients with CAP. These rules were developed to deal with the 2 objectives fundamental to the management of patients with CAP: a) to identify patients at low risk for death, who may be suitable for outpatient treatment; and b) to recognize patients at high risk for death, who must be hospitalized. 80 Using models based on multivariate statistical analysis, Fine et al 81 developed a prediction rule that stratifies patients into 5 classes with respect to the risk of death (Fine risk class or pneumonia severity index). This rule was derived from data on 14199 patients with CAP included in a series of studies in the United States of America, and it was independently validated in a different cohort of patients (the Pneumonia Patient Outcomes Research Team study). Fine's rule predicts mortality by assigning points to each case based on 20 variables. Patients are stratified into 5 classes on the basis of the resulting score (Table 5) : classes I to III (patients at low risk of death, 0.1%-2.8%), Class IV (risk of death between 8.2%-9.3%), and class V (high risk of death, 27%-31%). Because it identifies patients with a risk of death under 3% (classes I-III), this rule has become a tool used to decide when outpatient treatment is appropriate. Patients who fall into classes I and II receive outpatient treatment, patients in class III require brief inpatient observation, and patients classified as class IV and V are hospitalized. 81 When applied to different populations, this rule has been shown to predict the risk of death very accurately, particularly in patients over 65 years old, although its ability to predict hospitalization is weaker. One of the foremost limitations of Fine's rule is that the score is based on 20 variables, some of which can only be obtained using analytical techniques solely available in hospitals. Another disadvantage is that it may underestimate the severity of disease in young patients. Moreover, this rule does not take into account social factors or the patient's personal circumstances, which may be important when deciding whether hospitalization is necessary or not.",39.91654047520696,16.349402101865493

Some studies suggest a high rate of AKI events upon COVID-19 infection, whereas a recent study from Wuhan, China, reported that AKI happened in <5% of the hospitalized patients with this viral infection. 11 As more studies are underway, it is prudent that during an active COVID-19 we ensure the mitigation of PEW risk and immediate correction of PEW in all patients with kidney diseases including transplant recipients. We encourage adequate protein and calorie intake, be it enterally or parenterally, so that any occurrence of hypokalemia or hypophosphatemia can be avoided and that PEW, sarcopenia and cachexia can be prevented or immediately corrected. 12 In the midst of this serious infection there is no role for delaying nutrition support or for low protein, low phosphorus, or low potassium regimens if the patient has COVID-19 infection. 13 Therefore, the need to supervise the nutrition regimens of patients with kidney diseases may be enhanced during this period and should not be ignored while focusing on other, seemingly more urgent, matters.

There was no evidence of new onset atrioventricular block in COVID-19 patients and no arrhythmic cardiac death during hospitalization. Nevertheless, a previous report in 138 COVID-19 patients showed that common complications included arrhythmias in 16.7% of cases and acute cardiac injury in 7.2% [2] . This was confirmed in another recent report in 187 patients with COVID-19 demonstrating malignant arrhythmias in 11.5% of patients with increased troponin [4] . In this study the upper reference limit of troponin I was 0.12 ng/mL. The same authors demonstrate that even if functional and morphological cardiac abnormalities were infrequent with increased troponin levels had a significant hazard ratio of 8.9 (95% confidence interval 1.9-40.6) for the risk of death, as reported by others [4, 5] . Of note, in accordance with a similar report, troponin I was not elevated at the beginning of the infection while in patients with severe clinical conditions tended to increase [10] . This finding suggests that troponin I is mainly a marker of multiorgan failure and pulmonary hypertension associated with ARDS more than a marker that identifies patients with acute myocarditis. Finally, the Authors conclude that elevation of troponin during hospitalization is an important marker of prognosis and should be seen as a warning sign even if not generally increased at the beginning of hospitalization. The observation that troponin levels at the beginning of hospitalization cannot differentiate between survivors and non-survivors is also in line with a previous publication [10] . The study by Deng et al. [9] does not support to perform routine echocardiogram in all patients with COVID-19, but it should be considered in those with raised troponin. Several reports suggest that increased troponin levels in the emergency department could identify patients at higher risk for acute myocarditis triggered by SARS-CoV-2 [7, 8] . Identification of these patients would be important clinically since they often present with atypical symptoms such as chest pain and minimal respiratory involvement [7, 8] . Acute myocarditis, in addition to acute coagulopathy, could explain cases of sudden cardiac death observed during quarantine among COVID-19 patients not admitted to hospital [4] .",33.25069105759591,13.756752789491072

In this issue, Morris et al take the stand that minimally invasive surgery provides superior patient outcomes, more rapid patient healing, and the risks to staff can be mitigated by patient triage and by modifications to operative technique [2] . Cohen et al argue that the risks to operative staff should be minimized at all costs, and that triage, testing, and protection should minimize surgery on COVID-19 positive patients, but that when emergent surgery is required for untested or COVID-19 positive patients, laparotomy is indicated to minimize the risks to operating room personnel [3] .",34.5151888328095,13.182420469229905

Switching from a RAAS inhibitor to another antihypertensive therapy in a stable ambulatory patient may require careful follow-up to avoid rebound increases in blood pressure. In addition, selection of dose-equivalent antihypertensive therapies may be challenging in practice and may be patient-dependent. Even small and short-lived periods of blood pressure instability after a therapeutic change have been associated with excess cardiovascular risk. [64] [65] [66] This may be an especially important consideration in patients with Covid-19, which appears to result in a state of RAAS activation, 44 and in settings (e.g., China) where baseline blood-pressure control is infrequently reached at the population level. 11, 12 The effects of withdrawing RAAS inhibitors or switching treatments are uncertain among patients with chronic kidney disease.

They follow the regulations of local and national government, and provide prescription medications dispensing service and other pharmacy-related services. Retail pharmacies in China provide some prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, supplements, and health-related products and devices for sale. They are not considered part of the healthcare system as they practice follow different companies' regulations. The professional skills of pharmacy staff and pharmacists work in these retail pharmacies varies significantly, and are generally not considered as healthcare professionals. 4 Special needs of PC services during the COVID-19 pandemic During the COVID-19 pandemic, the need of PC services is beyond the scope of traditional practice of community pharmacists, which can be divided into two parts: the need of pandemic prevention and control and the need from patients of pharmacy-related issues. To promote the pandemic control, community patients need to be screened properly and suspected patients shall be referred to designated medical institutions in a timely manner. 5 The public also need to master effective personal protection skills to control the community transmission of COVID-19. 2,6,7 Patients on medical isolated observation or patients with mild COVID-19 on treatment at home are lacking guidance on home care strategies. 8 The pharmacy-related needs of community patients have similarities with the traditional patient population, but with different emphasis.

Such patients have a pro-inflammatory state with functional defects in innate and adaptive immune cell populations 8 , and are known to have a higher risk for upper respiratory tract infection 9 and pneumonia. 10 Of note, the median time period between the first symptoms and signs of COVID-19 and hospital admission was slightly more than a week in our study. An alternative explanation is that many COVID-19 patients could not be admitted in the very early stage of disease outbreak because of the acutely increasing, large number of patients and limited availability of hospital beds in Wuhan. Earlier admission to hospital might have helped to prevent disease spread and deterioration. This is the first study showing an association between kidney involvement and poor outcome in patients with COVID-19. We found that patients with elevated baseline serum creatinine were more likely to be admitted to ICU and to undergo mechanical ventilation, suggesting that kidney disease on admission represented a higher risk of deterioration. It has been reported previously that kidney injury was associated with an increased risk of death in patients with H1N1 and SARS. 5, 11 In our study, indicators of kidney involvement at admission were associated with a higher risk of in-hospital death even after adjustment for potential confounders. This AKI results from an abrupt loss of kidney function, strongly associated with increased mortality and morbidity. 12 We found that patients with elevated serum creatinine were more likely to develop AKI during hospitalization, which is consistent with study in SARS. 5 It is therefore important to increase the awareness of AKI in those who entered the hospital with an elevated serum creatinine. In our cohort the detection rate of AKI in COVID-19 patients was 5.1%, in keeping with recent reports of small sample size 1, 4, 7, 13 and much higher than the 0.5% of a large observational study. 14 This may be explained by an extremely high proportion of severely sick patients in a previous case series and only 15.7% in the large observational study. In our cohort study, 42.7% patients were severely ill, and this may explain the higher detection rate of AKI in clinic practice in Wuhan. Importantly, the present method of detecting AKI is mainly based on acute changes in serum creatinine and the frequency of serum creatinine tests has a substantial impact on detection rate. 15 In a nationwide cross-sectional survey of hospitalize adult patients in China, the detection rate of AKI was only 0.99% by KDIGO criteria. 16 After adjusting for the frequency of serum creatinine, determinations the incidence of AKI in Chinese hospitalized adults rose to 11.6%. 17 Thus, in order to improve early detection of kidney injury, more frequent serum creatinine measurements should be performed in patients with COVID-19.",37.15591339537394,14.386540269793194

However, these numbers are probably underestimated as not all patients are tested, especially those who are asymptomatic, or with only mild symptoms and no associated comorbidities. The standard of reference for confirming COVID-19 relies on microbiological tests such as real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or sequencing [3] . However, these tests might not be available in an emergency setting and their results are not immediately available. Computed tomography (CT) can be used as an important complement to RT-PCR for diagnosing COVID-19 pneumonia in the current epidemic context [4, 5] . Indeed, when the viral load is insufficient, RT-PCR can be falsely negative while chest CT shows suggestive abnormalities [4, 5] . A large series based on 1014 patients reported a 97% sensitivity of chest CT for the diagnosis of COVID-19, while the mean time interval between initial negative and positive RT-PCR was approximately 5 days [5] .

Results: We included six articles (one narrative letter, one in-vitro study, one editorial, expert consensus paper, two national guideline documents) and 23 ongoing clinical trials in China. Chloroquine seems to be effective in limiting the replication of SARS-CoV-2 (virus causing COVID-19) in vitro. Conclusions: There is rationale, pre-clinical evidence of effectiveness and evidence of safety from long-time clinical use for other indications to justify clinical research on chloroquine in patients with COVID-19.

[2] Seven of the 34 operative patients (20¢6%) died of COVID-19 associated complications. This mortality rate is much higher than the reported overall case-fatality rate of 2¢3% in COVID-19 patients without surgery, [9] and also higher than the case-fatality rate of 7¢9% in noncardiac surgical patients without COVID-19 infection who were admitted to multidisciplinary ICU. [20] Furthermore, the average duration from the time of first symptom to death of the 7 non-survivors (8¢7 days, range 4 to 13 days) is apparently shorter than that reported previously. In the report of Huang and colleagues, [5] the median time from onset of symptoms to first hospital admission was 7.0 days (4.0À8.0) and to ICU admission was 10.5 days (8.0À17.0) and 6 patients (15% of the total of 41 cases studied) did not survive ICU. The study did not report the exact dates of patient death, but it is safe for us to say that the average time from the onset of symptoms to death was longer than 10.5 days and thus longer than that of the non-survivors in our study. In other words, it is highly likely that surgical stress occurred during the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 infection exacerbated disease progression and severity. Currently, no specialized medication is available for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and supportive measures remain the mainstay of COVID-19 treatment. Thus, the patient's immune function is a major determinant of the disease severity, and populations with low immune function, such as older people are more vulnerable and have high mortality after COVID-19 infection. [7] Surgery may not only cause immediate impairment immune function, [12] but also induce early systemic inflammatory response. [21] Similar to the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, [22] the SARS-CoV infected lung could induce and increase the amount of macrophage and neutrophil infiltration, and increase the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. [23, 24] And, the high levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines has been reported to be correlated with the severity of illness in patients infected with the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). [5] Consistent with these findings, the most common laboratory abnormalities in this study were lymphopenia (29 [85¢3%] of 34 patients) and increased hypersensitive C-reactive protein.

Infectious disease outbreaks such as COVID-19, as well as other public health events, can cause emotional distress and anxiety. These feelings of distress and anxiety can occur even in people not at high risk of getting sick, in the face of a virus with which the common people may be unfamiliar. I read publications on ""Vicarious traumatization in the general public, members, and non-members of medical teams aiding in COVID-19 control"" and on ""Traumatization in medical staff helping with COVID-19 control"" with a great interest (Li et al., 2020; Joob and Wiwanitkit, 2020) . Li et al. reported how much people and medical staff suffer from vicarious traumatization and how this vicarious traumatization of non-front-line medical staff is more serious than that of front-line medical staff (Li et al., 2020) . As in South and Southeast Asia countries, also in Italy, there are similar problems in medical staff due to high workload and intermittent lack of protective devices. In addition, some slight form of racism is demonstrated against health care professionals who potentially have a higher risk of being infected and between non-front-line medical staff towards front-line medical staff. We don't have to forget the many doctors and nurses were infected and many of them died due to COVID-19 infection. Also in Italy, local people also have high levels of stress due to no firm estimate of how long pandemic will last and how long our lives will be disrupted or whether or not we or our loved ones will be infected. Previous research has revealed a profound and wide spectrum of psychological impact that outbreaks can inflict on people (Lima et al., 2020) . New psychiatric symptoms in people without mental illness can occur or aggravate the condition of those with pre-existing mental illness and cause distress to the caregivers of affected individuals (Kelvin and Rubino, 2020) . Most health professionals working in isolation units and hospitals very often do not receive any training for providing mental health care (Lima et al., 2020) . Barbisch et al. (2015) described how the confinement ""caused a sense of collective hysteria, leading the staff to desperate measures"". Suicidal cases were reported in India (Goyal et al., 2020) but also in other countries, Italy included, where two infected Italian nurses committed suicide in a period of a few days probably due to fear of spreading COVID-19 to patients. It is possible that fear and anxiety of falling sick or dying, helplessness will drive an increase in the 2020 suicide rates. In the United States (US), the COVID-19 Pandemic's New Epicenter, a dedicated Lifeline (the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline) was activated for emotional distress related to COVID-19 to prevent suicide.",36.94819399292269,14.323538452399267

If one assumes that the number of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic cases is several times as high as the number of reported cases, the case fatality rate may be considerably less than 1%. This suggests that the overall clinical consequences of Covid-19 may ultimately be more akin to those of a severe seasonal influenza (which has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1%) or a pandemic influenza (similar to those in 1957 and 1968) rather than a disease similar to SARS or MERS, which have had case fatality rates of 9 to 10% and 36%, respectively. 2 The efficiency of transmission for any respiratory virus has important implications for containment and mitigation strategies.

Most transplant patients are on triple immunotherapy, compared to pwMS who are on monotherapy and even then, the level of immunosuppression is generally low. Hence, the mortality/morbidity risk to an individual on a DMT, infected with COVID-19, may be actually quite moderate to low. Another hypothesis being considered is that moderate immunosuppression may prevent severe complications associated with COVID-19 infection. The severe pulmonary complications of COVID-19 infection are consistent with ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) caused by an over-exuberant immune response to the virus (Ramanathan et al., 2020) . As a result, several exploratory trials are currently being undertaken in China and elsewhere using immunosuppressants to try and dampen the immune response to the virus. Interestingly, fingolimod, a S1P modulator licensed for MS, is being tested as a treatment for COVID-19 associated ARDS (continued on next page) G. Giovannoni, et al. Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders xxx (xxxx) xxxx (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04280588). Interferon beta is also being trialled in COVID-19 based on its antiviral properties (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04276688). Then there is the virology to take into account. SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, is a new human pathogen that is likely to have recently crossed species (Andersen et al., 2020) . COVID-19 will eventually become endemic and hence pose a seasonal risk to patients on immunosuppressive therapies. As it is a small RNA virus with low fidelity it is likely to mutate rapidly making a one-off vaccine only a partial solution. Vaccines take time to be developed, tested and introduced at a population level. Delaying treatment, de-escalating therapy by switching to immunomodulatory DMTs, such as interferonbeta, glatiramer acetate or teriflunomide, or interrupting dosing of DMTs to wait for a vaccine will delay the adequate treatment of MS, especially as it may take 12-18 months to develop a vaccine. We, therefore, need a pragmatic response on management of the potential threat of COVID-19 in individuals with MS. If patients have active MS they need to be treated based on the clinical evidence at hand and hence may need to be treated with higher efficacy DMTs. This should be implemented in conjunction with appropriate behavioural modifications to reduce or ideally prevent exposure to the virus.",34.456982336625195,13.97693848487204

The number of positive patients without symptoms is probably higher than initially estimated, and the risk of spread should be kept at minimum [45] As the pandemic progresses it is inevitable that departments will have to deal with the issue of patients who have symptoms of COVID-19 or are confirmed to have the disease. In this scenario different healthcare systems will have different approaches to confirmatory testing. In the absence of a universal policy for testing and the lack of an instant test we should assume a patient with suspicious symptoms is an infectious carrier of the disease. For patients with slow growing or low risk disease it may be oncologically safe to either prematurely or temporarily stop the patient's treatment until they have recovered from infection.

Considering the speed of transmission of COVID-19, individuals from vulnerable health systems are at particular risk. An example is the Eastern European countries that in recent years faced health system vulnerabilities due to post-communism delayed reforms, corruption, and the emigration of physicians [3] . Romania is a concerning example of a vulnerable health system [3] with the highest governmental instability within the EU [4] , the leadership of the Romanian Ministry of Health changed 25 times in 27 years, a turnover three times higher than in other EU countries [4] . In its recent history, Romania experienced a series of economic crises (in the 1990s, and in late 2000s) which forced an estimated~5 million people to emigrate, including in countries where currently COVID-19 was identified (especially in Italy, Spain, Germany and United Kingdom). Many of these migrants regularly travel back to Romania which increases the likelihood for COVID-19 to spread [1] to Romania. Rising public awareness among migrant travelers and providing hygiene products is highly suggested to limit the spread of COVID-19. After the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Romanian Ministry of Health released late January a set of recommendations and proceeded to the acquisition of medical equipment with the purpose of initial identification of travelers that show COVID-19 symptoms [5] . As the Romanian government collapsed on February 5th, 2020, public auctions were suspended and the confusion among population is very high combined with the political instability. As this unstable situation continues how will Romania cope with the spread of the COVID-19 by incoming travelers? Romania has 14 international (out of 16) airports that are highly connected with airports across all EU (in 2019, over 23 million passengers used these airports), including from countries where COVID-19 was already identified in the EU. The vulnerability is even higher considering the high potential of false-negative rate of diagnostic of COVID-19 that already has been documented [6] and the lack of personnel. As such, public awareness, widespread public health measures, and close collaboration with countries from which incoming travelers are arriving in Romania is a key to limit the spread of COVID-19 and promote the wellbeing of travelers and the members of the community (resident or diaspora).",36.54049186834835,15.6363822929581

First, the patient is in the incubation period. The incubation period occurs in an acute disease. It is the time from the moment of exposure to an infectious agent until signs and symptoms of the disease appear. In other words, this patient will develop symptoms or signs later, but has not yet. Second, the patient has developed signs, such as pneumonia in chest CT, but has not yet had subjective symptoms. This patient is actually in the period of illness. This is the case for our patient 5-13, and also for patients 1-3 before their symptom onset. Third, if this patient turns RT-PCR negative later and has never experienced symptoms or signs, this patient should be subclinical infection, just like Patient 4 in our cohort. Fourth, if this patient continues to be asymptomatic and has no signs, and the RT-PCR remains positive for a long time, then this patient is an asymptomatic chronic carrier. No such cases were found in our cohort as all patients turned RT-PCR negative in 3 weeks. These 4 types of asymptomatic patients have completely different significance for the disease spectrum and natural history of COVID-19. If we can make diagnosis early enough, we should be able to detect patients in the incubation period. In our cohort, 3 patients (Patient 1-3) developed symptoms later which made them the typical COVID-19 patients. We also found that 2.7% (9/328) of patients continued asymptomatic even with pulmonary involvement (Patient 5-13). Although they underwent the pathological process of pneumonia like most COVID-19 patients, they were blind spots for control interventions based on symptomatic cases screening because they never developed symptoms. We did not find chronic asymptomatic carriers in our cohort. There have been no previous cases of human chronic carriers of coronavirus, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We think that there is probably no chronic carrier for SARS-CoV-2. Although subclinical infections accounted for only 0.3% (1/328) of our cohort (Patient 4), it represents only the tip of the iceberg. The proportion of subclinical infection should be derived from future serological studies. A positive nasopharyngeal swab or throat swab RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic patients suggests that they may have the potential to infect others. However, the viral loads and infectivity of these patients may vary widely. Due to limited resources, we did not perform these tests. Further investigations are needed to determine the potential for and mode of contagion of asymptomatic patients to develop more scientific control strategies. ",34.138572751936486,12.709561569799988

The Fangcang shelter hospitals, which can be rapidly established, 4, 5 can provide large numbers of hospital beds and appropriate care for patients who do not have severe or critical disease. 5, 6 Health workers at Fangcang shelter hospitals can transfer patients to higher-level hospitals for more complex treatment if their conditions worsen. 6 Fangcang shelter hospitals can also offer emotional and social support to help patients recover and thrive during an otherwise disruptive period in their lives. 6 In this report, we document the conception and dev elop ment of Fangcang shelter hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak in China, describe their key characteristics and essential functions, discuss critical issues for the success of Fangcang shelter hospitals, and consider applications of the concept as part of the COVID-19 public health response in other countries. on the city's medical system. 7 At the beginning of February, 2020, Wuhan had no beds available for COVID-19 patients in the hospitals designated for treating the virus. 8 Thousands of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 had to be sent home for isolation and observation. With a shortage of hospital beds, Wuhan needed an approach to rapidly and massively scale its capacity to isolate and care for patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. As the outbreak in Wuhan reached its most severe point, with thousands of new infections per day, the city opened three Fangcang shelter hospitals on Feb 5, 2020, by converting exhibition centres and stadiums. Over the following weeks, Wuhan opened an additional 13 Fangcang shelter hospitals. 9 Figure 1 shows the progression of bed capacity and occupancy of the Fangcang shelter hospitals over time. As the epidemic in Wuhan subsided and bed occupancy moved towards zero, the Fangcang shelter hospitals were successively suspended. The first hospital closed on March 1, 2020; by March 10, all Fangcang shelter hospitals had been suspended. 10, 11 Home isolation is an important alternative to hospital isolation, which requires behaviour change but no additional infrastructure investment. Chinese policy makers decided against home isolation of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 for a number of important reasons. 12, 13 First, home isolation puts patients' family members at risk. Early epidemiological evidence in China showed that more than half of all patients with COVID-19 had at least one family member with the disease, and 75-80% of all clustered infections were within families, suggesting high rates of intrafamily transmission. [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] Second, patients can find home isolation psychologically taxing, because they know that they are putting those they care about most at risk of contracting the disease. 19, 20 Third, home isolation is unlikely to be fully effective because it cannot be strictly enforced. Patients might break with the mandated behaviour to stay at home and go outside for errands, entertainment, or exercise. Lastly, it is difficult to organise medical care, frequent monitoring of disease progression, and timely referral to hospital care for thousands of patients in home isolation. 21 COVID-19 can deteriorate from mild or moderate to severe illness, requiring rapid referral to hospital care. [16] [17] [18] In home isolation in Wuhan, before the introduction of the Fangcang shelter hospitals, the time from onset of severe symptoms to admission to a tertiary hospital for intensive care was up to 10 days. 8, 22 The Fangcang shelter hospitals substantially reduced these delays.",33.22801846172588,12.442343887360513

They were implemented for the first time in China in February, 2020, to tackle the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. The Fangcang shelter hospitals in China were large-scale, temporary hospitals, rapidly built by converting existing public venues, such as stadiums and exhibition centres, into health-care facilities. They served to isolate patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 from their families and communities, while providing medical care, disease monitoring, food, shelter, and social activities. We document the development of Fangcang shelter hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak in China and explain their three key characteristics (rapid construction, massive scale, and low cost) and five essential functions (isolation, triage, basic medical care, frequent monitoring and rapid referral, and essential living and social engagement). Fangcang shelter hospitals could be powerful components of national responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as future epidemics and public health emergencies.",30.999157824557194,11.748096419825563

Fangcang shelter hospitals leverage large-scale public venues, which, once they have been converted to serve hospital functions, result in a large increase in health-care capacity (figure 1). The built over a period of 3 weeks contained 13 000 hospitals beds (figure 4). By March 10, 2020, the 16 hospitals had provided care to about 12 000 patients. 34 In caring for and sheltering such a large number of patients who would otherwise have been confined to their homes, these shelter hospitals effectively supported China's COVID-19 policy of leaving no patient unattended or untreated. 35 The third characteristic is the low cost of building and running Fangcang shelter hospitals. Investment costs are low because converting public venues into health-care facilities avoids costly construction of new physical infrastructure. Equally, once the epidemic has subsided, the structures can be returned to their original purposes, avoiding long-term, inefficient use of space, which is a particularly important consideration in a densely populated city. Running costs are low because Fangcang shelter hospitals require fewer doctors and nurses than traditional hospitals. 36 The low health worker-to-patient ratio is for two reasons: first, all patients in the hospital share the same primary admission diagnosis, reducing the complexity of care, and second, all patients have only mild to moderate disease. 9,37 By isolating and treating only mild to moderate cases, Fangcang shelter hospitals in Wuhan freed up the scarce medical infra structure of higher-level hospitals, such as the inpatient units providing respiratory support and intensive care, for patients with severe to critical COVID-19 and other patients requiring critical or complex care. More than 90% of severe cases in Hubei province were in Wuhan, 38 and the bed vacancy rate in the traditional hospitals designated for the care of patients with COVID-19 increased from 4% on Feb 4, 2020 (before the first Fangcang shelter hospitals had opened) to 16% on Feb 22, when 16 Fangcang shelter hospitals had started admitting patients. 38 The Fangcang shelter hospitals improved the distribution of patients with COVID-19 according to the severity of their symptoms, increasing the overall efficiency of care. Figure 3 summarises the functions of Fangcang shelter hospitals. The first essential function is isolation. Before the construction of the hospitals, thousands of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 in Wuhan had to be sent home for isolation. Patients with mild to moderate symptoms are generally more active than the severely ill and thus in greater contact with others, increasing the possibility of transmission and placing family and community members at risk. 39 The Fangcang shelter hospitals isolated COVID-19 patients more effectively from their communities than home isolation.",33.13367417854387,11.262388743927692

It also assumes a small proportion of persons who are negative or have recovered from COVID-19; this may change with the availability of wider testing and the ability to test for past infection or immunity. Recent data from China, by Chang et al, revealed the greatest risk of COVID-19 exposure to health care workers during early stages of the pandemic when testing was not yet widely available. 61 In a JAMA report published from Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan, 29.3% (40 of 138) of COVID-19 infected patients were health care workers who presumably had hospital-acquired infections. 27 Among 493 health care workers caring for hospitalized patients, 10/493 health care workers became infected with COVID-19; all 10 were unprotected health care workers (no mask) caring for patients on medical wards with a low risk of exposure (no known or suspected COVID-19 patients). In contrast, none of the 278 protected health care workers (N95 mask) caring for high risk patients (known or suspected COVID-19) became infected (aOR 464.82; 95% CI: 97.73 to infinite). 62 One study, evaluating health care worker exposure in the care of one COVID-19 positive patient, revealed that none of 41 health care workers (surgical masks only) developed infection despite absence of N95 mask, although studies evaluating health care workers in context of larger cohorts of COVID-19 positive patients are not yet available. 63 The decision to extend the recommendation to lower GI procedures is based on evidence of possible aerosolization during colonoscopy especially during the insertion and removal of instruments through the biopsy channel. 53 and the uncertain risks associated with evidence of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in fecal samples.

They reported that 5.0% of COVID-19 infected patients had nausea or vomiting and 3.8% had diarrhea. 21 30 A recent meta-analysis of 4243 patients from China suggested that approximately 17.6% of patients had any gastrointestinal symptom, including 9.2% with pain, 12.5% with diarrhea, 10.2% with nausea/vomiting. 31 One of the concerns with many of the published studies is the possible duplicate inclusion of the patients across reports, thereby limiting valid performance of pooled estimates in a meta-analysis. 32 There is evidence for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool specimens independent of the presence of diarrhea. Some studies showed that stool continued to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA even after respiratory samples became negative. Chen et al reported a case of COVID-19 based on compatible symptoms and lung imaging in a patient with positive stool real-time RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 RNA but negative pharyngeal swabs and sputum samples. Furthermore, Wang et al reported confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 positive fecal samples in 2 patients without diarrhea. 12, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 What are the liver manifestations of COVID-19? Liver injury is estimated to occur in up to 20-30% of patients at the time of diagnosis with SARS-CoV-2 infection. 14 Severe hepatitis has been reported but liver failure appears to be rare. 39 The pattern of liver injury appears to be predominantly hepatocellular, and the etiology remains uncertain but may represent a secondary effect of the systemic inflammatory response observed with COVID-19 disease, although direct viral infection and drug-induced liver injury cannot be excluded. One study of liver biopsy specimens obtained from a patient with COVID-19 disease revealed microvesicular steatosis and mild lobular and portal activity, suggestive of either SARS-CoV-2 infection or drug-induced liver injury. 41 Abnormal liver enzymes may be observed in both adults and children with COVID-19, 42 and do not appear to be a major predictor of clinical outcomes. 15 Early studies have multiple methodologic limitations, with variable laboratory thresholds, limited longitudinal assessment of liver enzymes, heterogeneous evaluation for alternative etiologies, and limited information regarding baseline liver diseases and confounding variables. Additional studies are needed to further characterize the unique clinical considerations for SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with chronic liver disease and/or cirrhosis, 43 although preliminary guidance has been provided by the AASLD on March 23, 2020. 44 What are the potential risks to health care workers performing endoscopy? SARS-CoV-2 is presumed to spread primarily via respiratory droplets from talking, coughing, sneezing, and close contact with symptomatic individuals. However humanto-human transmission can occur from unknown infected persons (e.g. asymptomatic carriers or individuals with mild symptoms) as well as individuals with virus shedding during the pre-incubation period before symptoms develop. 45 Data related to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the early phase of the pandemic have confirmed that health care professionals are at higher risk of infection than the general population. The WHO and Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) reported infection of 2055 health care workers as of February 20, 2020 during the index outbreak in Hubei Province, with health care workers facing a rate of infection approximately three times the general population. 46 This prompted the Chinese Department of Health Reform to deploy more than 40,000 additional health-care workers to the region, preserve personal protective equipment (PPE), and implement surveillance measures and quarantine protocols. 46 Such measures appear to have slowed the spread to health care workers, with recent cases primarily attributable to household contacts rather than occupational exposure. Similar trends have been observed in Europe, with an estimated 20% of COVID-19 infections in Italy occurring in health care workers. 47 Preliminary reports in the US also suggest that health care workers are at risk of nosocomial infections, including infection of 20 health care workers among the first 67 COVID-19 positive individuals in Philadelphia, and additional health care workers cases in WA, NY, and MA. 48, 49, 50 The spread of disease via health care workers is concerning for several reasons: a) appropriate PPE may not be utilized effectively, especially when COVID-19 patients cannot be identified quickly, b) shortage of health care workers due to infection and/or quarantine, and c) the concern of the role of infected health care workers to act as a vector for transmission to patients.",34.06598876450795,14.118071819216194

Secondly, the standard recommended protocol of changing PPEs between every testing of patients, to prevent cross-infection among patients and specimen contamination, were not strictly adhered to due to the lack of resources.5 In fact, a considerable number of patients received negative results initially but then got positive results on the consecutive test. These results may be due to window periods of virus infection, but the possibility of cross-infection among patients during sample collection or contamination of specimens cannot be excluded. Also, due to the limitations of the original facility, not all patients could receive solitary rooms, although they used separate bedrooms and bathroom inside the shared space and were promptly reassigned to solitary rooms as soon as other patients were discharged and solitary rooms became available. If more CTCs are to be operated, as is expected, this problem will be ameliorated.

Other reasons should be considered and explored based on future data. In addition, the higher rates of familial clustering may be related to faecal shedding in shared toilets in households. Further multivariate analysis revealed sputum production from infected areas and increased LDH/glucose levels as independent risk factors for the disease. In addition, symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath and headache were also significantly higher in patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms, which may be caused by their higher fevers and increased electrolyte imbalance. Liver damage should be carefully monitored, as we found significantly increased AST levels and coexisting conditions of liver disease in patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms. Since the ratio of chronic liver disease was higher in patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms, it could lead to increased levels of ALT and AST.

To estimate the overall risk of specific public health events, probability, and impact at the country-level were evaluated using the available information. For the probability of certain public health events, risk of importation and risk of transmission were taken into consideration. KCDC risk assessment was categorized into 5 levels (“very low,” “low,” “moderate,” “high,” and “very high”), and overall risk was determined [4]. The emergence of COVID-19, which started as clusters of pneumonia with unknown etiology in China at the end of 2019, was unique and thus, a good example for KCDC to conduct a series of risk assessments to evaluate the potential risk of importation, transmission, and the impact at the country-level.

Traditional HP treatment methods such as decreasing the antigen (virus) and controlling the abnormal immune response must be part of the strategy. SARS-CoV-2 is more likely to spread in the elderly and lead to severe pneumonia. Hence, COVID-19 patients would benefit from the administration of antiviral medications (nucleotide inhibitors, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), HIV non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), HIV protease inhibitor (PI), dextran sulfate, and combination therapy, etc.) that will limit the spread of less virulent virus both within the body and in the population.

The third phase is the final recovery phase. This was demonstrated by not only the clinical features but also the laboratory dynamics, including progressive lymphocytopenia and elevated inflammation markers at the time of acceleration. Therefore, strategies against COVID-19 should also be specified according to the course of infection. The best timing of antivirals, if any are used, may lie in the phase before acceleration. When clinical deterioration begins, the first few days of deterioration may present a critical point when potent suppression of the inflammatory cascade could save the patients from fatal immune-mediated injuries, as shown here.

Through various diseases, comorbidities have been associated with outcome.[88], [89], [90], [91], [92] Screening of significant extrahepatic comorbid conditions is the cornerstone of the health assessment required before placement on a waiting list. The UCLA score was developed with the aim of identifying variables associated with 3-month or in-hospital mortality after LT in patients with very high MELD scores (≥ 40). Among the evaluated variables, authors chose the Charlson-comorbidity index (CCI)93 that had already been proven in a recalibrated form to be efficient in determining outcome in an LT population.94 Another score named the “cardiac risk score” was defined by the presence of at least 1 of the following variables: severe valvular disease, coronary artery disease with more than 70% stenosis or previous revascularization, history of myocardial infarction, history of ventricular and/or atrial arrhythmias, elevated pre-orthotopic LT troponin I (> 0.2 ng/ml), and/or new wall motion abnormalities on echocardiography.

In the final score named UCLA futility risk score (UCLA-FRS) an important weight was given to comorbidity including the cardiac risk index and the CCI: UCLA-FRS = 0.5 × (MELD score) + 5 × (1 = CCI ≥ 6; 0 = CCI < 6) + 4 × (1 = cardiac risk; 0 = no cardiac risk) + 3 × (1 = septic shock; 0 = no septic shock).97 In a recent study reporting results of LT in patients with OFs, this score seemed to be helpful in selecting candidates for LT when considering predicted and observed post-LT survival rates.98 Another study aimed to compare available scores in 2 independent cohorts of transplanted patients with high MELD scores (Swiss and UNOS cohort). Most prediction scores showed low positive predictive values for post-transplant mortality despite good specificity. Among these scores, the BAR score was the only score linearly associated with complications.99 The usefulness of this score, which was designed for the more critically ill patients, seems restricted to this population based on its performance in other cohorts100 (Table 3).",19.917514153258658,9.779696953075955

Second, no studies have investigated the hazard of the identified risk factors over time, or the probability of survival at a given time. Under the rapidly changing pandemic situation, it is crucial to provide timely survival-time guidance for implementing the targeted treatment to the high-risk patients in clinical practice. Third, most existing studies on mortality risk factors were focused on patients diagnosed in Wuhan, Hubei Province, with little understanding about the mortality risk factors outside of Hubei Province. The risk factors are likely different inside and outside of Hubei Province, since current research has found that the clinical symptom severity [5] and the fatality-case rate [9, 21] to be higher in Hubei Province (the center of outbreak) than cities outside of Hubei Province in China. Fourth, no studies thus far have taken into account the pandemic stage when evaluating mortality risk factors. It has been found that average daily attack rate in China was different before and after January 11 th 2020, since non-pharmaceutical interventions were taken by the government before this date [22] . The change of pandemic stage may also influence the risk factors for fatality associated with COVID-19.",28.827058787048763,9.735762192026096

From the perspective of the route of transmission of COVID-19, mainly for the close contact and the spread of respiratory tract, the infectious, many for family gathering, patients not only concerned about their illness, more concerned about the infection of members of the family; 2. From the perspective of COVID-19, the new virus had never found in the human body, because of Wuhan viral pneumonia cases were found in 2019, was named the world health organization (WHO) on January 12, 2020, so the people the knowledge of the new disease, less about the characteristics of the virus and disease diagnosis, treatment and prognosis are exploring, so the uncertainty is adding to the patients with tension and fear of disease; 3. In a short period of time, a large number of COVID-19 patients broke out, the news media continuously reported, the death of some patients, all make the patients' psychological bearing capacity is low, in the course of illness is prone to depression, or even negative ideas. Therefore, in the process of disease treatment, patients not only need medical treatment, but also need psychological support. It is worth noting that in the process of receiving the intervention, a small number of patients began to reject the psychological intervention and deny the psychological problems. After our patient and careful explanation and communication, they finally accepted our help, which also reflected that our medical staff needed to take the initiative to publicize and provide help to more patients.",25.668171325783717,11.897722275864359
