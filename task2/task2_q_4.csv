The university-based model of postgraduate training in public health draws upon the model disseminated by the Rockefeller Foundation of dedicated, prestigious training institutes, distinct from clinical training institutes [26] . There is a dearth of public health training programs in universities in LMIC. Australia, for example, has 18 Public Health Education and Research Program (PHERP) funded public health training programs through universities and institutions [27]; South Asia -with a population eighty times that of the Australia -has only 12 schools of public health [28] . In the African continent, covering a population fifty times that of Australia, there are only 50 schools of public health [28] . This model of education has been critiqued for providing classroombased training of dubious relevance to 'real world' problems in LMIC [24, 28] . The most devastating argument against this model of training, however, is the fact that there are too few institutions to produce sufficient public health personnel in LMIC. The continued dominance of this model as the most prestigious form of public health training in LMIC represents a diversion of resources from more effective forms of public health training. The streamed training model has been used by UNICEF, WHO and other international aid agencies [24, 29] . This model aims to train workers in specified areas of public health practice, such as tuberculosis or diarrhoeal and vaccine-preventable diseases. This model is usually taken up by junior health workers who are provided with a limited set of public health competencies. While it is cost effective in meeting its educational goals, the streamed training model creates a cadre of public health workers who are generally positioned too low in the health bureaucracy to improve health policy or essential research.

Genomic data about individuals and groups might be consulted during disease outbreaks, in planning for public health programs, or in developing new or assessing existing public health policies; for instance, where are the hotspots for infection (and are these associated with specific pathogen or host genomics), where should vaccines be deployed most urgently, which therapies should be offered to which genomic populations, and where should treatment programs, isolation policies or public health control programs be implemented to halt the spread of infections?

Mathematical models that represented how contact tracing and follow-up may control Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) transmissions were developed for evaluating different infection control interventions, estimating likely number of infections as well as facilitating understanding of their likely epidemiology. We reviewed mathematical models for contact tracing and follow-up control measures of SARS and MERS transmission. Model characteristics, epidemiological parameters and intervention parameters used in the mathematical models from seven studies were summarized. A major concern identified in future epidemics is whether public health administrators can collect all the required data for building epidemiological models in a short period of time during the early phase of an outbreak. Also, currently available models do not explicitly model constrained resources. We urge for closed-loop communication between public health administrators and modelling researchers to come up with guidelines to delineate the collection of the required data in the midst of an outbreak and the inclusion of additional logistical details in future similar models.",25.368684595921984,9.731602331136436

Providing the limited healthcare worker cadre with appropriate training and personal protective equipment, and ensuring a continuous supply chain for such, is a challenge in all settings, exacerbated in complex humanitarian crises. Frequent displacement and limited contact information may prevent effective contact tracing.

What are the hospital infection control issues associated with a SARS outbreak, and what are the most effective approaches to address these issues? What type State and local health departments continue to face unprecedented challenges in preparing for, recognizing, and responding to threats to the public's health. The attacks of 11 September 2001 and the ensuing anthrax mailings of 2001 highlighted the public health readiness and response hurdles posed by intentionally caused injury and illness. At the same time, recent natural disasters have highlighted the need for comparable public health readiness and response capabilities. Public health readiness and response activities can be conceptualized similarly for intentional attacks, natural disasters, and human-caused accidents. Consistent with this view, the federal government has adopted the all-hazards response model as its fundamental paradigm. Adoption of this paradigm provides powerful improvements in efficiency and efficacy, because it reduces the need to create a complex family of situation-specific preparedness and response activities. However, in practice, public health preparedness requires additional models and tools to provide a framework to better understand and prioritize emergency readiness and response needs, as well as to facilitate solutions; this is particularly true at the local health department level. Here, we propose to extend the use of the Haddon matrix-a conceptual model used for more than two decades in injury prevention and response strategies-for this purpose. of advance planning strategy could a local public health department use to identify the contributing factors to this public health emergency? What approaches could a local public health department use to deliver comprehensive public health prevention, intervention, and risk communication measures before, during, and after such an outbreak?",26.246441938528704,10.571709342119346

Table 3 shows an example of the Haddon matrix as applied to one such issue: SARS hospital infection control. This SARS model of the Haddon matrix views infectious disease as a form of injury affecting the population on a broad scale. The model allows its users to better understand the multidimensional nature of the epidemic and to identify targets for prevention, mitigation, and intervention. By identifying targeted points of intervention (noted with asterisks in Table 3 ), we can discover potential measures to successfully mitigate the public health threat before, during, and after a SARS event. considered in the event of an emerging infectious disease outbreak such as SARS (Loutfy et al. 2004; Svoboda et al. 2004) . Lessons on public health readiness are often learned painfully after large crises, as was the case during the SARS outbreak of 2003 (Campbell 2004; Hearne et al. 2004 ). Using the Haddon matrix before an event occurs allows us to consider the interplay of variables that might otherwise have been missed (and were missed during the actual events associated with the SARS outbreak). For example, in the preevent phase under physical environment, the Haddon matrix reveals the importance of addressing the need for adequate personal protective equipment; this may seem obvious enough in hindsight, but this issue received insufficient attention before the SARS outbreaks in 2003 (Campbell 2004; Reznikovich and Balicer 2004) .",24.185147370650746,10.072148749246232

For example, a high incidence prediction could lead to a public health department using its limited resources to deploy costly measures (e.g., mosquito spraying). One consideration is whether it is more important to use a model with a high PPV or a high Sensitivity. A high PPV indicates that, when the model predicts high incidence rate, high incidence is very likely to actually occur. When disease prevention and mitigation resources are limited, it is very important to have high PPV. Based on feedback from the local public health departments in Peru, there was a desire for a dengue prediction model with high PPV [20] . To reduce morbidity and mortality, public health departments also want to be able to mitigate any real outbreaks without being caught unprepared. A high Sensitivity indicates that the model predicts a high percentage of the outbreaks that actually occur. If PPV is high and Sensitivity is low, it means that when an outbreak is predicted, the probability is high that it will occur, but only a small percentage of actual outbreaks are predicted.

The immediate relevance of EIDs to humans has united global efforts to counter them, and this has resulted in national and international networks of public health organizations coordinated (in the case of international outbreaks) by WHO. By contrast, calls for unity over invasions (e.g. [113] ) have so far largely failed to produce effective agencies. There is, for example, no equivalent to public health organizations such as US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Public Health Agency of Canada and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control that has prime responsibility for the detection and control of invasive species. This contrast is probably due to a number of reasons, including the local, regional or national (versus international) scope of many invasions, the often long time lag between biological invasions and detected impacts, and the generally slower nature of invasions, which together result in fractionated efforts that may be ineffective. Responsibilities for coordinating responses to EIDs of public health significance always lie with public health organizations, but responsibilities for responding to invasive species vary depending on the impact or location of the invasive species and may be organizations responsible for agriculture, fisheries, environment, natural resources, transport or local government entities [114] . 4) . These functions are, to a greater or lesser extent, already undertaken independently by those involved in the study, prevention and control of EIDs and biological invasions. However, we advocate for a strong, collaborative One Health approach in these actions that integrates across human, animal and environmental health, including both invasion biology and epidemiology in the field of EIDs.",25.182620362624274,9.821925995165765

The effectiveness of S in reducing the total number of cases was small, a reduction of about 4.2%. (4) For multiple control measures, since A had almost no effect, it is not surprising to see that AH was similar to H, AS was similar to S and AHS was similar to HS. HS (and AHS) were the most effective control strategies: the peak number of cases decreased by 56% to 57%, the total number of cases decreased by 21% to 22% and the peak day was delayed by 17 to 20 days. Table 2 lists the distribution of infections between different types of AB amongst S, H and HS (A is excluded due to its ineffectiveness). Compared with N, S reduced the infection in schools to a very low level, but infection within other ABs also increased in absolute number, compensating for the gain. Compared with N, H reduced the total infection, and the effectiveness varied amongst different types of AB. Thus, the transmission environments (ABs) most resistant to control were home and school, with decreases of 33% and 41%, respectively, while for all other ABs the total number of cases decreased by 63 -69%. HS was the most effective control measure for all types of AB, with the lowest infection rates for any AB type. Table 3 shows the three properties of the outbreak controlled by HS (with a 50% compliance level for household quarantine), with alert values increasing from 20 to 1000. Clearly, the higher the alert value, the larger the total number of cases and peak number of cases, and the earlier the peak day. With a lower alert value, that is, intervening earlier, control measures were more effective. Table 4 shows the three properties of the outbreak controlled by HS (with a 50% compliance level for household quarantine) for four values of R 0 (1.24, 1.79, 2.42, and 2.60). By comparing the set of outcomes under control measure HS with the corresponding N scenario (for the same R 0 ) ( Table 4) , it can be seen that the control measure HS was more effective for smaller R 0 values.

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak to be a pandemic because of growing worldwide cases [3] . Currently, the severity of the outbreak is moderate as most people recover from infection without the need for medical care [4] . However, if the virus mutates and achieves the ability to cause severe illness, it will kill more people and overwhelm the health system. Vaccination is the most effective means of pandemic mitigation. Vaccine production is a complex multi-step process which involves development, manufacturing, and delivery processes and current levels of vaccine production capacity are inadequate. Thus many uncertainties exist in every step and effective vaccines are typically available well after the viral strain has emerged [5] [6] [7] [8] . For instance, vaccines against the H1N1 strain are still under development and will remain in short supply by November 2009 [9] . Current stockpiling of antiviral drugs will also be in short supply and their efficiency will be limited once a pandemic occurs [7, 8] . Public health systems need to be prepared for cases when effective pharmaceutical interventions are unavailable.

There are also clear boundaries between global health, public health and medicine with regard to the target population. Medicine targets patient populations, public health targets health populations in general, while global health targets the global population. We have to admit that there are obvious overlaps between global health, public health and medicine, particularly between global health and international health. It is worth noting that global health can be considered as an extension of international health with regard to the scope and purposes.

We estimated the effective vaccination rate for the population, with basic reproduction number (R 0 ) as the intermediate variable. Periodic EVD fluctuation was analyzed by solving a Jacobian matrix of differential equations based on a SIR (susceptible, infective, and removed) model. A comprehensive compartment model was constructed to fit and predict EVD transmission patterns, and to evaluate the effects of control and prevention measures. Effective EVD vaccination rates were estimated to be 42% (31-50%), 45% (42-48%), and 51% (44-56%) among susceptible individuals in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, respectively. In the absence of control measures, there would be rapid mortality in these three countries, and an EVD epidemic would be likely recur in 2035, and then again 8~9 years later. Oscillation intervals would shorten and outbreak severity would decrease until the periodicity reached~5.3 years. Measures that reduced the spread of EVD included: early diagnosis, treatment in isolation, isolating/monitoring close contacts, timely corpse removal, post-recovery condom use, and preventing or quarantining imported cases. EVD may re-emerge within two decades without control and prevention measures.

Many related issues were discussed, including low literacy level, poverty, and trust of and/or deference to health authorities. Some cultural variations were expressed; for example, that certain societies more readily accept autocratic directives for disease control. Participants at all meetings affirmed that their cultures do not tolerate corruption and indicated that a lack of transparency raises suspicions of corrupt dealings. Government authorities and leaders are expected to be open and consult the community in making important decisions, including public health emergency decisions, affecting their people. Factors that complicate mass communication that were discussed at all meetings include low levels of literacy, the inaccessibility of media such as television, newspapers, and the internet because of poverty; and the unavailability of the internet and cell phone towers in some rural areas. Although the detail and depth of discussions regionally varied and some cultural variation was evident, transparency in decision-making was in general decisively affirmed. At the African meeting, in contrast to the general perception that ""big men"" and individuals with centralized power make all of the decisions, participants agreed that traditional cultures expect leaders to seek input from those they lead, through elder councils and similar institutions. Participants noted that public health leaders include traditional healers who serve as both recipients of and conduits for information. Because many Africans will seek care from traditional healers during a pandemic, these health providers must also be informed of how to protect themselves from infection, and how to guard against spreading the infection. In addition, a wide variety of local and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs), often funded by high-income countries, are active in resource poor countries in Africa seeking to meet the populations' most basic needs. Thus, it is important that both traditional healers and NGOs be engaged in the decisionmaking process. The participants at the Asian meeting varied widely in their views and practices relating to informing and engaging the public. For example, when SARS broke out in one Asian country, the government issued mandatory public health measures and expected public compliance. Due to the culture of deference to authority, nearly all communities in this country instantly adopted the measures (eg, quarantine, isolation, and social distancing). However, not all participants reported such deference to authority. This was reflected in a story from another Asian country about a boycott of a government polio immunization campaign by a minority community due to suspicions about the government's motives. Others reported that when the central government was perceived as misgoverned or weak, responsibilities for informing the public about health threats and providing leadership during emergencies fell to local leaders. Participants at the Latin American meeting stressed that community participation and cooperation will be crucial during a pandemic influenza response, particularly for migrants or minorities who are already stigmatized. Latin American participants also pointed to the importance of the media and health authorities in communicating health information and avoiding panic, as well as to convey factual information about availability and access to therapeutics. Some participants were concerned about the wide disparity in resources within and between countries, which make transparency even more important. Participants at the Eastern Mediterranean meeting emphasized the need for inclusion, accountability, and transparency in public health policies, but also noted the reluctance among countries to collaborate because of political differences and disparity in wealth and resources. Participants discussed the need to establish a clear understanding of who will make what decisions during an emergency, how guidelines will be established, and the importance of considering multiple perspectives, including perspectives from individuals most at risk.",21.924594154730137,9.139962109696013

Early engagement with communities and social scientists who study the culture, tradition, and linguistics of people from affected areas would help inform communication by decision-makers, mitigation strategies used by public health responders, and trust-building with the local population. Furthermore, leveraging the knowledge gained from these social science disciplines could enhance efforts to build trust among affected individuals rather than allow the persistence of distrust between local communities and foreign health workers [76, 77] . Similar approaches should be used towards domestic and wild animal research, with animal and conservation ethics and local cultural and traditions considered.",24.43365034730209,10.50639912133257

Existing scientific knowledge and experience could be built upon to prevent or mitigate future outbreaks. However, under pressure to respond quickly to emerging outbreaks, decision-makers struggle to identify effective and relevant medical and non-medical public health response measures because they may not have available information about the causative agents, assessments of potential health and/or economic effects, effective biosafety and infection control measures, information about societally appropriate control measures, and ready risk communication measures for their constituents.

The all-hazards approach is viewed as essential for public health systemlevel readiness, enabling effective and efficient preparedness that accounts for the difficulty in predicting the type and severity of events [14, 22, 23] . The conventional cycle of emergency management includes four phases which are (1) prevention/mitigation, (2) preparedness, (3) response and (4) recovery; public health agency activities relate to all four phases [24] . In this study, we focus on preparedness as upstream activities and actions that promote enhanced public health system capacity and resilience throughout all four phases. It is important to note that in Canada, PHEP addresses population-level preparedness, distinct from clinical care and health care facility preparedness.

The public health system is the lead in responding to outbreaks and in minimizing the impact of diverse emergencies on health [2, 3] . Public health sector activities in infectious disease emergencies include leading other emergency management organizations during outbreaks, conducting surveillance and investigation, implementing control measures, developing guidance for health-care practitioners, and communicating risks [3] . In addition, public health is the lead sector in preparing for the population health effects of non-infectious events incited by natural or anthropogenic hazards. Emergency preparedness levels have been a concern globally in past emergencies; for example, Canada's response to the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak raised a number of issues: lack of surge capacity in the clinical and public health systems, difficulties with timely access to laboratory testing and results, and weak links between public health and the health care system were clear gaps in preparedness [3] . Recognizing complex and system-level challenges that affect emergency preparedness efforts globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) has called for all countries to create resilient integrated systems that can be responsive and proactive to any future threat, although this remains a knowledge gap [4, 5] . While risks vary for different communities, disaster and emergency preparedness is recognized as essential for all nation-states [4, 6] . Local and regional public health agencies aim to mitigate risks and protect population health; however, they face challenges to ensure readiness for potential emergencies ranging widely in likelihood and impact.

A telephonebased survey in the Greater Toronto Area aiming to ascertain public perceptions of the use of quarantine found that while quarantine was perceived to be a necessary and effective strategy, its ethical implementation should involve the collaboration of policy-makers, public health organizations, and the general population, and should be closely regulated to ensure appropriate use and protection of individual rights (Tracy et al. 2009 ). Despite these recommendations, Toronto quarantined significantly more people during the SARS outbreak compared to the other affected cities, including Hong Kong and Shanghai (Jacobs 2007) . Given the reported psychological distress reported by those quarantined, Toronto might have considered other strategies, such as the use of face masks to better Bdistribute the burden of containment measures ( Jacob, 2007, p. 532) . Critics note that the extensive quarantining in Toronto lacked proper policies and procedures to guide its implementation (Jacobs 2007) . Others highlight a lack of public record detailing any consultation between public health officials and the Ontario Human Rights Commission (Jacobs 2007) . There was little public scrutiny, which was suggested to be the result of effective conditioning of the public consciousness to believe that quarantining recommendations would be made fairly and legitimately by senior public health officials (Jacobs 2007) . Ultimately, it was not quarantining that was problematic, but the lack of apparent or sufficient evidence to guide its implementation. Beyond extensive quarantining, The World Health Organization issued travel-advisories as an additional control measure to contain further national and international spread of SARS from Toronto (Paquin 2007) . This travel-advisory cost Toronto $1.1 billion and restricted the international right for freedom of movement (Paquin 2007) . Paquin (2009) criticizes these travel-advisories for various reasons. For example, the advisories were not made by the WHO in consultation with Toronto authorities and led to an uneven global distribution of the burden of SARS (Paquin 2007) . Furthermore, the travel advisories were based on old data resulting from delayed communication between the federal government of Canada and the WHO, as information had to first travel from municipal to provincial to federal health authorities (Paquin 2007) . Once again, the evidence used to inform the response was outdated and therefore considered unjustified. As such, there were problems with both the lack of quality evidence and the travel advisory as a response.",22.529689177441416,9.421275604366

These measures contributed to an acceleration in the efforts to control tuberculosis [30, 31] . Because the data quality for TB is higher after 2004, we decided to fit the data for the infected TB cases for 2005-2016 in China using Model (2) . The data from, 2005-2015 were used to fit and those of 2016 were used to check the predictive power by residual and R 2 statistic.",26.53551975160105,11.92282645050925

Since the outbreak, several groups reported estimated R 0 of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and generated valuable prediction for the early phase of this outbreak. After implementation of strict prevention and control measures in China, new estimation is needed. An infectious disease dynamics SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Removed) model was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Wuhan, China under two assumptions of R t . In the first assumption, R t was assumed to maintain over 1. The estimated number of infections would continue to increase throughout February without any indication of dropping with R t = 1.9, 2.6, or 3.1. The number of infections would reach 11,044, 70,258, and 227,989, respectively, by 29 February 2020. In the second assumption, R t was assumed to gradually decrease at different phases from high level of transmission (R t = 3.1, 2.6, and 1.9) to below 1 (R t = 0.9 or 0.5) owing to increasingly implemented public health intervention. Several phases were divided by the dates when various levels of prevention and control measures were taken in effect in Wuhan.

Whether or not the peak of the number of infections would occur in February 2020 may be an important index for evaluating the sufficiency of the current measures taken in China. Regardless of the occurrence of the peak, the currently strict measures in Wuhan should be continuously implemented and necessary strict public health measures should be applied in other locations in China with high number of COVID-19 cases, in order to reduce R t to an ideal level and control the infection.",23.495803075894578,9.45634068573783

However, this principle has been embraced less when the public health intervention is targeted at the animal population, even when the intervention has shown to be feasible and costeffective, as in the case of mass vaccination of dogs against rabies, discussed below.

For effective control of rabies, for example, it is increasingly clear that sustained, contiguous and large-scale programmes are needed, as even small pockets of low vaccination coverage (involving less than 0.5% of the dog population) can significantly hamper progress [75] . Even where the cost-effectiveness of One Health strategies has been demonstrated, for example, in relation to mass rabies vaccination of dogs in Africa [76, 77] , sheep and goat vaccination against brucellosis in Mongolia [62] and control of human African trypanosomiasis in Uganda [13] , barriers remain to scaling-up. Increasing attention is being paid to opportunities for integrating platforms for delivery of health interventions, with international health agencies focusing on the importance of strengthening health systems to achieve equitable delivery of health services, rather than developing multiple vertical programmes for specific diseases [78] . It is recognized that establishing independent delivery efforts for specific diseases can lead to fragmentation, and that coordination across sectors is needed to strengthen health systems. In Tanzania, these ideas are being explored through a programme investigating whether the reach and cost-effectiveness of MDA targeting soil-transmitted helminths in children and mass vaccination of domestic dogs against rabies can be improved through integration. Adopting One Health approaches, the project aims to break down traditional barriers that exist between veterinary and human health interventions, and build on the community trust achieved through the provision of a common good (effective control of rabies) in order to achieve cost savings, develop synergies and improve the effectiveness of both interventions. Further opportunities to establish co-delivery across a range of health interventions exist, not only for integrating control measures against several different zoonoses [73] , but also for cross-linkages with public health interventions, such as water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programmes, and joint delivery of public health and veterinary services, particularly in remote or nomadic rural communities [79] .",29.95491872671701,12.07055369670401

Therefore, we maintain that the urgent implementation and monitoring of diagnostic capacities and capabilities for SARS-CoV-2 in Europe is proportional to the containment and expected mitigation phase of the global public health response and is critical for care of local patients. The implementation of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics does not replace nor exclude diagnostic capacity for other respiratory viruses. Moreover, it explicitly does not disregard the importance of other seasonal respiratory pathogens for public and patient health. This is clearly illustrated by the authors themselves, who indicate that they have tested thousands of samples of patients suspected of respiratory viral disease not only for common respiratory pathogens but also for SARS-CoV-2. The fact that Colson et al. found a wide range of seasonal respiratory viruses indeed underlines the impact of such pathogens.

The introduction of population movement into an area characterized by sustained differences in measures of population health allows for the transfer or elaboration of these characteristics between locations. 53 This is a concept with far-reaching implications for health maintenance and promotion, disease prevention, intervention and health-services management, and education and training programs. In the sphere of infectious diseases, population mobility is one of the underlying factors in the emergence and reemergence of diseases of international public health importance as shown by communicable disease outbreaks. 54 Prevalence disparities between migrant source and destination countries can also exist for noninfectious diseases and conditions, although the direction of disparity from high to low prevalence and vice versa may vary depending on the condition being studied. As a consequence, migrant-receiving nations are sometimes required to respond to adverse health outcomes that originate beyond their jurisdiction and normal planning considerations. In addition, migrants who are subjected to legal, social, or economic isolation and deprivation may develop levels of ill health much different from those seen in the local or host population. Taken together, evidence clearly suggests that health interventions and attempts to mitigate adverse health outcomes in migrant communities may require approaches that differ from those required by the locally born community. 55, 56 The impact of migration on national health and disease epidemiology Many economically advantaged nations have gained the benefits of long-standing and effective public health and disease-control programs. The effective control of tuberculosis in much of the high-income world means that the major remaining public health challenges presented by the disease in developed countries are related to migration. 57 In terms of noninfectious conditions and chronic diseases, programs directed at detection and treatment for malignancies (cervical, breast, and colon), interventions to manage anemia and some endocrine disorders, and the significance of maternal-child health issues have resulted in the moderation of the impact of these illnesses locally. Migration from less economically advantaged areas will affect the epidemiology of diseases in 'low-incidence' host environments. 58 This is particularly true for diseases that occur at very low incidence levels, or which have been virtually eliminated locally. The relationship between migration and disease epidemiology at the destination of the migrant is not always negative. Differential risk and variability in adverse health outcomes may exist between migrant and host populations for a number of diseases. Variations in prevalence may go in several directions or vary over time and across generations. Health impacts of population mobility may occur in an epidemiologically neutral context. Large populations of labor migrants moving within Asia or Western Europe represent situations in which there may be no significant health disparities between mobile and host populations, and any significant migrant effects on health instead are related to the scale of demand for services. Finally, population mobility may result in situations in which new arrivals exhibit more positive health characteristics than those observed in the host population. Examples of the latter type are observed in the context of some noninfectious or chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases and eating disorders, and are described as representing the 'healthy immigrant effect.' 59, 60 Even this 'healthy immigrant effect' concept varies depending on time, social situation, and clinical condition. 61 Although preexisting health conditions and illnesses can be associated with changes in disease patterns, the act of migration can also pose new threats and health risks. Postmigration public health impacts include the consequences of ill health when newly arriving migrants experience isolation, social exclusion, and/or poverty. 62 In situations in which migrant communities' access to health or social services is limited, post-arrival susceptibilities may increase, manifested by the expression of a more severe or advanced disease. 63 Programs and strategies designed to promote and improve the health of migrants and mobile populations vary between nations. They often reflect national health priorities and local migration dynamics. Examples include developing migrant-friendly clinics and hospitals, 64 ensuring that some categories of unauthorized migrants, such as those without documents, can receive care without being reported to immigration authorities, 65 providing medical care or screening guidelines indicating the role had by mobile populations in the epidemiology of a given disease or illness, 66 and in terms of public health risk, considering migrant and mobile populations in emergency and contingency plans for disease risk mitigation. 67 Health system challenges Migration-associated adverse health outcomes present two sets of challenges to health systems in migrant-receiving nations. The first challenge is the early appreciation and recognition of the diversity and disparity components of the population, which could result in significant migrant health issues. Early recognition can be achieved through effective engagement of the health-services system by a health professional or the migrant. The size of the migrant population and the diversity within migrant communities and populations can mask significantly different groups with disease vulnerabilities. Health practices may differ significantly by group, particularly in health-promotion strategies and approaches to disease screening between source and host nations (for example, hypertension, diabetes in pregnancy, colon, uterine or breast cancer). These differences may also extend to infectious disease prevention and control measures, such as vaccination or outbreak response. If health indicators are collected or recorded in terms of broad administrative classifications, such as 'migrant' or 'place of birth,' health risks in populations composed of internally displaced, refugees, or trafficked individuals may be obscured.",23.732329221915265,11.912033792657525

Many of these diseases are being addressed through initiatives that involve international and regional programs dedicated to improving global health. They include international efforts to expand immunization (GAVI), 112 reduce the impact of high-burden diseases (such as tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and malaria), 113 manage the implications of pandemic influenza, 114 and improve public health responses in general (IHRs). 115 Although migration and population mobility may feature in some aspects of these endeavors, there is a paucity of integrated collective action on migration-associated components. Integrating a migration component into these activities can facilitate the global approach to disease control and demonstrate immediate benefit for both source and recipient nations. Mobile populations are one of the means by which locally arising risks can become global challenges. Mitigation programs and control strategies must encompass migration components in terms of both threat-to-risk assessment and intervention planning. The importance of these issues has been noted during responses to global health events such as SARS (2003) and the more recent pandemic influenza (2009) event, wherein travel-related control measures included screening, inspection, isolation, quarantine, and exclusion.

A One Health approach emphasizing inter-disciplinary co-operation is increasingly seen as necessary for effective EID control and prevention. There are, however, socio-political, ethical and legal challenges, which must be met by such a One Health approach. Discussion: Based on the philosophical review and critical analysis of scholarship around the theory and practice of One Health it is clear that EID events are not simply about pathogens jumping species barriers; they are comprised of complex and contingent sets of relations that involve socioeconomic and socio-political drivers and consequences with the latter extending beyond the impact of the disease. Therefore, the effectiveness of policies based on One Health depends on their implementation and alignment with or modification of public values. Summary: Despite its strong motivating rationale, implementing a One Health approach in an integrated and considered manner can be challenging, especially in the face of a perceived crisis. The effective control and prevention of EIDs therefore requires: (i) social science research to improve understanding of how EID threats and responses play out; (ii) the development of an analytic framework that catalogues case experiences with EIDs, reflects their dynamic nature and promotes inter-sectoral collaboration and knowledge synthesis; (iii) genuine public engagement processes that promote transparency, education and capture people's preferences; (iv) a set of practical principles and values that integrate ethics into decision-making procedures, against which policies and public health responses can be assessed; (v) integration of the analytic framework and the statement of principles and values outlined above; and (vi) a focus on genuine reform rather than rhetoric.",23.46768173742576,10.618442930866273

Unlike SARS and swine influenza, HeV is a low-incidence high-consequence pathogen [54] . This type of slow emerging zoonosis, which only affects human health occasionally, comes with its own set of unique challenges.

Failing to do so, may put people at risk, in particular professionals such as farmers, zoo and wildlife carers, and veterinarians who may come in contact with an infected animal. However, it would be unrealistic to mobilise the same level of resources used for the management of zoonoses such as SARS or swine influenza. Nevertheless, it may be possible to develop a template framework for the management of slowly emerging zoonoses, which could include: improving veterinary IC and emerging zoonoses management preparedness through education; better communication between government authorities, veterinarians and the public; better recognition of the biosecurity and public health role and services provided by private veterinarians; consultation with private veterinarians when developing zoonoses management plans compatible with running private practices; a clearer definition of the respective roles of government, professional agencies and private veterinarians using officially ratified agreements; and better and equitable government support for the management of emerging zoonoses to all private veterinarians across all affected geographic areas.

Currently, a fourth large-scale outbreak is occurring and spreading out from Wuhan, Hubei province, China, to neighboring provinces and other countries. There is a dearth of epidemiological data about the emerging coronavirus, which would be of crucial importance to design and implement timely, ad hoc effective public health interventions, such as contact tracing, quarantine and travel restrictions. In this study, we adopted a deterministic model to shed light on the transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus and assess the impact of public health interventions on infection. We found that the basic reproduction number could be as high as 6.47 (95% CI 5.71-7.23), which seems consistent with the special period prior to the Spring Festival when contacts were higher than usual, and with the opinion that the virus has gone through at least three-four generations. It is worth mentioning that our model made a very good prediction of the confirmed cases from 23 to 29 January 2020, as shown in Table 4 . Particularly, the predicted confirmed cases should be 7723 as of 29 January 2020, which is very close to the real number of cases of 7711. Furthermore, according to our model, the outbreak, under the most restrictive measures, is expected to peak within two weeks (since 23 January 2020), with a significant low peak value. Our investigation has major practical implications for public health decision-and policy-makers. The rather high reproduction number suggests that the outbreak may be more serious than what has been reported so far, given the particular season of increasing social contacts, warranting effective, strict public health measures aimed to mitigate the burden generated by the spreading of the new virus.

The serial interval is defined as the time from illness onset in a primary case to illness onset in a secondary case [15] and has been estimated at 15 days on average for the ongoing epidemic [12] . The basic reproduction number, R 0 , quantifies transmission potential at the beginning of an epidemic and is defined as the average number of secondary cases generated by a typical infected individual during the early phase of an epidemic, before interventions are put in place [16] . If R 0 < 1, transmission is not sufficient to generate a major epidemic. In contrast, a major epidemic is likely to occur whenever R 0 > 1. When transmission potential is measured over time t, the effective reproduction number R t , can be helpful to quantify the time-dependent transmission potential resulting from the effect of control interventions and behavior changes [17] . Estimates of R 0 for the ongoing epidemic in West Africa have fluctuated around 2 with some uncertainty (e.g., [12, [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] ), which are in good agreement with estimates from past EVD outbreaks [23] . R 0 could also vary across regions as a function of the local public health infrastructure (e.g., availability of health care settings and infection control protocols), such that an outbreak may be very unlikely to unfold in developed countries simply as a result of baseline infection control measures in place (i.e., R 0 < 1) while poor countries with extremely weak or absent public health systems may be unable to control an Ebola outbreak (i.e., R 0 > 1).",19.413757510515133,9.807930081721373

The identified mode of hepatitis A infection in Korea are person to Third, the public health system in Korea is inadequate. Although Korea' s medical technology development is among the best in the world and the utilization of healthcare services and medical expenditures have increased significantly, the public health system has not correspondingly improved. Outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases are occurring worldwide and the threat of the importation of infectious disease and healthcare associated infection including antibiotic resistance is increasing. However, the public health system necessary to carry out effective countermeasures and the national budget allocated for public healthcare personnel and public health, in general, are inadequate. A typical consequence resulting from this vulnerability of Korea was the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome outbreak in 2015. Since then, the system and policies for recruiting epidemic intelligence officers and managing hospital infections have been introduced; however, the speed of the implementation is slow and fundamental issues such as the development of healthcare workers, healthcare delivery system, and consolidation of the public health organization system have not changed. The current hepatitis A outbreak was predicted from the 2009 outbreak. At that time, the low immunization rates of birth cohorts in the 1970s and 1990s were identified as the cause and catch-up vaccination was recommended as the most cost-effective measure to increase immunity level of the corresponding age groups [20, 21] . The actual policy was to increase the 1-year-old vaccination rate to 90% by including hepatitis A vaccination into NIP, from the approximately 50% rate as an optional vaccination. These policies were the most inefficient in modeling research. As a result, as of 2019, immunity levels in children up to age 7 have increased significantly, but the lower immunity levels in older children and adults have not been addressed. At the end of 2010, hepatitis A was designated as a class 1 notifiable infectious disease, which includes waterborne and foodborne infectious diseases, due to the need for epidemiological investigations and systematic prevention and control. However, we should review and evaluate the reported improvement in epidemiological investigations and systematic prevention and control of hepatitis A over the last decade. Although the number of waterborne and foodborne infectious diseases outbreaks has been increasing annually in locations such as group catering centers, we have focused only on the management of respiratory infectious diseases and infrastructure establishment; thus, we should review whether we have neglected the epidemiological investigation, management, and prevention of waterborne and foodborne infectious diseases. As a matter of priority, an adequate system for epidemiological investigation and countermeasures against these infectious diseases should be in place, which will require substantial improvements in our capability to perform these actions at regional and basic regional government levels.",18.298328105981142,8.930124942989394

This includes the mode of transmission, incubation period, timing, duration and degree of infectiousness, age group most affected and age structure and contact behaviour of the population. Uncertainties surround these factors, especially at the beginning of an outbreak. In retrospect, although SARS was transmitted primarily through the respiratory route it usually did not behave as a highly infectious agent and certain parameters facilitated its containment through traditional public health interventions. These parameters included the lack of pre-symptomatic transmission, a low level of infectivity at the onset of illness, and that transmission was primarily through respiratory droplets and occurred primarily in healthcare or household settings involving close person to person contact (with the important exceptions of Hotel M. and Amoy Gardens in Hong Kong (Tomlinson & Cockram, 2003) ). In addition, although the reproductive number for cases was approximately three its serial interval was relatively long at 8-10 days between onset of symptoms in one person and onset of symptoms in the next person in the chain of transmission. These factors made it relatively easy to reduce transmission by promptly isolating cases, quarantining close contacts, and introducing and enforcing infection control and hygiene measures Pang, Zhu, & Xu, 2003; Riley, Fraser, & Donnelly, 2003; Svoboda, Henry, & Shulman, 2004; WHO, 2003a, b) .

Arguably, the best control strategy is early containment. This approach was successfully implemented for the case of SARS (Ho & Su 2004; Svoboda et al. 2004) , and it has also been suggested as the optimal strategy against an avian influenza outbreak (Ferguson et al. 2005; Longini et al. 2005) . However, containment might not always be possible. Both the SARS and influenza viruses are endemic in animals ( Webster 2004 ) and therefore the occurrence of multiple outbreaks within a short time span is a possibility (Mills et al. 2006) . Multiple outbreaks, as well as a situation where an outbreak occurs in a region with poor public health infrastructure, might lead to containment failure. If outbreak prevention is not possible, then reducing its severity is the next goal. The impact of a variety of intervention measures has been studied for SARS (Lipsitch et al. 2003; Pourbohloul et al. 2005) , and more recently for a potential pandemic influenza outbreak Germann et al. 2006) . Such studies provide vital information for public health officials. However, there is one important caveat to the results obtained from these studies. Namely, it is most often assumed that the outbreak occurs in a closed population, i.e. no new infecteds enter the population and no secondary outbreaks are considered. Under such a scenario, more severe intervention measures lead to less infections and accompanying mortality. Therefore, from a viewpoint of reducing the number of infecteds, the best control strategy is one that is as stringent as can possibly be implemented. However, this is not necessarily true anymore if one considers the case of multiple outbreaks. We will explain here how the best control strategy should look like for such a situation.",24.449414014196478,9.17386841603282

This issue is somewhat controversial, i.e., one study found that mass vaccination was more effective, 7 while, on the contrary, another study concluded that ring vaccination was preferable. 8 However, these studies did not take into account the human resources limitations of the public health authorities, whereas, on the other hand, a theoretical model for HIV has considered this viewpoint explicitly. 9 However, this model ignored the deaths due to HIV, and thus, we cannot extent the model to smallpox. In this article, we report our model, in which we tried to take into account the human resources limitations of public health authorities for dealing with smallpox. There is no report of this kind of research with mathematical models of control measures, (namely, mass or ring vaccination) for smallpox in Japan (S. Tokuraga: The research for technological foundation from the viewpoint of precautionary medicine [unpublished manuscript]; 2003) . In this sense, this study could contribute to public health policy for the preparation of measures to deal with bioterrorism attacks using smallpox.",26.708826358667043,10.891590921524026

Initially, the virus attaches to the enterocyte via the spike and hemagglutinin glycoproteins, which also allow fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane or endocytotic vesicles. 148, [150] [151] [152] Once in the cell, the virus replicates and is released using normal secretory mechanisms and upon cell death. 148, 153 Diarrhea begins at the time of virus entry into the cell (before cell death occurs), but it is unknown if this is the result of secretion, malabsorption, or both. 115 Infected cell loss is significant by 2 days after onset of diarrhea, and villous blunting occurs. The mature villous epithelial cells are the primary target for the virus, but crypt enterocytes are also affected. 154, 155 As in rotavirus and C parvum infections, maldigestion and malabsorption lead to diarrhea. Because the crypt enterocytes and the colonocytes can be affected by coronavirus, the clinical signs often have a longer duration. 149, 154 Treatment and Control of Coronavirus Diarrhea Like rotavirus diarrhea, there are no specific treatment methods for coronavirus infections, and little research has been done to confirm specific control measures for coronavirus in calves. Oral electrolyte solutions should be provided to prevent dehydration and treat acidosis.

A recurring point in the above discussion is the remarkable resistance of viruses to decontamination procedures. Heating and disinfection protocols for viruses and food preparation surfaces are being defined in the literature, but they must also be recognized and implemented along the food production continuum. In addition, these viruses typically have a very low infectious dose (10-100 particles) and they can be excreted at high levels (10 6 -10 11 particles per gram of faeces). Since contamination of food products is typically a secondary event, a 5 log reduction in infectious particles has been considered effective for control. The recent development of sensitive and semi-quantitative detection methods will help to identify the critical control points along the food production and preparation continuum where virus contamination can be reduced. Unfortunately, many of these methods detect viral genomes instead of infectious virus particles. The regulation of viruses in foods will require a more detailed understanding of the correlation between the presence of viral nucleic acid fragments and a human health risk.

This is where risk research and disaster research meet. Mitigation is not necessarily to ""eliminate risk"", but to reduce loss to an acceptable level. Even in the United States, mitigation is still one of the weakest links in disaster management practices. There are mainly two reasons. First, mitigation measures are generally proposed by academics rather than policymakers, and it is not easy to turn research issues into policy issues; second, mitigation measures need to be implemented down to earth, but general management departments lack the motivation to do so, because it is disaster management departments, not them, that will be responsible for the consequences of inadequate mitigation. Thus mitigation is not merely a technological issue. Only by reflecting on the negative consequences of social action from time to time and internalizing them can individual behavior and habits, organizational social responsibility and government policy preferences be developed, and a risk culture be fostered.

These measures involve multiple different agencies and commissions, for example, policymakers introducing regulations regarding the storage, transportation, and disposal of chemical substances. Another example of mitigation is to empower a public health system to monitor and conduct surveillance for infection diseases and at the same time introduce rules regarding health screening at the borders. The importance of the mitigation phase is to avoid disaster or to reduce the impact on the population. It is clear if we compare the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, with a magnitude of 7.0, and similar earthquakes in Japan where despite the same magnitude the number of dead and injured were more limited, that we see the effect of a disaster is often dependent on the underlying condition of the area affected. For decades, Japan has introduced strict building codes that follow seismic regulations. Nevertheless, it is not possible to fully mitigate against all disaster events. For instance, the 2011 earthquake in the Pacifi c Ocean produced a tsunami that hit the east coast of Japan and caused severe damage, in particular a failure of the nuclear plant in Fukushima, with release of radiation that affected the local community.",25.71175466837054,12.462157501792388

Biggs, when reflecting on the controversies that had greeted his efforts to mandate the reporting of tuberculosis cases-as he moved forward to begin the surveillance of sexually transmitted diseases in the early twentieth century-remarked that, ""[t]he ten year long opposition to the reporting of tuberculosis will doubtless appear a mild breeze compared with the stormy protest against the sanitary surveillance of the venereal diseases"" (Biggs, 1913) . Despite the existence of much opposition, the reporting of cases by name to local and state health departments and to special confidential registries ultimately became part of the tradition and practice of public health. u S courts almost always deferred to public health authorities that have deprived individuals of their liberty in the name of public health. one uS state high court declared at the beginning of the twentieth century that, ""[i]t is unquestionable that the legislature can confer police powers upon public officers for the protection of the public health. the maxim Salus populi suprema lex is the law of all courts in all countries. the individual right sinks in the necessity to provide for the public good"" (parmet, 1985) . Even more remarkably, a plenary grant of authority was still found to be constitutional in the 1960s. in upholding the detention of a person with tuberculosis pursuant to a statute that provided virtually no procedural protections, a california appellate court declared in 1966 that, ""[h]ealth regulations enacted by the state under its police power and providing even drastic measures for the elimination of disease…in a general way are not affected by constitutional provisions, either of the state or national government."" t he breadth of powers that public health authorities had enjoyed remained virtually unchallenged through most of the twentieth century, but finally came under increasing scrutiny during the last decades of that era. the development of a robust jurisprudence of privacy, and the ""due process revolution"", which extended rights to prisoners, mental patients and others under the authority of the state, ultimately questioned the long-held assumptions that had protected public health from constitutional scrutiny. the groundwork for this profound change was laid in the transformations that occurred in american politics, law and culture during the 1960s and 1970s. But it was the HiV/aiDS epidemic that forced a fundamental rethinking of the dominant ideology of public health. the methods of mandatory screening and examination, reporting the names of those who were sick or infected to public health registries and the imposition of quarantine once again became the subject of controversy and dispute (Bayer, 1989) .",24.622466309919197,11.706351465403023

Many consider hospital infection control to be a natural extension of control strategies applied in the wider community for the control of spread of infectious diseases. So for example, the role of the English Health Protection Agency (HPA) is to provide an integrated approach to protecting UK public health. The HPA has taken a substantial role in overseeing the surveillance and strategic direction of infection control in National Health Service (NHS) trusts. The HPA website describes its function as 'to protect the community (or any part of the community) against infectious diseases and other dangers to health.' The HPA acknowledges that 'decision makers must balance individual freedom against the common good, fear for personal safety against the duty to treat the sick, and short term economic losses against the wider implications of the potential spread of serious diseases', but it says little about the principles to be used in balancing these requirements. More detailed guidelines have been produced by the US Public Health Leadership Society, by other recent reports, and by a number of books, some of which have proposed a change in the definition and emphasis of public health. 9e12 Many of the actions available to public health professionals are also used in hospitals. These include surveillance, education, isolation of individuals, cohorting, treatment of infectious individuals, vaccination, and actions to contain risks associated with food, water, and airborne transmission of agents of infection.

Respiratory droplet and contact precautions have been shown to be effective in the prevention of nosocomial transmission of the disease under most circumstances . Additional measures of airborne precautions are necessary in situations where droplet nuclei are likely to be generated. Strict hand hygiene and a patrol nurse overseeing all gowning and degowning procedures in a SARS ward appear to be critical for the prevention of hospital transmission. In the community setting, contact tracing, quarantine of contacts to prevent community spread, temperature checks at borders, health declarations for travellers, public education, and effective risk communication with public media have proven to be effective for the control of the 2003 outbreak of SARS. All laboratories handling SARS specimens must comply to the World Health Organization standards. Accurate logging and secure storage of virus or infected samples are important to avoid further accidents. The amount of stored clinical specimens must be kept to a level just sufficient for research purpose. In institutions where live virus are being cultivated and manipulated, the laboratories must be regularly audited to meet the safety standards of a biosafety level 3 laboratory.

Munthe developed a model for the goals of public health within a European Public Health Network (EuroPHEN) project which was funded by the European Commission. 14 Munthe suggested that 'The most basic problem . seems to be the tension between the population perspective of public health and the individualistic perspective of traditional medical ethical notions of autonomy.' He proposed a population approach to autonomy, and an integrated multidimensional model of public health goals including consideration of autonomy (with respect to health opportunity choices), and equality (of health states and distribution of health opportunities). He proposed an integration of these goals with the traditional goal of public health e which is the promotion of population health e into the integrated goal of 'the promotion of equal (and real) opportunities of everyone to be more healthy.' In discussing how this model might work in guiding decision-making in practice, he argues that the relative importance of the traditional goal increases when population health is poorer. As population health rises, further gains in population health could be traded for gains in autonomy and equality. It is difficult to see how this approach could be applied in a hospital context. Levels of health (of hospital patients) are low (otherwise they would not be hospital patients), the capacity for autonomous decision-making may be impaired (because patients are ill), and the consequences of actions taken to control (hospital) population health may have impact not just on autonomy but also on the health of individuals e for example, on those placed in isolation.",24.149639839179684,9.540820361163794

It is always best to take measures beforehand to minimize property damage and prevent injury and death.

It was discovered during this research that ""mitigation measures were found to be most common when proactive mitigation measures were mandated by regulatory agencies and legislation."" 55 Tax incentives, government assistance grants, and building code and insurance requirements may also serve to motivate administrators and decision makers to put the necessary time and effort into mitigation planning. 30 The Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP), designed to provide leadership and funding through grants to and cooperative agreements with states, territories, and eligible municipalities to improve surge capacity and enhance community and hospital preparedness for public health emergencies, 52 has undergone significant cuts over the past few years that threaten to undo progress made in the last decade. HPP appropriations have decreased from $426 million in FY2010 to $255 million in FY2014, including a one-third cut in the FY2014 omnibus. 56 HPP provides financial incentives to ensure that hospitals are able to coordinate, cooperate, and reduce loss of life during an emergency.

The method of Wallinga and Teunis, 17 with quantifications from Lipsitch et al., 18 was used to estimate Rt, the effective or net reproduction number, which helps to determine which interventions were most important. Rt is defined as the mean number of secondary cases generated by one primary case with symptom onset on day t. This number changes during the course of an epidemic, particularly as a result of effective control measures. If Rt is larger than the threshold value of one, a sustained chain of transmission will occur, eventually leading to a major epidemic. If this number is maintained below one, then transmission may still continue, but the number of secondary cases is not sufficient to replace the primary cases, leading to a gradual fade-out of the epidemic. Figure 3 shows Rt over time for mainland China together with the timing of nine important events and public health control measures. The graph is characterised by a fluctuating pattern and wide confidence interval early in the epidemic, which can be explained by the initial low number of cases used in the calculations and the relatively more important impact of so-called super-spreading events. In Guangdong, where the epidemic started, standard control measures such as isolation and contact tracing (arrow 2) seem to already have helped to largely interrupt transmission in this province. However, during the period from day 80 to 140 the number of new SARS cases steadily increased, due to the spread to and within other parts of China, i.e. mainly Beijing and surrounding provinces. The first official report of an outbreak in Guangdong (arrow 3) and the WHO global alerts (arrow 4) were by no means reflected in a consistent reduction of Rt. Also, the first interventions in Beijing were not effective enough to cause any downward trend in the transmission (arrow 5). It was only around 11-14 April 2003 that the Chinese authorities gained full control of all activities to combat SARS, with national, unambiguous, rational, widely followed guidelines and control measures, under central guidance (arrow 6). Immediately the reproduction number decreased dramatically and consistently. Within one week, R t was below one. Strikingly, this marked decrease after the period 11-14 April was consistently present in the patterns of Rt for all heavily affected areas in mainland China. (19) The stringent control measures to prevent human contacts (arrow 7), including the decision to cancel the public holiday of May 1 (arrow 8), were all initiated after Rt was below one, i.e. when the epidemic was already dying down, again consistently for all areas in mainland China. Still, given the information available at the time, the most stringent interventions were rational since it was not clear to which extent the epidemic was under control. However, in retrospect, we can now conclude that these measures -which so much affected public life -contributed little to the factual containment of the SARS epidemic; the essential moment had occurred earlier. Obviously, the late interventions may still have played a role in speeding up the elimination of SARS. Also, cancelling the public holiday, where millions of people travel long distances to visit their family, may have prevented (smaller) outbreaks in yet unaffected locations. Nowadays methods are available to estimate Rt in real time, so that the course of the epidemic and the impact of control can be assessed more rapidly. 20 We conclude that strong political commitment and a centrally coordinated response was the most important factor in the control of SARS in mainland China. With respect to future outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, we emphasise that it is of first and foremost importance that effective control is based on clear (inter)national guidelines, communication and reporting structures, together with firm definition of responsibilities at all levels.",25.094902683568133,8.926725351060675

Consistent with IHR (2005), Greek reform reintroduced the communitarian foundations of control strategies, mandating restrictions of individual liberties when necessary for protecting public health. Disease control is consistently treated as public health protection and crafted to avoid undue impact on individuals. Thus Greek law aligns with public health provisions in the revised IHR, and in laws of France, Sweden, and other countries. [24] [25] [26] Disease control is not treated as a national security issue that would be reminiscent of the older policing approach. 27 Thus, Greek law embodies current understanding of effective public health practice with emphasis on public education and transparent procedures, not on punitive, coercive or stigmatizing ones that may drive epidemics 'underground'. 28, 29 Along with these amendments to align Greek law conceptually with EU and international legislation, the Ministry of Health drafted a national public health plan (2008) incorporating policies for meeting EU and IHR (2005) disease control objectives. However, Greek implementation has lagged; the pressing economic situation raises questions about whether the country will fully meet its obligations by the IHR (2005) deadline in 2012. Major legislative weaknesses stem from failing to follow up core infectious disease control law with supplementary legal and administrational regulations needed to guide implementation. Inconsistent and uncoordinated law making contributed to incomplete establishment of structures and procedures. Governmental change or emergence of new diseases exposed legal and administrative inadequacies, whereas consecutive reforms remade structures, policies, and procedures. Reforms have not thoughtfully integrated preexisting legislation, nor have obsolete or conflicting provisions regularly been removed.

The language of human rights is increasingly part of the landscape for health law in Australia and a See, for example, Public Health Act 1991 (NSW) s 23. internationally. [43] [44] [45] Given the potential for public health laws to impact upon the freedom of individuals, and the need for public health laws to balance the interests of individuals and society, public health laws will ideally have a transparent ethical framework, articulating the principles upon which state intervention will be premised. 46 The World Health Organization has acknowledged the importance of legal and ethical considerations to pandemic preparedness, noting that public health measures such as quarantine, compulsory vaccination and off-licence use of medicines 'need a legal framework to ensure transparent assessment and justification of the measures that are being considered, and to ensure coherence with international legislation (International Health Regulations)'. 47 Consideration of ethical issues is also essential for, as the World Health Organization has noted, ethical issues 'are part of the normative framework that is needed to assess the cultural acceptability of measures such as quarantine or selective vaccination of predefined risk groups'. 48 The exercise of state powers in terms of quarantine, isolation and detention during a public health emergency is likely to be particularly controversial in Western liberal democracies such as Australia. The extent to which the state can and should exercise its powers in this area has become increasingly relevant in public health, as is clear from debates over detention of tuberculosis patients, 49, 50 and from the use of quarantine during the SARS crisis. 51 Although comparable countries to Australia in Europe, the USA and Canada all have human rights charters or equivalents, which could provide procedural protections and safeguards for citizens in relation to quarantine and detention, Australia has yet to develop a Bill of Rights at the federal level. While Australian state and territory governments have begun enacting human rights legislation, 52 there is no comprehensive inclusion of human rights safeguards in the federal Quarantine Act, which raises issues about the mechanisms for ensuring procedural safeguards in the event of a pandemic. 53 Public health measures directed at implementing social distancing, quarantine or travel restrictions will not only infringe on individual liberties that are often taken for granted in Western societies, but are also likely to have a profound economic impact. As outlined above, estimates indicate that pandemic influenza will have a significant impact on the global economy. At local level, businesses may be closed or experience a reduction in their cash flow as public health measures are introduced or people stay home voluntarily. In such an environment, the economic cost to individuals and businesses may be significant, which in turn demands consideration of development of support systems and compensation systems for those affected. 54 In the USA, a great deal of work has been done on strengthening the public health laws, both generally and specifically for public health emergencies. The Turning Point Public Health Statute Modernization National Collaborative developed the Turning Point Model State Public Health Act. 55 In 2001, the Centre for Law and the Public's Health at Georgetown and Johns Hopkins Universities prepared a Model State Emergency Health Powers Act, setting out the powers for a state of public health emergency. The provisions of the earlier Model State Emergency Health Powers Act were adapted and included in the Turning Point Model Act. 56 Article V of the Turning Point Model Act deals with the powers of public health authorities, including the powers of quarantine and isolation. The Model Act provides that the principles to be applied in relation to quarantine and isolation include that they should be by the least restrictive means necessary to prevent the spread of disease (s 5-108[b](1)).

Standard-Times senior correspondent Steve Urbon describes such temporary quarantine powers, ""Civil rights activists in some cases have objected to people being rounded up, stripped and showered against their will. But Capt. Chmiel said local health authorities have 'certain powers to quarantine people.'"" 46 Political, economic, social, and ethical issues are always being raised by these strategic measures. Individual rights have often been trampled in the name of public good. The liberty of outwardly healthy persons from lower classes has frequently been violated by isolating or segregating persons suspected of being infected. Marginalized groups of different ethnicities and races have been stigmatized and discriminated against. Quarantine has a line of continuity from the time of plague to the influenza A pandemic in 2009. 46 During plague and cholera outbreaks, the fear of discrimination and mandatory quarantine pushed the lowest social class and minorities to flee from affected areas. This contributed to a more rapid and wider spread of the disease as this regularly occurred in towns affected by deadly disease outbreak. In this global world, the fear caused by mass media can spread the disease farther and faster, playing a larger role than in the past. Entire populations or segments of populations are at the risk of being stigmatized. In the light of new challenges posed by twenty-first century that can lead to the spread of infectious diseases, quarantine, along with other public health tools, retains importance for public health preparedness. Vigilant attention is required to avoid the intolerance and injustice while implementing these measures. Regular, transparent, and comprehensive communications should be used to gain the public trust. Valuable lessons from the past must lead to successful responses to public health emergencies. 46 ",27.34942191471463,12.132992567324955

Under the Act, the scope of quarantine is quite broad and covers a range of measures which aim to prevent or control 'the introduction, establishment or spread of diseases or pests that will or could cause significant damage to human beings, animals, plants, other aspects of the environment or economic activities'. 21 The Act defines a quarantinable disease as 'any disease, declared by the Governor-General, by proclamation to be a quarantinable disease'. 22 Masters of vessels are required to make a notification to a quarantine officer if prescribed symptoms or a prescribed disease is present on board, or if the master 'has reason to believe or suspect' that a quarantinable disease or pest is on board. 23 Individuals or vessels can be ordered into quarantine if they have a quarantinable or communicable disease, 24 and there are also powers to subject individuals to quarantine surveillance in certain circumstances. 25 The Governor-General can declare, by proclamation, that an epidemic exists or that there is the danger of an epidemic, and while the proclamation exists the Minister may give directions and take actions necessary to control, eradicate or remove the danger of the epidemic by way of quarantine or measures incidental to quarantine. 26, 27 The Quarantine Act 1908 is focused on preventing quarantinable diseases at ports of entry into Australia. While there is still benefit in this focus, it is inadequate for a world where international travel is now primarily by aircraft, and passengers can travel from one country to another before they even realize that they are sick. 33 As a Canadian report on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) noted, 'SARS has illustrated that we are constantly a short flight away from serious epidemics'. 28 While previous outbreaks of pandemic influenza have traditionally taken 6-8 months to spread globally, 29 aided by international air travel, pandemic influenza could spread globally within 3 months. 30 This potential for quarantinable diseases to emerge within domestic populations raises questions about the scope and applicability of quarantine laws in these circumstances. However, it has been argued that the broad scope of quarantine under the Act, the fact that quarantine powers are not restricted to ports of entry, and the ability for state laws to be over-ridden in emergencies suggests that the federal quarantine power could also have domestic application. 31 Domestically, state public health laws are also relevant to the notification and control of communicable diseases. In New South Wales, for example, SARS and avian influenza in humans are both notifiable diseases under the Public Health Act 1991. 32 State public health laws also contain a range of measures to enable health authorities to restrict the spread of disease, including powers to require medical testing and, in some cases, powers to restrict movement or to specify treatment of individuals who are regarded as posing a risk to public health. a The intersections between federal and state laws are relevant to Australia's responses to public health threats. As Howse has noted, 'in a public health emergency caused by the spread of an emerging infectious disease, Australia could need to rely on a patchwork of legislative measures to assist it to cope'. 34 In Australia and elsewhere, cross-jurisdictional and interagency cooperation are essential components in effective emergency responses. 35, 36 At an international level, the International Health Regulations (IHR) provide a framework for notification and response to infectious diseases. First introduced in 1951 as the International Sanitary Regulations, and renamed in 1969, the IHR required Member States to notify the World Health Organization of cases of plague, cholera and yellow fever. Prior to 1981, smallpox was also on the list of notifiable diseases. However, the IHR became increasingly irrelevant during the 20th Century with the re-emergence of old diseases such as tuberculosis, the emergence of new diseases such as SARS, and the threat of biological weapons. 37, 38 A revised version of the IHR was adopted in 2005 and took effect from 2007. The IHR (2005) seek to balance public health responses to disease against the needs of international traffic and trade, and rest on the principle that public health responses should not unnecessarily interfere with international traffic and trade. While the IHR (2005) has a list of specified diseases, including SARS and smallpox, which must be notified to the World Health Organization, the IHR (2005) also move beyond the specified-diseases approach and adopt a broader approach with focus on events which could constitute a public health emergency of international concern. Using a decision algorithm, countries are required to assess public health events in order to determine whether the event is a public health emergency of international concern. If the event is of international significance, notification to the World Health Organization is required.

What is clear is that public health rights and responsibilities for infectious disease are global as well as national. If we are to assess the adequacy of our legal frameworks for pandemic preparedness, we also need to assess the adequacy of our laws in terms of their suitability for meeting our international obligations. While developed countries of the world already have sophisticated public health systems, the capacity to meet their obligations under the IHR (2005), and the financial resources to develop national vaccine stockpiles, the developing countries of the world face a very different outlook. 57 As we consider the intersections of law and public health in the context of the shared global risks of an influenza pandemic, it is important to realize that pandemic preparedness must necessarily involve improved international cooperation and the sharing of expertise to assist in capacity building for public health and the regulatory frameworks surrounding it, as well as a renewed dialogue around international obligations to help the world's poorest and least healthy people. 58 Legal analysis must be a key part of our planning for pandemic influenza. It is essential that federal and state laws are harmonized so as to ensure their smooth functioning and to eliminate crossjurisdictional differences and uncertainties. Public health laws also play a key role in setting out the rights and responsibilities of individuals, communities and governments, providing transparency and accountability to the frameworks for decision-making. In contemporary Australian society where there are high expectations of individual rights and freedoms, and of the public health system, public health laws have an important role to play in ensuring that, as far as is possible, the public's health and the public's freedom are both balanced and protected.

Within the hospitals, there were a number of situations where health workers were criticized for minor breaches in safety procedures (Naylor et al., 2003) . The emphasis on the individual's responsibility to minimize others' exposure to risk throughout the SARS outbreak disregarded the reality that abilities and inclinations to control behaviours affecting exposures to risk were not homogeneous throughout the entire population. In this case, the individual was responsible for self-surveillance and identifying one's self as a 'risk' to the rest of the population and consequently adhering to quarantine measures and other directives identified by public health officials. This was encouraged by a number of surveillance measures including voluntary quarantine measures, and involved a clear stigmatization of those who were unwilling or unable to adhere to the safety protocol. The necessity for compliance to identified protocol was consistently emphasized throughout the SARS outbreak, with the media announcing failures to comply, public health workers regularly calling the homes of those in quarantine (sometimes once or twice per day) to ensure compliance, and in some cases the assignment of court directives forcing compliance (Basrur et al., 2004) . Those who were unwilling to comply were at times openly reprimanded by public health officials.

In some countries and remote locations, governments are struggling to provide basic animal and public health services due to a lack of resources. Consequently, there is a financial incentive for animal and public health services to combine their resources to either attain a critical mass that allows the establishment of some minimal infrastructure and service provision or to enhance the delivery of services by sharing cost-structures. The economic logic for integrating the delivery of animal and public health services at the operational level is obvious. Where similar structures in terms of logistics, personnel and materials are required by multiple programmes running concurrently, resources can be shared and in some cases saved by intersectoral partnering. Such cost-sharing initiatives serve to reduce the investment required in individual programmes, thus increasing the efficiency of a programme. (2) One Health risk mitigation programmes for endemic zoonotic diseases. Strategic higher level budgetary and resource allocation provides sufficient financing to control disease along the livestock value chain and leads to benefits in humans. This requires a proactive and preventative approach to disease management and recognition that disease can be managed further upstream, which requires significant shifts in resource allocation. Mitigation activities are introduced at multiple points encompassing multiple sectors or in one specific population only with financial contribution from the other sector. (3) One Health surveillance and response for early detection of emerging, reemerging or exotic zoonotic pathogens. Recent experiences with emerging zoonotic diseases have demonstrated their potential for major impact on human and animal populations, either directly due to morbidity and mortality in animals or humans, or indirectly due to response to disease, control measures, effect on trade or fear of disease and associated behaviour change. This has stimulated the creation of interdisciplinary partnerships for integrated surveillance and/or rapid response for future emerging disease threats Fig. 1 Overview of one health zoonotic disease risk mitigation programmes that have particular characteristics in terms of their economic efficiency (King et al. 2004 ). If such partnerships are well coordinated, a (re-)emerging or exotic disease may be detected early before it has spread widely, making it easier and less costly to contain. (4) One Health activities to prevent zoonotic disease emergence and establishment. The ultimate goal of zoonotic disease risk mitigation is to prevent emergence and subsequent establishment through One Health or Ecohealth approaches. Ecohealth takes One Health further by examining changes in the biological, physical, social and economic environments and relates these changes to human health. To prevent disease emergence, risky environments, contacts and behaviours must be modified in a way to decrease the probability of zoonotic disease emergence. This requires not only knowledge about factors for disease emergence, but also a willingness of service providers to invest resources in activities that have a highly uncertain outcome. If successful, the benefits from avoiding zoonotic disease emergence are potentially very large.",24.581934806819827,11.021776150654379

In 2003, the commission on intellectual property rights, innovation, and public health was created and located within the Director-General's office. The commission was welcomed as a political compromise between a proposal made by Kenya and Brazil for a global mechanism to provide financial support for research driven by public-health needs and industry support for market-driven solutions. The commission's work concluded in 2006 after several years of debate of the issues, although specific recommendations on ways forward were not agreed. Public-health advocates continue to call for WHO to take an assertive stance. As Rodrigo Estrela of Brazil's UN mission in Geneva states, ""Developed countries used to say IP rights were not an issue for WHO, but instead for WTO…WHO has work to do in this area, including supporting measures contained in TRIPS regarding flexibilities."" 27 The difficulty in the management of trade and health issues was evident in the revision process of the International Health Regulations. The revision was eventually achieved in 2005 after the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, focused attention of major financial contributors to global health. Although trade has remained central to the purpose of International Health Regulations, ""to prevent, protect against, control and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease in ways that are commensurate with and restricted to public health risks, and which avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade,"" 28 its measures now show the broader scope and scale of international trade. The International Health Regulations (2005) represent what can be achieved when shared goals exist between the trade and health communities. However, WHO faces much challenge when there is little commonality between these goals. As Ford and Piédagnel write, ""In the face of rising infectious diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, and the increasing marginalisation of health problems that do not affect the developed world, the importance of an international, independent organisation that is brave, aggressive, and vocal in its defence of global public health has never been more important."" 25",24.874379867418252,10.771101115083967

Identification of the causative agent is a first step to develop diagnostic tools. No diagnostic tools were available at that stage. Epidemiology of the disease such as mode of transmission, incubation period, infectious period and susceptible age group was also largely unknown except some information from Hanoi and Hong Kong. Such epidemiological information was critical to establish effective control and containment strategies. Clinical information such as clinical course, complications, case fatality rate and effective treatment was limited. Clinicians were forced to treat patients with a little knowledge about the disease. The disease was already spreading many countries while government officials, public health experts, laboratory scientists and clinicians in many countries were trying to find better ways to deal with this new disease. However, more information was accumulated in Guangdong, which was the initial epicentre of the outbreak. In fact, most of the effective containment strategies including surveillance with appropriate clinical case definitions, contract tracing, quarantine and isolation, and infection control measures in hospitals had already been established by mid March in Guangdong.

The optimal level can be influenced by two key factors, namely technical changes that lead to an improvement of disease control measures with no price changes and changes in the value of losses avoided relative to the costs of mitigation (Howe et al. 2013) . Consequently, when the value of unpriced negative externalities are taken into account, the total losses increase, which impacts on the optimal point of mitigation as illustrated in Fig. 45.4 . To be able to add the negative externalities, their value must be added to the total losses. Often their value cannot be directly deducted from prices in the conventional sense; instead they must be valued using indirect estimation methods, such as the DALY approach described above. Similarly, the value people place on the welfare of their companion and recreational animals can be estimated for example from how much they spend on veterinary services and medicines. Freedom from fear of infection is more problematical to quantify, but may be revealed by changes in people's normal consumption behaviour. Disease mitigation programmes at national level generally comprise two important components, namely surveillance and intervention. Surveillance is defined as the ""systematic, continuous or repeated, measurement, collection, collation, analysis, interpretation and timely dissemination of animal health and welfare related data from defined populations, essential for describing health hazard occurrence and to contribute to the planning, implementation, and evaluation of risk mitigation measures"" (based on Hoinville et al. 2013) . In other words, surveillance provides information for interventions directed at loss avoidance. Surveillance and intervention are often inextricably linked; they can be technical substitutes or complements (Howe et al. 2013) . The above conceptual basis to define the optimal level for mitigation can then be extended to identify the optimal combination of surveillance and intervention, namely the point where the marginal cost of surveillance and intervention (combined at least cost) equal the marginal benefit (= loss avoidance) on the expansion path (Howe et al. 2013 ). The expansion path (Fig. 45 .5) links all identical tangent points on iso-mitigation curves (along such a curve, the losses avoided are the same for all combinations of surveillance and intervention) with the gradient corresponding to the price ratio for surveillance and intervention. Each point of tangency is a least-cost combination for surveillance and intervention for the given price ratio. If the iso-cost line represents a budget constraint, the surveillance and intervention resources cannot be increased above this level. In Fig. 45 .5, the optimal location on budget line BB' would be at H for A3 avoided losses, although H' would also be a feasible, albeit inferior use of resources. If adding externalities such as negative effects of disease in people, the point H would no longer be optimal and a case would need to be made to increase investment to be able to reach point K (Häsler 2011; Howe et al. 2013) (45.5) .",23.021327684889336,9.493970835903818

Reporting incidences of disease outbreaks has been transformed from manual record keeping to instant worldwide internet communication ). Timely identification of infectious disease outbreaks is critical, both for effective initiation of public health interventions and control measures, as well as the timely alerting of government agencies and the general public at large. Surveillance capacity for such detection can be expensive, and many countries lack the public health infrastructure to identify outbreaks at their earliest stages. The Internet is revolutionizing how epidemic intelligence is activated, and it offers solutions to some of these challenges. Social media and freely available web-based sources of information may allow us to detect disease outbreaks earlier with reduced cost and increased reporting transparency (Wilson and Brownstein 2009 ). Furthermore, the search and exchange of health information on the Internet and social media has been viewed as an opportunity to improve public health surveillance (Velasco et al. 2014; Kass-Hout and Alhinnawi 2013) , and to monitor and predict emerging infectious diseases (Milinovich et al. 2014a, c) .

With extraordinary efforts, but without a vaccine or specific treatment, these outbreaks were controlled once the mode of transmission was established and measures taken. The experience of the year 2003 has taught us that although this new coronavirus is sufficiently transmissible to cause a very large epidemic, it is not so contagious as to be uncontrollable with good, basic public health measures.

Although other passengers from Central America may come to the U.S. via connecting flights, these travelers would be so low in number as to present minimal risk, and to expend resources to address them initially may divert from more effective efforts with the bulk of travelers arriving on direct flights at a few U.S. locations. Our analysis of 2009 flight data revealed that, by volume, the airports most affected by flights from Central This approach seems intuitive, but others have observed that this risk-based, targeted approach to bolstering surveillance and response capacities at key airports has been the exception rather than the norm, and that careful planning for public health response at key points of entry can be more effective than the usual first response of implementing travel restrictions. 13, 41, 47 In light of current global economic uncertainties and the overall decline of resources for public health in the U.S. and other countries, current planning and future point of entry interventions for global disease outbreaks must optimize the resources that are available, quickly and accurately assess risks and prioritize efforts to maximize impact of intervention efforts. 48 The ""node-to-node"" approach embodied in our model will allow public health officials to preserve resources for longer-term, community-based mitigation and prevention activities by targeting response to those points of entry likely to be affected earliest.",26.215327518212717,10.533680236299606

Data were analysed for thematic content guided by Lomas' policy decision-making framework as well as indicative coding using iterative methods. We interviewed 40 public health officials and scientific advisors across Canada and reviewed 76 pandemic policy documents.

Using an iterative consultative process, the authors developed a set of public health competencies relevant to family medicine and primary care.",21.77402524238875,10.146689220568712

If policy makers always had to wait for an exhaustive research study, many substantial threats to the public's health would persist. Evidence might come from analogy to other areas of law, such as the effectiveness of taxes on reducing sugary beverages, based on effectiveness of taxes in reducing tobacco use. Similarly, evidence of effectiveness for portion controls on sugary beverages might come from studies showing increased portion size, and its relationship to overweight or obesity. In such cases, policy makers need to make informed choices for law reform, in the absence of complete evidence. While using the best available (albeit incomplete) evidence at the time, evaluating the law's effect to ensure continuous quality improvement in health legislation is imperative. Even then, though, law makers might need to accept some uncertainty, such as where there is clear evidence that a suite of legal measures is effective at addressing a complex health threat (eg, obesity, or gun violence), but it is difficult to determine the specific contribution of any single intervention. For example, in tobacco control, a comprehensive approach using a host of demand and supply reduction measures has, in combination, substantially reduced smoking rates over time.",27.28291318491147,10.038327494748097

In the context of pandemic influenza, it is considered that social measures authorized by law will be at least as important as medical interventions. 3 Evidence from the 1918 influenza pandemic suggests that compulsory home isolation and quarantine were not particularly effective disease control measures because of the difficulty in diagnosing mild cases. Nor were such measures likely to be feasible beyond the initial cases. 4 However, compulsory interventions such as school closures, closure of public places and restriction of mass gatherings, along with disease surveillance and hygiene improvement, have proved effective both in influenza outbreaks and in the SARS epidemic. 5 International and EU instruments require states to undertake such measures, many of which will require a legal underpinning. The requirement of compliance with the revised IHR and the globalization of disease information and exchange have prompted many states to revise their public health laws. Other states, which had no public health legislation, have now enshrined public health laws in legislative form. These initiatives were long overdue. Across Europe, as elsewhere, national public health laws tended to be old, based on flawed science, and to predate contemporary understandings and protection of human rights. 6, 7 The allocation of responsibility for public health practice and the role of the state in regulating private behaviours have very different histories across Europe. 8 Not surprisingly, states have adopted very different positions on the issue of the extent to which constraints can be placed upon individuals for the public benefit. Earlier research on European national public health laws in relation to tuberculosis 9 enabled the identification of four different 'families' of public health legislative models in Europe. These were: authoritarian (the enforcement of a high number of compulsory control measures); moderate (the enforcement of predominantly compulsory control measures without recourse to prevention powers such as compulsory vaccination or population screening); preventive (where compulsory provisions were oriented towards preventive measures, including screening, medical examination and/or vaccination, rather than compulsory treatment or detention); and the laissez faire model, where few or no compulsory measures existed.",35.70000891926065,15.898847776301315

In times of economic strength and freedom from threats of war and disease, the commonality of EU states comes to the fore, and states are ready and willing to engage in joint enterprise. Where states are at threat, however, they tend to turn inward on themselves, and political and cultural differences emerge. In times of threat, states which have traditionally been strong on public intervention in private rights are unwilling to accede to the approaches of more liberal states. Traditionally, liberal states are reluctant to impose draconian measures, but at the same time may be unwilling to carry the public health burden of citizens from poorer states.

School buildings will be used as centres for vaccination and for accommodation of vulnerable persons. The new Code withdraws employment rights such as the right not to work in a situation of danger. Employees and public servants in France currently have the right to withdraw from their workplace if they reasonably believe that their work situation presents a grave and imminent danger to life and health, provided that they have alerted their employer to the danger and provided that their leaving does not create a new risk for others. Under the new Code, which only applies in the particular case of pandemic influenza, this right of withdrawal will not apply in circumstances where the employer has taken all foreseeable measures to reduce the risk of exposure to disease. The formulation of public health measures across Europe reflects cultural values and priorities. French law, for example, proposes the possible closure of schools in an epidemic, but the new French Public Health Code, recognizing the importance of education in France, provides very specific measures to protect the right to education of its children. The Code acknowledges the need for school closures because children are more susceptible to the influenza virus than adults. However, the Code requires that during a school closure, every effort must be made to continue educational provision via the Internet, radio and television, and sets out detailed provisions on ways in which education might be continued throughout the pandemic.",26.8629990528189,11.91899501865675

The IHR are framed around the assumption that disease is a security issue. 34 However, the danger of subsuming disease control within foreign and national security is that the focus is on security rather than on health. Wider national and international interests may not always coincide with public health. Global public health may not always coincide with the security concerns of individual states, particularly more powerful states. McInnes and Lee note that policy responses to the SARS epidemic elicited a 'garrison mentality' whereby strict border controls and control of movement of persons became central to disease containment, with consequences for the movement of persons, goods and services. 35 It has been widely argued that the promotion and protection of human rights is inextricably linked to the promotion and protection of public health, and that lack of respect for the rights and dignity of persons or groups of persons can increase their vulnerability to disease contagion. 36, 37 The importance of human rights to health has been acknowledged in the revised IHR Article 3, which requires that the IHR be implemented with full respect for the dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms of persons. As Mann argues, '.the human rights framework is indispensable both for analyzing the central societal issues which must be confronted and for guiding the direction of societal transformation needed to promote and protect health.' 38 States have a significant number of non-medical tools at their disposal in a disease pandemic, and public health law reform has been undertaken with pandemic influenza in mind. Public health legislation around the world now authorizes a wide range of social distancing powers and compulsory screening, examination and treatment measures. In addition, much public health legislation provides for the possibility of some limited emergency measures. Nevertheless, some European states have proposed the use of emergency powers legislation to provide exceptional powers in the case of a pandemic; powers which will inevitably constrain the rights of individuals. The evidence base for the need for such exceptional powers has yet to be established, and in the absence of such evidence, there is concern that too heavy a hand will result in long-term harm to public trust in the exercise of population-based disease prevention strategies.",27.225486950924818,10.944886812466173

On 29 April, for example, the Chinese Prime Minister announced measures to have SARS 'brought under control'. Framing responses to SARS in a discourse of bureaucratic control drew on a long tradition in which public health as 'medical police' is a function of the civil state similar to the other kinds of 'policing' it carries out (Jordanova, 1980; Porter, 1999) . Ideas of police ran throughout the limited repertoire of traditional public health techniques used to halt SARS. Quarantines of the infected and their contacts, and surveillance of travellers were the two most important methods used against SARS, with travel bans imposed by some countries. 4 The relationship to policing was clear: governments promised 'to hold victims', 'detain SARS sufferers', identify 'those suspected of harbouring the virus'.

The SARS epidemic fuelled the creation and deployment of such systems in Canada and internationally. However, the usability and effectiveness of such systems will need to be considered and optimized for them to achieve their promise. This includes consideration of providing the most effective user interfaces for entering new data (e.g. from points of entry in a country, offices, and clinical settings across regions or countries), retrieving patient and case data, and also for providing effective and timely alerting about potential epidemics, disease spread and counter measures. To address these challenges, methods from usability engineering [50] are beginning to be applied throughout the systems development life cycle of health surveillance systems to ensure their design and deployment are effective and such systems lead to adoption and proper use when epidemics and public health emergencies arise. This has included usability inspection of the user interfaces of such systems, usability testing involving observing representative users of such systems (e.g. public health officers, clinicians, managers etc.) and clinical simulations, where systems are tested under simulated conditions and environments (e.g. simulations of public health emergencies) [31] .

An influenza epidemic could, on a worst case scenario, last for years, which would potentially allow the operation of emergency powers that derogate from human rights protections for a considerable period of time. There is a danger that laws made in the form of emergency regulations might, if in force for long enough, become embedded in the legal system and so constitute a permanent assault on liberties which had previously been achieved, as might be suggested of terrorism legislation in the UK. 29 Emergency powers in the context of disease, based as they are on responses to war and catastrophes, tend to operate in such a way that persons affected with disease are characterized as the enemy. They propose that in public health emergencies, there must be a trade-off between the protection of civil rights and effective public health interventions. However, the ideals of democracy, individual rights, legitimacy, accountability and the rule of law suggest that even in times of acute danger, government should be limited in the activities that it can pursue and the powers that it can exercise. As Gostin points out in the context of the US Model State Emergency Health Powers Act, 30 this is not to say that individual rights should always trump public health, but that individual rights should never be infringed 'unnecessarily, arbitrarily or brutally'. 31 Nevertheless, there has been significant criticism of the US legislation, and concern that measures proposed in the Act are sufficiently dangerous as to 'undermine.constitutional values'. 32 While emergency powers might provide short-term solutions to serious threats, they could also do long-term harm to public trust in public health services, and encourage health behaviours which are counterproductive to the public health.",26.746464744736365,9.341842257415616

Immigrant populations have long been targeted as carriers of disease, and in relation to diseases such as drug-resistant tuberculosis, increasing incidence in the Western world is often attributed to persons entering from states with high tuberculosis rates. 40 Much contemporary public health policy has rejected the 'fortress' approach to disease control in favour of seeing the public health mandate as imposing duties upon all members of a society or population, 18 or indeed duties of global health protection.

(20) modeled the control of communicable diseases according to the diseases' characteristics of infectiousness during the incubation period and in asymptomatic infections. According to this model, public health measures are likely to be effective if persons are infectious only when symptomatic, particularly if infectivity peaks after the onset of symptoms. This means that infected persons are not infectious during the incubation period or during asymptomatic infection. During SARS virus infection, peak viremia (and assumed infectivity) occurs 10 days after symptom onset (28) , and this timing coincides with the severity of symptoms. Persons with asymptomatic infection and persons in the incubation period do not appear to be infectious (27, 28) . Therefore if case-patients are isolated within 2-3 days of infection, transmission will be limited (29) . If contacts are quarantined until beyond the incubation period, this will also limit further transmission. High fever (>38°C) is a common symptom among persons seeking medical care for SARS, but case-patients with fever of <38°C or who were afebrile have been described and have been implicated in the transmission of SARS in a health care setting (30) (31) (32) (33) . This information suggests that active case finding, isolation, strict infection control, and contact tracing will limit the spread of SARS, and modeling suggests that the combination of these measures would be the most effective control strategy (20, 29) . This information also suggests that border measures that involve effective case detection (i.e., a high proportion of cases detected), especially if associated with opportunities for effective contact tracing (i.e., contacts quarantined within 2 days of case-patient contact), could be useful strategies for delaying the entry of SARS into a country and limiting opportunities for the virus to spread.

To reach these goals in terms of public health, ranking from disease eradication to elimination and control, the availability of a safe and efficacious vaccine is obviously essential. However, critical factors are also the definition of the medical need of any given vaccine in terms of cost/benefit, the prospected advantage in relation to the existing preventive or therapeutic measures, the correct identification of the target population to vaccinate. The capability of the public health system to implement an effective vaccination policy must also be carefully considered. This includes, among others, the capacity to persuade healthy subjects or their parents or guardians in case of pediatric vaccines, of the personal and societal advantages of being vaccinated, weighting the minimal though actual risk of an adverse event against all future benefits of avoiding the diseases and its transmission to neighbours. Finally, of utmost importance is also establishing whether the disease could be contrasted not only with a preventive vaccination but also with the use of a therapeutic vaccine, i.e. a vaccine formulation that could be used in the ill subject.

Second, the government must have clearly identifi ed control measures that the public can take prior to and during a bird fl u outbreak, and have a strategy for communicating these measures in an effective manner to the public. Third, the government will need to convince persons that they need to comply with all of the recommended control measures, not just those that they personally believe are important. Fourth, the government must have an effective communication strategy directed at medical personnel who are likely to encounter persons concerned about bird fl u. This is important as in the SARS outbreak medical personnel were found to have critical gaps in their knowledge (Deng et al. 2006 ) . Fifth, the communication strategy should try to create a sense of social responsibility and empathy amongst the population as this may increase the likelihood that they will comply with all the recommended control measures (Nickell et al. 2004 ) and support others facing multiple challenges.

In all cases, a prompt public health response is critical to containing a SARS outbreak. This is the case particularly for strategies that do not reduce R to below 1, as the possibility of stochastic fadeout (see figure 2b ) falls drastically if the disease has time to spread beyond the initial few cases. We also considered the impact of implementation delays on the most effective, combined strategy from figure 3a, in scenarios where R 0 equals 2, 3 and 4 (figure 3c). Again, timing is critical, especially for the mosttransmissible case when the effective R after control is greater than 1. In all cases in figure 3b,c, a window of opportunity exists at the beginning of a SARS epidemic when a given control strategy has the greatest chance of success. This critical period is lengthened by more effective control strategies, lower-transmission settings, and, potentially, by a smaller hospital pool (see electronic Appendix A). As implementation is delayed, the probability of containing the epidemic is reduced to levels obtained in the absence of control; for instance if R 0 = 3, the weaker strategies lose their possible impact on containment within a few weeks, and even the highly effective combined strategy must be implemented within two months to show any gains over doing nothing. Note that this result pertains strictly to epidemic containment (as we define it), and is oriented toward minimizing overall morbidity and mortality. We emphasize that implementation of stringent control measures is all the more essential if containment has already been lost and a full-scale epidemic is in progress.",28.053474534663494,10.355967102139717

The 1933 Sanitary Convention on Aerial Navigation established the principles and standards on which (inter)national public health measures should be based and, as we reveal above, involved practices that were targeted at both human passengers and at the non-human cargoes that were transported by air. Importantly, the 1933 convention sought to overcome the problem of where such micro-practices of public health should occur. As with other modes of transport, most notably rail travel, the issue was whether public health surveillance should be implemented on departure or arrival; that is at or beyond the sovereign borders of a nation. As we note, one solution was to pass some of the responsibility for implementing public health measures on to the airlines and their passengers. After all, it was the commercial airlines that were required to carry out disinsection, and it was the passengers who were responsible for ensuring that they carried valid documentation detailing the inoculations they had received prior to travel.

The IOM outlined several factors contributing to microbial spread, which officials at IOM, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization, and other health agencies are attempting to halt by limiting antimicrobial use, by pouring money into global health funds, by establishing international surveillance networks and, in severe instances, by limiting travel. 10",29.685318274069793,10.099735149710515

A highly trained unit, belonging to the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) laboratory services, that responds to criminal acts and incidents involving hazardous materials. The unit also develops technical proficiency and readiness for crime scene and evidence-related operations in cases involving chemical, biological, and radiological materials and wastes and trains US and international law enforcement in these skills. It also provides site safety oversight of FBI personnel operating in other high-hazard crime scenes, including collapsed structures and confined spaces. • Laboratory Response Network (LRN). A national network of local, state, and federal public health, food testing, veterinary diagnostic, and environmental testing laboratories that provide the laboratory infrastructure and capacity to respond to biological and chemical terrorism and other public health emergencies. The more than 150 laboratories that make up the LRN are affiliated with federal agencies, military installations, international partners, and state and local public health departments. • Mass prophylaxis. Medical care or measures provided to a large percentage of a population to prevent or protect them from disease. The best example of this is the smallpox eradication campaign that rid the world of one of the worst human diseases in 1980. As a program, mass prophylaxis can be a mitigation measure, a preparedness initiative, or a postevent response function. • Mitigation.

By the end of the SARS outbreak, 211 945 people, 0·92% of the total population in Taiwan, who either had contact with a SARS patient or had returned from a SARS-affected area, were quarantined for 10-14 days. 21 Only 133 (0·06%) of the quarantined were later reported as probable or suspected SARS cases. Furthermore, among the limited number of confirmed SARS patients who acquired SARS infection outside of the hospital settings in Taiwan, SARS transmission to family members did not occur until day 3 of the onset of the fever (figure 5). After a review of the local and international epidemiological data that showed the infectivity of SARS patients began only after the onset of fever (figure 3), the quarantine policy was ultimately replaced by implementing stringent fever monitoring of the high-risk group and fever surveillance at the ports of entry. 17, 22 Further revision of the public-health code has been undertaken to accommodate the complex issues concerning the protection of rights and freedom of individuals in the context of the overall well-being of the public. In SARS patients, the onset of symptoms precedes the onset of infectiousness (figure 3), which supports the effectiveness of quarantine and fever surveillance. In the case of influenza A infection, however, the infectivity may precede the onset of illness. Thus, in the event of pandemic influenza, quarantine would not be an effective control measure. Rather, the preparation for the influenza pandemic is now focusing on stockpiling of effective antiviral drugs as well as the strengthening of the influenza vaccination programme.

First, under Article 43.2, countries cannot implement additional health measures exclusively as a precaution but must rather ground their decision making in ""scientific principles"", ""scientific evidence"", and ""advice from WHO"". 1 Many of the travel restrictions being implemented during the COVID-19 outbreak are not supported by science or WHO. Travel restrictions for these kinds of viruses have been challenged by public health researchers, [4] [5] [6] and WHO has advised against travel restrictions, arguing they cause more harm than good. 7, 8 Second, under Article 43.1 any additional health measures implemented by countries ""shall not be more restrictive of international traffic and not more invasive or intrusive to persons than reasonably available alternatives"". 1 In this case, even if travel restrictions did work, there are so many other more effective measures that countries can take to protect their citizens. WHO has issued COVID-19 technical guidance on several such measures, including risk communication, surveillance, patient management, and screening at ports of entry and exit. 9 Third, and most importantly, Article 3.1 strictly requires all additional health measures to be implemented ""with full respect for the dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms of persons"", 1 which in turn must reflect the international law principles of necessity, legitimacy, and proportionality that govern limitations to and derogations from rights and freedoms. 10 Under no circumstances should public health or foreign policy decisions be based on the racism and xenophobia that are now being directed at Chinese people and those of Asian descent. 11 Many of the travel restrictions implemented by dozens of countries during the COVID-19 outbreak are therefore violations of the IHR. 12 Yet, perhaps even more troubling, is that at least two-thirds of these countries have not reported their additional health measures to WHO, 12 response to public health emergencies and prevents countries from holding each other accountable for their obligations under the IHR. Some countries argue that they would rather be safe than sorry. But evidence belies the claim that illegal travel restrictions make countries safer. [4] [5] [6] In the short term, travel restrictions prevent supplies from getting into affected areas, slow down the international public health response, stigmatise entire populations, and disproportionately harm the most vulnerable among us. In the longer term, countries selecting which international laws to follow encourages other countries to do the same, which in turn undermines the broader rules-based world order. Effective global governance is not possible when countries cannot depend on each other to comply with international agreements. 13 Of course, the IHR is far from perfect. For example, the IHR only governs countries, not corporations and other non-governmental actors. Thus, some countries are finding themselves with de-facto travel restrictions when airlines stop flying to places affected by COVID-19.",22.946368566617185,10.226567268384182

However, lasting behaviour change is a result of decisions made at the individual level. To facilitate voluntary behaviour change a campaign must appeal to the values and cost-benefit evaluation of each audience group targeted, emphasising near-term salient benefits rather than long-term, abstract, collective benefits. Likewise, veterinary public health messages must be customised in such a way that they are interesting, relevant and captivating to their audience. Messages should be clear, easy to understand and easy to act on. Unless it is easy for people to remember how, when and what to do it is unlikely that a veterinary public health communication campaign will be successful. Social marketing techniques applied to emerging zoonosis communication campaigns have been shown to be effective in crafting health messages that 'speak' to target audiences [6] . Successful communication campaigns are based on systematic planning efforts and on objectives that are attainable, measurable, clear and time-bound. Successful campaigns develop and deliver health messages that are tailored to specific target audiences. Disseminating generic veterinary public health messages widely and increasing knowledge about certain emerging zoonoses issues and healthy behaviours have been shown to be less effective than more targeted efforts. Audience-centred health communication efforts with a consumer perspective are much more effective in motivating target audiences to change their behaviour. This requires designing and delivering messages that are adapted to the needs, perceptions, preferences and situations of the intended audiences rather than the needs and goals of the message designers or institutions. Communicators in veterinary public health practice therefore need to know as much as possible about their target audience(s) in order to stimulate voluntary behaviour change [7] .",22.2248525482971,9.955692656029807

In fi nancial terms, funding from diff erent partners is harmonised under one fi nancing plan with clear funding needs and gaps-another model for other programmes. Furthermore, the failure to control tuberculosis in the past-when tuberculosis services were not free-and the success in tuberculosis control over the past few yearswhen tuberculosis services have been free-have provided policymakers with arguments to increase funding for public health from the government. With regard to management, several features of DOTS-eg, directly observed therapy to manage treatment of patients and the management of logistics and drugs-are now used to tackle HIV/AIDS and in other public-health programmes. Furthermore, although many public-health workers are being trained to implement DOTS, setbacks caused by inadequate numbers of trained workers have shown governmental leaders the importance of such resources in public health, and thus they have increased planning for them. In terms of information systems, the tuberculosis programme's quarterly recording and reporting system has long been a model for other disease control programmes. With the new internet-based reporting system for communicable diseases, the tuberculosis programme leads the way in the use of information to improve public-health outcomes.

The Chinese social networking sites' timeliness of reporting are significantly better compared to international mainstream media in English, official websites of the central Chinese government and WHO. Information was released by the local news agencies on the social networking site in the local language before any reports in the conventional news websites or government websites. The information was subsequently amplified by the social networking sites through re-posting of the original report. This allowed the international community greater access to more detailed and timely information compared to that released at the central government level to the international media. The central Chinese government may have allowed the provincial/municipal health authorities to release information on new cases when available to ensure transparency and timeliness of public communications. The access to such timely, crowd-sourced information on infected cases greatly facilitated the understanding of the epidemiology of an unknown disease, which is key in developing effective prevention and control measures. public health practitioners, social media surveillance could provide early warning for unusual public health events in a foreign country and serve as an additional source of epidemiological intelligence to complement conventional surveillance tools.

This should be accomplished through professional education by integrating elements of public health and medicine into each other's curriculum. The good news is that we have already seen some progress in this arena. Schools offering combined MD-MPH degrees have more than doubled since 1994, and now total 75. 15 This has been accompanied by an increase in the numbers of participating students. 15 However, medical school curricula are already overcrowded due to required content and the explosion of scientific knowledge; for that reason, it is important to integrate public health concepts into existing courses. Several frameworks exist for accomplishing this within the current educational milieu. For instance, the Association of American Medical Colleges has made specific recommendations to emphasize public health principles regarding bioterrorism in medical schools. 16 The Association of Teachers of Preventive Medicine has developed an inventory of core competencies for disease prevention and health promotion that underscore critical public health concepts within medical education. 17 Building on these efforts, recent work has been completed to extend clinical prevention concepts across health professional education as part of the Healthy People 2010 planning. 18 Conversely, the same holds true for imbedding medical concepts into training programs in public health, as was recently recommended by the Institute of Medicine. 19 This is likely to be challenging, given the broad spectrum of graduate public health education and the multiple and divergent backgrounds of the student population. Nonetheless, despite its inherent complexity, this should be a high-priority challenge for the Association of Schools of Public Health and the Council on Linkages Between Academia and Public Health Practice. Cross-referencing the work of the Healthy People Curriculum Task Force for comparison within public health curricula is a logical starting point.

Students will then recognise public health issues when they arise, placing them in a fuller and familiar context of similar issues they have studied. They will appreciate more fully the reasons for and implications of the particular doctrines they are mastering'. 26 To cite an obvious example, the leading English case on the tort of negligence, Donoghue v Stevenson, emerged in a public health context (that would now be categorized as food safety). Lord Atkin described the issue of whether the manufacturer owed a duty of care to the consumer as 'important. because of its bearing on public health'. 30 Similarly, the common law of nuisance is also interwoven with public health concerns, 5 and the doctrine of nuisance was employed as the legal mechanism for control of disease in public health legislation, much of which, in turn, has been largely subsumed within modern environmental law. Familiarity with public health thus provides a valuable basis for building comprehension of foundational legal tenets, although it may be stretching the point to claim that there exists 'no less a role for public health law than as a unifying, syncretic theme for law school education'. 29 In sum, the benefits of a module in public health law extend well beyond the vocational. While the growing salience of law to public health policy requires that students of public health develop an understanding of legal processes and rules which can be applied to practical situations, the teaching of legal principle also serves a broader pedagogical purpose by exposing such students to a particular mode of analytical reasoning and fostering a deeper understanding of societal ordering. Similarly, the educational experience of students of law will be enhanced by the interdisciplinarity and social context which public health brings, offering 'a vantage point and a set of methodologies that can enrich a lawyer's ability to comprehend the world and practice law effectively'. 9",23.554687970221032,9.009340338328478

The consideration that should accord severe infectious diseases the top priority in emergency public health events was inadequate. Nowadays, infectious diseasesespecially acute and severe ones transmitted via respiratory and intestinal tractsmay appear as either newly emerged infectious diseases or weapons in biological terrorism. Since such diseases usually emerge in an explosive and indiscriminate manner and have wide spread impact, they often lead to panic, social disorder, and economic trauma. Historically, severe epidemics had sometime changed war outcomes, wreaked social disorder, and altered political regimes. Considering these grave potential impacts, the establishment of a response system to severe infectious diseases should be given significant priority in the response system of sudden public health incidents. Acute and severe viral infectious diseases generally do not have specific and effective prevention and treatment measures; therefore, emergency response, prevention, and control need to be given the top priority. 2. The most significant revelation from the SARS outbreaks is that the response system to emergency public health events is inadequate. In the epidemics, weaknesses in China's command system, information system, prevention and treatment teams, and corresponding material storages were completely exposed. For the past two decades, the public health service in China has lagged behind, primarily due to inadequate funding. To solve these problems is an essential step for China to build a harmonious modern society with long-term lasting and equilibrating economic development. The establishment of China's CDCcentered nationwide laboratory monitor network, epidemic information network, emergency teams, and material storage is an essential component in building up the national response to public health emergencies. 3. No consummate public reporting institution of epidemic is observed. In the beginning of the epidemic, the policy of ""strict inward while loose outward"" concerning SARS blocked the epidemic information. The mystery of epidemic disease hovered among the public. Information was not transparent and blocked between related CDCs and researchers, even among departments of government including China and international organizations. This delayed the timely control of the epidemic and even initiated a confidence crisis among the public. It is essential to develop a complete system to announce and report epidemics -a scientific system to analyze and explain epidemics so that various departments can coordinate control of the epidemic and so that the public can correctly understand the epidemic and positively support the measures that the government takes to contain the epidemic.

Some of these diseases are of national public health interest or are of international trade importance requiring immediate reporting through specific official public health channels and to the World Organisation for Animal Health, one of the three sisters of the World Trade Organization. Reportable diseases of animals are those with the potential to cause epidemics or pandemics that cause serious disease in people, as is the case of the severe acute respiratory syndrome known as SARS, the H5N1 (pathogenic avian), and H1N1 influenza virus (known as swine influenza) (Gauthier-Clerc et al., 2007; Girad et al., 2010) .

Determining the public health penetration of these programs in slums has been highlighted as a need (Unger and Riley, 2007) . Risk communication in a crisis situation involving the livestock population in a slum may require additional resources and targeted programming.

Today, the core business of public health falls into disease prevention and control, public health emergency response, epidemic reporting and management of health-related information, surveillance of and intervention against health hazards, laboratory testing and evaluation, health education and health promotion, technical management, and applied research guidance. Undergraduate education in public health, which takes place in medical schools, covers areas including epidemiology, biostatistics, environmental health, occupational health and safety, food hygiene, school health, health toxicology and radiation protection. In recent years, medical sociology, maternal and child health, health management and policies, health economics, health inspections and their roles within healthcare services have been gradually added to the curriculum of most schools. There has also been an increase in masters courses in public health. Currently, most graduates in public health work in centres for disease prevention and control at various levels, and some work in health inspection institutions which have functions of inspecting and managing goods and services related to health. From discussions at the workshop, 10 significant problems facing public health education in China were identified: Goals for public health education and training at the national level have not been clearly defined; Public health education is not seen as independent of the traditional medical education system, and the unique characteristics of public health education are not recognized and respected; In schools of public health, there is a lack of expertise in health economics, health management, health policy, and health-related law and regulations; It is difficult to attract high-quality students to public health as compared with clinical medicine; The importance of public health education as part of the public health system has not been well recognized by the Government; Curriculum development has not kept up with the modern developments in public health; Teaching has not kept up with the new technology and teaching contents; Structure of teaching faculty has not kept up with the requirements of education reform; Teaching materials have not kept up with the rapid growth of scientific evidence and with the change in health needs; and Links across universities (e.g. with social science faculties) are poor.",25.50166407519933,10.157976090441391

This question is one faced by many countries. The issue of who to include within educational strategies for public health is complicated. In general, the public health workforce in mainland China is considered to be primarily those working in centres for disease control and protection, many of whom are trained within the existing system and are medical doctors. However, the challenges of the healthcare reforms require a broader definition of public health which is in line with the ecological model for determinants of health, as well as being responsive to the increasing focus on patient-centred care.

Keeping the public healthy requires not only a well-educated public health workforce but also much better educated citizens. The Institute of Medicine has recommended that all university undergraduates should have access to education in public health, and that public health education should be introduced in high schools. The report 22 sets out basic competencies and curricula. This trend to a broader liberal education is being followed in Hong Kong, where the university curriculum is being extended to 4 years along the lines of the US and mainland Chinese model. Not only has a new BSc now been introduced at university level, 23 but public health has been added into the curriculum for high school students as part of liberal studies for all students, and a further module on health and social care management is also being taught in years 4-6 in middle school. 24 In the USA, there is a growing demand for public health undergraduate courses, and the Association of Schools of Public Health is in the process of devising undergraduate public health competencies. The Asia-Pacific Academic Consortium of Public Health is working to improve public health through the delivery of education, research and public health programmes by member institutions, and actively supports increasing undergraduate public health opportunities, stressing that public health education is more urgent for its region than the rest of the world and that a better system needs to be built, based on developments and experiments already occurring in other universities and other countries and regions. 25 ",24.100016739970393,9.818787676545064

Hong Kong has a less structured but similar approach to specialist training (i.e. 5-year postgraduate training) which is competency based. However, in Hong Kong, public health specialists are medically trained, having qualified as physicians through a training programme common to all doctors. In the UK, where public health is also a postgraduate specialty, there are parallel pathways for clinicians and non-clinical (multidisciplinary) specialists. In the USA, where there is more reliance on schools of public health, and Masters of Public Health degrees and public health qualifications are multidisciplinary, new systems of assessing professional competence are being introduced. 21 The role of undergraduate non-medical public health In many countries, the multidisciplinary nature of public health is well recognized; in others, such as the UK, there is a marked shift away from the medical model with explicit recognition of the multidisciplinary basis of specialist public health training and practice.

Some diseases, such as those restricted to high elevations or latitudes or that prefer cooler temperatures, might experience range contractions with climate change (Categories 1, 2). For example, several fungal entomopathogens of insects are expected to decline [6] (Category 1). Similarly, white pine blister rust, Cronartium ribicola, which costs more to control than any other conifer disease, is expected to decrease if conditions get warmer and drier [70] (Category 2). Indeed, many pests of crops are expected to decrease under warmer and drier conditions [70] . Category 3 diseases show limited direct responses to climate and have good options for control. An example is measles, which is directly transmitted and has a highly effective vaccine. Category 4 diseases are also relatively insensitive to direct effects of climate change, but have less effective mitigation measures.

Many basic public health measures achieved decades ago in developed countries are urgently needed, highly appropriate, extremely cost-effective, and eminently attainable in LMICs today. Further according to Frieden and Henning (2009) , a progress of public health in developing countries is possible but will require sufficient funding and human resources; improved physical infrastructure and information systems; effective program implementation and regulatory capacity; and, most importantly, political will at the highest levels of government. Most change is due to money. For instance, robotics, automation, and technicians are widely used to save money. In the hospital setting, unit dose, unit-of-use, etc. are done to save cost.

To trace the tendency of the effective reproduction number can give some practical clues to control the epidemic. The variation of the effective reproduction number R t in the epidemic is shown in Fig. 1(c) . At the beginning of the curve (before Apr. 24), R t = R 0~2 .16. This indicates that there were not effective control measures and the disease spread rapidly. The value of R t drops drastically since Apr. 30, after the anti-SARS measures started to take effects. On May 5, R t dropped down to less than 1, the self-sustained threshold of the epidemic. This means that the disease has been subdued since then. Therefore, if the present control measures are still kept in force, the disease will be put under control in mid-June, as shown in Fig. 1(a) . Till then, the cumulative number of SARS cases will reach about 2530. However, if the effective control measures are let up, the epidemic curve would present a tail lasting a long time even bounce.

It is clear that the basic reproduction number in the two areas ranges from 2 to 3, but the response delay (characterized by I c ) and the two indexes m and q are different, reflecting the difference in control measures in the two areas. Now, we intend to understand the mechanism governing the transmission and control of SARS. We characterize an epidemic curve with the total cumulative number of patients I * and the epidemic lasting time T. It is found that the parameters I c , m, and q are the corresponding indicators of the effectiveness of control measures. Fig. 2(a) illustrates the effects of I c on the total number of SARS cases I * and the lasting time of the epidemic T. Obviously, I * is directly proportional to I c , which is reasonable because the CT model can be rescaled with I c . In addition, the epidemic lasting time increases with I c . The curves in Fig. 2(a) suggest that the timeliness of the control measures, i.e. smaller I c , leads to a shorter, smallerscaled, and less intense epidemic.",24.22437215355004,10.48387426910239

Significant medical school debt can drive new physicians away from the ID specialty and public health. Targeted loan repayment opportunities would allow more physicians to pursue these critical career paths. In July 2018, in a move supported by IDSA, the US House of Representative's Energy and Commerce Committee passed legislation that would authorize the CDC to provide loan repayment for those who serve in the Epidemic Intelligence Services (EIS). More than 85% of EIS officers continue serving in public health roles, and this proposal would significantly help make this career path more financially feasible for physicians. Such loan forgiveness opportunities could also be broadened to support ID physicians who work in public health at the federal, state, or local level and face similar challenges around compensation and medical student debt. Establish financial compensation for ID physicians who work in public service (eg, local, state, and federal public health agencies) or who do ID work that provides broader public health benefits (infection control and antimicrobial stewardship). Physicians who perform infection control and antimicrobial stewardship work should be compensated for these activities. As part of hospital accreditation, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) mandates that every participating facility have an active infection control program [37] . States could attach an accreditation process to such mandates that would formally document ID clinicians who oversee hospital infection control and antimicrobial stewardship committees, with loan forgiveness or other financial incentives attached to this accreditation. Ensure that ID physician compensation reflects public health value added. As a cognitive specialty, many of the clinical services ID physicians provide are billed under Evaluation and Management codes, which have not been reevaluated in more than 20 years. The CMS should update these codes to reflect the increasingly complex care provided in inpatient and outpatient settings. Public and private payers, healthcare systems, and hospitals should also provide appropriate compensation and protected time for nonclinical services that are crucial to public health, including infection prevention and control, antimicrobial stewardship, and bioemergency preparedness and response.

Identified interventions may vary depending on the type of risk assessment performed. Thus, food chain risk assessments provide more information on interventions targeted to processing/consumer practices. Epidemiological risk assessments facilitate interventions that can be deduced from studies about risk factors, implicated vehicles in outbreaks and high-risk product-pathogen combinations. A summary of the most important interventions for the control of viruses in the food chain could be setting adequate criteria for decimal reduction for viruses (may not be suitable for all foods) e.g. achieving a core temperature of 85-90°C for at least 1.5 min has been considered a virucidal treatment (CAC, 2012). Implementing raw material/food production controls (oysters, berries, leafy greens) e.g. harvesting oysters and other shellfish from non-contaminated areas, establishing an acceptable limit for NoV in oysters to be harvested and placed in the market, and testing of products for compliance to this acceptable limit (EFSA, 2012) are examples of theses controls. Appropriate farm to fork implementation of food safety management systems (GAP, GHP, GMP) accompanied by suitable validation and verification procedures are primary mitigation options for reducing risk of NoV in berries and leafy greens (EFSA 2014a, EFSA 2014b).

The Capacity Review Commission (CRC), which was tasked by the province with reviewing the organization and capacity of local health units, also advocated for autonomous health units. It recommended that “public health units should be governed by autonomous, locally based boards of health. These boards should focus primarily on the delivery of public health programs and services” (CRC 2006: 30).

But the provincial contribution to public health spending, which is based on what the minister considers appropriate, has varied considerably in recent years (Pasut 2007). Before 1997, the province funded 75% of the mandatory program budgets for most boards of health and municipalities funded the remaining 25%. In 1996, the Social Services Sub-Panel of the Ontario Who Does What? panel concluded that the province has the primary interest in public health and that public health services should be delivered by provincially appointed and funded boards of health (Crombie and Hopcroft 1996). However, this recommendation was never implemented. Instead, public health and many social services were downloaded to municipalities in 1997, with the province assuming more responsibility for education (see Graham and Phillips 1998). This total download of public health lasted until 1999, when the province moved to a 50/50 funding formula (Campbell 2004). The 50/50 formula stayed in place until 2004. In 2005, the province began to phase in a return to its previous mandatory program contribution level of 75%. This increase in provincial funding was in response to the fallout from two public health emergencies – the Escherichia coli outbreak in Walkerton in 2000 and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 – and was intended to increase the capacity of the public health system. The province's original plan was to reach the 75/25 funding split within three years, but it has since capped its annual increases.

This study presents a new deterministic model for assessing the population-level impact of the implementation of quarantine on the control of the 2014 Ebola outbreaks in West Africa. The model was fitted using data relevant to the EVD dynamics in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Some of the notable features of the model include the explicit modeling of quarantine of both susceptible and infected individuals (in line with the approach by Lipsitch et al. (Lipsitch et al., 2003)) and the assumption that quarantine is imperfect (so that disease transmission can occur during quarantine). Detailed theoretical analysis of a special case of the model, in the absence of quarantine and with constant total population, was carried out. The analysis revealed that the disease-free equilibrium of the resulting quarantine-free model is globally-asymptotically stable whenever a certain epidemiological quantity (the basic reproduction number of the model, denoted by R0) is less than unity. The epidemiological implication of this result is that, in the absence of quarantine, bringing R0 to a value less than unity is necessary and sufficient for the effective control of the disease in the population. The quarantine-free model is also shown to have a unique endemic equilibrium (where Ebola persists in the population), which is globally-asymptotically stable, whenever R0>1. The full model with quarantine was also analysed, from which it was deduced that adding imperfect quarantine to the quarantine-free model introduces a dynamic phenomenon (backward bifurcation) that was not present in the former model. Thus, the community-wide implementation of imperfect quarantine measures (except if implemented with high efficacy to minimize disease transmission during quarantine) may fail to lead to the effective control of the disease. The presence of backward bifurcation in the transmission dynamics of a disease makes its effective control more difficult (since a lot more effort is needed to reduce the associated reproduction number further below unity, outside the backward bifurcation region).",24.34715945150252,11.597564064652012

RISK, RIGHTS AND PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES","The collision of security and public health is our focus in this article. But before explaining why, we need to define ‘public health emergency preparedness’, in particular its impressive–sounding correlate, ‘global public health security’, and its less readily comprehensible subset, ‘public health emergency legal preparedness’. In the World Health Report 2007, Dr Margaret Chan, Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), described ‘global public health security’ as ‘the reduced vulnerability of populations to acute threats to health’.2 Later in the same report, more detailed definitions were provided:
Public health security is … the activities required, both proactive and reactive, to minimize vulnerability to acute public health events that endanger the collective health of national populations. Global public health security widens this definition to include acute public health events that endanger the collective health of populations living across geographical regions and international boundaries … .[G]lobal health security, or lack of it, may also have an impact on economic or political stability, trade, tourism, access to goods and services and, if they occur repeatedly, on demographic stability.3
The other term that requires some explanation is ‘public health emergency legal preparedness’. Stated shortly, this is all about having the right laws in place and then using them in the right way in a time of public health emergency.4 In other words, it is about both legal preparedness for, and response to, public health emergencies – it is both proactive and reactive. More generally, it can be said to be an essential part of both public and global public health security, and a subset of public health emergency preparedness.",23.570489237684818,9.252970916522129

Gostin et al. [9] argued that it becomes essential to develop a set of legal and ethical recommendations, especially when scientific evidence is not enough and public health action is urgently required as in the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). During the MERS outbreak in Korea, difficult choices between public health needs and the protection of individual rights, which include privacy, liberty, and freedom of movement, had to be made. Gostin et al. [9] proposed four ethical values: the precautionary principle, the least restrictive option, fairness, and transparency in decision making. It is unclear that these values were fully considered in the public health actions that were taken during the MERS outbreak in Korea. The Korean government strictly restricted the movement of 16 752 individuals who satisfied the operational definition of “close contacts with a MERS patient” within designated hospitals or their homes for the maximum incubation period regardless of whether they displayed MERS symptoms [1]. According to the WHO, there is no evidence that MERS can be transmitted before symptom development or in early symptomatic stages. Therefore the WHO does not recommend quarantine nor isolation of asymptomatic contacts during this period [10]. The urgent social demand for controlling the MERS outbreak overwhelmed the issue of legitimacy of the public health interventions taken by the government. Economic issues have also been raised regarding this restriction of movement. In this situation, the people who undertake the costs incurred by movement restriction are not the same people who benefit. In principle, if those who benefited were to compensate those who were made worse off, the outcome could have been considered an improvement (known as a “Kaldor–Hicks improvement”) [11]. For effective and fair implementation of public health measures against MERS or other transmissible infectious diseases that compromise individual rights, a reasonable compensation scheme for the victims, including for health care providers, should be designed to benefit those individuals and society overall.",23.151456286813506,10.50206608733236

He estimates the risks for the short and medium term very low. “From a security perspective, many people are concerned that it is now possible to directly construct harmful pathogens from DNA sequence information.

In this paper, the various measures to prevent and control the spread of COVID -19 in China are divided into two categories: One is traffic control, which not only affects the movement of people across regions and even across the country, but also affects the transportation of goods. The price of this is to force companies and other institutions to stop operations, which is at huge cost. Another is social distancing, including closure of public places in the city, community containment, isolation of the infected, and quarantine of the suspected, which affects the operation of some urban institutions, and the cost is less than the traffic control. Based on the mechanism analyzed above and the classification of prevention and control measures against COVID-19, we then propose the hypothesis: traffic control and social distancing can quickly contain the spreads of COVID-19 epidemic, but they perform different effect in various regions.",23.852962017191103,9.536642566369402

Rothstein & Talbott (2007) found that to make quarantine to be the most effective measure for limiting the spread of infection, compliance with quarantine regulations should be encouraged, that is, providing job security and income replacement. Wang et al. (2012) found that In the case of short reaction time, intra-population, such as patient isolation, are more effective than inter-population such as travel restrictions. Jefferson (2008) pandemic influenza (H1N1) and found those were effective to some extent. Rashid (2015) researched the public health policy of the 2009 pandemic influenza and concluded that the school closure, whether positive or passive, seemed to be moderately effective and acceptable in reducing the spread of influenza and delaying the peak of the epidemic, but it is related to high expenses of secondary school. Voluntary isolation and quarantine at home are also effective and acceptable measures, but it takes the risk of intra-household transmission from index cases to contacts. Workplace-related interventions, such as work closure and work at home, are also moderately effective and acceptable, but it may have negatively impact on economy. Internal mobility restriction is only effective when extremely high restrictions (50% of travel) are imposed and mass gatherings which happened within 10 days before the epidemic peak is likely to increase the risk of transmission of influenzas. Rothstein (2015) compared the effectiveness of public health policies to intervene with infectious diseases, among which quarantine is one of the most aggressive and controversial measures that public health officials can take when trying to control an outbreak. Serious legal and ethical concerns have been raised because of restrictions on the movement of potentially large numbers of people (Fidler et al., 2007) . During the SARS epidemic in 2003, quarantine was widely used in several Asian countries and Canada, and it played a role in ending the epidemic. Similarly, during the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, social distancing measures, including quarantine, had become a major containment strategy. The paradox of quarantine and other social distancing measures is that they may effectively resist the outbreak of disease, but the scope of application is too wide, leading to various social hazards, including economic disruption, physical isolation and even violence. Quarantine is the first public health tool to control infectious diseases and remains a legitimate and valuable public health strategy because it has a significant impact on civil liberties, economic activity and social cohesion, so officials must be extra careful about the possibility of abusing quarantine authority (Rothstein, 2015) .",25.406035157537083,9.460069235536919

The first would be adopted by communities that either initially decided not (or did, but were unable) to sufficiently control the exponential increase of new cases. These 'suppression measures' reduce the reproduction number sufficiently below 1 and in so doing lower the number of infectious cases to a manageable level. The second tactic -'mitigation measures' -may either be gradually introduced towards the end of suppression, or as a preventive approach, whereby communities begin to manage very early in the outbreak.

A total of 17,637 cases have been confirmed in 78 countries outside China. [1] The new coronavirus outbreak has surpassed the severity of SARS in 2003. [2, 3] The outbreak of virus coincided with China's Spring Festival travel peak, and to curb the spread of the disease, the Chinese government launched unprecedented public health intervention measures, such as shutting down Wuhan transportation, extending the legal holiday, mass isolation, strict enforcement of quarantine of all contacts, and canceling all public gatherings and health public to abide by hygienic practices. To reduce the flow of people, the health monitoring of returning residents has been conducted at the nationwide level. As of 16:00 clock on February 28, Dr. Wan'nian Liang, chief of the National Health Commission's institutional reform department and head of the Chinese expert panel, said: The virus outbreak in Wuhan is curbed basic. The number of new confirmed cases per day declined from a high peak of 3,900 cases on 13 February to 323 cases on 27 February. The number of newly cured cases has exceeded the number of newly confirmed cases for eight consecutive days since February 20.

Important for the current debate about the natural history of the disease, this policy would also work if there is a fraction of asymptomatic but infectious individuals in the population. Our results also show that from a practical point of view, a combination of all the analyzed contexts can have second order benefits. As already stressed, containment measures should not only be directed towards a full cutdown of the number of infected cases. Their efficacy is also given by other factors, such as delaying, even if only by a few days, the spreading of the disease. Such delays are always good for preparedness and to have more time for clinical research that can lead to new pharmacological treatments or vaccines. For instance, even if traffic restrictions are not effective on their own, they facilitate the control of the population and thus it would be easier to detect infected individuals and treat them. Similarly, self-protection measures and other social-distancing practices delay the spreading of the disease, freeing resources that would allow for a better management of the epidemic, in turn leading to an increase of the efficacy of individual isolation. Closing public places would, in practice, reduce the transmission, which again will lower the total number of infections and thus make them more manageable for the public health system. This also highlights the importance of having a coordinated response system, since simply adopting central measures like imposing mobility restrictions and closing public places is not effective in the middle-to-long term.",17.691617994299772,7.750014181014831

The Chinese government has implemented a series of large-scale public health interventions to control the epidemic, many of which have far exceeded what International Health Regulations required, especially Wuhan lock-down, nationwide traffic restrictions and Stay At Home Movement. Wuhan had prohibited all transport in and out of the city as of 10:00 on January 23, 2020, this is maybe the largest quarantine/movement restriction in human history to prevent infectious disease spread (Tian et al, 2020) .

As the WHO leader Bruce Aylward said at the COVID-19 news conference of February 24 in Beijing [4] : ""This is one of the biggest successes of China's response to the outbreak. The past month, for example, there were more than 1,800 epidemiological investigation teams in Wuhan, with at least 5 persons in each group, tracking thousands of close contacts every day. It is through painstaking efforts that the vast majority of identified close contacts were tracked down and their health monitored. These remarkable results have not come easily because of the epidemiology of these curves.
