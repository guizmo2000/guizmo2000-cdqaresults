Our direct estimate of serial interval from 15 infector-infectee pairs has a mean of 24 days, which is much shorter than the above guess from experts' views.

Estimating the transmissibility, which is usually characterized by the basic reproductive number R 0 , the mean number of secondary infectious cases generated by a single primary infectious case introduced into a totally susceptible population, provides crucial information for the effort required to stop infection spreading. Hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted indirectly through contaminated food and environment. An outbreak from March to June 2011 was reported to have occurred at an elementary school of 698 pupils in China and it was found that the outbreak was due to direct transmission between school children. Based on the symptom onset date and the social contact network of the children, in this study we estimate the serial interval (i.e. the gap in symptom onset between an infectee and its infector) and use different statistical methods to estimate R 0 . Combining with the positivity of IgG antibodies tests, we develop a compartmental transmission dynamics model which includes both asymptomatic and symptomatic infections to estimate the overall R 0 . Our analysis suggests a serial interval of mean = 23.9 days and standard deviation = 20.9 days. The different statistical methods suggest estimates for R 0 in the outbreak varying from 2.1 to 2.8, and the estimates from the transmission dynamics model are consistent with this range. Our estimates are in agreement with that from one study in England but are higher than that from one study in the United States. Our transmission dynamics model suggests that the proportion of symptomatic infections is about 9%, implying that there were about 344 asymptomatic infections along with the 32 observed symptomatic cases. Furthermore, it is shown that the inclusion of asymptomatic infection in the epidemic process increases the estimate of R 0 but does not do so greatly provided that the proportion of symptomatic infections is constant over the outbreak and there is no difference in transmissibility between symptomatic and asymptomatic infections.",57.82874138061003,20.73876087942549

From these 15 infector-infectee pairs, the serial interval was estimate to have a mean of 23.9 days and standard deviation of 20.9 days and 95% of serial intervals were predicted to lie with the range 1.6 to 79.1 days (this assumes serial intervals come from a Gamma distribution). The same distribution was assumed for the generation time. The maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) from the reconstruction of transmission trees has a mean of 14.4 days and standard deviation of 13.9 days with 95% confidence interval: [0.47, 51.3]. This is shorter than the above direct estimate. The shortness of MLE of serial interval is the consequence of many short pairs of infector-infectee reconstructed: One sample of the reconstructed transmission trees for the Hepatitis A outbreak is shown in the left panel of Fig 1. Within this sample tree, the reconstructed infector-infectee pairs have a mean of 7.7 days, which substantially reduces the overall pooled mean. In view of the large amount of infections being asymptomatic (see the transmission dynamics model below), the shortness of the serial interval of reconstructed infector-infectee pairs must have been due to the ignorance of contribution of asymptomatic infections. Hence we regard the direct estimate as the reasonable serial interval distribution and use it in other analyses. In order to estimate R 0 in the transmission tree method [9] , we sample 10,000 transmission trees from the maximum likelihood estimate of the contact probability p ij . The evolution of effective reproductive number R t along the course of outbreak is show in Fig 1 (right panel) . In view of the turning point of 26 May suggested from renewal equation (see below), we approximated the average reproductive number during the period from 10 March to 26 May 2011 as R 0 and it is 2.00 [1.80,2.20] . If the transmission trees are sampled from the contact probability p ij generated from Eq (1) using direct estimate of serial interval distribution, we obtained the fairly similar estimate: 2.10[1.9, 2.30] (see Table 1 ). The underlying reason for the similar results is that R 0 was calculated as the average reproductive number before 26 May 2011 while In right panel, the filled triangles represent mean and bars the lower and upper levels of 95% Confidence interval (CI). In the transmission tree which describes who acquired infection from whom among 32 cases, 15 cases (black circles except index case) know their unique infectors and the infectors of other 16 cases (red triangles) were reconstructed by the method of [9] .

The mean estimates of the transmissibility of hepatitis A virus from three different statistical methods before effective control range from 2.1 to 2.8, with their 95% confidence interval ranging from 1.8 to 4.5. Transmission dynamics model, which includes both asymptomatic and symptomatic infections, generates an estimate of 2.7. When assuming all infections are symptomatic in transmission dynamics model, the estimate reduces to 2.1. These results are well in agreement with statistical estimates which are based on symptomatic case data alone. By further incorporating the results of IgG antibodies test [3] , our transmission dynamics model suggests that about 91% of the HAV infections in the school children are asymptomatic. This result suggests that at the end of the outbreak there are total of about 344 asymptomatic infections along with 32 symptomatic cases. This estimate of asymptomatic proportion is consistent with the general estimate [17, 18] . The common knowledge is that hepatitis A in children is mostly an asymptomatic disease while adolescents and adults usually show symptoms of clinical hepatitis. For example, one estimation [19] indicates that 80 to 95% of children less than 5 years old have asymptomatic infections, compared to 10 to 25% of adults.

Neglecting depletion of susceptibles is justified by the fact that the number of infected individuals is very small compared to the total number of pupils (28 vs 698). (It is worth noticing that in statistical estimation methods all infections are assumed to be symptomatic) This allows using of R 0 instead of the instantaneous reproductive number (the average number of people someone infected at time t can infect over their entire infectious lifespan) as originally used in [11] . More complicated modifications have been proposed for the renewal equation to reflect the outbreaks that will finish with many individuals still being susceptible (e.g., [12] ).

If the basic reproductive number is greater than one, the disease has the potential to spread. If it is less than one, the disease will die out after only a few generations. The next influenza pandemic will start when a novel strain of influenza evolves with R 0 . 1 in humans. Wherever in the world the novel strain evolves, with modern news services and electronic communication, there will be a period of time during which the disease is not present in some large populations but is known to be spreading in other more remote locations. This presents a window of opportunity for implementing interventions to reduce R 0 prior to the introduction of the pandemic strain from those remote populations. Although R 0 is sometimes considered to be intrinsic to a pathogen, it is also dependent on the behavior of the host population and can vary across time. For instance, for the severe acute respiratory syndrome that re-emerged during the winter of 2003-2004 [6] , since there was no significant sustained transmission, R 0 was likely to have been lower than when the virus first circulated during the previous year [7] . The first-wave infection attack rate (IAR) is defined to be the proportion of the population infected during the initial epidemic (i.e., first year) of the circulation of a novel pathogen and includes both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection. Specifically, the IAR for pandemic influenza does not include infections arising during subsequent years. Public health policy in disease-free populations prior to the arrival of pandemic influenza should aim to reduce R 0 , thus reducing the IAR.

Briefly, PEDV is a RNA coronavirus in the family Alphacoronaviridae that causes high pre-weaning mortality in piglets 18 . The virus emerged in the United States in 2013 and rapidly spread to 30 states infecting approximately 50% of breeding herds by the middle of 2014 19 . PEDV transmission among individual pigs occurs primarily by direct and indirect contact via the fecal-oral route 19, 20 . Recent research has examined the role of animal transport in the spread of PEDV [21] [22] [23] . An analysis of the animal movement network for one swine system showed the frequency of movements declined during the initial emergence of PEDV 24 . Indirect transmission between farms may also be possible via airborne mechanisms 25, 26 . Potential environmental conditions that may facilitate virus survivability in the environment include temperature 27 and relative humidity 28 , but these environmental factors have not been integrated into broader analyses of risk factors for transmission. More generally, there is a lack of quantitative knowledge about the impact of meteorological, environmental, and topographic features (i.e. land cover, slope) on PEDV spread, though recent work on porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) suggests that there are potential relationships between environmental and topographic variables and between-farm virus transmission 29 .",34.95759434089868,12.594704956362973

The fact that the scaling factors for the adjustment of the reproductive number are close to one in the synthetic cases, compared to stronger super linear behaviors observed in the workplace and conference settings, shows that a smaller adjustment of the reproductive number is needed once contacts are characterized by a simpler dynamics. Once non-random peculiar structures are considered, as those inevitably present in the empirical datasets, stronger adjustments in the transmissibility are required. The School dataset is the only case where an underestimation of the transmissibility is needed to reproduce the epidemic process, in contrast to all other cases explored. The study of additional datasets of contacts between students at various schools would be needed to understand whether the observed behavior is specific of this setting or of the particular dataset under study. The value of the rescaling factor is however very close to one, similarly to the values obtained in the synthetic cases (though smaller vs. larger than one). Synthetic contact networks share similar features with the contact patterns recorded at the school: first, the synthetic networks are composed of groups of the same size, similarly to classes at school but differently from the workplace departments, which have varying sizes; second, the synthetic contact matrix describing the interactions between and within groups (with only two values for a p,q ) is more similar to the one observed in schools [47] [48] [49] , than to the more heterogeneous and more mixed patterns observed at the workplace [50] . Schools composed of rather homogeneous substructures in terms of class sizes may thus be nicely described through our rescaling, regardless of the specific number of classes and class size. This is particularly relevant as schools represent an important mixing group for the transmission of airborne infections, due to a pattern of contacts that is strongly age-dependent [67] [68] [69] . Workplace results are different from school results, indicating that the same homogeneous approximation cannot be used in both settings (as currently done in the realm of agent-based models) to achieve accurate epidemic curves, but that a stronger rescaling of the basic reproductive number should be considered. We note however that repeated observations of empirical networks for each setting would be needed to assess the robustness of the recovered behaviour.",33.14306387045572,12.453527687326137

With a heightened increase in concern for an influenza pandemic we sought to better understand the 1918 Influenza pandemic, the most devastating epidemic of the previous century. Methodology/Principal Findings. We use data from several communities in Maryland, USA as well as two ships that experienced well-documented outbreaks of influenza in 1918. Using a likelihood-based method and a nonparametric method, we estimate the serial interval and reproductive number throughout the course of each outbreak. This analysis shows the basic reproductive number to be slightly lower in the Maryland communities (between 1.34 and 3.21) than for the enclosed populations on the ships (R 0 = 4.97, SE = 3.31). Additionally the effective reproductive number declined to sub epidemic levels more quickly on the ships (within around 10 days) than in the communities (within 30-40 days). The mean serial interval for the ships was consistent (3.33, SE = 5.96 and 3.81, SE = 3.69), while the serial intervals in the communities varied substantially (between 2.83, SE = 0.53 and 8.28, SE = 951.95).

In the ships, this value is higher and rapidly drops off, perhaps due to the close quarters and extremely rapid transmission that could take place in these very vulnerable populations.

Public health workers, government officials and disaster planners have an increasing interest in better understanding the potential impact of an influenza pandemic and possible strategies for containment. Crucial in this planning is an understanding of the basic epidemiology of the disease in various settings. This has led to a growing interest in the analysis and understanding of past epidemics, particularly that of 1918, the most virulent and deadly influenza epidemic of the 20th century. Mortality has been estimated at 50-100 million people worldwide as a result of influenza in the 1918 pandemic [1] . It is reasonable to suppose that by better understanding the transmission dynamics of the highly pathogenic virus in 1918, we can gain greater insight into the dynamics, and thus potential methods of control, for a future pandemic [2] . Important parameters for understanding disease transmission are the reproductive number and the serial interval [3] . The basic reproductive number is defined as the average number of secondary infections created from a primary infection in an entirely susceptible population [4, see also 5] . A more complex, but perhaps meaningful parameter is the effective reproductive number which defines the average number of secondary infections an infected will create at a given point in the epidemic. This parameter takes into account that not all contacts of an infected individual are with susceptible persons, as well as the impact of public health control measures. Control strategies are typically targeted to drive this number below one and maintain it there, as this will lead to eventual extinction of the epidemic. An example of this is herd immunity, or immunity to a disease that is incurred from a sufficiently large proportion of the population being immune to a disease. Modeling techniques are often used to determine the proportion of the population that should be vaccinated in order to have the reproductive number low enough to avoid outbreaks of disease [6] .",57.520977019741636,21.069934293445023

While it can be argued that adhering to a parametric definition of the shape of the effective reproductive number leads to a greater chance of lack of fit, it can also lead to a result that can be interpretable for other settings that are similar to that being studied.",41.5867065325368,14.972474408372838

The generation time distribution (i.e. distribution of time between infection of an index case and infection of its secondary cases) determines-with the reproduction number-the growth rate of an epidemic [67] . Most commonly, the generation time distribution is estimated from data on the serial interval distribution of an infection-the delay between symptom onset in a case and symptom onset in his/her infector. Other delays between events in the natural history of infection (e.g. exposure, onset of symptoms, hospitalization and recovery or death) also affect disease transmission or have implications for control [43, 67] . Delays from symptom onset to recovery (or death) will determine the required duration of health-care and case isolation. The incubation period (the delay between infection and symptom onset of a case) and the extent to which infectiousness precedes symptom onset will determine the feasibility and effectiveness of contact tracing or prophylaxis [43] . Estimating these delay distributions requires detailed data on individual cases and their exposure, e.g. through transmission pairs identified in household studies [43] .",38.9580577145119,14.42359295045682

Cases can report contact both with sick individuals (their potential source of infection) and healthy individuals they have contacted since becoming ill (who may need to be traced and monitored as potential new cases). These data will be more informative if the majority of infections are symptomatic (and hence easily identifiable), if individuals are mostly infectious after the onset of symptoms [43] and if the time window over which exposures and contacts are monitored is as long as the upper bound of the incubation period distribution. If exposure information is collected with enough demographic information to allow record linkage, these backward and forward contacts can be identified in the case line-list, defining transmission pairs. Depending on the mutation rate of the pathogen, genetic data can also be used to identify or confirm these epidemiological links [56, 85] . The increasing availability of full genome pathogen sequences offers exciting prospects in that respect. Some genetic sequence information was available during the Ebola epidemic, but most sequences could not be linked to case records, limiting the use of sequence data in this context. On the other hand, individuals who were named as potential sources of infection could often be identified in the case linelist, although this process was hindered by non-unique names and limited demographic information collected on the potential sources [10] . These exposure data were used to characterize variation in transmission over the course of infection [10] , and to estimate the serial interval and the incubation period [3] .

We explore the transmission dynamics of the developed model using numerical simulations with different parameter settings, which characterize different levels of heterogeneity. The results show that when the reproductive number, R 0 , is larger than one, a low level of heterogeneity results in dynamics similar to those predicted by the homogeneous mixing model.

In general, epidemiologists use mathematical formulas with clear and acceptable assumptions to calculate the infectivity index. For this purpose, ""basic reproduction number"" termed R0 is used, and it indicates the expected number of cases directly infected by one contagious case in a population that everyone is supposed to be susceptible. For viral pathogens in MERS and SARS epidemics, the index was approximated to be 2, indicating that each infected person could infect two people on average in an effective contact. However, for COVID-19, the calculated value in a study was slightly higher and the index value based on data calculated in Wuhan, China was 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9) (17) and it shows that the infectivity of COVID-19 is higher than previous epidemics originated by coronavirus (18) . In other studies, R0 has been reported with different values, the lowest of which corresponds to the WHO report of 1.95 (1.4-2.5) (19) and the highest value is 6.47 (95% CI 5.71-7.23) (20) . A review study estimated an average R0 for COVID-19 of 3.28 with a median of 2.79 and an IQR of 1.16 (21) . As an explanation for variety of the calculated indices is that different calculation methods were used and calculations were done at different times of epidemics. As previously noted, certain assumptions have been made in calculation of this index. Initial reports on a family in one of the provinces of China show that all six-members of a family, aged 10-66 years were infected within a short period after one member returned from Wuhan (8) . As a conclusion, this index is changing over time, and its reduction may reflect effectiveness of preventive measures, so that reaching a value less than one (less than one new case per effective contact with an infected person and transmission) implies that the epidemic is controlled in the community (6).",39.28582746266303,14.826095605071803

The distribution of the incubation period is also used in estimating the size of the epidemic [3] [4] [5] and the transmission potential [6, 7] .

Eckland (Medical Microbiology and Immunology, Creighton University in Omaha, NE, USA) introduced prion disease, and how prion strain interactions during incubation periods affect strain dynamics. Prion diseases are a group of inevitably fatal neurodegenerative diseases affecting mammals, including humans. Prion diseases are caused by a misfolded isoform of the prion protein, PrP Sc . Prion strains are operationally defined a heritable phenotype of disease under controlled transmission conditions that are hypothesized to be encoded by strain-specific conformations of PrP Sc . Prion strains can interfere with each other when a long incubation period strain (i.e., blocking strain) inhibits the replication of a short incubation period strain (i.e., non-blocking). Prion strain interference influences prion strain dynamics and the emergence of a strain from a mixture. However, it is unknown if two long incubation period strains can interfere with each other. To investigate this, they used a combination of protein misfolding cyclic amplification strain interference (PMCAsi) and animal bioassay. Using PMCAsi, they found a PrP Sc migration pattern consistent of a mixture of both strains, suggesting that strain interference is not occurring. Animal bioassay experiments are consistent with these in vitro findings. This is the first example of prion strain combinations that do not interfere with each other both in vitro and in vivo. This observation changes the paradigm of the interactions of prion strains in a mixture and has implication for interspecies transmission and emergence of prion strains from a mixture.",38.06171304575793,14.681538852128059

From our simulation work, we notice that the mean of the serial interval appears to follow the trend of the reproductive number.

Under the constant missingness scheme the reproductive number estimates increase with the attack rate (between 1.49 and 1.54), as well as the mean of the serial interval (2.15-2.25 days). When the reporting fraction increases through time, the reproductive number is smaller and decreases as the AR increases (1.29 to 1.05). The mean of the serial interval follows a similar pattern ranging between 2.01 for AR = 39% and 1.45 for AR = 68%. The results from the overreporting scenarios follow a similar pattern, assuming that the amount of overreporting is consistent throughout the epidemic.

Implications for biodefense,"The rapidity with which smallpox would spread in a developed nation is not known and is a major source of uncertainty in models used for public health planning (Ferguson et al., 2003) . The basic reproductive number (R 0 ), which describes the tendency of a disease to spread, has been estimated for smallpox from historical data and outbreaks in developing countries (Gani and Leach, 2001; Eichner and Dietz, 2003) . Because R 0 is a function of the contact rate between individuals, it can be affected by changes in the environment (Anderson and May, 1991) . A potentially important difference between contemporary environments and those used to estimate R 0 is that today many buildings, including hospitals, mechanically recirculate air. If smallpox was almost entirely transmitted by mucosal contact with large droplets (aerodynamic diameters >10 µm), which can only occur following ""face-toface"" exposure over distances of a few feet, then change in the built environment would not change the contact rate between individuals. If, however, smallpox was frequently transmitted from person-to-person by airborne droplet nuclei [fine particles with aerodynamic diameters of ≤2.5 µm capable of remaining suspended in air for hours and of depositing in the lower lung (Hinds, 1999) ] then mechanically recirculated air systems would increase the contact rate, R 0 , the risk of epidemic spread, and the difficulty of hospital infection control. Unfortunately, leading authorities disagree regarding the relative importance of fine and large particle routes of transmission; some state that smallpox was transmitted primarily via airborne droplet nuclei, (Henderson et al., 1999) while others emphasize ""face-to-face"" contact and state that, airborne transmission was rare (Centers for Disease Control, 2002; Mack, 2003) .

There are likely substantial opportunities to gain valuable insights into outbreak dynamics if we relax our assumption that transmissibility is constant over time and thus consider an inferential framework that accounts for both changes in transmissibility and depletion of susceptible individuals.

Two quantities that are often used to describe transmission are the basic reproductive number and the distribution of the serial interval (SI). The basic reproductive number (R 0 ) is the average number of secondary cases a primary case will infect, assuming a completely susceptible population [1] . The reproductive number is always nonnegative; values less than one are indicative of an outbreak that will not continue to grow in the absence of imported cases. When R 0 is larger than one, the magnitude of the value guides the types of control measures that are necessary to restrict transmission and control the outbreak. It is also essential to understand the timing between primary and secondary cases. For a given R 0 , if secondary cases occur shortly after the primary cases, a rapidly growing outbreak will result, which can be more difficult to control than an outbreak with a longer time interval between cases. The timing of the secondary cases is most easily measured by the SI distribution, an observable quantity. The SI is defined as the time between symptom onset in successive cases in a chain of backward transmission. The SI is used as a surrogate measure for the generation interval, which is unobservable, and is defined as the time between consecutive infections in the chain of transmission [2] .

In these instances, disease is introduced from an external source and subsequent secondary transmission is characterized by 'stuttering chains' of transmission which inevitably go extinct. This regime can be defined formally in terms of the basic reproductive number, R 0 , which describes the expected number of secondary cases caused by a typical infected individual. Stuttering chains occur when R 0 in the focal population is non-zero but less than the threshold value of one that enables sustained spread (i.e. 0vR 0 v1). Transmission is therefore subcritical, and epidemics cannot occur. However there are many settings where such transmission dynamics are important. A major set of examples comes from stage III zoonoses, such as monkeypox virus, Nipah virus, and H5N1 avian influenza and H7N7 influenza [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Because most human diseases originate as zoonoses, there is significant public health motivation to monitor stage III zoonoses [7] [8] [9] [10] . Subcritical transmission is also associated with the emergence of drug-resistant bacterial infections in some healthcare settings, such as hospital-acquired MRSA [11] . In addition, stuttering chains characterize the dynamics of infectious diseases that are on the brink of eradication, such as smallpox in the 1960s and 1970s [12] and polio now [13, 14] . Furthermore, stuttering chains are seen with measles and other vaccine preventable diseases when they are re-introduced to a region after local elimination [15] [16] [17] .",42.41612614464883,16.876052497280075

Currently, the analysis suggests (details of this analysis will be published elsewhere [7] ) that COVID-19/Wuhan 2019-nCoV belongs to Category B, indicating that, similar to SARS-CoV, COVID-19/Wuhan 2019-nCoV can be efficiently transmitted via the respiratory mode. However, due to the fact that the outer shell of this virus is among the hardest in the coronavirus family, the model suggests that COVID-19/Wuhan 2019-nCoV is likely to be more resilient in body fluids and the environment than most of its cousins, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Therefore, our model predicts that COVID-19/Wuhan 2019-nCoV can be efficiently spread by respiratory means, as in the case of SARS-CoV, but it also has the potential to remain outside the body longer than SARS-CoV, and, probably, MERS-CoV.

Firstly, the SEIR model was set up based on a number of necessary assumptions. For example, we assumed that no super-spreaders exist in the model, but there is currently no supportive evidence. Secondly, the accuracy of the estimation model depends largely on the accuracy of the parameters it used, such as incubation period. With more precise parameters obtained as the epidemic progresses, our estimation model will also be more precise. Our estimates of the reproductive number from 3.1 to 0.5 are based on previous studies and experience from SARS control. However, this measure may change substantially over the course of this epidemic and as additional data arrives. Besides, using a fixed R t value in each phase may incur potential bias because R t is essentially a dynamic parameter. Thirdly, these estimated data may not be sustained if unforeseeable factors occurred. For example, if some infections were caused by multiple exposures to animals, these estimates will be exposed to a big uncertainty. Fourthly, the epidemic trend shows great difference between Wuhan and Hubei Province and regions in mainland China outside Hubei Province according to the NHC reported data. It is thus inappropriate to generalize the estimations in Wuhan to regions in mainland China outside Hubei Province. The dynamics model for the other locations in mainland China remains to be developed and specific parameters need to be redefined. Lastly, we do not provide model fit information in the current study. SEIR model is a prediction model forecasting the number of infections in the future. The data corresponding to actual situation in the future cannot be determined and this makes model fitting almost impossible during the outbreak. We would carry out model fitting according to the real data in pace with more information and knowledge about the characteristics of COVID-19 and the epidemics in the future.",37.380486918044895,15.814170254661125

These properties can also explain the higher contagiousness levels of the COVID-19/Wuhan 2019-nCoV than with SARS-CoV [6] . In fact, the ability of COVID-19/Wuhan 2019-nCoV to remain infectious outside the body for a longer period than SARS-CoV could imply that it requires fewer viral particles for greater chances of infection. Furthermore, an infected body can shed more active viral particles in greater concentrations as more particles are able to resist the digestive enzymes found in most bodily fluids including saliva [2, 3] .

This regional variability in mixing has direct implications for estimates of the basic reproductive number of dengue in our study region and elsewhere. Although the potential for such bias in estimates of the basic reproductive number has been shown in a theoretical context [26, 55] , we provide quantitative estimates of the extent of this problem by interfacing models with a rich spatio-temporal dataset. Our results have implications for estimates of population-level parameters not only for dengue but also for other infectious diseases [13,56 -60] and possibly even more broadly in ecology [11] . Our analysis revealed significant differences in the inhomogeneity of mixing between urban and rural settings and found that a population-weighted urban accessibility metric was able to account for differences in mixing between these settings. Mixing is presumably influenced directly by human behaviour and has been shown to be highly unpredictable, largely dependent on the local context and the spatial and temporal scale [61] . In this study, however, we could show that the density-dependent covariate we considered was able to capture the influence of these behavioural effects on a district level. Once differences in the inhomogeneity of mixing were accounted for, estimated R 0 values indicated considerably larger differences between transmission potential in Lahore and all other districts. Synchronizing more accurate geo-referenced data would allow for the assessment of the extent to which the relationship between 'mixing parameters' and urban accessibility is dependent on the spatial scale at which data are aggregated [26, 62] . In the case of dengue, this has been limited specifically by the availability of high-resolution data [63] . Complementing such an analysis with measurement of social contact patterns could be important for exploring this relationship in even more detail [22, 64, 65] and could be informed by mathematical models that explored this relationship previously for other diseases [13, 66] . Another encouraging result from our analysis was the finding that large-scale mosquito suitability surfaces helped capture the environmental determinants of dengue transmission [28] .",37.15806792229594,16.10842434682015

Analysis of 425 patients with confirmed COVID-19 showed that the incubation period is 3 to 7 days. The mean was 5.2 days (95% CI: 4.1 to 7.0), and the 95 th percentile of the distribution is 12.5 days (95% CI: 9.2 to 18) [11] . Notably, it was reported that the incubation period could be as long as 24 days in a rare case [25] . The basic reproductive number (R 0 ) up to the period of 4 Jan 2020 was estimated based on the study of 425 patients to be 2.2 (meaning that one patient has been spreading infection to 2.2 other people) [11] , slightly smaller than the value of 2.68 by a modelling in another [29] . The R 0 of SARS-CoV-2 from both of these two studies is smaller than that of SRAS, which are 3 before public health measures were implemented [30] . However, subsequent investigation based on the analysis of high-resolution real-time human travel and infection data estimated that the R 0 is much larger, ranging from 4.7 to 6.6 before the control measures [31] , implying that SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and more infectious than initially estimated. This conclusion is consistent with the wide spread of SARS-CoV-2 within a short period time and was also echoed by the finding that SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein had 10-to 20-fold higher affinity to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor than that of SARS-CoV based on the Cryo-EM structure analysis of S proteins [32] . Similar to SARS-CoV, the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells depends on the recognition and binding of S protein to ACE2 receptor of the host cells [14, 33] . The high affinity of S protein to ACE2 receptor likely contributes to the quick spreading of virus. The finding of ACE2 as the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 also indicates that human organs with high ACE2 expression level, such as lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine, are potentially the target of SARS-CoV-2 [34] .",35.42932120114971,12.689829081819884

The four methods involved (1) an early exponential growth rate, (2) In particular, uncertainty during the early part of the epidemic leads to a wide range of estimates for R 0 (0.5-3.5, 95% confidence interval), but uncertainty decreases with more observations. Wallinga and Lipsitch [52] investigated how generation intervals shape the relationship between growth rates and reproductive numbers. For new emerging infectious diseases, the observed exponential epidemic growth rate r can indirectly infer the value of the reproductive number. The existence of a few different equations that relate the reproductive number to the growth rate makes such inference ambiguous. It is unclear which of these equations might apply to new infection. The authors showed that these different equations differ only with respect to their assumed shape of the generation-interval distribution. They found that the shape of the generation-interval distribution determines which equation is appropriate for inferring the reproductive number from the observed growth rate. By assuming all generation intervals to be equal to the mean, they obtained an upper bound on the range of possible values that the reproductive number may attain for a given growth rate. They also showed that it is possible to obtain an empirical estimate of the reproductive number by taking the generation-interval distribution equal to the observed distribution.",36.36221815806368,12.492205099578785

Thus, it is often difficult to determine the incubation period without explicit information of the time of exposure. The majority of epidemiologic data informs us that exposure (i.e., infection) occurred in a defined period, data of which is referred to as interval censored [29] . This is a common concern for acute infectious diseases transmitted by droplets and droplet nuclei and, most noteworthily, was discussed in detail during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [30, 31] . Previous studies on the population dynamics of influenza tend to make assumptions with regard to the incubation period distribution without employing observed data [32, 33] , perhaps mainly due to difficulties in identifying the time of exposure. The incubation period distribution of influenza remained almost unknown until a recent study reanalyzed the data of influenza transmission on an aircraft with a short duration of flight [34, 35] . Assuming Weibull distribution, this study estimated the mean (and standard deviation (SD)) incubation period as 1.48 (0.47) days [35] .

Initially, there is interest in estimation of the idealized basic reproductive number, R 0 , which measures the average number of cases generated by an infected individual in an entirely susceptible population. Post hoc analyses of an outbreak may include estimation of the time-varying effective reproductive number, R t , which represents the impact on R 0 of acquired immunity and public health interventions that typically lead to decreased transmission and a decrease in the growth of the outbreak [1] . Several methods exist for estimating these quantities either in real time as the epidemic progresses, or after the epidemic is over [2, 3] . Frequently, these estimators assume a homogenously mixing population, even though often this simplifying assumption may not be realistic. One possible source of heterogeneity is the lack of spatial uniformity in transmission across the population in question.

First, the virus detection window was set to be identical to the mean serial interval at 7.5 days [10] , but there has been no strict biological justification that the virus is detectable during this time period. An estimated mean infectious period of 3.6 days was also used [11] , but there is no direct theoretical link between infectious period and virus positive period. Second, the sensitivity of RT-PCR testing is known to be limited. In fact, the sensitivity to correctly diagnose SARS by RT-PCR test ranged from 44% to 80% [12] . It was found that the sensitivity was greatly influenced by viral shedding and was dependent on the date of sample collection with respect to illness onset [13] . These factors also reduce the previously mentioned ascertainment rate for COVID-19 and indicate that the estimate is likely less than 9.2%.

When fitting a new model for each province with no inter-province connections this estimate varies little (1.23-1.37). Using the proposed method with any of the four similarity measures yields an overall R 0 that varies little across the four new models (1.33 to 1.34). However, when allowed to vary across provinces, the estimated R 0 is greater than one consistently in only two of the nine provinces, the most densely populated provinces of Gauteng and Western Cape.

This variability makes a qualitative difference in our understanding of the epidemic.

For example, the predicted disorder in the matrix of retroviruses was shown to vary with the mode of the viral transmission. The HIV and EIAV viruses, that are related but have distinctly different modes of transmission, were used to illustrate this point since. HIV is largely transmitted sexually, whereas EIAV is transmitted by a blood-sucking horsefly. It has been observed that the abundance of predicted intrinsic disorder (PID) in the HIV and EIAV matrix proteins was very different, with the HIV proteins being highly disordered, especially HIV-1. An explanation for this has to do with the need for a more rigid encasement in viruses that are not sexually transmitted, so as to protect the virion from harsher environmental factors [1] .",37.717637941625156,13.351002297684802

The first model parameter is an exponential growth term. Exponential growth is a function of the basic reproductive number (R 0 ) of the pathogen, which is defined as the (average) number of successful transmissions per infected individual within an entirely susceptible population, and the average serial interval [24] . In the case of PEDV and the farm-level nature of the OMAFRA dataset, we modify the definition slightly to consider the farm as the unit of observation. In this case, we define R 0 as the (average) number of successful farm-to-farm transmissions per infected farm within an entirely susceptible population of swine farms in Ontario. The average serial interval is defined as the time between laboratory confirmation in an index case/farm and laboratory confirmation in a secondary case/farm. The model also includes simultaneous exponential decay in the form of a control parameter (d). This parameter describes the slowing of the disease transmission process that is expected to occur as a result of interventions such as behavior change, increased immunity within the population or enhanced biosecurity.

A quantitative understanding of transmission dynamics in domestic dog populations provides critical information to assess whether global elimination of canine rabies is possible. We report extensive observations of individual rabid animals in Tanzania and generate a uniquely detailed analysis of transmission biology, which explains important epidemiological features, including the level of variation in epidemic trajectories. We found that the basic reproductive number for rabies, R 0 , is very low in our study area in rural Africa (;1.2) and throughout its historic global range (,2). This finding provides strong support for the feasibility of controlling endemic canine rabies by vaccination, even near wildlife areas with large wild carnivore populations. However, we show that rapid turnover of domestic dog populations has been a major obstacle to successful control in developing countries, thus regular pulse vaccinations will be required to maintain populationlevel immunity between campaigns. Nonetheless our analyses suggest that with sustained, international commitment, global elimination of rabies from domestic dog populations, the most dangerous vector to humans, is a realistic goal.

Unfortunately, detailed information on the distribution of the serial interval, g(τ), is not available for pandemic influenza, and historical records often offer only an approximate mean length. Although a recent study estimated the serial interval from household transmission data of seasonal influenza [9] , this is likely to have been considerably underestimated owing to the short interval from onset to secondary transmission within the households examined.

We speculate that this reduces the impact of fluctuations in a particular report on the subsequent report, diminishing their correlation. This effect is exacerbated if the reporting probability is low. A more rigorous explanation requires a full solution to the stochastic process with aggregation and reporting error. For many known pathogens the serial interval is larger than one week, for example measles virus and Bordetella pertussis [47] . For other pathogens it is less than one week, such as SARS coronavirus [48] and influenza virus [47, 49] .

Therefore, our proposed method depicts a more detailed spatial-temporal dengue transmission process and identifies the significant role of the edges apart from the epidemic foci, which could be the weak spots in disease control and prevention.

Based on experimental research of the transmission ability of influenza virus and the meteorological statistics, analysis of the influence of meteorological anomaly on the spread of influenza was introduced to a susceptive-infective-removal (SIR) model. According to the general infection mechanism, SIR classifies the target population of the disease into three specific groups, namely the susceptible (S), infective (I) and removed (R) individuals. The model has achieved good results and been widely used to predict the dynamics of infectious diseases [41, 42] . The basic reproductive rate R 0 is equal to the contact rate divided by the removal rate, namely the number of susceptible infected by a single infective case; only when R 0 >1 can the disease spread among population: if R 0 <1, the disease will disappear; if R 0 =1, the disease will remain unchanged, and neither spread nor disappear [43, 44] .

However, since it neglects individual-level geographical variations in exposure risk, R t may smooth out interpersonal heterogeneous transmission potential, obscure high-risk spreaders, and hence hamper the effectiveness of control measures in spatial dimension. therefore, this study proposes a new method for quantifying spatially adjusted (time-varying) reproductive numbers that reflects spatial heterogeneity in transmission potential among individuals. This new method estimates individual-level effective reproductive numbers (R j ) and a summarized indicator for population-level time-varying reproductive number (R t ).

The serial interval is defined as the time from illness onset in a primary case to illness onset in a secondary case [15] and has been estimated at 15 days on average for the ongoing epidemic [12] . The basic reproduction number, R 0 , quantifies transmission potential at the beginning of an epidemic and is defined as the average number of secondary cases generated by a typical infected individual during the early phase of an epidemic, before interventions are put in place [16] . If R 0 < 1, transmission is not sufficient to generate a major epidemic. In contrast, a major epidemic is likely to occur whenever R 0 > 1. When transmission potential is measured over time t, the effective reproduction number R t , can be helpful to quantify the time-dependent transmission potential resulting from the effect of control interventions and behavior changes [17] . Estimates of R 0 for the ongoing epidemic in West Africa have fluctuated around 2 with some uncertainty (e.g., [12, [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] ), which are in good agreement with estimates from past EVD outbreaks [23] . R 0 could also vary across regions as a function of the local public health infrastructure (e.g., availability of health care settings and infection control protocols), such that an outbreak may be very unlikely to unfold in developed countries simply as a result of baseline infection control measures in place (i.e., R 0 < 1) while poor countries with extremely weak or absent public health systems may be unable to control an Ebola outbreak (i.e., R 0 > 1).",40.48708802539579,14.545890237291307

Transmission dynamics models are well suited to address infectious disease scenarios that do not conform to these assumptions. For example, these models easily account for changes in the incidence rates of infection as the proportions of susceptible and infectious persons change in the population.

R 0 is not a fixed property of a pathogen. Rather (as is apparent from its definition) it is only defined within a certain population of hosts governed by a specific contact pattern, duration of infectiousness, and transmission probability. One could have very different underlying biological transmission processes that generate identical basic reproductive numbers. For example, the R 0 for measles is approximately 9, which also happens to be the R 0 for HIV among intravenous drug users (Halloran 1998 ). However, measles has a high transmission and short duration of infection, while HIV has a low transmission and long duration of infection. This feature can make comparisons of R 0 across diseases very difficult since R 0 is a compound expression of three variables. What R 0 captures is the capacity to generate an epidemic given some (unfortunately often unknown or not assessed) transmission process. Both measles and HIV have a high capacity to generate an epidemic assuming a given transmission process, but at very different time scales and governed by very different underlying transmission components.",47.95511790028317,17.966919230609

This includes the mode of transmission, incubation period, timing, duration and degree of infectiousness, age group most affected and age structure and contact behaviour of the population. Uncertainties surround these factors, especially at the beginning of an outbreak. In retrospect, although SARS was transmitted primarily through the respiratory route it usually did not behave as a highly infectious agent and certain parameters facilitated its containment through traditional public health interventions. These parameters included the lack of pre-symptomatic transmission, a low level of infectivity at the onset of illness, and that transmission was primarily through respiratory droplets and occurred primarily in healthcare or household settings involving close person to person contact (with the important exceptions of Hotel M. and Amoy Gardens in Hong Kong (Tomlinson & Cockram, 2003) ). In addition, although the reproductive number for cases was approximately three its serial interval was relatively long at 8-10 days between onset of symptoms in one person and onset of symptoms in the next person in the chain of transmission. These factors made it relatively easy to reduce transmission by promptly isolating cases, quarantining close contacts, and introducing and enforcing infection control and hygiene measures Pang, Zhu, & Xu, 2003; Riley, Fraser, & Donnelly, 2003; Svoboda, Henry, & Shulman, 2004; WHO, 2003a, b) .

Without loss of generality, we assume that t is indexing days, however this method is applicable to any discrete time unit. We consider that a typical infectious disease outbreak can be characterized by a two step process: we first have the basic reproductive number, R 0 , the average number of secondary cases produced by a single infected in a population of susceptible individuals. We then consider the serial interval, the distribution of the time between a primary case developing symptoms and a case, that she or he infects, becoming ill. This interval is a function of the incubation distribution and distribution of infectiousness which are not readily observed. Note that the distribution of the serial interval can be linked to the incubation distribution (see Kuk and Ma, 2005) , which is also sometimes used to characterize an outbreak. As a possible model, suppose that the number of secondary cases produced by an infected individual follows a Poisson distribution, with expected value R 0 , and that the serial interval is described by a multinomial distribution. We assume that primary cases always appear with symptoms before their secondary cases, that there is no movement in and out of the system of infected cases, and that an outbreak behaves in the following manner: Let N 0 individuals be the cases that initially show at the outset of the epidemic. Each of these cases independently generates secondary cases according to a Poisson distribution with mean R 0 .

This was reinforced with the reporting of 'super-spreading events'. 2, 5, [12] [13] [14] [15] The concept of super-spreading events has been proposed to explain incidents where a SARS patient infects many more persons than would be expected. Such events contributed to large-scale nosocomial outbreaks and have been attributed to the lack of stringent IC measures in hospitals. However, this does not fully explain these events and further research is required to understand the underlying risk factors. Aerosol-generating procedures have been associated with increased risk of transmission through the aerosolisation of virus-containing particles. 16 In addition patients with unrecognised SARS, particularly those with atypical presentations were the source of a number of nosocomial outbreaks. 13, 15 As the outbreak evolved SARS was shown to be only moderately transmissible with an estimated basic reproductive number of approximately three. 17, 18 The basic reproductive number refers to the average number of secondary cases generated by one primary case in a susceptible population. For SARS this is much lower than for influenza, and unlike influenza and other viral respiratory diseases, SARS-CoV has a long incubation period (up to 14 days), with the viral load peaking during the second week of illness and appearing to be highest in patients with more severe disease. 2 This may explain why transmission has not been identified in asymptomatic patients or after symptoms have resolved, and why transmission mainly occurs in hospitals.",49.10781456779357,17.399857493268094

Similarly, we can define R 0 as the mean number of infectious contacts (i.e., finite infectious contact intervals) made by a primary case without reference to a completely susceptible population. Generation and serial intervals and the effective reproductive number can then be defined in terms of infectious contacts that actually lead to the transmission of infection.

This time period depends on the temporal relationship between the infectiousness of the disease, the clinical onset of the source case, and the incubation period of the receiving case [17] . As MERS becomes infectious with the onset of clinical symptoms, the MERS latency period equals the incubation period. Therefore, the shortest serial interval could be the same as the incubation period, and the longest serial interval could be the sum of the incubation period and the maximum duration of infectiousness. During the Korean MERS outbreak, several superspreading events occurred because the MERS cases were not isolated immediately upon presentation of clinical symptoms [18] . Thus, these cases contacted susceptible individuals for up to one week after the onset of their clinical symptoms. However, most MERS cases with laboratory confirmation were isolated immediately after onset of clinical symptoms [19, 20] .

When estimating the serial interval, it is difficult to observe the symptom onset of the infector and infected person with precision. Estimates of the reproductive number were limited geographically ( Fig. 6) with estimates only available for seven countries. Settings with high TB burdens, especially high drug-resistant TB burdens such as the former Soviet Union [83] are not included in these papers. In addition, there was only one estimate from a high TB and high HIV burden country [47] . The lack of estimates could be because incidence and mortality rates are currently used to monitor TB control. These rates are not suitable for monitoring transmission; reductions in mortality could be attributed to improvements in treatment outcomes rather than any change in transmission and, due to the long incubation period of TB, changes in transmission could take years to impact incidence rates. In contrast, the reproductive number can provide a direct estimate of TB transmission itself. Most studies used mathematical models with various assumed model structures and parameters, making it difficult to compare the estimates and draw useful conclusions about the TB transmission dynamics by evaluating the reproductive number. The WHO End TB goals [4] include reducing TB deaths by 95% and incident cases by 90% by 2035. To achieve these goals, it is necessary to obtain improved estimates of the reproductive number and the SI as they can be used for monitoring and evaluating the effect of interventions on TB transmission. For example, the serial interval of TB can be used to determine how long one must monitor contacts of an infectious TB case to see if they will develop symptoms [84] . The effective reproductive number can be used to monitor the efficacy of interventions in reducing transmission. As interventions decrease transmission, estimates of the reproductive number should correspondingly decrease [41] ; in particular, if the reproductive number can be maintained below one, the disease can potentially be eliminated.",74.39784471639615,27.68386596795934

This reasoning is based on the well-established epidemiological concept of basic reproductive number which implies that infection outbreak will die off in the long run if basic reproductive number is kept below 1 (less than one new infected case) [33] . This is a very strict criterion that can be applied to evaluate protective effectiveness of the air delivery system against airborne infection spread in the indoor environment; therefore it is used as the threshold.

To date, seven human coronaviruses have been identified (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2). 7 The SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the subgenus Sarbecovirus and most closely resembles a bat coronavirus, with which it shares 96.2% genetic sequence homology. 2 8 9 The current belief is that COVID-19 was introduced into humans through an as yet unidentified intermediary animal, and it has since propagated through human-to-human spread. Human-to-human transmission occurs primarily through respiratory droplets that travel up to 2 m and may enter the respiratory tract of individuals within range or contaminated surfaces, leading to infection through contact transmission. 10 The average incubation period is 5 days, but it ranges from 1 to 14 days. 10 11 The basic reproductive number (the number of cases one infected individual generates), R 0 , is estimated to be 2.68 (95% confidence interval: 2.47e2.86). 12 Whilst asymptomatic transmission (during the incubation period, before onset of symptoms in infected individuals) has been suggested, it remains controversial and currently does not appear to be a major factor for infection transmission. 10 Infections in humans result in a spectrum of clinical disease, from mild upper respiratory tract infection, mostly commonly characterised by fever (82%) and cough (81%), to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis. The median age of infected individuals is between 49 and 56 yr. 1 13 Children are rarely diagnosed with 2019-nCoV, a phenomenon that has not yet been explained. Characterisation of the first 99 cases of 2019-nCoV within Wuhan demonstrated that 33% had severe illness, with 17% developing ARDS, 4% requiring mechanical ventilation, and 4% having sepsis. 13 The case fatality rate is currently estimated at 2% based on the confirmed cases reported for the ongoing outbreak. 3 However, as mild and subclinical infections are currently under-reported, the true case fatality is likely lower than this. 14 People with co-morbidities, such as diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease, appear to be at higher risk for death. 1 13 ",44.21413373601153,17.092395793180664

It is reasonable that the basic reproductive number of Wuhan is lower because of the stricter control measures. According to the derived parameters, we predict the number of accumulative confirmed cases from 22 February 2020 to 2 March 2020, the MAPE of the prediction compared with the real data is 23.71% in Wuhan and 28.66% outside Hubei; the MSE is 204 900 693 person 2 in Wuhan and 21 936 049 person 2 outside Hubei.

The first stage is from the start time to 20 January 2020, the second stage is from 20 January 2020 to 11 February 2020, and the third stage is from 12 February 2020 to the present.

In these provinces, the mean serial interval was 5·1 days (95% CI 1·3-11·6). This estimate is considerably shorter than a previous estimate (7·5 days) derived from an analysis of six observations of the serial interval in Wuhan. 5 Given that the basic reproduction number is positively associated with the growth rate of the epidemic and the length of the serial interval, 8 the shorter mean serial interval estimated here implies that transmissibility might not be as high as initial estimates suggest. We cannot rule out, however, that the serial interval might differ between Wuhan and other Chinese provinces. The short estimate of the serial interval that we obtained might be linked to the short estimate for the interval from symptom onset to hospital admission (with a mean of about 2·6 days since Jan 28) for mainland China outside Hubei. A longer admission delay was reported in Wuhan in the early phase of the outbreak, 5 which could drive longer serial intervals. It should be stressed also that serial interval estimates based on household clusters might be up to 20% shorter than the true value, as suggested by a theoretical study. 10 We estimated that the serial interval was about as long as the incubation period, which is in overall agreement with an independent previous estimate. 5 This finding suggests the possibility of an early peak of infectiousness, with possible transmission of SARS-CoV-2 before the onset of symptoms. If confirmed, the presence of relevant presymptomatic transmission might hamper control efforts, including contact tracing and timely isolation of index cases, as well as passenger screening at airports. By contrast, strategies based on social distancing, such as limiting mass gatherings and contact in the workplace and in schools, might still be effective. 15, 24, 25 Evidence is accumulating to indicate the possibility of transmission during the incubation phase. [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] It is worth noting also that our estimates of the incubation period and serial interval were based on analysis of cluster data, for which we assumed that the risk of infection from the community was negligible compared with that from infected individuals in the cluster.

In our study, the overall SAR was 22%, higher in those age <1 year (38%) and 1-4 years (50%). There is a wide variation in report of SAR from various settings, which is not unexpected. Our estimates are similar to household transmission studies in Germany (26%), 12 Kenya (26%), 20 and the United States (18%). 8 These estimates were slightly lower than other studies in Canada (Sikora C et al: 30%; Papenburg J et al: any ILI: 29%, laboratory-confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 ILI: 26%, and laboratory-confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 including asymptomatic infections: 45%) 15,21 and the United States (27AE3%). 22 Conversely, our estimates are higher than others reported from Japan (7AE6%), 23 UK (17%), 24 and United States (4-13%; 11%; 14AE3%). 9, 16, 25 Many factors affect transmission and hence SAR within households including age, antiviral use, and ascertainment of index and secondary cases or contacts, as well as socio-environmental factors such as climate, crowding, and control behaviors such as the use of masks and hand washing. The initiation of treatment for the index case upon illness onset or the following day was associated with a 42% reduction in secondary infections in households in a Japanese study. 26 In the study by Morgan et al. 16 (SAR: 4-13%), most of the index cases (72%) had received treatment. In the New York school household transmission study (SAR: 11%), about one quarter (26%) of index cases took antiviral treatment and 71% started within 2 days of illness onset. 9 About 7% of the household contacts also received antiviral prophylaxis. In the Suess et al. 12 study, SAR among those who did not receive prophylaxis was 26%, very close to our own measured rate. Reduced virus shedding with antiviral treatment for seasonal and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses has been reported. 13, 27, 28 Thus, differences in SAR may also in part be attributed to variation in antiviral use. The pattern we found of higher SAR among children than adults (highest in 0-4 and lowest in ‡50 years) is also consistent with other studies. 9, 15, 16 A higher SAR among children may be explained by differences in cross-protective innate or acquired immunity as well as contact and hygiene patterns. 22, 29 The spread of an infection is determined by the average number of secondary cases generated by an infectious case. This number is called the basic reproductive number (R 0 ) when the population is completely susceptible and the effective reproductive number (R) when the population is partially immune. The serial interval is an important parameter as it affects the estimation of R 0 . 30 It also determines the rate of growth of an epidemic (R ⁄ serial interval): for a given reproductive number (R), an epidemic will grow faster with a shorter serial interval. 31 These two parameters together are also useful in evaluating the impact of interventions employed to control the outbreak. Thus, estimating the serial interval is important in responding to a novel pathogen such as A(H1N1)pdm09 and convergence of estimates from several sources and settings lends credibility to the measure overall.",54.04688364019118,21.191448017086014

An often-used estimate of the incubation distribution is based on 36 laboratory-confirmed secondary cases from a single infector on an airplane where symptom onset mostly appeared within 1-2 days of infection (median 1.5 days). 19 Even less is known about the duration of infectiousness and its variability over time. Experimental infections suggest that viral shedding peaks around the time of symptom onset and declines with time; viral shedding can persist for up to 1 week after infection20 (perhaps longer in children). Our finding of a mean serial interval of 3.6 days suggests that the average time from symptom onset in the index case to secondary infection in the household setting may be around 2 days, assuming that time from secondary infection to secondary onset is 1.5 days (based on the airplane data19).",47.65474101659106,16.60898947910474

The last of these shows both the power of mechanistic approaches and the dangers of its misuse. In the summer and fall of 2014, the number of Ebola cases in West Africa was continuing to grow, and it was unclear how severe the epidemic would eventually become. To address this issue, as well as the threat of spread to other countries, a number of modeling exercises were conducted (e.g., Gomes et al. (57) ). Of particular note was a model released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that predicted that, without further intervention, 1.4 million cases of Ebola would occur in Liberia and Sierra Leone by mid-January 2015 (58). This did not come to pass, and although the authors noted that such long-term projections were tenuous, the media and many in the public health community made much of this number. Of course interventions and behavior change did occur, but the authors had also made tenuous assumptions about how the populations of Liberia and Sierra Leone mix together, essentially treating each country as a homogenous entity. In contrast, the World Health Organization Ebola Response Team, who also made projections based on an unconstrained epidemic, declined to forecast further than 2 months into the future (56), and though theirs was a moderate overestimate of total cases, they avoided publishing any panic-inducing overestimations (they projected approximately 20,000 cases by November 2, 2014; approximately 13,000 actually were reported by that point) (59) . Forecasting the course of disease spread is difficult to do well, particularly in the context of an active response. It also may be the least of what mechanistic approaches to disease epidemiology have to offer. The aforementioned work, particularly that of the World Health Organization Ebola Response Team, also characterized important aspects of Ebola's natural history and epidemiology, including its basic reproductive number (R 0 ), the decline in R over the course of the epidemic, the incubation period, and the serial interval, properties of the disease that will be important to understand should it re-emerge.",43.78056963475641,16.45240050124361

First, since many unobservable events would always be the source of uncertainty in all mathematical models of the transmission dynamics, observable statistical distributions must be effectively employed to translate observables to unobservables. For this reason, the incubation period and serial interval are deemed critically important epidemiologic measurements, if symptom onset is observable for a disease in question. Therefore, it is essential to make sure that systematically collected data are aggregated and stored for posterity in order to appropriately discuss the dynamics of infectious diseases using observed data. Second, transmission probabilities (or other conditional epidemiologic measurements) per exposure to infection should be effectively employed to address the dependence between individuals, as long as we deal with directly transmitted infectious diseases (i.e. communicable diseases). Although our example of dependent happening was focused on an assessment of vaccine efficacy, the readers are advised to remember (to gain some sense of quantitative modeling) that the need for mathematical modeling in all practical settings arises due to this complicated issue.

Firstly, we would like the readers to recognize the difference between observable and unobservable events in infectious disease epidemiology. Since both infection event and acquisition of infectiousness are generally not directly observable, the total number of infected individuals could not be counted at a point of time, unless very rigorous contact tracing and microbiological examinations were performed. Directly observable intrinsic parameters, such as the incubation period and serial interval, play key roles in translating observable to unobservable information. Secondly, the concept of dependent happening must be remembered to identify a risk of an infectious disease or to assess vaccine efficacy. Observation of a single infected individual is not independent of observing other individuals. A simple solution for dependent happening is to employ the transmission probability which is conditioned on an exposure to infection.",42.84436811332142,17.487730805709784

From the initial growth phase of an epidemic, the intrinsic growth rate, r 0 , i.e. the intrinsic rate of (natural) increase for infected individuals [33] , is estimated, and R 0 can be subsequently estimated using the Equation (16). Thus, the generation-time distribution has been recognized as playing a key role in estimating the transmission potential of a disease [86, 96] . In many instances, R 0 has been inferred from real-time growth data by using the estimate of r 0 and by assuming that the generation-time distribution is known. However, it is very difficult to estimate the generation-time distribution in practice, because infection events are seldom directly observable. Indeed, the estimation methods of the generation time and its sampling scheme have yet to be developed. Previously, the distribution of the generation time (or, at least, the mean generation time) was implicitly (and wrongly) assumed to correspond exactly to that of serial interval. However, this is not the case when the incubation period of the primary case depends on the time from onset to secondary transmission [94] and even the means are different when we deal with diseases with asymptomatic secondary transmissions (which will be discussed below). Figure 3 illustrates an interpretation of the relationship between serial interval S, incubation periods F 1 and F 2 , and generation time G in the absence of asymptomatic cases (i.e. where there is no infected individual who does not exhibit any symptoms throughout the course of infection).

Early observations indicated that regardless of the frequency of respiratory activities or the number of particles generated by the different activities, very few particles actually carry pathogens 15 and that efficient disease transmission is more reliant upon pathogen load in particles and the flow of saliva than atomization of particles. 65 Of further significance is the relationship between particle size and infectivity. While it may be that many particles carry pathogen, pathogens may be inactivated due to desiccation and other environmental factors. Computer models have pointed out that aerosolised transmission dynamics are pathogen-specific, due to pathogenspecific peak shedding and inactivation rates 66 and that models need to include an inactivation parameter to account for pathogens that are no longer infectious. 67 Type of pathogen A number of fungal, bacterial and viral pathogens is responsible for causing respiratory infections by utilising aerosolised modes of transmission (see Table 2 ). The size of these pathogens may firstly dictate the size of the particle carrying the pathogen. For example, larger pathogens such as bacteria have been found in larger particles 54,55,68e70 whereas particles produced from virally infected individuals have been much smaller 49,56,71 (see Fig. 1 ). Secondly, the size of pathogens may dictate the infectivity of particles. Large pathogens, such as bacteria and fungi, may not be able to be carried at high concentration in particles without breaking up into smaller particles soon after expulsion. In light of this, some large sized pathogens may find it difficult to establish an infection if a high concentration of pathogen is required.",38.364851187182516,14.321470270235903

With that being said, a dominant cerebral involvement alone with the potential of causing cerebral edema in COVID-19 can take a lead in causing death long before systemic homeostatic dysregulation sets in.

It is expected that the differences in the sequence of spike proteins between COVID-19 virus and SARS-CoV ( Figure 2A ) will enable scientists to identify epitopes in COVID-19 virus for the development of monoclonal antibodies against this virus. With the recent COVID-19 outbreak, there is an urgent need to understand the neurotropic potential of the COVID-19 virus in order to prioritize and individualize the treatment protocols based on the severity of the disease and predominant organ involvement.

This is an inherently difficult parameter to estimate, since the true number of cases that can transmit infection at a given time is unknown (reported cases are likely to be just a small fraction of true cases) and probably varies over time (because of different interventions being introduced and population behaviour changing in response to the epidemic). In our analysis, we used an existing model that inferred time-dependent R e based on the growth of reported cases in Wuhan and the number of exported cases outside China originating from Wuhan. 14 We acknowledge that the underlying reproduction number in Wuhan could have been larger than that used in our study. However, other studies of early SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in Wuhan, using different methods, arrived at the same estimate with similar ranges. 1, 9 Although the precise effects of interventions might vary by country and different estimates of key parameters, our model highlights the usefulness of physical distancing interventions and the need to carefully calibrate their lifting to avoid second and subsequent waves of a COVID-19 epidemic. Areas of China outside Hubei and other east or southeast Asian regions have managed to avert a major outbreak locally and delayed the peak of the epidemic, without resorting to Hubei's extreme measures. 38 Policy makers are advised to reapportion their resources to focus on mitigating the effects of potentially soon-to-be overwhelmed health systems. 39 Non-physical distancing factors play a part in mitigating potential spikes in cases, especially when physical distancing measures are relaxed. The effects of seasonality on SARS-CoV-2 are difficult to predict without long time series; supporting evidence for the link between climate and COVID-19 has been largely anecdotal and based on spread in different settings and such analyses are subject to confounding. 40, 41 Consequently, we have not incorporated climatic factors into our mathematical model.

Although the reproductive number for SARS (R 0 , the average number of new cases resulting from a single infection in a susceptible community) was approximately 2-4, contact tracing was facilitated by its relatively long serial interval (time between onset of symptoms in successive patients in a chain of transmission: mean 8-10 days) and incubation period (median 4-5 days). Most infections did not lead to further transmission, although a small number of ""super-spreading"" events occurred in which single unrecognized cases transmitted to many people, usually in hospitals or households, before appropriate infection control precautions were in place (1).",54.32977104938115,18.079037591463624

These pathogenic microorganisms are often adsorbed on the solid or liquid particles suspended in the air to form aerosols or droplets, whereas very small amounts of pathogenic microorganisms in the air are usually sufficient to cause infection compared to other modes of transmission (Alford, Kasel, Gerone, & Knight, 1966) . For many respiratory viruses, the relative importance of different modes in transmission are controversial if not unknown, and can even vary within the same type of virus depending on the various viral, host and environmental factors (Branch-Elliman, Savor Price, McGeer, & Perl, 2015; Carlson, Budd, & Perl, 2010; Gautret et al., 2014) . However, in general, respiratory viruses considered to be transmitted mainly through droplets include SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), influenza virus, adenovirus, rhinovirus, RSV and parainfluenza virus, and viruses considered to be transmitted mainly through aerosols include measles (rubeola virus) and chickenpox (varicella-zoster virus) (Hall, 2000 (Hall, , 1982 Tang, Li, Eames, Chan, & Ridgway, 2006; Xie et al., 2007) , in addition to other modes such as direct or indirect contact (fomite) transmission (Boone & Gerba, 2007; Pica & Bouvier, 2012) . One study showed that a large community outbreak in SARS in Hong Kong could be explained by aerosol transmission (Yu et al., 2004) , while another study showed that environmental surfaces in the hospitals could be contaminated with SARS-CoV and therefore contact transmission was considered possible (Dowell et al., 2004) . It has been suggested that respiratory transmission of Ebola viruses could occur, although this is controversial (Osterholm et al., 2015; Vetter et al., 2016) . Several experimental studies indicate that EBOV can be transmitted through aerosols in various animal species (Jaax et al., 1995; Weingartl et al., 2012) . In addition to respiratory viruses, some enteroviruses can also be spread by airborne transmission through aerosol particles. For example, the main symptom of noroviruses infections is vomiting, a fine mist of virus particles passes into the air because of projectile vomiting. Droplets being inhaled by anyone in the immediate vicinity can be deposited in the upper respiratory tract, and subsequently be swallowed along with respiratory mucus (Bonifait et al., 2015) . The evidences supporting the relative importance of different modes of transmission for respiratory and enteric viruses are summarized in Table 2 . Additional discussion on modes of transmissions of these viruses can be found in the review by La Rosa et al. (2013) .",36.796810746212785,14.390528893477713

These components of disease risk rely on several factors that are external to the host-pathogen system. Extrinsic factors, such as urbanization, agriculture and socioeconomic standing, control host and human population dynamics underlying the frequency of transmissible contacts at the humanwildlife and the wildlife-livestock interface [5 , 18 , 20 -22] . Intrinsic factors (of hosts, pathogens, and vectors) combine with extrinsic factors to contribute to disease risk in humans. Intrinsic factors include life history [23 -25] , behavior [26 , 27] , competence [28 -30] , and rapid evolutionary changes in animal hosts and pathogens [31 -33] ; transmission modes and host breadth in pathogens [13 , 34 , 35] ; and differences in host susceptibility, often conferred by prosperity or poverty in human populations [36] , and pristine or degraded communities in wildlife hosts [37] .

In December, 2019, a novel coronavirus, named SARSCoV2, emerged in Wuhan, China, and led to a rapidly spreading outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19). By Jan 30, 2020, COVID19 was declared a public health emergency of international concern. The similarities between SARSCoV and SARS CoV2 are striking, not only in name. The whole genome of SARSCoV2 has a 86% similarity with SARSCoV. 1 Both viruses share high degrees of homology to SARS like coronaviruses isolated in bats, suggesting that bats are the probable origin of both SARSCoV and SARS CoV2. Live animal markets selling multiple species of wild and domestic animals in proximity to large populations of densely housed humans are thought to be the source of both outbreaks. Even in terms of disease dynamics there are apparent similarities. The main transmission route is thought to be respiratory droplets, although viral shedding via faeces has also been reported for both viruses. The angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2), found in the lower respiratory tract of humans, has been identified as the receptor used for cell entry for both SARSCoV and SARSCoV2. 2,3 COVID19 and SARS have a median incubation time of about 5 days. The mean serial interval of COVID19 is 7·5 days (95% CI 5·3-19·0) and the initial estimate for the basic number (R₀) was 2·2 (95% CI 1·4-3·9), 4 similar to that reported for SARS (mean serial interval 8·4 days, and basic R₀ range 2·2-3·6 for serial intervals of 8-12 days). 5 Risk factors for severe disease outcomes are old age and comorbidities.

For these respiratory diseases, a common approach has been to estimate the early growth rate from daily or aggregated case counts, combine this estimate with a (usually exogenous) estimate of the distribution of serial intervals, and produce an estimate of the early values of the reproductive number of the infection. Relatively high-quality estimates of the serial interval distribution were available from contact tracing for SARS, leading to rather consistent estimates of the initial reproductive number around 3. [42] [43] [44] Likewise, several sources of data provide estimates for the serial interval of pandemic influenza around 2-4 days, 45, 46 with corresponding estimates of early reproductive numbers ranging from around 1.3 to a bit over 2, depending on the pandemic and the setting. [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] While these estimates vary (reflecting true variation, methodological choices, and statistical noise), the range of variation in estimates is less than described above for epidemic cholera. The influenza literature contains explicit considerations of the appropriate values for natural-history parameters 45, 50, 51 (including critiques 45 of previously used values 48 ), discussions of the impact of data processing assumptions on reproductive number estimates, 35, 49 and extensive sensitivity analyses exploring the consequences of alternative parameter values. [52] [53] [54] Moving beyond parameter-value uncertainty to issues of model structure, the literature on respiratory diseases has considered how varying assumptions about the scale and ""localness"" of mixing, 55,56 the relative importance of various settings for transmission, 54 seasonality, 57 and other factors affect the predicted natural history of an epidemic and impact of control measures. The importance of heterogeneity is recognized in modeling many diseases. [58] [59] [60] [61] In summary, the issues raised here about the reliability of quantitative predictions from cholera models are applicable to other diseases, including those for which real-time (and retrospective) model fitting has been attempted, such as influenza and SARS. In these diseases, as well, sensitivity analyses to uncertain or heterogeneous parameters are needed, and have indeed been employed. 42, 62, 63 However, there appears to be less heterogeneity and less uncertainty about parameter values for these diseases, perhaps because of their direct person-to-person transmission route, which reduces the impact of environmental variables on parameter values and improves one's ability to measure relevant quantities. Thus, while the same issues should be considered in other diseases, we believe the magnitude of uncertainty in the predictions of models is greater for cholera than for SARS and influenza.",44.01600425399125,16.055699256905644

Since the finitepopulation reproductive numbers are limited by the size of the population whereas the infinite reproductive numbers are not, the finite-population reproductive numbers diverge from their corresponding infinite population reproductive number as R 0 approaches the size of the population. Where they diverge depends on both the distribution and the coefficient of variation of that distribution; although where the finite-population reproductive numbers depend on these factors, the finite-population reproductive number with CV ¼3 diverges around 1/5 N whereas the homogeneous finite-population reproductive number diverges around 1/2 N. Further, for heterogeneity in intrinsic mixing, the heterogeneous finite-population reproductive numbers are larger than the homogeneous finite-population reproductive number when R 0 is small relative to the size of the population and the heterogeneous finite-population reproductive numbers are smaller than the homogeneous finite-population reproductive number when R 0 is large relative to the size of the population.

If the reproductive number is 41, the expected number of new cases will increase, whereas if it is o1, then the numbers will fall. It is important to distinguish the incidence from the prevalence. Incidence is the number of new cases per unit time, whereas prevalence is the overall frequency of the disease in the population. The incidence can be falling but the prevalence can continue to rise, albeit at a slower rate. This is illustrated in Figure 1 , which shows an idealized epidemic curve, and how R changes over the course of the outbreak.

Here, we report the clinical characteristics and outcomes for both patients with COVID-19 and the anaesthetists who provided their spinal anaesthesia. Methods: Forty-nine patients with radiologically confirmed COVID-19 for Caesarean section or lower-limb surgery undergoing spinal anaesthesia in Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan, China participated in this retrospective study.

For anaesthesiologists exposed to patients with COVID-19 by providing spinal anaesthesia, the level of personal protective equipment (PPE) used, clinical outcomes (pulmonary CT scans), and confirmed COVID-19 transmission rates (polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) were reviewed. Results: Forty-nine patients with COVID-19 requiring supplementary oxygen before surgery had spinal anaesthesia (ropivacaine 0.75%), chiefly for Caesarean section (45/49 [91%]).

Both cause major infection-related morbidity and mortality around the world. Tuberculosis was the leading cause of mortality from an infectious disease worldwide in 2018, causing 1·2 million deaths. 1 COVID-19 has infected more than 300 000 people and caused over 13 000 deaths in the first quarter of 2020 alone. 2 Both COVID-19 and tuberculosis can present with respiratory symptoms, and diagnosis and treatment of people with tuberculosis, or tuberculosis and COVID-19 co-infection, are likely to be compromised during the COVID-19 pandemic. Older people and those with comorbidities are at increased risk of severe disease and adverse outcomes in both diseases. 3, 4 And, as we are discovering for COVID-19, both diseases have considerable social impact-including stigma, discrimination, and isolation-in addition to the economic impact from country productivity losses and catastrophic costs to individuals and households. 5 There are also stark differences. While tuberculosis is a slow pandemic and has accompanied humankind for millennia, 6 the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19 is new and spreading rapidly around the world. Tuberculosis has been labelled a pandemic many times over the past three centuries, whereas this is the first COVID-19 pandemic. Children are less severely affected by COVID-19, whereas 1·1 million children had tuberculosis disease in 2018, of whom 200 000 died. 1 The vast majority of cases and deaths from tuberculosis occur in low-income and middle-income countries, whereas high-income countries have low rates. 1 By contrast, Europe became the second epicentre of COVID-19 after China, which might explain, in part, why COVID-19 can be expected to mobilise more global resources and person-power in a year than tuberculosis has in decades. However, underprepared and vulnerable countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Central and South America might soon see substantial rises in COVID-19 cases and deaths, and concerted, collective action must be taken now to avoid catastrophe. 7 There are many unknowns. The clinical and epidemiological interactions of COVID-19 with tuberculosis (with or without HIV) are likely to be highly complex. Simply put, tuberculosis transmission might rise because of increased respiratory symptoms associated with COVID-19, or decline owing to COVID-19-related self-isolation and quarantine. There is increasing recognition of the millions of people treated for tuberculosis who have residual, long-term lung damage 8 who are likely to be at a higher risk of severe disease and death from COVID-19. Because of extreme pressures on health systems, exacerbated by COVID-19, people with tuberculosis are likely to face decreased access to diagnostic and treatment services, which might also result in adverse outcomes.",37.17730637264533,13.98449806029895

Despite the apparent simplicity of the SIR model, many recent studies of pandemic influenza have been built from this basic model structure. The model can be extended to include variation in transmission dynamics by factors such as age and spatial location. The equations above describe a deterministic process, although it is straightforward to allow stochasticity (random variability) in the dynamics, and this can be particularly important when describing the early stages of an epidemic. [6] Three epidemiologic parameters form the cornerstones of mathematical epidemiology: (i) the basic reproductive number R 0 , which is defined as the average number of secondary cases generated by an index case when an epidemic begins in a completely susceptible population (the reproductive number R has the same definition but without requiring a completely susceptible population); (ii) the mean generation time T g , which is defined as the average time it takes an index case to infect other individuals after he becomes infected; (iii) the growth rate of an epidemic r. The importance of these parameters stems from their intuitive implications on disease spread: If R 0 < 1, then an outbreak will die out without causing widespread infections. For a given R 0 > 1, the outbreak could lead to an epidemic and a shorter generation time would be associated with higher growth rate. The same results hold for the reproductive number R when considering a partially susceptible population. While the definitions of R 0 , T g and r are not model-dependent, model-based statistical inference of these parameters from epidemic data could be sensitive to the assumed structure of the model. [7] In the SIR model, the basic reproductive number is R 0 = βN/α, the mean generation time is T g = 1/α, and the epidemic growth rate is r = (R 0 −1)/T g .",55.96278286212375,24.991487241603846

Control parameters are thus divided into those describing case-management measures (h c , h h , q, g, k) and those describing contact precautions (h and r). The most difficult process to characterize in any epidemic is disease transmission. This can be divided into a contact process and the probability of transmission given contact. The former varies dramatically between communities (owing to, for example, usage patterns of public transport or housing density) and between diseases (owing to different modes of transmission); the latter also depends on both the disease (the proximity required for transmission) and the community (cultural mores relating to intimacy of contact and hygiene). Thus, transmission rates are both disease-and community-dependent and will vary from country to country, as well as between cities within a region .

A valuable metric for assessing the current threat posed by an outbreak is the time-dependent reproduction number, i.e. the expected number of secondary cases caused by each infected individual. This quantity can be estimated using data on the numbers of observed new cases at successive times during an epidemic and the distribution of the serial interval (the time between symptomatic cases in a transmission chain). Some methods for estimating the reproduction number rely on pre-existing estimates of the serial interval distribution and assume that the entire outbreak is driven by local transmission. Here we show that accurate inference of current transmissibility, and the uncertainty associated with this estimate, requires: (i) upto-date observations of the serial interval to be included, and; (ii) cases arising from local transmission to be distinguished from those imported from elsewhere. We demonstrate how pathogen transmissibility can be inferred appropriately using datasets from outbreaks of H1N1 influenza, Ebola virus disease and Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome. We present a tool for estimating the reproduction number in real-time during infectious disease outbreaks accurately, which is available as an R software package (EpiEstim 2.2).

The first published transmission dynamic study of COVID-19 was rapid and uncomplicated, estimating the basic reproduction number as time-invariant 5 without exploring some of the major underlying assumptions, such as lack of infectiousness during the incubation period. Since this early publication, many estimates for the reproduction rate have appeared, ranging from around 2 to more than 6. 6 In The Lancet Infectious Diseases, the study by Adam Kucharski and colleagues 7 addresses many of the assumptions of earlier works. The report contributes a time-varying reproduction number, showing the effect of the massive public health interventions put in place by China from Jan 23, 2020. By using additional datasets of travel-related exported cases, Kucharski and colleagues do not rely entirely on notified cases in Wuhan, which are likely to bias estimates caused by changes in case detection over time. The authors show that the reproduction number fell almost to the threshold value of 1 during the unprecedented public health restrictions in China. 7 Kucharski and colleagues 7 suggest that chains of transmission might not take off initially and might require up to four imported cases to establish transmission. This estimate assumes that SARS-CoV-2 has heterogeneity of infectiousness similar to SARS, which was characterised by a number of super-spreaders with most cases infecting no other people. If SARS-CoV-2 has a more homogenous infectiousness profile (to which emerging evidence is pointing) in which most people infect two to three others, the risk of established local transmission with a single imported case is considerably higher.",39.58599086505678,15.318327767311306

This potentially leads to delays between studies inferring the serial interval and subsequent analyses estimating transmissibility, or means that estimates of transmissibility are based on estimates of the serial interval from earlier outbreaks. Here, we used data from the 2013-2016 Ebola outbreak in Liberia to show that failing to account for full uncertainty in the serial interval distribution may lead to underestimating the uncertainty surrounding reproduction number estimates (Fig. 4c) . Moreover, ignoring recent data on the serial interval can dramatically impact estimates of the reproduction number and the uncertainty associated with those estimates (Figs. 3d, 4e) . This is of practical importance -as an example, a number of studies conducted during and after the 2013-16 West African Ebola outbreak (e.g. Wiratsudakul et al., 2016; Bakker and Wallinga, 2016; Dalziel et al., 2018) used the same single serial interval estimate obtained near the beginning of the outbreak (WHO Ebola Response Team, 2014). Our results suggest that using the latest available data on pairs of index and secondary cases, and fully accounting for the corresponding uncertainty in the serial interval estimates, may lead to very different, but more robust estimates of the reproduction number. It is worth noting that the pairs of index/secondary cases included in the estimation should be as representative as possible; in particular, if too recent index cases are considered, some of their secondary cases may not have been observed yet, leading to artificial underestimation of the serial interval.",36.44759879658649,12.90808320147306

Our present method for estimating b is purely theoretical and relies on our new SEIR model. Based on some sophisticated probabilistic arguments (cf.

As shown by the very recent case of the 2002-2003 epidemic SARS (Donnelly et al. [15] , Lipsitch et al. [36] , Riley et al. [53] , Bauch et al. [2] ), an accurate estimation of R 0 is essential for a successful control of newly emerging diseases by the public heath control measures. A large number of compartmental (both deterministic and stochastic) epidemic models (Anderson and May [1] , Hethcote [28] , Diekmann and Heesterbeek [14] ) have been proposed for this purpose (see Heffernan et al. [27] for a comprehensive review). But most of these models rely on the traditionally used assumption that both transmission processes of latency and recovery states are exponentially distributed. This assumption is biologically unrealistic, because it corresponds to assuming that such a transmission process is memoryless in the sense that the chance of change from a state 'A' to another state 'B' in a given time interval is independent of the time since the entrance into the previous state 'A'. More realistic distributions are, for example, the gamma or the log-normal distributions (Sartwell [54] ). However, the inclusion of gamma distributions, as shown by Lloyd [38, 39] and Wearing et al. [59] , could change drastically the patterns and dynamics of the epidemic models, as well as the estimate of the basic reproductive number R 0 .",43.02746576186136,15.453821095482908

The newly (re)-emerging diseases SARS, Ebola, AHC, FMD, influenza, influenza pandemic and avian influenza are put also into the category 'mild', since they have an observed relatively small basic reproductive number R 0 .

When estimating the serial interval, it is difficult to observe the symptom onset of the infector and infected person with precision. Estimates of the reproductive number were limited geographically ( Fig. 6) with estimates only available for seven countries. Settings with high TB burdens, especially high drug-resistant TB burdens such as the former Soviet Union [83] are not included in these papers. In addition, there was only one estimate from a high TB and high HIV burden country [47] . The lack of estimates could be because incidence and mortality rates are currently used to monitor TB control. These rates are not suitable for monitoring transmission; reductions in mortality could be attributed to improvements in treatment outcomes rather than any change in transmission and, due to the long incubation period of TB, changes in transmission could take years to impact incidence rates. In contrast, the reproductive number can provide a direct estimate of TB transmission itself. Most studies used mathematical models with various assumed model structures and parameters, making it difficult to compare the estimates and draw useful conclusions about the TB transmission dynamics by evaluating the reproductive number. The WHO End TB goals [4] include reducing TB deaths by 95% and incident cases by 90% by 2035. To achieve these goals, it is necessary to obtain improved estimates of the reproductive number and the SI as they can be used for monitoring and evaluating the effect of interventions on TB transmission. For example, the serial interval of TB can be used to determine how long one must monitor contacts of an infectious TB case to see if they will develop symptoms [84] . The effective reproductive number can be used to monitor the efficacy of interventions in reducing transmission. As interventions decrease transmission, estimates of the reproductive number should correspondingly decrease [41] ; in particular, if the reproductive number can be maintained below one, the disease can potentially be eliminated.",77.28287142711821,28.693625316712062

An R e > 1 indicates that the disease will continue to spread while an R e < 1 indicates that the disease will eventually die out. Although the reproductive number is usually defined as the average number of secondary cases, it is occasionally defined as the average number of secondary infections [7] [8] [9] [10] , a distinction that is important for a disease with a long incubation period (the time between infection and developing symptomatic disease) and/or only a fraction of infections progressing to disease.

He infected 26 cases in Hospital C, and consecutive nosocomial transmission proceeded throughout the nation. We provide an epidemiologic description of the outbreak, as of July 2015. Methods: Epidemiological research was performed by direct interview of the confirmed patients and reviewing medical records. We also analyzed the incubation period, serial interval, the characteristics of superspreaders, and factors associated with mortality. Full genome sequence was obtained from sputum specimens of the index patient. Results: A total of 186 confirmed patients with MERS-CoV infection across 16 hospitals were identified in the Republic of Korea. Some 44.1% of the cases were patients exposed in hospitals, 32.8% were caregivers, and 13.4% were healthcare personnel. The most common presenting symptom was fever and chills. The estimated incubation period was 6.83 days and the serial interval was 12.5 days.

The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 as public health emergency after it spread outside China to numerous countries. Thus, an assessment of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with novel approaches is essential to the global debate. This study is the first to develop both time series and panel data models to construct conceptual tools that examine the nexus between death from COVID-19 and confirmed cases. We collected daily data on four health indicators namely deaths, confirmed cases, suspected cases, and recovered cases across 31 Provinces/States in China. Due to the complexities of the COVID-19, we investigated the unobserved factors including environmental exposures accounting for the disease spread through human-to-human transmission. We used estimation methods capable of controlling for cross-sectional dependence, endogeneity, and unobserved heterogeneity. We predict the impulse-response between confirmed cases of COVID-19 and COVID-19-attributable deaths. Our study reveals that the effect of confirmed cases on the novel coronavirus attributable deaths is heterogeneous across Provinces/States in China. We find a linear relationship between COVID-19 attributable deaths and confirmed cases whereas a nonlinear relationship is confirmed for the nexus between recovery cases and confirmed cases. The empirical evidence reveals that an increase in confirmed cases by 1% increases coronavirus attributable deaths by~0.10%-~1.71% (95% CI). Our empirical results confirm the presence of unobserved heterogeneity and common factors that facilitates the novel coronavirus attributable deaths caused by increased levels of confirmed cases.

The higher the transmission rate of the disease per unit time and the longer the duration of the infectious period, the larger the R 0 . A disease which is highly infectious for a short period of time may have the same basic reproduction number as a disease that is not as infectious but has a much longer infectious period. For diseases with similar characteristics the basic reproduction number is different for each population, as the opportunities for onward infection are affected by the contact patterns of a population. In a city where most people commute to work by public transport, for example, the opportunities for onward transmission of an airborne pathogen may be much greater than in less densely populated areas. For many directly transmitted diseases, such as measles 1 and pandemic influenza, 11 R 0 is usually assumed to be similar in unvaccinated populations. For sexually transmitted diseases, large differences in sexual behaviour within populations can lead to estimates of R 0 for heterosexual populations from 2 for low risk populations 17 to over 10 for high activity groups and sex workers. 18 Generation time, serial interval, T g Alongside the basic reproduction number, it is important to have some estimate of how quickly the number of cases of a novel infection will grow and how long an outbreak will last. The generation time, T g , is defined as average time from an individual being infected to that individual infecting others. 1, 14, 19, 20 This includes any latent period when the infected individual may not show symptoms or may not be infectious, and excludes any period when infected individuals may still be showing symptoms but are no longer infectious.

Molecular tools can usefully be applied in studies estimating each of these parameters. Before the availability of modern molecular tools, our ability to empirically estimate transmission probabilities was limited. Although the transmission of a sexually transmitted infection can be estimated by following couples where one is infected and the other is susceptible, without molecular tools, it is difficult to verify that the transmission event came from within the partnership. For respiratory infections, such as pulmonary tuberculosis, our estimates of the transmission probability and natural history have been based on careful documentation of outbreaks. However, as we have been able to type individual strains, we have determined that tuberculosis cases that previously were considered sporadic and not part of apparent time-space clusters (because the exposure to the index case was very limited) were indeed part of the same outbreak. 11",39.64309030370833,15.109883923917236

Although rigorous attempts were made to confine the disease, this infection has continued to spread throughout the world. At the date of this publication, there are confirmed COVID-19 cases in 162 countries worldwide with growing concern that the infection will quickly reach pandemic proportions. As per Bruce Aylward, head of a World Health Organization (WHO) expert mission to China, the world is ""simply not ready"" to contain this outbreak. 4 China's extraordinary measure of instituting a quarantine in Wuhan and surrounding areas afforded the world a few months of lead time to prepare. However, according to the Dr. Tom Frieden who is the former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a coronavirus pandemic is inevitable. 5 The number of confirmed cases and patient deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have already exceeded those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS). 6 Healthcare systems worldwide should be prepared for an unusually high volume of patients in the next few months. This will include patients with COVID-19 in addition to patients requiring emergent care for other illnesses. Rapid diagnosis is essential for efficient patient triage. The RT-PCR test kits disseminated by the CDC are considered the gold of standard for COVID-19 diagnosis 7 , but several studies have shown that a negative initial PCR does not exclude COVID-19 infection 8, 9 . Additionally, it may take up to 48 hours to receive the final results, which limits the utility of this diagnostic test during initial triage of these patients in the emergency setting. In a recent study published in Radiology, based on a retrospective study of 1014 patients, the diagnostic sensitivity of chest CT for COVID-19 is significantly greater than that of RT-PCR (98% vs 59%), but the specificity is limited (25%) 7 . Proposed explanations for the decreased sensitivity of RT-PCR include low viral load, immature development of RT-PCR technology, and suboptimal clinical sampling. This study concluded that chest CT can be used as a screening tool for COVID-19 in cases with a high pretest probability, as evidenced by patients demonstrating clinical manifestations compatible with COVID-19 infection. Therefore, it is expected that there will be a significant interest in increasing in the number of imaging studies ordered for suspected cases of COVID-19 from both Emergency Medicine Department and Inpatient services. Given the low specificity of CT for diagnosing COVID-19, the American College of Radiology (ACR) does not recommend the use of CT for screening or as a first-line test for diagnosing COVID-19. 10",31.509184478748374,11.060353490372485

A key factor that determines whether a pathogen can persist and spread in a new population is its basic reproductive rate, which is the number of secondary infections produced in a susceptible population by a typical infectious individual. To become established in a new host population, a pathogen must have a basic reproductive rate that exceeds one. The basic reproductive rate for a pathogen is affected by a range of biologic, social and environmental factors, so may vary by place and population. Also critical in determining how easily an infection can be controlled is the proportion of transmission that occurs before onset of symptoms or during asymptomatic infection. 32 Multiple factors restrict the introduction and spread or persistence of infection in a region (Box 106-4). Nutrition determines susceptibility to and severity of many infections. A substantial proportion of disease burden in LMIC can be attributed to childhood and maternal weight and micronutrient deficiences. 33 Before measles vaccine was introduced, the epidemiology of measles exhibited marked periodicity in large populations, with peaks typically occurring every 2-3 years. 34 In small island communities (or other isolated populations), outbreaks typically occur only after periodic introductions from outside.

This value represents the average number of new infections caused by an infectious individual in an immunologically naïve host population (Anderson and May 1991) . Subsequent work has shown that the intensity of macroparasitic infections (e.g. worms per individual) generally follows a negative binomial distribution with high skew (Shaw and Dobson 1995) , with more highly infected individuals potentially being responsible for more transmission events. A later study proposed the ""20/80"" rule, and showed that in a variety of disease systems, 20% of hosts were responsible for 80% of transmission events (Woolhouse et al. 1997 ). Thus, models allowing for heterogeneity in the distribution of the expected number of new infections an infectious individual produces (rather than using a single mean value, R 0 ) have transformed the epidemiological modeling of diseases by accounting for changes in disease dynamics that result from such heterogeneities (Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005) . Importantly, heterogeneous transmission also occurs in cases where amplification host species or environmental 'hotspots' contribute disproportionately to disease transmission within a community or landscape ( Fig. 1 ).

Some people in the incubation period become confirmed patients (infections), and the ratio of this process is α. Some healthy people are still in the incubation period, which is directly affected by the infection index F . The third formula shows the increase in the number of diagnosed infections per unit of time. The proportion of people with a ratio of α changes from incubation period to confirmed patients.

Some studies suggest a high rate of AKI events upon COVID-19 infection, whereas a recent study from Wuhan, China, reported that AKI happened in <5% of the hospitalized patients with this viral infection. 11 As more studies are underway, it is prudent that during an active COVID-19 we ensure the mitigation of PEW risk and immediate correction of PEW in all patients with kidney diseases including transplant recipients. We encourage adequate protein and calorie intake, be it enterally or parenterally, so that any occurrence of hypokalemia or hypophosphatemia can be avoided and that PEW, sarcopenia and cachexia can be prevented or immediately corrected. 12 In the midst of this serious infection there is no role for delaying nutrition support or for low protein, low phosphorus, or low potassium regimens if the patient has COVID-19 infection. 13 Therefore, the need to supervise the nutrition regimens of patients with kidney diseases may be enhanced during this period and should not be ignored while focusing on other, seemingly more urgent, matters.

Initially they assumed that no between-species transmission was present. Using the prevalence of infectious individuals, together with field data on population structure and density derived from the same sites, they computed the basic reproductive number R 0 for each of the species. The analyses showed that even when the maximum likely prevalence was assumed (based on the upper 95% confidence limit), the R 0 (the basic reproductive rate of the disease) ranged from just 1.003 in wood mice to 1.05 in rats. (The lower confidence intervals for prevalence always gave R 0 values that were <1.0; Mathews et al., 2006b .) It is therefore unlikely that the disease would persist within single-host systems in the wild: the animals are unable to pass on the infection to their conspecifics at a rate high enough to maintain the disease. The findings are robust to underdiagnosis of infection: to affect the R 0 materially, the prevalences would need to be have been underestimated very substantially. If, instead of single-host models, we assumed multiple-host systems, then higher prevalences should have been observed in the field than those recorded. Alternatively, to achieve the prevalences seen in reality, the withinspecies transmission rate would have to be even lower than the very low value calculated. They have therefore been able to conclude that multi-species transmission of bTB within farmland wildlife communities appears unlikely.",38.28086021102986,15.246473184179587

Traditionally, epidemiologists describe disease emergence in terms of the standard epidemiological measure ''basic reproductive rate'' (R 0 ) of a pathogen (the number of infections per infected individual in a completely immunologically naive population) and ''critical host threshold density'' (N t , the population size for which a pathogen (R 0 ‡ 1) can persist (Anderson and May, 1986; Anderson et al., 1992; Grenfell et al., 2004) . More recently, it has been recognized that ecological factors which increase transmission also increase ongoing opportunities for adaptive evolution in the pathogen (Antia et al., 2003; Woolhouse et al., 2005) , can increase R 0 and, thus, affect the probability of disease emergence or reemergence. In enzootics, such as H5N1, where the ecological conditions appear to be in place for emergence, yet barriers to crossspecies transmission exist, we must combine both the social-ecological context and evolutionary potential (mutation, genetic drift, recombination, and adaptation due to natural selection) of the pathogen to begin to quantify the risk of emergence.",36.35918644700443,14.356249541758482

Data that identifies when an individual was exposed to infection and when their secondary transmissions occurred, such as family-based transmission studies or contact tracing data-even if incomplete-can be highly informative in this regard [2, 4, 12, 13] . It is important to realize that models are often framed in terms of transmission status, e.g. whether an individual is infectious, while data may reflect disease status, e.g. whether an individual is symptomatic or not.

In turn, the infection rate is a product of the rate at which an infective meets susceptible individuals, i.e. the contact rate, and the per-contact probability of transmission. Direct estimation of the basic reproductive number could be undertaken if secondary infections of individual infectives could be quantified. Unfortunately, the most commonly available type of data-aggregated incidence data-does not reveal transmission chains in sufficient detail to identify the source of secondary cases.

There is an analogous statement for epidemic dynamics in a community of households. Define the infectious contact interval distribution is a community of households as (4.5.4) where as before, β h (t) is the expected intensity of infectiousness of a household of size h infected t time units ago -see equation 3.0.10. Again, one can apply the Euler-Lotka equation using the number of newly infected households, where households are treated as individuals, with the serial interval distribution w H (t) and the reproductive number R H . Thus infectious spead in a community of households will grow exponentially at rate r given by solution to (4.5.5) or alternatively, (4.5.6) where M w H is the moment-generating function for the density w H ( ).

When no or few cases of disease have been reported in a country, laboratory testing is restricted to travellers presenting with an acute respiratory syndrome and coming from regions or countries with widespread transmission. When contact tracing efforts are implemented, criteria for laboratory testing often include symptomatic contacts of confirmed cases or asymptomatic contacts during or after quarantine. After local transmission is established, some countries, such as South Korea, have chosen to test all individuals who have acute respiratory syndrome or who have had contact with a confirmed case. 3 Because of limited testing capacity, other countries, such as Italy or Spain, have restricted laboratory testing to those seeking hospital care for severe COVID symptoms or to those prone to severe disease (the elderly and patients with comorbidities). 4 Thus, curves based on confirmed cases in countries that have been changing the testing recommendations and are now using stringent testing criteria could provide a false impression of flattening (or unmask much steeper curves), which could lead to misinterpretation of the status of the epidemic. By contrast, and as a basic epidemiological concept, comparisons of the number of COVID-19 cases by country or region should be adjusted by the size of the population at risk, using incidence risks (ie, new cases in a population at risk within a specified period of time, also called attack rates in the context of an epidemic). Similarly, mortality is better expressed as mortality risk (ie, number of deaths in a specific time interval divided by population size among which deaths occurred, commonly referred to as mortality rate; figure) and, if possible, should be stratified by age, given the differences in age-specific mortality rates for COVID-19 5,6 and the differential age structure by country. When the epidemic is contained and all cases are identified and contacts traced, absolute number of cases would still be an acceptable indicator if testing criteria have not changed. However, the capacity of countries to detect imported cases varies but is generally poor, estimated to be around 38% at the global level. 7 Thus, the crucial question is how to monitor disease burden when local transmission is widespread and a large proportion of the population has been quarantined or confined at home. We believe that the basic principle is to try to select an indicator that includes the numerator that is least affected by changing testing criteria and that is adjusted by population size. In regions with strong hospital admission or mortality surveillance systems, such an indicator could be the incidence risk of hospital admissions of laboratory-confirmed cases and COVID-19 mortality rates, which should provide a reliable picture of the epidemic, with the following assumptions: (1) most people with severe disease are admitted to hospital and are tested for SARS-CoV-2;",35.912604356955065,13.34480226988862

Alternatively, the host population may be highly structured so that small host subgroups are infected quickly, but jumps between subgroups are more difficult, e.g. foot-and-mouth transmission between distinct farms. Although it is common for mathematical models to be used qualitatively to investigate specific hypotheses regarding alternative modes of transmission in such pathogen-host systems, it is less common (although certainly not unknown) for them to be used as models in the inferential sense to compare multiple hypotheses.

Here we aim to investigate the importance of spillover transmission for explaining the number and the size of outbreaks. We propose a simple continuous time stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model with a recurrent infection of an incidental host from a reservoir (e.g. humans by a zoonotic species), considering two modes of transmission, (1) animal-to-human and (2) human-to-human. The model assumes that (i) epidemiological processes are faster than other processes such as demographics or pathogen evolution and that (ii) an epidemic occurs until there are no susceptible individuals left. The results show that during an epidemic, even when the pathogens are barely contagious, multiple outbreaks are observed due to spillover transmission. Overall, the findings demonstrate that the only consideration of direct transmission between individuals is not sufficient to explain the dynamics of zoonotic pathogens in an incidental host.",34.430898733083126,14.225508415202597

The infection can spillover by contact between the reservoir and the incidental host at rate τ S where S is the number of susceptible individuals and τ is the rate at which an individual becomes infected from the reservoir. In the incidental host, the infection can propagate by direct contact at rate βSI where I is the number of infected individuals and β is the individual rate of infection transmission. An infected individual can recover at rate γ . The propensity of the pathogen to be transmitted between individuals within host is expressed in terms of the basic reproductive ratio of the pathogen, R 0 , which is widely used in epidemiology. R 0 corresponds to the average number of secondary infections produced by an infected individual in an otherwise susceptible population. In a deterministic model, for a pathogen to invade the population, R 0 must be larger than 1 in the absence of reservoir. In a stochastic model, the higher the R 0 the higher the probability for the pathogen to invade the population. In a SIR model, the basic reproductive ratio R 0 equals to βN / γ . Individuals in the recovered compartment do not contribute anymore to the transmission process. Since we assume that demographic processes are slower than epidemic processes, the number of susceptible individuals decreases during the epidemic due to the consumption of susceptible by the infection until the extinction of the susceptible population. In other words, in our model, R 0 will decrease because of the successive spillovers from the reservoir.

Generally, the occurrence of epidemics in humans is attributed to the ability of the pathogen to propagate between individuals. In the case of a single-host process, the notion of the basic reproductive ratio R 0 seems sufficient to evaluate the spread of the pathogen in a population entirely composed of susceptible individuals. In EIDs, R 0 is also used to gauge the risk of pandemics. In this way, Lloyd-Smith et al. (2009) delineate the three stages identified for a zoonotic pathogen ( Wolfe et al., 2007 ) by using the ability of the pathogen to spread between individuals. Each stage corresponds to a specific epidemiological dynamics ranging from a non-contagious pathogen making an outbreak impossible (Stage II, R 0 = 0 ) to a barely contagious pathogen with few outbreaks and stuttering chains of transmission (Stage III, R 0 < 1) to a contagious pathogen making a large outbreak possible (Stage IV, R 0 > 1). The aim of the Wolfe's classification is to establish each stage at which a zoonotic pathogen may evolve to be adapted to human transmission only, in order to identify pathogens at potential risk of pandemics. However, in our model, by taking into account the recurrent emergence of the pathogen from the reservoir, the three dynamics that define the three stages will depend on both the spillover transmission and the direct transmission of the pathogen between individuals. The results suggest that in the case of pathogen spilling recurrently over an incidental host, the direct transmission should not be the only parameter to consider.",33.421902201350754,13.42572499078679

For this reason, the World Health Organization (WHO) and other authorities have recommended the adoption of adequate prevention and control measures for HCWs. WHO has recommended that HCWs should use proper personal protective equipment (PPE), such as medical masks, gowns, gloves and eye protection [3] . In some cases, such as in aerosol-generating procedures, WHO has recommended the use of FFP2 respirator masks [3] . Strict compliance with these recommended measures and with good practice procedures for managing infectious diseases may minimize the risk of virus transmission from patients to HCWs.

According to the stochastic SIR model coupled with a reservoir analysed here, the same dynamics can be observed depending on the relative contribution of the transmission from the reservoir and the direct transmission by contact with an infected individual (see Fig. 4 ). For example, a large outbreak is observed either for a high spillover transmission or for a high direct transmission. The proposed stochastic model makes it possible to understand the effects of the infection from the reservoir or from direct transmission on the epidemiological dynamics in an incidental host when empirically this distinction is difficult. Empirically, the origin of the infection is established by determining the contact patterns of in-fected individuals during the incubation period.

He infected 26 cases in Hospital C, and consecutive nosocomial transmission proceeded throughout the nation. We provide an epidemiologic description of the outbreak, as of July 2015. Methods: Epidemiological research was performed by direct interview of the confirmed patients and reviewing medical records. We also analyzed the incubation period, serial interval, the characteristics of superspreaders, and factors associated with mortality. Full genome sequence was obtained from sputum specimens of the index patient. Results: A total of 186 confirmed patients with MERS-CoV infection across 16 hospitals were identified in the Republic of Korea. Some 44.1% of the cases were patients exposed in hospitals, 32.8% were caregivers, and 13.4% were healthcare personnel. The most common presenting symptom was fever and chills.

This is closely related to the density and communication between susceptible populations because for virus transmission, a certain proximity between hosts or hosts and vectors is necessary. The smaller the population size of the host, the less likely transmission will be and, consequently, the more difficult to be sustained long enough to cause acute infections. However, large, dense host populations can easily sustain a virus that causes short, virulent infections. In this context, the analysis of the basic reproductive number (R 0 ) is highly relevant. This number depends on several factors, such as the number of contacts with susceptible individuals, the probability of transmission, and the length of the infectious period (Dietz 1993 ).

It has spread rapidly to other areas in China and worldwide. [3, 4] The most common manifestations of COVID-19 included fever, dry cough, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, hypolymphaemia, and radiographic evidence of pneumonia. Complications (eg, acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS] , arrhythmia, shock, acute cardiac injury, secondary infection, and acute kidney injury) and death may occur in severe cases. [2,5À7] The course of the COVID-19 is long, and COVID-19 is highly contagious even during the incubation period. [8] Furthermore, asymptomatic carrier of SARS-CoV-2, accounting for 1% of the laboratory confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-infection, [9] may potentially transmit the virus during incubation time, [10] which makes the identification and prevention of COVID-19 infection highly challenging. During the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak, we encountered a small number of asymptomatic patients who underwent elective surgeries during the incubation period of COVID-19 infection, but the clinical manifestations and prognosis of these patients were beyond our expectation.

However, some limitations of these studies should be noted. First, in a household transmission study, index cases are generally enrolled after presenting for medical attention and therefore are biased towards infections that cause more serious illness. If more severe illness was associated with greater transmissibility, then the estimates of transmissibility from household transmission studies may be overestimated. More generally, in household transmission studies it is not possible to estimate the total number of secondary infections in all settings caused by one index case (i.e. the reproductive number) because data are not collected outside the household. Second, because of the case ascertainment, households without any infections will not be enrolled (Figure 1 ), and it is not possible to estimate population based rates of infection unless the transmission study is nested in a larger cohort study. Third, it is possible to characterize the mild end of clinical severity by assessing illnesses in household contacts, but severe disease is rare and only very large transmission studies would be able to estimate for example the risk of hospitalization if infected with influenza.",37.95455275094709,14.83475281537245

Compared with other type of close contacts, household contacts are easier to identify and follow up, and provide a well-defined number of susceptible people that are likely to have been exposed to infection, compared with other settings such as schools, offices or hospitals. Household cohort studies can also permit inference on the transmission dynamics of influenza in households, providing valuable data on transmission in the broader community because a substantial fraction of influenza virus transmission events do occur in households [21, 22] . However, in many cohort studies infections are ascertained by serologic analysis, which can have imperfect sensitivity and specificity, and only provides what is known as final size data in which the number of infected and uninfected household members is known at the end of each epidemic [5] . Specialized methods have been developed to permit inference on transmission dynamics (who was infected by whom) based on final size data, allowing for the risks of acquiring infection from outside or inside the household [5, 23, 24] . It can be challenging to explore heterogeneities in transmission dynamics due to individual characteristics, for example age, when only final size data are available [7] . In addition, it is not possible to estimate the serial interval based on final size data although this epidemiologic parameter, measuring the average time between illness onset in an infected person and a secondary case infected by that person, is an important parameter for mechanistic models (also called mathematical models) of influenza epidemics that are often used for policy planning [22, 25] . Some of these limitations can be ameliorated by careful collection of respiratory specimens from ill individuals, although intense follow up for illnesses over a prolonged period is challenging and demands considerable resources [26, 27] .",41.830327163126285,14.567295493677431

By using this generation interval for the duration of the epidemic, a constant and high importance of short-distance transmission mechanisms was assumed. However, as the epidemic grew, these short-distance transmission mechanisms were likely to be less important; or in, other words, as farms around a case became infected and immune, short-distance transmission was likely to be less involved in disease spread. Thus, we investigated the variations of R e by giving less weight to short-distance transmission and more weight to long-distance transmission. To obtain such serial interval distributions, the D 0 (s,t) distribution was flattened by using a 2-dimensional double exponential kernel function with bandwidth values equal to 1, 3, and 5, resulting in 3 smoothed surfaces ( Figure 3 ). It was assumed that the bandwidth equal to 1 would better correspond to the serial interval distribution at the early stage of the epidemic and that bandwidth values 3 and 5 would better describe the intensity of the transmission when the population started to be immune (i.e., at the later stages of the epidemic).",43.54461578643814,16.094633832730583

However, the assumption that generation intervals are independent and identicallydistributed (iid) severely constrains the underlying epidemic model. Consider a model with only two people, i and j. Upon infection, there is a constant hazard λ of infectious contact. The infectious period is with probability p or with probability q = 1 -p. If person i is infected and person j is susceptible, the generation interval X has the probability density function (pdf) where 1 S equals one if S is true and zero otherwise. Now suppose i can transmit infection to a second susceptible k, and assume that transmission between j and k cannot occur (to avoid generation interval contraction). The generation interval Y from i to k has the pdf g(y). However, the joint pdf of X and Y is because the infectious period of i is either or , not both. X and Y are independent if and only if p = 0 or q = 0. A similar result holds for the latent period from infection to the onset of infectiousness. Suppose i has infectious period ι and becomes infectious immediately with probability p or after a latent period ε > 0 with probability q = 1 -p. Then X and Y each have the pdf but their joint pdf is Again, X and Y are independent if and only if p = 0 or q = 0.

However, experience with other respiratory viruses suggests that travel restrictions have a limited effect. Mateus and colleagues (1) found that such restrictions decreased new cases of influenza by only 3% and delayed but did not prevent influenza epidemics. Similarly, Errett and colleagues (2) identified minimal evidence to support the effectiveness of travel bans as a control measure for emerging infectious diseases. Read and colleagues (3) suggest that, because only 5% of infections have been identified, even a travel reduction that is 99% effective may reduce the epidemic outside Wuhan province by no more than 24.9%. Other investigators (4) estimate that almost 59 000 cases occurred in Wuhan and 3500 in other regions of China before the travel ban was implemented. Hence, the ban may simply reduce the progression of the outbreak by only 3 to 5 days within China. Finally, a recent report (5) suggests that 46% of cases would be missed by airport-based screening because of COVID-19's incubation period, the spectrum of symptoms, and the time during the incubation period in which persons may fly.

Considering the speed of transmission of COVID-19, individuals from vulnerable health systems are at particular risk. An example is the Eastern European countries that in recent years faced health system vulnerabilities due to post-communism delayed reforms, corruption, and the emigration of physicians [3] . Romania is a concerning example of a vulnerable health system [3] with the highest governmental instability within the EU [4] , the leadership of the Romanian Ministry of Health changed 25 times in 27 years, a turnover three times higher than in other EU countries [4] . In its recent history, Romania experienced a series of economic crises (in the 1990s, and in late 2000s) which forced an estimated~5 million people to emigrate, including in countries where currently COVID-19 was identified (especially in Italy, Spain, Germany and United Kingdom). Many of these migrants regularly travel back to Romania which increases the likelihood for COVID-19 to spread [1] to Romania. Rising public awareness among migrant travelers and providing hygiene products is highly suggested to limit the spread of COVID-19. After the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Romanian Ministry of Health released late January a set of recommendations and proceeded to the acquisition of medical equipment with the purpose of initial identification of travelers that show COVID-19 symptoms [5] . As the Romanian government collapsed on February 5th, 2020, public auctions were suspended and the confusion among population is very high combined with the political instability. As this unstable situation continues how will Romania cope with the spread of the COVID-19 by incoming travelers? Romania has 14 international (out of 16) airports that are highly connected with airports across all EU (in 2019, over 23 million passengers used these airports), including from countries where COVID-19 was already identified in the EU. The vulnerability is even higher considering the high potential of false-negative rate of diagnostic of COVID-19 that already has been documented [6] and the lack of personnel. As such, public awareness, widespread public health measures, and close collaboration with countries from which incoming travelers are arriving in Romania is a key to limit the spread of COVID-19 and promote the wellbeing of travelers and the members of the community (resident or diaspora).",34.69627669647181,12.418227649412508

A similar application of the convolution equation has been intensively studied in modeling HIV/AIDS. Since AIDS has a long incubation period, and because AIDS diagnosis is certainly reported in the surveillance data (at least, in industrialized countries), backcalculation of the number of HIV infections with time using the number of AIDS diagnoses and the incubation period distribution has been an issue to capture the whole epidemiologic picture of HIV/AIDS [139] [140] [141] [142] . In the current modeling practice using the temporal distribution of onset events, we are now faced with a need to apply this technique to diseases with much shorter incubation periods. Now, let us look back at a method to estimate R(t), which was proposed by Wallinga and Teunis [41] . Whereas the method has a background of mathematical reasoning (as shown in (46), Section 4.2), the estimator was derived implicitly assuming that observed data exactly reflects infection events. If asymptomatic infection and transmission are rare, this assumption might be justifiable as the lengths of the serial interval and generation time become almost identical. However, as long as we cannot ignore asymptomatic transmissions, which is particularly the case for influenza, the assumption s(σ ) = w(τ ) might be problematic [85] .",41.02806546150672,15.97528244307299

In the simplest models, R 0 is the product of three factors: the contact rate, the conditional probability of transmission per contact, and the duration of the infectious period. It is used to indicate whether or not the infection prevalence will increase or decrease. When R 0 > 1 the pathogen may spread, when R 0 < 1 it will not. The basic reproductive ratio, or variants such as the effective reproduction number (which measures transmission in a population that may be only partially susceptible) and the control reproduction number (which measures transmission in a susceptible population with control measures in place), are then used to inform disease management (Brauer and Castillo-Chavez 2013) .

When coupled with strict PPE use and standard infection control procedures, hospital fomite, contact and droplet transmissions were efficiently controlled. As a result, community SARS infection rates declined as well. Success was evidenced by no new diagnosed cases over two one-week incubation periods following TCB implementation. 3, 4 TCB is particularly effective as regards to the role of fomites. As noted, fomite transmission played a central role in SARS 2003. However, fomites have also proven important during other outbreaks. As with SARS, during MERS 2015 there were numerous examples of HCWs contracting the virus even when fully gowned and often despite having had no direct contact with carriers. 6 For example, during the Korean MERS outbreak, one super-spreader infected 82 people in a medical center. Initial analyses pointed to transmission by the index case via droplets and contact Figure 1 . Proposed mechanism of community-hospitalcommunity chain of amplification in COVID-19. with exposed people in the same care zone. However, later analysis found that those without contact history with the index case were likely infected by fomites on bed curtains and/or public restroom fixtures touched by the index case who had been suffering from walking pneumonia and diarrhea. 9 Similar findings were identified regarding interactions of fomite-related nosocomial and community transmissions during H1N1 2009 and Ebola 2014. 4e6 In the COVID-19 case, after a long incubation period, family clusters related to Huanan market developed (Fig. 1,  arrow 1) . Early in the outbreak, much as with SARS, transmission via droplets and fomites began cycling between the local community and clinics and hospitals via waiting rooms crowded by both ill and healthy people (Fig. 1, arrow 2) . In this case, nosocomial spread began among both HCWs and visitors to the hospitals, who when returning home, reinfected their communities (Fig. 1, arrow 3 ). This process extended the transmission cycle in a positive feedback loop, amplifying the outbreak (Fig. 1, arrows 4 &5 ) and cascading to the point of community saturation (Fig. 1) . 4 In short, following a dynamic similar to earlier coronavirus outbreaks, COVID-19 spread from the Wuhan epicenter to nearby communities and outward within China and internationally. However, COVID-19 has some unique characteristics. These include asymptomatic infection; a hyper-affinity to ACE2 receptors resulting in high transmissibility; false negatives, and; an incubation period of up to 22 days. 10, 11 These characteristics necessitate enhancement to the TCB protocols to ensure effective transmission control. 6 Enhanced TCB (eTCB) includes two enhancements to traditional TCB. First, where TCB has a contamination zone (Isolation ward) and a transition zone, eTCB expands the transition zone to incorporate a quarantine ward as well. The quarantine ward houses patients with atypical manifestations and patients awaiting final diagnosis. These patients are transferred to the quarantine ward directly from outdoor triage and are held there for the full incubation period. 6 (Fig. 2) .",39.08924006183252,14.207255701877244

The result is a relatively easily transmitted virus with a case fatality rate currently estimated as well above that of the seasonal influenza. With its high transmissibility and rapid global circulation, COVID-19 is being compared with the deadly Spanish flu outbreak of 1918. 1 On 30 January, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern. Since erupting in China, it has claimed thousands of lives there, and has now spread globally, causing infections, death and growing alarm. The WHO's initial focus was on managing droplet and contact transmission, but it has since recognized the role fomites play as well. 2 Fomites are important because while populations generally protect themselves from clearly observable droplet transmissions (coughing, sneezing), being invisible, fomite transmission is regularly overlooked both in hospitals and communities. 3e5 Consequently, during the community saturation phase, fomite transmission may play a larger role than droplet transmission as a mechanism in emergent infectious diseases. 3e6 In this paper we argue that by implementing enhanced Traffic Control Bundling (eTCB), 6 an extension of the TCB deployed by Taiwan during the 2003 SARS outbreak, countries can interrupt the community-hospital-community transmission cycle, thereby limiting COVID-19's impact.",34.987428833133684,12.547341339966005

The nonnegative solution of the model is provided by using the generalized mean value theorem. We obtained the basic reproductive number R 0 , which perform as a threshold parameter in the disease control. We established and investigated the stability analysis of the fractional-order model with respect to the values of R 0 . The disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable if R 0 < 1. For R 0 > 1, using Lemma 5.1 and condition 6, we investigated the local stability of the positive endemic equilibrium state. Sensitivity analysis shows that R 0 is most sensitive to the disease transmission rate β. This recommends that periodic monitoring by medical professionals and researchers should be done to control the transmission of the disease. Additionally, we investigated the optimal control problem by the application of the optimal control theory. We used the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle to provide the necessary conditions needed for the existence of the optimal solution to the optimal control problem. Also, we applied the Atanackovic and Stankovic method to provide a numerical solution to system (5) . Lastly, the theoretical results were verified by numerical simulations to measure the efficacy and impact of control on the transmission of the respiratory diseases. From the numerical simulation, the size of the infected population is significantly reduced under the controlled conditions. This proposes that if all two control measures u 1 (quarantine of exposed population groups) and u 2 (monitoring and treatment of infected populations) are employed for the same period of time and continue for a considerable period of time, the future of free from transmission of a respiratory disease could be achieved. In this manner, the fractional-order optimal control method can progress the value of the treatment (Fig. 7) .

Many species show resistance to disease induction by TSE agents derived from other species. This resistance or ""species barrier"" is manifested either by total lack of disease induction or by a prolonged incubation period prior to onset of clinical disease. For instance, Chandler mouse scrapie can be transmitted to Syrian hamsters with an average incubation period of 378 days, but in mice the incubation period is 120 days (Kimberlin and Walker, 1978; Kimberlin et al., 1987) . Conversely, the 263K hamster scrapie strain has a 72 day incubation period in Syrian hamsters, but does not cause clinical disease in mice. Of particular concern is whether or not various strains of TSE in animals can be transmitted to humans. Epidemiological studies indicate that transmission from scrapie-infected sheep to humans does not occur.

As of 00:00 on March 6, 2020, approximately 98,332 persons have been infected across the world(NHC, 2020), the figure that has already far exceeded the numbers for SARS in 2003 and MERS in 2012 (Huang et al., 2020; Wong et al., 2015) . Moreover, other than a certain degree of progress in the control and prevention of the epidemic in China, the situations in other countries have deteriorated. Without proper protective measures, COVID-19 may be transmitted through airborne droplets from coughing and sneezing, as well as close contact. Furthermore, air transmission and feces-mouth transmission have not yet been verified, though there are signs that such transmission means are possible (WHO, 2020). As people gain more knowledge about the disease, the prognosis for the majority of patients infected by COVID-19 has been relatively promising, but the prognosis for a small number of patients in critical conditions, especially seniors and patients with chronic diseases, are less optimal (Zhu et al.,2020) . The enclosed management model employed at most psychiatric hospitals represents a daunting challenge for effective control of infectious disease and thwarting outbreaks within institutions. The Fourth People's Hospital of Chengdu is the ninth most influential hospital in terms of scientific research and one of the largest psychiatric medical care centres in southwest China. We propose the following suggestions and strategies for psychiatric hospitals during the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic. At present, COVID-19 symptoms mainly include fever, dry cough, and fatigue, but some infected patients may not show any symptoms. Therefore, preliminary screening, pre-examination and triage, and fever clinic management at psychiatric hospitals are particularly crucial. Medical care staff should earnestly document patient information such as name, gender, age, job, home address details and phone number. In case of possible violent behaviors exhibited by psychiatric patients, security personnel should be garrisoned at clinic zones to maintain order. All staff at the clinic should be equipped with the appropriate protective equipment. Signs should be posted to remind patients to protect their respiratory system and frequently wash hands. During the epidemic period, patients who match critical psychiatric illness standards and who are considered as potential carriers of COVID-19 shall be kept within the infection quarantine ward to receive treatment according to potential virus carrier protocol. For patients who match critical psychiatric illness standards but are not considered as potential carriers of COVID-19, they should be kept within the psychiatric transition and observation ward for 14 days, as per clinic and emergency room protocol, before being transferred to a regular ward when relevant conditions are met.",32.27312731906031,11.502826614690214

In other words, transmission of norovirus infections is more likely to occur among patients sharing a bay, compared with transmission among patients in different bays. While this might at first seem an obvious finding, there are competing theories about the transmission of the virus in complex healthcare settings. For example, transmission might occur through staff transferring virus on their hands or patients touching infected surfaces with their hands when moving around the wards or the hospital. The strength of our conclusion is sensitive to the assumed serial interval distribution. We used values derived from the dates of onset of illness in patients during outbreaks on hospital wards. We also performed sensitivity analysis using a serial interval distribution derived from a study of norovirus in children.13 However, because the degree to which this generalises to a hospital setting is unclear (intuitively the high contact rates in hospitals would be expected to lead to shorter serial intervals)17 we explored serial intervals from 0.5 to 4 days, while constraining the variance. Our results show that for serial intervals of less than 2 days the observed effect of proximity (sharing a bay with someone else who was ill) is highly significant (p<0.001) and for serial intervals up to 2.5 days remained significant at the 5% level.

However, in practice, transmission events are unobserved, so instead we consider all possible infection trees consistent with the data. We used a previously described approach to calculate the probability, πij, that patient i was infected by patient j for each pair of infected patients in each outbreak based on onset times and the serial interval distribution (the serial interval is the time from onset of symptoms in case i to case j), without using proximity data. The serial interval distribution tells us the probability of durations of 0, 1, 2… days between onset in a case and onset in secondary cases infected by this case.

Using a maximum serial interval of 35 days, based on the upper bounds for the latent period and infectious period, that is, L = 15 days and D = 20 days,4 respectively, a minimum of three cases were required to form the infection path from the June 6 to September 3 cases; hence, only one unreported case during this 89-day period was required for the virus to have remained in circulation.

The rapid increase in the overall Rt from day 12 (January 31, 2020) to day 19 (February 7, 2020) is greatly influenced by the increase in passenger-to-passenger transmission, and this time period covers the time lag between February 1, 2020 when the index COVID-19 case was reported and February 5, 2020 when the Japanese government requested the passengers to stay inside their cabin after the detection of a cluster of COVID-19 positive cases (National Instatitute of Infectious Disease, 2020; Kumamotonichinichishinb, 2020). Upon the implementation of the quarantine orders, the overall Rt and Rt for passengers aboard the Diamond Princess Ship declined thereafter, while Rt among crew maintained a steady level and only started to decline on day 25 of the outbreak (February 13, 2020). This is consistent with the fact that passengers staying inside their cabins led to a substantial decline in passenger-to-passenger transmission type except for their interaction with cabin mates. Indeed, the proportion of secondary infections inside the cabins increased from 7% (1/15) on February 6, 43% (3/7) on February 10, 2020 to 100% (1/1) on February 14, 2020 (National Instatitute of Infectious Disease, 2020). Thus, a high proportion of the symptomatic cases after the quarantine gradually shifted from largely passenger cases to crew cases. Indeed, despite their potential risk of acquiring the infection, crews had to continue to work to deliver services to isolated passengers. The distribution of the median Re by transmission type suggests that other transmission types likely contributed to this outbreak to some extent (Fig. 3).

If the number of differences between two sequences accumulating in a given time is assumed to follow a Poisson distribution, with λ equal to the expected number of mutations, the probability of finding this number of differences between the two sequences by chance can be calculated from the cumulative density function of the Poisson distribution. A transmission pair was rejected if the number of observed mutations exceeded the 95% upper cumulative probability value. To reduce the chance of type 1 statistical errors due to multiple testing, a Bonferroni correction was applied to the significance cutoff, resulting in an adjusted significance level of 3.85 × 10–3.

If it is assumed that subsequent infections can occur at random during the infectious period before the onset of symptoms, then the average serial interval will be the sum of the average latent period (from infection to infectiousness) and half the average infectious period before disease onset. Hence, we can state the following equations: We know that the mean incubation period for COVID-19 is 5.2 days . The mean serial interval is estimated to be 4 days in one study from a total of 28 infector-infectee pairs (Nishiura et al. 2020 ) and 4.4 days in another study based on data from 21 infection chains in Hong Kong . For our calculation, we have used the mean of these two studies as our average serial interval, which is 4.2 days. Using the above equations for the serial interval and incubation period, we have calculated the values of 1/R2 and 1/R3, which provide us with a median value of 2 days for 1/R2 and 3.2 days for 1/R3. Further assuming that a person once exposed to the infection, spends at least one day in latent non-infectious period and overall, the latent noninfectious period (1/R2) is not greater than latent infectious period (1/R3), we get a range of 2.6 to 4.2 days for 1/R3.

There likely is some secondary spread locally, from cases infected from the reservoir, but local reproduction numbers are low, often insufficient to support sustained transmission. Knowledge of the serial interval, for symptomatic cases in the outbreak, is essential for analysis of the transmission probabilities [14] . Previous studies have estimated the distribution of serial intervals from a set of confirmed transmission pairs, where both the ancestor (who caused infection) and the descendant (who became infected) were known [19, 20] . As such information is mostly lacking [6] (and may be hard to obtain) in this COVID-19 outbreak, we have estimated the serial interval distribution from a curated network, using whatever contact information was available. Existing knowledge of contacts (and timing of those contacts) between cases was used to construct a matrix of prior probabilities, to restrict the transmission network to only those links that are possible. When all transmission links are known, the serial interval distribution can be easily estimated. However, at early stages of an outbreak, information on transmission links is usually incomplete. When a sufficiently large proportion of the transmission links is known, it is possible to estimate both the serial interval distribution, and the transmission probability matrix [14] . Starting from a plausible serial interval distribution, the transmission probability matrix V is updated until convergence; then V is frozen and the serial interval parameters are updated, again until obtaining a new optimum; then the serial interval distribution is frozen and the transmission probability matrix is updated again, and so on, until no further improvement can be found. The estimated serial interval distribution, Gamma(3·16,1·52), has a mean of 4·8 days and good spread out (i.e. large scale parameter) to long serial interval. The variation of serial interval could caused by highly varied incubation period [21] . Such a short serial interval, compared to SARS (mean: 8·4 days) [22] and MERS (mean: 6·8 days) [23], gives COVID-19 ability to spread more rapidly. The rapid spread of COVID-19 in South Korea (from 31 cases on 18 February to 2,022 cases on 28 February) and Italy (from 20 cases on 21 February to 650 cases on 28 February), shows how missed infectious subjects may cause rapid transmission within a very short period, due to the combination of a short serial interval and an occasionally high reproduction number [24] . As the incubation period seems to be highly variable, it may be possible that appearance of symptoms in any case precedes symptom onset in its ancestor. When that happens, the serial interval for symptom onset is negative. To check whether negative serial intervals would adversely affect analysis we used an alternative distribution, where the serial intervals were shifted leftward by a small amount. A shift of one or two days had no destructive effect on estimation of V , and the resulting estimates of the effective reproduction numbers did not change substantially.",46.592520795587724,16.899719580574242

In this sense, let us remark that parameter κ 0 allows us to tune the strength of those containment mesaures proposed to contain COVID-19. In this sense, κ 0 = 1 reflects a total lockdown of the population which isolates the households from each other, thus constraining the transmission dynamics at the level of household rather than municipality.

For R < 1, an introduced disease will die off because it will be dampened in transmission, while for R > 1, disease transmission will be amplified and result in an epidemic where the disease is transmitted quickly to almost everyone (see Figure 1B ).
