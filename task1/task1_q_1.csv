During the winter season, acquisition of these viruses typically occurs in the community, and patients may be admitted with symptoms of infection or infection to a hospital. Nosocomial acquisition due to transmission occurs as well [15] , [16] , [17] , [18] . Recom-mendations and suggestions for controlling the spread of influenza and RSV in healthcare settings in general and especially in hemato-oncological patients exist (e.g. [5] , [10] ), but should be adapted to each hospital's specific needs. To extend our existing standard infection control measures, we introduced a prophylactic screening program for asymptomatic patients targeting RSV and influenza on an adult and a pediatric hemato-oncological ward. The screening was intended to detect patients that shed the virus without having signs or symptoms of disease. Shedding my occur before the onset of disease (incubation period), during an asymptomatic clinical course, or following disease as a result of prolonged viral shedding, particularly in the immunocompromised host [19] . These groups of asymptomatic patients, who often remain unnoticed, can contribute to nosocomial spread. Of the 23 asymptomatic shedders, we detected an increased viral load in 6 patients in follow-up specimens (see Table 2 ). It is likely that these patients were in the incubation period. This group of patients is of particular interest for infection control strategies, since with increasing viral load, the risk of transmission also rises. We identified 23 of a total of 251 asymptomatic patients with an RSV or influenza virus infection (detection rate of about 9%).This means that about 11 asymptomatic patients needed to be screened to detect one shedder of either RSV or influenza virus. Other studies found a similar prevalence in asymptomatic individuals for influenza (8.3%) and RSV (4.4%) using RT-PCR [20] , [21] . Campbell et al. examined samples from asymptomatic and symptomatic patients prior to hematopoietic stemcell transplantation (HSCT) in a study to evaluate the clinical outcomes associated with respiratory virus detection before HSCT [22] . During a 5-year period, 308 asymptomatic adult and pediatric patients were screened, but only one patient with RSV and none with influenza virus were identified. Interestingly, this study found other viruses (e.g., human rhinovirus or coronavirus) in 23 patients. These respiratory viruses were not included in our screening program, as they rarely cause severe lower respiratory tract disease. 13 out of 23 asymptomatic patients who tested positive for RSV or influenza virus in our study occupied shared patient rooms at the time of virus detection. The majority were moved to single rooms (one-bed rooms) or cohorting was used. Droplet and contact precautions were used for all affected patients. Isolation and barrier precautions regarding virus shedders is important, as transmission to roommates has been described [16] . The transfer to single (one-bed) rooms was challenging in some cases, due to the lack of single-room availability. Nonetheless, because of the high mortality rate of RSV and influenza infection in hemato-oncological patients, isolation and barrier precautions were enforced. With these measures, we aimed to lower the risk of patient-to-patient transmission by reducing the exposure of contact patients. The usage of droplet and contact precautions (such as surgical mask and gown) was also intended to reduce exposure of HCWs. All HCWs, whether vaccinated against influenza or not, wore masks when they performed care in patients with RSV or influenza virus. A further benefit of early detection of influenza virus is the possibility of early antiviral therapy for infected patients and prophylaxis with antiviral agents for contact patients [5] . An additional effect of the screening program and the associated audits and feedback talks was the heightened awareness among HCWs and visitors for respiratory viral infections in this highly susceptible, immunocompromised patient population. During the screening period, no nosocomial cluster of influenza virus or RSV was observed on the two wards. Our investigation has limitations. First, it relied on virological laboratory data analyzed retrospectively. Further information, such as the clinical course and outcome of the patients identified by screening, was not accessible for this study. We therefore could not correlate the laboratory results with the clinical course of the patients. Viral loads were estimated semi-quantitatively by comparing ct values of real-time PCR between positive screening and follow-up specimens. However, this approach has been established for respiratory specimens by previous studies on influenza and various other pathogens [23] , [24] , [25] , [26] .",18.750629236862952,11.843351119456752

Under this scenario, pathogen carriage is stable in space and time even if viral shedding is episodic [18] . The synchrony of shedding among bats may depend on the extent and synchrony of the drivers of shedding (Fig 2, e.g., food shortages or climate conditions), the abundance of susceptible individuals (e.g., during a birth pulse [61] ), and behaviors that increase transmission rates [15] .",15.882897281365068,9.47936823596633

Leptospirapositive urine samples in M. natalensis clustered in two genetic groups (figure 2a), one associated with L. borgpetersenii samples previously identified in M. natalensis in South Africa [26] and the other closely related to L. interrogans and L. kirschneri. High Leptospira shedding prevalence was observed across the reproductive season, varying between 71% (±18%) and 87% (±10%). Despite some variation over time and a peak in November that coincided with parturition (figure 1a), we found no significant effect of the sampling month for Leptospira shedding prevalence in urine. This may be due to a lack in statistical power, because of the limited number of urine samples available in September (n = 4). Only a significant effect of age class on Leptospira shedding prevalence was found (GLM 1 : χ 2 1 = 6.851, p = 0.009; electronic supplementary material, table S1), but this was because none of the two urine samples collected from juveniles were positive for Leptospira, compared to an overall shedding prevalence of 83% (±9%) in adults. Our results are consistent with previous studies reporting bats as a reservoir of pathogenic Leptospira worldwide [36] , and similar to the dynamic found in the insectivorous bat Mormopterus francoismoutoui in Reunion Island, where a peak of shedding was observed in late-pregnant females [12] . AdVs detected in faeces of M. natalensis were almost all identical and closely related to mastadenoviruses found in the bat Myotis ricketti in China [30] . One sample (UP5980) clustered with a sequence from the fruit bat Pteropus giganteus in Bangladesh (figure 2b). We found a strong variation of AdV shedding prevalence over the reproductive season (GLM 2 : χ 2 2 = 65.197, p < 0.001), as shedding only occurred in November with 72% (±14%) of the bats excreting AdV (figure 1a). Our limited number of faeces samples collected in September (n = 3) may hide a higher prevalence in the M. natalensis colony, but results from January (n = 28 samples) showed that lactating and post-lactating females, as well as young juveniles, were not shedding AdV. This contrasts with the stable prevalence observed by Drexler et al. [13] in Myotis myotis in Germany, before and after parturition. The absence of AdV shedding in young juveniles may be explained by the transfer of maternal antibodies, as demonstrated experimentally for henipaviruses [37, 38] and largely suggested by several field studies [12, 13, 39, 40] . However, the absence of AdV shedding in lactating and post-lactating females suggests that even though persistence of DNA viruses on the level of individual bats might occur [13] , shedding is highly dynamic over the reproduction period in female individuals.",17.884176092774062,9.340435835819083

The mean estimates of the transmissibility of hepatitis A virus from three different statistical methods before effective control range from 2.1 to 2.8, with their 95% confidence interval ranging from 1.8 to 4.5. Transmission dynamics model, which includes both asymptomatic and symptomatic infections, generates an estimate of 2.7. When assuming all infections are symptomatic in transmission dynamics model, the estimate reduces to 2.1. These results are well in agreement with statistical estimates which are based on symptomatic case data alone. By further incorporating the results of IgG antibodies test [3] , our transmission dynamics model suggests that about 91% of the HAV infections in the school children are asymptomatic. This result suggests that at the end of the outbreak there are total of about 344 asymptomatic infections along with 32 symptomatic cases. This estimate of asymptomatic proportion is consistent with the general estimate [17, 18] . The common knowledge is that hepatitis A in children is mostly an asymptomatic disease while adolescents and adults usually show symptoms of clinical hepatitis. For example, one estimation [19] indicates that 80 to 95% of children less than 5 years old have asymptomatic infections, compared to 10 to 25% of adults.

Estimating the transmissibility, which is usually characterized by the basic reproductive number R 0 , the mean number of secondary infectious cases generated by a single primary infectious case introduced into a totally susceptible population, provides crucial information for the effort required to stop infection spreading. Hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted indirectly through contaminated food and environment. An outbreak from March to June 2011 was reported to have occurred at an elementary school of 698 pupils in China and it was found that the outbreak was due to direct transmission between school children. Based on the symptom onset date and the social contact network of the children, in this study we estimate the serial interval (i.e. the gap in symptom onset between an infectee and its infector) and use different statistical methods to estimate R 0 . Combining with the positivity of IgG antibodies tests, we develop a compartmental transmission dynamics model which includes both asymptomatic and symptomatic infections to estimate the overall R 0 . Our analysis suggests a serial interval of mean = 23.9 days and standard deviation = 20.9 days. The different statistical methods suggest estimates for R 0 in the outbreak varying from 2.1 to 2.8, and the estimates from the transmission dynamics model are consistent with this range. Our estimates are in agreement with that from one study in England but are higher than that from one study in the United States. Our transmission dynamics model suggests that the proportion of symptomatic infections is about 9%, implying that there were about 344 asymptomatic infections along with the 32 observed symptomatic cases. Furthermore, it is shown that the inclusion of asymptomatic infection in the epidemic process increases the estimate of R 0 but does not do so greatly provided that the proportion of symptomatic infections is constant over the outbreak and there is no difference in transmissibility between symptomatic and asymptomatic infections.",16.24271431621735,7.137452316481754

By contrast, only β-HVs were detected in R. aegyptiacus (figure 2c). Sequences were embedded within a clade containing other fruit bat samples and were closely related to the only sequence available for R. aegyptiacus, obtained from a captive bat at the Budapest zoo in Hungary [42] . For both bat species, HV shedding prevalence varied strongly over time (GLM 3 : χ 2 2 = 8.848, p = 0.012, GLM 4 : χ 2 3 = 36.364, p < 0.001, figure 1b) and with age class (GLM 3 : χ 2 1 = 12.169, p < 0.001, GLM 4 : χ 2 1 = 3.913, p = 0.048). However, we found a distinct temporal pattern compared to Leptospira and AdV. Indeed, a peak of HV shedding was observed at the beginning of the reproductive season, followed by an almost twofold decrease in November for M. natalensis and a continuous decrease in October and January for R. aegyptiacus. The effect of age class was explained by the lower shedding prevalence that was observed in juveniles, suggesting the protection of juveniles by maternal antibodies during the first months of life. Additional sampling of R. aegyptiacus in April allowed us to observe a second peak of shedding (65 ± 10%), which may reflect the progressive loss of maternal protection and thus the infection of older juveniles. We also found that reproductive status was associated with an increase of HV shedding prevalence in R. aegyptiacus (GLM 4 : χ 2 1 = 6.028, p = 0.014), but this was probably driven by the absence of HV shedding in juveniles (thus in a non-reproductive state) in January compared to a shedding prevalence of 67% (± 24%) in lactating females at the same time (χ 2 1 = 16.944, p < 0.001). In females, pregnancy and lactating states were not associated to a different HV shedding prevalence compared to non-reproductive females. In males, although scrotal individuals always showed a higher HV shedding prevalence (100% in September, 85% in November) compared to the non-scrotal ones (77% and 46%, respectively), differences were not statistically significant. Overall, our results illustrate the HV temporal dynamics in bats, with similarity between two bat species. A notable aspect of HV infection is its latency, despite ongoing immunity, combined with the capacity to reactivate and spread to new hosts, especially during stress and pregnancy [43] [44] [45] . Moreover, male reproductive behaviours (such as biting) could be an important component of natural HV transmission, as shown in mice [46, 47] . Therefore, we could hypothesize that such factors may play an important role in favouring HV transmission at the beginning of the bat reproductive season.",19.786694602272377,6.894478421668721

In general, among children, studies have found that 24.6% to 64% of human rhinovirus (HRV) infections are asymptomatic (7) (8) (9) (10) . A number of studies have also documented the fraction of asymptomatic children who are shedding virus rather than the fraction of infected children who are asymptomatic. Calvo et al. documented an HRV shedding rate of 12.3% among healthy children (9) . Van Benten et al. found that 20% of asymptomatic infants Յ2 years old tested positive for HRV (11) . Similarly, Nokso-Koivisto et al. found that 20% of children without any past or recent respiratory infection symptoms tested positive for HRV or coronavirus (CoV) (12) . Other studies examining multiple respiratory agents documented respiratory virus infection in 40% and 42% of children without symptoms (13, 14) . The definition of symptomatic infection is not standardized, but most of these studies defined asymptomatic patients as those free from symptoms at the time of study participation or within a window around the time of enrollment. This wide variation in symptomatic versus asymptomatic presentations underscores the need for further studies to understand the distribution of symptoms across infec-tion statuses. Here, we document the shedding prevalence of a number of common respiratory viruses in an ambulatory adult population, as well as the distributions of symptomatology and symptom severity. Sampling was conducted in two seasonal arms: one carried out in the late spring/early summer (summer arm), which has been previously reported (2) , and one carried out in the late winter/early spring (winter arm). In the summer arm, we found that over 5% of individuals tested positive for respiratory virus, with the majority testing positive for HRV, but with over half also reporting being asymptomatic. We hypothesized that these numbers might vary by season, as many respiratory infections, as well as ambulatory population contact dynamics, display seasonal patterns. (Since we published our previous study, GenMark Diagnostics, the manufacturer of the respiratory viral panel [RVP] assay used to analyze these samples, determined that a higher cutoff value for positivity was warranted for some of the assayed viruses. This paper thus rereports the summer study with a cutoff value of 25 nA/mm 2 rather than 3 nA/mm 2 , so the numbers differ from those reported in Shaman et al. [2] .)",24.832219692171186,11.70726301296075

While the sampling scheme was designed to capture individuals from a population different from those represented in studies of persons seeking medical attention, it would not capture individuals who stay home with severe symptoms. However, given that the site used in the study is frequented by tourists, who usually only have a limited amount of time in New York City, we hypothesize that many people might still visit the site despite having symptoms that would otherwise keep them home. Consequently, our sample may be less skewed in symptom distribution than a random sample from the street. Conversely, among tourist attraction visitors, those with symptoms might have been more inclined to participate in this study. Symptoms were self-reported, which can introduce error, and were reported only for the previous 48 h. For some viruses, RNA can be detected for several weeks following infection, so some seemingly asymptomatic individuals who tested positive may have been previously infected and symptomatic. Further, shedding prior to symptom development also occurs (19) . These dynamics preclude calculation of the proportion of infections that are asymptomatic, but not estimation of asymptomatic prevalence in the ambulatory population, as the participants were asymptomatic at the time and were still shedding. Also, the study was run over two seasons, but there were no samples taken during the late summer or fall or early winter season, when prevalence levels may be different. For the diagnostic analysis, we performed a molecular test but did not try to isolate viruses or determine titers and therefore cannot confirm whether the virus collected in samples was viable. Lastly, this study excluded children, who have a high burden of respiratory virus infection.",22.108309017066585,10.18877170806681

As the role of asymptomatic infection in respiratory virus transmission is still largely unknown and rates of asymptomatic shedding are not well constrained, it is important to obtain more-precise estimates through alternative sampling methods. We actively recruited participants from among visitors to a New York City tourist attraction. Nasopharyngeal swabs, demographics, and survey information on symptoms, medical history, and recent travel were obtained from 2,685 adults over two seasonal arms. We used multiplex PCR to test swab specimens for a selection of common respiratory viruses. A total of 6.2% of samples (168 individuals) tested positive for at least one virus, with 5.6% testing positive in the summer arm and 7.0% testing positive in the winter arm. Of these, 85 (50.6%) were positive for human rhinovirus (HRV), 65 (38.7%) for coronavirus (CoV), and 18 (10.2%) for other viruses (including adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza virus, and parainfluenza virus). Depending on the definition of symptomatic infection, 65% to 97% of infections were classified as asymptomatic. The best-fit model for prediction of positivity across all viruses included a symptom severity score, Hispanic ethnicity data, and age category, though there were slight differences across the seasonal arms. Though having symptoms is predictive of virus positivity, there are high levels of asymptomatic respiratory virus shedding among the members of an ambulatory population in New York City. IMPORTANCE Respiratory viruses are common in human populations, causing significant levels of morbidity. Understanding the distribution of these viruses is critical for designing control methods. However, most data available are from medical records and thus predominantly represent symptomatic infections. Estimates for asymptomatic prevalence are sparse and span a broad range. In this study, we aimed to measure more precisely the proportion of infections that are asymptomatic in a general, ambulatory adult population. We recruited participants from a New York City tourist attraction and administered nasal swabs, testing them for adenovirus, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza virus. At recruitment, participants completed surveys on demographics and symptomology. Analysis of these data indicated that over 6% of participants tested positive for shedding of respiratory virus. While participants who tested positive were more likely to report symptoms than those who did not, over half of participants who tested positive were asymptomatic.",16.984536365229932,6.646596918449468

A low prevalence rate was not unexpected in the children sampled who were between 2 -16 years as RSV infection is highest below the age of 2 years [34] . The significant lower prevalence of other respiratory viruses in the asthmatic children has been reported in other investigations [6, 7, 14] .",18.007639234612512,10.167372487855499

If, on the other hand, asymptomatic carriers have a higher reproduction potential (so that A > 1), then decreasing the relative frequency of appearance of symptomatic infectives may actually increase the endemic prevalence of diseaseP I .

Models are separated into those which do not allow reinfection (top) and those that do allow reinfection (bottom). Models are then sorted according to the transitions between C and I so that models in column 1 have no transitions between C and I, column 2 has models with the C → I transition only, column 3 has models with the I → C transition only, and column 4 has models with both C → I and I → C transitions.

This phenomenon has received little attention so far. Specifically, infective contacts may be observed when infectious individuals travel to the hotspot and cross the territory of susceptible individuals and, reversely, when susceptible individuals cross the territory of infectious individuals. This second type of transmission may be prominent when the disease reduces the mobility of sick individuals (i.e., sickness behavior [16, 17, 18] ). For example, in humans, sick individuals often stay home, which alters disease dynamics [19, 20] . Sick wild animals also commonly reduce their rate of search for food or water [21] .

Asymptomatic and presymptomatic virus shedding posts a big challenge to infection control [1, 2] . In addition, patients with mild and unspecific symptoms are also difficult to identify and quarantine. Notably, the absence of fever in SARS-CoV-2 infection (12.1%) is more frequent than in SARS-CoV (1%) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV; 2%) infection [6] . In light of this, the effectiveness of using fever detection as the surveillance method should be reviewed. However, based on previous studies of influenza viruses and community-acquired human coronaviruses, the viral loads in asymptomatic carriers are relatively low [9] . If this is also the case for SARS-CoV-2, the risk should remain low. Studies on the natural history of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans are urgently needed. Identifying a cohort of asymptomatic carriers in Wuhan and following their viral loads, clinical presentations and antibody titers over a time course will provide clues as to how many of the subjects have symptoms in a later phase, whether virus shedding from the subjects is indeed less robust, and how often they might transmit SARS-CoV-2 to others.",19.307416466750837,7.090717778455315

Ours is the first case-control investigation of pneumonia etiology in children from Mali (S1 STROBE checklist). The results should serve to better manage pneumonia not only in these children but also in those from neighboring countries. Data quality was enhanced by centralized microbiological analysis in the Emerging Pathogens Laboratory (Lyon, France). In addition, this analysis should serve to better focus multicentric pneumonia studies that will permit us to assess the global etiologies of pneumonia and to compare etiologic agents between countries and continents. Some limitations should be underlined. First, microbiological diagnosis of pneumonia is difficult due to the lack of single reliable test. Then, at the individual level, it is difficult to establish if a positive nasal swab denotes etiology or nasopharyngeal colonization; particularly for bacterial agents such as S. pneumoniae because of the high asymptomatic carriage. However, at the population level, addition of a control group permits to evaluate and control for the prevalence of carriage in asymptomatic children. In a pneumonia etiology study, it would be interesting to correlate the threshold cycle (Ct) values obtained from RT-PCR with lower airway specimens to establish more precisely the relationship between positive nasal swab and etiology of pneumonia, according to the microorganism [30] . Second, because the study was implemented in one hospital in Mali, external validity might be limited. However, Gabriel Touré University Hospital is a reference center in the country, and then source population is not limited to the city of Bamako.

The age-distribution of reported infections synthesised here, suggests that contact with juveniles may pose greater risks of human transmission than adults, making them potential targets for vaccination. However, frequency of human contact with dromedaries may also be animal-age-dependent (Wernery et al., 2015a) . Calf-focused vaccination may reduce the overall number of dromedary infections but, the reduced risk of exposure would mean that any remaining infections would likely occur at an older age than in the absence of vaccination. It will therefore be important to further investigate the age-dependency of human-dromedary contact patterns and how these vary in different countries and husbandry systems.

Asymptomatic viral shedding in the nasopharynx in asymptomatic populations and immunocompetent hosts is relatively common [11] [12] [13] . Asymptomatic shedding among pediatric surgery patients (PSPs) could potentially play an key role in propagating outbreaks of respiratory diseases if subclinical VRI is transmissible and leads to progression of symptomatic disease [13] .

Asymptomatic shedding among pediatric surgery patients (PSPs) could potentially lead to progression of symptomatic diseases and cause outbreaks of respiratory diseases. The aim of this study is to investigate the incidence of infection among mild symptomatic PSP group and asymptomatic PSP group after surgical procedure. Methods: We collected the induced sputum from enrolled 1629 children (under 18 years of age) with no respiratory symptom prior to pediatric surgery between March 2017 and February 2019. We tested 16 different respiratory virus infections in post-surgery mild symptomatic PSP group and asymptomatic PSP group using a quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay panel. We analyzed symptom data and quantitative viral load to investigate the association between viruses, symptoms and viral quantity in qRT-PCR-positive PSPs. Results: Out of 1629 children enrolled, a total of 204 respiratory viruses were present in 171 (10.50%) PSPs including 47 patients with mild symptoms and 124 with no symptoms after surgery. Commonly detected viruses were human rhino/enterovirus (HRV/EV, 42.19%), parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV3, 24.48%), coronavirus (CoV NL63, OC43, HKU1, 11.46%), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, 9.9%). PIV3 infection with a higher viral load was frequently found in PSPs presenting with mild symptoms, progressing to pneumonia with radiographic evidence after surgery. HRV/EV were the most commonly detected pathogens in both asymptomatic and mild symptomatic PSPs. CoV (OC43, HKU1) infections with a higher viral load were mostly observed in asymptomatic PSPs progressing to alveolar or interstitial infiltration. Conclusions: Our study suggested that PIV3 is a new risk factor for VRI in PSPs. Employing a more comprehensive, sensitive and quantitative method should be considered for preoperative testing of respiratory viruses in order to guide optimal surgical timing.",17.748197352019982,11.223916304404352

Therefore, it will be important to conduct more extensive surveillance studies of different bat species in different habitats as well as consecutive studies on well-characterized colonies followed over long periods of time. For optimal results and the greatest benefit, an interdisciplinary approach would be desirable where virologists, bat ecologists and zoologists work closely together. Novel sequencing techniques might deliver more detailed data on phylogenetic relationships of astroviruses from bats and other hosts, but they should always be combined with field data for the best possible interpretation of their significance. There is strong evidence that astroviruses in general are not as species-specific as they have been considered to be in the past. However, sequence data from bat astroviruses are still insufficient to really assess zoonotic potential. To overcome this issue, virus isolates and more detailed sequence information from several strains that are thought to circulate in bat populations would be most helpful. Although bats are frequently proposed as the natural reservoir of some highly pathogenic and zoonotic viruses, the overall risk for astrovirus transmission from bats to humans is assumed to be relatively low and does not, to our current understanding, exceed the risk of an astrovirus transmission from other mammals such as minks, pigs or cattle to humans.",15.106571413248634,10.464494458843717

In the case of CoV (HKU1, OC43)-positive PSPs, the Ct values were significantly lower than for RSV and IV in patients with severe clinical symptoms supported by radiographic evidence (Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.05, Fig. 4 ). CoV (OC43, HKU1) infections with a higher viral load were also observed in asymptomatic PSPs progressing to alveolar or interstitial infiltration. [15, 16] .

In addition, these studies lacked quantitative analysis of viral pathogens in the PSPs. Though the frequency of symptomatic VRI was low, presence of VRI significantly prolonged postoperative recovery in children following surgery, as evidenced by longer LOS periods in hospitalization. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the infection rates and outcomes of both asymptomatic and symptomatic PSPs leading to VRI after surgery using qRT-PCR. As samples were taken not only from patients with symptoms of infection, but also from asymptomatic patients in this study, we were therefore able to explore the impact of viral testing in asymptomatic patients, which could help improve estimates of VRI in PSPs and further study of disease transmission modeling and forecasting. A total of 171 out of 1629 children (10.50%) were confirmed to have VRI with laboratory results, which is a considerably higher proportion than previous studies have identified.

This might be owing to the high sensitivity of the proposed qRT-PCR assays identifying more viral pathogens. In this study, we also observed that HRV/EV were associated with prolonged shedding and the most commonly found coinfections were PIV3 and HRV/EV. These results are consistent with previous findings that HRV/EV co-infection or different HRV species co-infection were associated with acute respiratory illness hospitalization and that prolonged viral shedding over the course of 30 days was more commonly associated with respiratory viruses [9, [20] [21] [22] [23] .

A significant proportion of the CoV infected patients required hospitalization, and some progressed to LRTI. In contrast, BoV detection was rare and almost always related to co-pathogens (Pinana et al., 2018) . A surveillance study on BoV in children found 10% of children with RTI to be PCR positive, as well as 17% of the healthy controls; thus showing a high prevalence of the virus without necessarily causing disease. Progression to lower infection however was associated with higher BoV load and viremia, suggesting a pathogenic role in a subgroup of patients (Christensen et al., 2010) . Figure 1 shows the incidence of CARV in mainly adult HCT population, and the impact of CARV on LRTI and mortality. Profound immunosuppression in patients undergoing HCT obviously leads to a greater risk of infection, with prolonged shedding of the virus, a higher chance of transmission of disease and a greater risk of progression to severe lower respiratory tract disease.

According to our previous research [19] , k, ω, p, γ, γ', c, and ε are disease-specific parameters which could be estimated from literatures. The incubation period of shigellosis is 1-4 days [24, 25] , and most commonly 1 day, therefore, ω = 1.0. The proportion of asymptomatic infection ranges from 0.0037 to 0.27 [26] [27] [28] , and it can be set p = 0.1. The infectious period of symptomatic infection is 13.5 days [19] , therefore, γ = 0.0741. According to our previous research [19] , the infectious period of asymptomatic infection could be simulated 5 weeks in our model, thus γ' = 0.0286. Because of that the die-off rate of Shigella spp is about 24.5 h [29] , ε = 0.6931 was consequently simulated [19] . In our previous research [19] , a typical case has diarrhea about 3.2 times (range 3-12 times) per day but an asymptomatic individual only sheds stool once per day, thus c = 0.3125. Due to reduction of shedding frequency, the relative transmissibility of asymptomatic individual (k) was modeled to be a reduced quantity as 0.3125 [19] . However, b and b w are scenario-or area-specific parameters which depend on different outbreaks and periods. Therefore, these two parameters are confirmed by curve fitting by Models 1 and 2 to the collected data. To simulate the contribution of b and b w during the transmission, we performed a ""knock-out"" simulation which was based on the following four scenarios: A) b = 0 and b w = 0; B) b = 0; C) b w = 0; D) control (no intervention). was employed for model simulation and least root mean square was adopted to assess the goodness of fit.

Asymptomatic infections were not captured, affecting our ability to fully characterise the transmission chain. We expect that asymptomatic transmission may have impacted our ability to characterise HRV spread, particularly in transmission involving older children and adults, our ability to associate age of index case with transmission risk [30, 39] . Moreover, we likely only captured a minority of adult illness as adults required subjective fever for specimen collection and fever occurs infrequently in adult RSV, MPV and HRV illness [7 40 ]. While we underestimated transmission, specifically spread involving individuals ⩾5 years, due to our symptom criteria, a previous study of RSV transmission demonstrated that the odds of transmission in symptomatic infection is five times that of asymptomatic infections [28] . This suggests that we likely captured index infections. We anticipate that some illness with shedding <7 days may have been missed due to our weekly surveillance. We expect that this represented a small minority of illness episodes as the estimated shedding duration of HRV and RSV in adults is 10 and 9 days, respectively [30, 31] . Shedding for 1-2 weeks is common with paediatric respiratory infections [31] . Moreover, while we performed sequencing on RSV and HRV samples involved in transmission chains, we were not able to phylogenetically verify transmission in the majority of episodes due to high cycle threshold values, and could not use sequencing data to define transmission. Our sequencing results revealed a degree of misclassification with some HRV and RSV transmission events representing illness clusters with multiple virus types circulating in the household simultaneously. This was especially true for HRV, a finding in agreement with previous studies of HRV transmission, including in household and daycare settings [30, 39 41] . Additionally, some households originally selected for the household substudy were not surveyed as intended. Individuals within selected households who were not surveyed were primarily adults. Among adults, males and those <40 years old were surveyed less frequently, a group not considered high risk for household transmission of respiratory viruses in previous studies. A significant proportion of the Sarlahi population, especially men, are reported as absent from home, supporting the possibility that some household members were absent from the community during the study, although these data were not captured [36] . We also surveyed a higher proportion of preschool children compared to school-aged children. The differential exclusion of these subsets may have affected our results, including identification of index cases, especially if these persons were periodically present in the household. Lastly, we did not collect data on the social mixing patterns of individuals in these households which would have provided valuable information regarding possible causal explanations for our findings.",24.214694245374517,16.128825789988745

Over half of RSV infections in children 5-15 years in that study were asymptomatic, with a smaller proportion of asymptomatic infections in infants under 1 year and children 1-4 years at 9% and 17%, respectively [28] . However, they also reported viral shedding in symptomatic RSV infections was 14 log 10 RNA copies greater than in asymptomatic RSV cases suggesting that symptomatic episodes are more likely to transmit virus [29] . Last, we collected weekly specimens and our findings may be biased if non-infant younger children had longer shedding duration compared to older children. However, this has not been demonstrated in studies of RSV and HRV shedding duration [28, 30] . Our large cohort allowed us to use a multivariable analysis to identify the risk factors and protective characteristics associated with the incidence of transmission. While both infants and preschool children were frequently identified as the index case in a transmission event and can shed virus for prolonged periods, a preschool child index case was associated with a twofold increased risk of transmission and an infant index case was associated with a decreased risk of transmission [11, 31, 32] . Whereas infants are more likely to transmit RSV via direct contact as compared with fomites, young children may transmit infection efficiently through both methods due to differences in mobility and behaviour [33] . Coinfection as the initial infection was associated with an increased risk of transmission, including in our multivariable model. Coinfections most commonly involved HRV and a greater proportion of coinfections resulted in a secondary case compared to monoinfection of most viruses. Viral coinfection with RSV infection has been demonstrated to increase RSV viral load and shedding duration. However, this has not been consistently seen, including a study analysing seven respiratory viruses [29 31, 34] . Finally, electricity in the household, a proxy for socio-economic status and housing conditions, was negatively associated with transmission. Although an association between indoor air pollution and RSV infection has been reported in resource-limited regions, smoking and biofuel cookstove use were not associated with the risk for transmission in our model [4] . However, we had limited power to detect this association due to the use of indoor biofuel cookstoves in over 90% of households in our model and exposures were self-reported without actual measures of indoor air pollution.",24.957537820890618,12.706767415835733

Although, increasing number of studies suggested the pathogenic potential of HBoV in young children with respiratory tract infections, however HBoVs were frequently detected in asymptomatic children's respiratory tract secretions, which may raise some justifiable concerns for etiology [1, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . The variation of HBoV detection in these studies was likely attributable to multiple factors, such as patient's age, season, geographic location, primer sensitivity, laboratory technique, true variation in incidence of HBoV, and methods used in sample collection. Some studies suggested that persistent virus shedding was therefore being a reasonable explanation for the high occurrence of HBoV in healthy subjects [20] . Moreover failure for follow-up on HBoV-positive asymptomatic children also led to high occurrence of HBoV detection in asymptomatic children. Recently, an in vitro study of HBoV infection in pseudostratified epithelial cells was established to confirm the virus uptake, transcription, and replication [30] . This study supports the concept that HBoV is a respiratory pathogen.",18.598912422309066,9.005458043572714

The clinical significance of a single time-point PCR finding of certain pathogens has been debated. Studies on immunocompetent children have reported that viruses such as HBoV, HCoV, and RV are detected in asymptomatic children at rates ranging between 27-40% [13] [14] [15] [16] , which could be suggestive of prolonged viral shedding from an earlier infection or the incubation period prior to a symptomatic- [17] , or asymptomatic infection [13, 14, 17] . To clarify this issue, more longitudinal studies with appropriate control groups are needed. Rhedin et al. conducted a case-control study to investigate the etiologic role of respiratory viruses in a group of children with respiratory tract symptoms seeking medical care at a pediatric emergency center [13] . The control group consisted of children on routine visits to child welfare centers for vaccination within the childhood immunization program. The detection rate of respiratory viruses in the control group was high (35.4%) with RV and HCoV the most commonly detected viruses in asymptomatic children and HMPV, PIV and RSV detected only rarely. The authors concluded that HMPV, PIV and RSV play an etiologic role and suggested that findings of RV and HCoV must be carefully interpreted [13] .We chose a longitudinal design for the present study, and found that 78% of the infections had resolved by the median follow-up time of 28 days. In addition, two of the RV infections identified at follow-up represented new species of RV from the previous infection, which increases the proportion of resolved infections to 84%.",16.647434459874155,8.440921170872642

Martin et al. conducted a longitudinal study of healthy immunocompetent children attending a daycare center [33] and found prolonged shedding (i.e., persistent virus >7 days) of all viruses examined except Flu A and B. Jartti et al. reported shedding times of 2-3 and 5-6 weeks for EV and RV, respectively, in immunocompetent children [17] . However, RV was not sequenced in that study; therefore, it is unclear whether the sample at 5 weeks represented the same or a new genotype of RV. Another study reported that prolonged persistence (>30 days) of the same RV strain is uncommon (<5%) [34] . Shedding times were of special interest in our cohort of immunosuppressed children because viral shedding necessitates isolation from other immunosuppressed children. The design of our present study did not allow us to determine the exact shedding time, which is a major limitation. However, the clearance of all viruses except RV-A and HCoV at a median follow-up time of 28 days, together with respiratory symptoms appearing at the time of fever onset in a majority of the patients, suggests that the shedding time for viruses such as Flu, HMPV, RSV and PIV is limited. The same RV genotypes were detected from follow-up samples in four episodes, with a follow-up time of 12-51 days. Furthermore, five patients positive for RV reported symptom appearance 6 days or longer before fever onset. That could indicate longer shedding times for RV, which is in line with results from studies on immunocompetent children [17] . However, this needs to be addressed in additional studies with repeated followup sampling, preferable on a weekly basis.",18.031869628777848,7.958129333022

Daily differences in the behaviour of an individual can also impact transmission, particularly if triggered by illness [13, 14] . For many acute infectious diseases that are spread through close contact, infectious individuals can pose a transmission risk for several consecutive days until the infection is cleared or treated. This may be particularly important for influenza, where individuals may be infectious prior to symptoms developing [15] . The set of people such individuals may encounter during this infectious period defines their effective neighbourhood of contacts-the totality of people they could potentially infect [16] . In other words, the speed and extent to which infection can transmit may be determined by how quickly contacts are made and how the number of people encountered may accumulate during the infectious period. The number of different people encountered by an individual may asymptote as the number of days considered increases [7] . This saturating relationship may reduce the final variation between individuals' effective neighbourhood size, such that variation in the number of secondary infections arising may not be as great as estimated by information from a single day, particularly for infections with long (multiple day) infectious periods. Currently, there is little evidence as to how individuals' contact rates may change over time [3, 7, 17] .

Particles released during regular breathing are predominantly under 1 micron in diameter [38] , small enough to enter the human alveolar region and upper respiratory tract. Some subjects can exhale more contaminant particles from breathing than from coughing: consider that the average person breathes 20 times a minute and each breath may contain 0.5 liters of air. Although one cough may release up to 3.56 liters of air, the typical cough frequency of a sick person is usually less than 50 times per hour. The rate of exhalation for breathing is therefore significantly higher for breathing than for coughing. In this study, we assumed that exhaling passengers are not covering their mouths during coughing and sneezing; however, airline passengers are likely to cough or sneeze into their hands or elbows, though most do not cover their mouths when breathing. This differential in mitigating behaviors by passengers enhances the possibility of asymptomatic airborne transmission. Interestingly, observational studies conducted on the novel H1N1 virus reported a wide range of asymptomatic infection rates: from ,10% among households in Germany and Canada [39, 40] to over 90% in India [41] . For influenza virus alone, multiple modes of transmission have been hypothesized [42, 43] , and there is limited information on viral shedding from asymptomatic persons. However, we believe that airway transmission via regular breathing cannot be ruled out as a putative transmission pathway for communicable respiratory diseases. Further investigation of this pathway is especially critical given recent data on the number of particles exhaled during normal breathing [44] .",16.78487857126108,5.993395131131201

Molecular S. pneumoniae detection by blood PCR is thus helpful in identifying bacterial pneumonia cases with the poorest prognosis who might need intensive therapies. Interpretation of molecular methods, such as PCR, to identify the etiology of pneumonia in children is, however, challenging. Respiratory viruses can be identified in asymptomatic children, and secondary bacterial infections in the lungs can easily be missed by these methods. In addition, identification of S. pneumoniae in blood by highly sensitive PCR may detect children with nasopharyngeal colonization only, which could lead to potential misclassification bias, particularly when using results of nasopharyngeal specimens to determine the etiology of pneumonia in children.

Additionally, CoVs have proven ability for cross-species transmission, exemplified by the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus in 2002/2003, and of the Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus in 2012 [4] . Both viruses belong to the Betacoronavirus genus and have an animal origin. SARS coronavirus crossed over from bats via intermediate hosts to humans, became human-adapted and quickly spread worldwide before its containment. MERS coronavirus recurrently enters the human population via its dromedary camel reservoir host, with limited, non-sustained human-to-human transmission particularly in healthcare settings [5] [6] [7] . Apart from SARS-and MERS-CoV, all four globally endemic human CoVs (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-HKU1) originate Viruses 2019, 11, 743 2 of 16 from animals [8] [9] [10] [11] . In addition, cross-species transmission potential of CoVs is also illustrated by the occurrence of chimeric coronaviruses that resulted from recombination events between feline CoVs (FCoV) and canine CoVs (CCoV) [12, 13] .",14.17717006017862,5.911021052534723

For instance, although a type of enterovirus, HPeV cannot be detected on routine enterovirus PCR assay. HPeV-specific PCR is required to detect this virus in respiratory, CSF and stool samples of infected children and should be considered as a part of workup for neonates and young children presenting with sepsis (113) . The clinical utility of viral respiratory PCR panels is also limited by their high rates of positive detections without clinical correlates. Detection of a virus in a patient with sepsis does not necessarily indicate causation. Some studies have shown that a respiratory virus can be detected in about one third of asymptomatic children (114, 115) . Viral PCR testing is particularly difficult to interpret due to its high sensitivity for viral nucleic acids, making it challenging for the clinician to distinguish between active viral disease and viral nucleic acid or live viral carriage (112, 116, 117) . A positive test could be a result of asymptomatic colonization, prolonged viral shedding or viral coinfection. In a study by Rhedin et al. comparing PCR results between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, RSV, metapneumovirus and parainfluenza viruses had a significantly higher detection rate in children with acute respiratory infection, suggesting causation; however, other viruses (enterovirus, coronavirus, bocavirus, rhinovirus, and adenovirus) had an equally high detection rates in asymptomatic children (101) . Because of these positive viral detections in asymptomatic children, it is important that clinicians consider the big picture, and factor in other pertinent information that may indicate an active ongoing bacterial infection before discontinuing antibacterial agents based on a viral assay. The use of serum biomarkers (see section below) and whole blood gene expression analysis (118) may serve a crucial role in this setting to discern viral from bacterial sepsis. When faced with a septic child who has an unusual sepsis presentation, does not respond to usual therapies, or has persistently negative diagnostic evaluations, a viral etiology must be considered and consultation with an infectious disease expert is recommended.",19.291469249724088,9.08116341805414

We can make two hypotheses in this regard: the first is that viral shedding is truly intermittent, and the second is that viral shedding in semen is continuous but that the quantity of PEDV RNA is sometimes too low to be detected by RT-qPCR. Intermittent shedding of porcine viruses has already been shown for PCV2, CSF and PRRSV [29, [37] [38] [39] [40] . We also observed that shedding of PEDV in semen appeared before shedding in feces and prior to the onset of the clinical signs. This is consistent with the data reported for other porcine viruses, such as CSFV and Aujeszky's disease virus, which showed viral excretion occurring in semen before the development of clinical signs [21] . Therefore, boars infected by PEDV may be detected after delivery of potentially infected semen. Consequently, specific control measures should be implemented for breeding pigs before semen or boars are imported. This may include the control of seroconversion and control of the absence of previous virus shedding in feces and reporting clinical signs. Implementing these types of measures is particularly important because we have demonstrated that PEDV RNA can be detected in semen even when the boars no longer shed virus in feces and do not show any clinical signs.

In contrast, a hallmark of the asymptomatic response was upregulation of pathways that restrain cytokine signaling (SOCS2, SOCS5) and oxidative stress (SOD1, STK25), together with suppression of inflammasome signaling pathways. Of note, myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) accumulate in the lung during IAV infections, and may contribute to the immunosuppressive environment via production of IL-10 [112, 113] .

In addition to original findings of similar virus shedding frequency inducing asymptomatic infections among food handlers. Not only spreading the virus via food handlers, but the greater asymptomatic ratio allows infected individuals to be freely mobile and have more opportunities to pass the virus to others. When we assumed that the actual frequency of virus shedding from asymptomatic individuals is smaller than symptomatic cases, the asymptomatic ratio was estimated to be greater than the baseline. In other words, the estimated value around 30% might be even greater than our result. There was no statistically significant difference between GI and GII, while the AIC value was indicative that there might be a difference between GI and GII. This was caused by limited sample size, and slight non-significant differences (eg, greater risk of infection for GI than GII and smaller asymptomatic ratio for GI than GII) were identified, implying that GI might be more controllable than GII. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to epidemiologically endorse different patterns of outbreaks by genogroups in natural settings, though differences have been indicated in experimental studies. 12, 22, 23 While a greater asymptomatic ratio for GII.4 than others was consistent with our existing understanding, the smaller infection risk with GII.4 than others calls for careful interpretation. Due to the frequent circulation of GII.4, a portion of exposed individuals might have been immune in advance of outbreaks (that were not widespread before 2006 but may have remained unrecognized); moreover, evolutionary changes in GII.4 (eg, antigenic evolution) might have later varied the virus characteristics, including the infectiousness of GII.4.

We set the baseline value of α as 1.00, which indicates that asymptomatic and symptomatic cases have the same probability of virus shedding (due to a highly sensitive PCR testing method 8, 26 ), which is supported by empirical observation. 31, 32 However, as part of sensitivity analysis, the value of α was changed from 0.50 to 1.00, anticipating that virus shedding frequency from asymptomatic cases might potentially be smaller than that from symptomatic cases. Calculating the AIC for each interpretation scenario, the AIC of the genogroup-combined model (ie, a model with three parameters only) yielded the value of 1,227.9, while that of the genogroupseparated model (ie, a model with six parameters) was 1,177.4. The smaller value of AIC for a genogroup-separated model indicated that the model with genogroup information was better fitted to outbreak data, so there might potentially be a difference between GI and GII.

We stress that the estimated effectiveness ε d (t) for a long quarantine period (e.g., longer than 8 days) should be treated cautiously.

Methods: Employing a statistical model that is considered to capture the data-generating process of the outbreak and virus surveillance, maximum likelihood estimation of the asymptomatic ratio was implemented. Results: Assuming that all norovirus outbreaks (n = 55) were the result of random sampling from an identical distribution and ignoring genogroup and genotype specificities, the asymptomatic ratio was estimated at 32.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 27.7-36.7). Although not significant, separate estimation of the asymptomatic ratio of the GII.4 genotype appeared to be greater than other genotypes and was estimated at 40.7% (95% CI, 32.8-49.0). Conclusion: The present study offered the first explicit empirical estimates of the asymptomatic ratio of norovirus infection in natural infection settings.

Hence, another possibility is to apply interventions that reduce the time for virus clearance in infected people, decreasing transmission risk and, as a consequence, also decreasing the number of infected people. Such interventions for COVID-19 would require treatment as usually done for severe acute respiratory illnesses but problems still remain. First, there is potential transmission during virus incubation period, i.e., transmission before onset of symptoms when people typically will not enter treatment regimen, and the mean incubation period has been estimated at 5.2 days (95% CI: 4.1 -7.0 days) 4 . Also, there is evidence of asymptomatic individuals capable of transmitting SARS-Cov-2, but the proportion of asymptomatic cases or how intense transmission could be from those cases remains an open question 6 . The fact is that transmission before symptoms or even in asymptomatic individuals makes control even harder.

An example of this calculation can be found in the Additional file 1: Appendix. The average shedding rate for influenza was found to be an order of magnitude higher than for rhinovirus and norovirus. Existing studies characterizing the volume and frequency of shedding events were available for influenza and norovirus, but not rhinovirus. Given that rhinovirus causes similar upper respiratory tract symptoms as influenza, we used the same parameterization for these two pathogens for volume of fluid excretion and number of shedding events, but influenza had a higher concentration per shedding event. While viral shedding rates were similar for all age groups for both rhinovirus and norovirus, very young children (< 1 year) had higher influenza shedding rates [25] [26] [27] . Betweenindividual shedding rates were high among young children and we were only able to find estimates from one small study, which suggested that young children might shed up 2 orders of magnitude more than older individuals [25] . Both because data describing differences in shedding rates were sparse and because this difference in shedding was only found for young children who are less mobile and may interact with their environment in different ways, we used the same shedding rates for all age groups and venues in our simulations.

Our adjustments were made based on the prevalence of these risk factors in each province and their relative risk for childhood pneumonia as defined by Rudan et al. based on their review of the literature (Table 1) [11, 20] .

For persons $5 years old, the risk factors used for adjustment were household air pollution, crowding, and HIV prevalence. Due to a lack of studies found during a literature review of these risk factors for adult pneumonia, we assumed that the relative risk of SARI for each risk factor was the same as for children.",16.43528717740842,6.5076653703507175

Indeed, one study documented that 45% of cats start re-shedding feline herpesvirus after incurring a stressful event such as entering a new shelter or being rehoused [18] . The stress associated with hours of transport and being placed into a new shelter is likely to reactivate herpesvirus and contribute to clinical URI after a lag phase of 4-11 days [10] . Accordingly, a higher prevalence of URI in relocated cats should not be unexpected and in the authors' opinion it is surprising that the URI prevalence documented in this study was not higher. It should also be noted that diagnostic testing was not required as part of the case definition for URI; as such, the degree of viral shedding of individual cats was unknown and the true prevalence of URI infection may have been underestimated. As it has been documented that herpesvirus shedding significantly increases within the first 7 days of shelter entry, it is likely that many cats were shedding virus in this study, whether clinically ill or not [16, 19] . Although the cats in this study spent an undisclosed amount of time in previous shelters (their respective source agencies) and even though a direct comparison cannot be made to studies that diagnostically tested for disease, it is likely that the frequency of viral shedding was higher than the noted frequency of clinical cats. Accordingly, understanding that relocated animals are subjected to additional stress and potentially additional disease while in transport vehicles, as well as the fact that they may be subclinically shedding virus, the management of relocated cats should be similar to that of other shelter cats based on currently recognized best practices. Adequate and appropriate low-stress care, housing, sanitation, biosecurity measures and population density should be maintained to minimize the risk of URI development in all cats.",18.15080770362418,5.712374988353753

Based on this review, we define a new model of pathogen transmission that enables us to systematically compare the behaviour of alternative model structures and how they influence the estimated impact of control interventions. First, we analyse this model to establish the contribution of asymptomatic carriers to measures of pathogen transmission, the prevalence of symptomatic infections and the total infection (both symptomatic and asymptomatic) prevalence. We then consider how excluding asymptomatic carriers from this model could lead to the misinterpretation of data and the conditions under which this obscures the most important drivers of pathogen transmission.

It is not known whether the latter group are infectious, but clearly only the first two categories could potentially be detected by entry screening. Most people who were infected but asymptomatic on boarding will still be asymptomatic on arrival at their destination [23] . However, in the absence of effective exit screening during the H1N1 2009 pandemic, some countries decided to use ITIS in entry screening with the hope that detecting travellers who were febrile on arrival would be worthwhile to reduce the probability of infected travellers entering the country, and that ITIS could detect them [1] . This study provides evidence to the contrary. The low PPV of ITIS measures for fever in this population means that the number of false positives who would require further investigation, presumably by taking a tympanic temperature, would be very high. In this study, using a front of face ITIS threshold of 35.4uC identifies 69% of travellers as requiring further investigation, of whom only 4.1% had a tympanic temperature $37.5uC. The PPV of any of the measures of temperature for influenza infection itself was lower, at less than 3%. However, the prevalence of disease is an important determinant of PPV, and the prevalence of influenza infection in this study, performed during the 'influenza season', was low at 1.9%. There are no other published estimates of the prevalence of influenza in arriving travellers, but it could be argued that the prevalence of infection would be higher during a pandemic, which typically infects a higher proportion of the population than seasonal influenza, than in this study. On the other hand, particularly if local containment strategies were in place in originating countries, the prevalence of infection in travellers might be lower during a pandemic. At the beginning of a pandemic, when effective entry screening would be most useful, the prevalence of infection among travellers and therefore the PPV will likely be much lower than the prevalence of seasonal influenza in this study.",15.937536316411475,9.243190434628598

These communities are characterized by higher host-injury rates and poorer host health compared to communities where S. pyogenes has a much lower prevalence.

Excluding asymptomatic carriers from our model transforms it into a standard susceptible-infectedsusceptible (SIS) model. In the SIS model, the basic reproduction number R 0,SIS has the standard form R 0,SIS = β SIS /γ SIS , which is simply the ratio of transmission rate to recovery rate. The dynamics of the SIS model are well known [27] and are determined by the parameters defining R 0,SIS , i.e. β SIS and γ SIS . Similar to our model, in this SIS model the pathogen will become extinct if R 0,SIS ≤ 1. Otherwise, the pathogen will become endemic with total infection prevalenceP SIS = 1 − 1/R 0,SIS .

However, our analysis found very few epidemiological predictors for being named as a source contact multiple times, suggesting that simple demographic characteristics are unlikely to pinpoint those most at risk of super-spreading.

The most conservative and least conservative estimates were 8·6 days and 14·0 days, respectively. The duration of shedding based on the most realistic estimate decreased with age: 18 days in infants and 9 days in adults (aged 515 years). Symptomatic infections on average had longer virus shedding of 13·5 days compared to 7·8 days in asymptomatic episodes. The presented average durations of virus shedding are longer than published estimates of 6·7 days [4] , 3·4-7·4 days [10] , 3·9 days [11] , and 4·5 days [12] which could be attributed to differences in study methods. The present study was informed by critical review of the previous studies and it incorporated frequent sampling regardless of symptoms and screening by highly sensitive PCR methods. The specimen collection procedure was acceptable, recording a good compliance across all ages [7, 13] . The use of the sensitive viral detection method (PCR) results is likely to result in longer estimates of shedding. A community study nested within a birth cohort in coastal Kenya targeting symptomatic RSV infections by Okiro and colleagues reported a mean duration of shedding of 4·5 days [12] . Our corresponding estimate in symptomatic cases was 13·5 days. In a subset of the children whose start of symptoms could be established from the clinic records, the Okiro et al. study reported a longer duration of 7·7 days [12] . Given that RSV shedding has been reported to start before illness [6] , the actual duration in the symptomatic children would have been an underestimate and our estimate of 13·5 days is likely to be more accurate. A Rochester family study, in the USA, with similar design as the present study (collecting samples every 3-4 days regardless of symptoms) reported lower estimates of duration of shedding of 3·4-7·4 days [10] . The Okiro et al. and Rochester study used the immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT) and culture, respectively, which are less sensitive methods [14] . As a counter argument, it is not known to what degree PCR positivity equates with shedding of viable and infectious virus. Thus, while the molecular methods might be more sensitive, the resultant increase in duration of shedding over more traditional methods such as culture (which directly measures viral infectivity) may not necessarily translate to increased period of infectivity. Further work relating virus infectiousness and detectability is warranted. In the Okiro et al. study, sampling started when participants were symptomatic and stopped at the first negative follow-up sample. The present study revealed instances where negative samples arose within RSV infection episodes. Even though this observation raises, again, questions on the relationship between infectivity and shedding duration, accounting for periods of RSV-negative samples would still result to longer shedding duration compared to previous estimates. Alternative estimation of the shedding patterns by calculating the area under the C t (viral load) curve would have some additional advantages and will be explored in future.",15.288399449887052,7.417064568565051

The authors applied the same RT-PCR protocol as we did. Except for that particular study sampling oropharyngeal specimens, as we did, all other information on healthy children is derived from analysis of feces. Drexler and colleagues [12] did not detect SAFV-RNA in stool samples from 39 control children while the detection rate in children with diarrhea was 0.7% (6/844).

Our results demonstrating presence of SAFV in non-diseased individuals might be consistent with the results of these three studies, although the body site where the specimens were collected was quite different. Surprisingly, detection of SAFV seems to be more frequent in adenoid tissue (15.7%) than in non-tissue specimens from the respiratory tract. In a recent study, SAFV was detected in 9.7% of throat swabs from 226 Taiwanese-children with respiratory symptoms [4] .

HBoV2, at 17.2%, was the third most prevalent virus after rotavirus (39.2%) and astrovirus (21.5%), and was greater than that for NoV GII (13.4%) and adenovirus (4.8%). Two further factors may be influencing the prevalence rates for HBoV2 we have detected in both cases and controls. Firstly, S phase synchronized replication observed for other parvoviruses may also be applicable for HBoV2, in which case delayed and perhaps cyclical or pulsed shedding of HBoV2 during infection may result, consistent with our finding that 10 cases (31.2% of positive cases) had detectable virus only in their second sample. Therefore, the statistical association in the pooled sample data may better reflect the true disease association. Secondly, long term virus shedding post-infection, which is increasingly being recognized for other enteric viruses such as NoV GII [38] , may also account for asymptomatic carriage among the controls. However, until the natural history of HBoV2 infection is elucidated, the influence of S phase replication and asymptomatic shedding can only be speculative.",21.36120304559204,7.176968755156661

First, one cannot rule out the possibility that the PCR detection of the virus preceded a symptomatic episode, i.e., viral presence was observed during the incubation period [94, 104] . Second, in studies that involve young children, parental registration of the infant health status might be a major confounder, as the presence of minor respiratory symptoms like a runny nose may be underestimated. Third, viral presence might indicate a true subclinical infection. A recent study [95] revealed that the median viral load of rhinovirus was significantly lower in asymptomatic children than in symptomatic children, with a total absence of clinical symptoms when the viral load was below a certain threshold. Another study analyzed the bronchoalveolar lavage fluids of asymptomatic children attending elective surgery to reveal the effect of viral presence on the immune system. The authors found that viral presence was associated with significantly higher neutrophil counts, but not macrophage, lymphocyte, and eosinophil counts [105] . This may imply that a low viral load only triggers a minor inflammatory response without causing respiratory symptoms. Fourth, the duration of viral shedding varies greatly between studies and seems to be strongly dependant on viral species, selected patient population, and method of detection [104, [106] [107] [108] . Therefore, detected viruses may mark an expiring infection. Finally, prolonged detection of viral presence may be due to the sequential presence of different serotypes of the same viral species [104, 109] . For example, for adenovirus, it was recently shown that prolonged or repeated persistence of viral nucleic acids might actually be caused by both persistent viral shedding and consecutive infection with different serotypes/strains [108] . However, few other studies discriminate between the exact serotypes of the viruses found in the nasopharynx of asymptomatic children [99] . Most likely, interplay of these factors will influence the presence of viral species in the nasopharynx of healthy asymptomatic children, though the clinical relevance of these findings remains unclear and needs further investigation.",19.81928797081116,6.568541417323064

Coinfection with S. pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenza is common in most populations studied, particularly in children. In in vitro co-culture studies, the former has repeatedly demonstrated a clear growth and fitness advantage over the latter, but the converse is true in coinfection studies in a murine model. Investigation of the mechanism of this in vivo effect implicates a complex modulation of the host immune response, which results in a selection for virulent S. pneumoniae strains. Conversely, during coinfection with S. pneumoniae and S. aureus, the former strongly attenuates carriage of the latter, probably also via an immune-mediated mechanism. During coinfection with S. pneumoniae and influenza virus, the latter attenuates immune suppression of the bacterium, engendering a synergism in pathogenesis between the two.

HCV transmissions are difficult to link to their corresponding source of infection because intrahost viral populations are often genetically related but seldom identical [95, 119] . Importantly, branching in phylogenetic analyses, derived from genetic relatedness studies, do not always correspond to transmission events, particularly in those cases where not all individuals belonging to the transmission network are sampled ( Figure 5 ).

HCV evolution is also affected by preexisting liver conditions, infection with other viruses and also pregnancy as a direct consequence of the alterations of the immune response in the mother [17] . During pregnancy, increased viral loads and a reduction in CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity are commonly observed, favoring the emergence of more fit strains [121] as a result of the impairment of the antiviral response in the mother.

Thus, a robust diagnostic assay capable of the rapid, sensitive and specific detection of S. pneumoniae in near-patient settings could play a significant role in the reduction of pneumococcal disease related morbidity and mortality, particularly in developing countries. Isothermal in vitro nucleic acid amplification strategies are of great interest in molecular diagnostics, as they negate the need for thermocycling, as is the case for PCR. In PCR, thermocycling is required to facilitate the separation of double-stranded DNA to enable amplification. The major isothermal amplification techniques currently utilised include: Nucleic Acid Sequence based Amplification (NASBA) [42] , Transcription Mediated Amplification (TMA) [43] , Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) [44] , Helicase Dependant Amplification (HDA) [45] , Rolling Circle Amplification (RCA) [46] and Strand Displacement Amplification (SDA) [47] . Of these, NASBA, TMA, RCA and SDA cannot be considered truly isothermal as they require an initial heating step to denature the target nucleic acid prior to amplification. RPA, HDA and LAMP can be considered truly isothermal, as there is no requirement for a denaturation step to initiate amplification. The operating temperature of LAMP is typically 60-65°C, at which temperature the nucleic acid target is in dynamic equilibrium, enabling the binding of primers to their target sequence and subsequent amplification. Whilst LAMP is inexpensive to perform, primer design is complex and multiplex amplification is at present difficult. Both HDA and RPA use proteins to facilitate the binding of primers to their respective template and both technologies enable multiplex amplification. The major advantage of RPA over other competing isothermal amplification technologies is its speed, being capable of amplifying single-digit copy numbers of nucleic acids to detectable levels in 5-10 minutes.",14.857185847518544,11.038724865948353

Two or more pathogens were found in 56% (63/112) of the asymptomatic children and in 55.5% (50/90) of the symptomatic children. The prevalence of the four bacterial pathogens is shown in Table 5 . As reported previously, the prevalence of these bacterial species was largely age-dependent [20] . We found a significantly higher prevalence of S. aureus in the asymptomatic group than in the symptomatic group. However, when adjusted for age this difference in prevalence was not significant. An association between the presence of any of these four bacterial species and M. pneumoniae was not detected. Almost all of the viruses screened for were detected in both groups (Table 6 ). We did not perform a statistical analysis to detect differences in the distribution of cycle threshold values since our study was not powered for this purpose. Rhinovirus, bocavirus, and parainfluenzavirus 4 were detected more frequently in asymptomatic children than in symptomatic children. In contrast, influenzaviruses A and B, human metapneumovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus were predominantly detected in symptomatic children. The majority of the children (from both groups) tested positive for more than one pathogen ( Figure 6 ). Group-specific combinations of pathogens could not be identified. In addition, none of the viruses were associated with the presence of M. pneumoniae.

The importance of an environmental factor in viral persistence has been shown in an experiment that monitored AIV isolation rates before and after days that the market was disinfected [8] . However, whether this environmental persistence adds to transmission has not been determined empirically. Theoretically, indirect transmission via an environmental reservoir could contribute to the overall force of infection within rLBMs by providing a sustained source of AIV (i.e., by providing a transmission link between birds even if they do not occupy the market at the same time) [9] . Indirect transmission can occur through a variety of routes, including viruses in drinking water, in feces on the ground or on surfaces in cages. All of these routes rely on three main processes: shedding rates into/on a particular environmental feature, decay rates of the virus in it, and contact of susceptible birds with it. Intuitively, one would predict that indirect transmission would be most significant when shedding rates are high, decay rates are low and contact rates are high.",14.232939568812817,6.999693936784375

Incubation periods for AIVs in poultry can be up to 2 days when birds are inoculated with doses less than or equal to 10 3 , and around 1 day when doses are higher [6] . Making the worst-case assumption that susceptible and infectious hosts are in constant contact, this means that the minimum time infectious individuals can create other infectious individuals is 1 day, and higher on average. Thus, if the average staytime of birds in rLBMs is ≤ 2 days, there is not time for exponential growth of prevalence due to direct transmission within rLBMs (e.g., ""outbreaks""). In addition, direct transmission alone may not cause significant amplification of prevalence within rLBMs because birds that entered the market uninfected have a high probability of being slaughtered before they begin shedding AIV. A similar principle has been identified in other animal-disease systems. For example, epizootics of plague in prairie dog populations have been shown not to occur by blocked-flea or pneumonic transmission alone, because both blocked vectors and hosts capable of direct transmission are removed from the population by death before they reliably create large chains of transmission required for outbreaks [7] .

By contrast, severe cases of type B3 infection in otherwise healthy children have been previously described. 17 Multiple severe infections with a variety of B subtypes have also been described in military recruits, suggesting that the entire B subgroup may have a higher propensity for severe disease in children and young adults. 12 Underlying epidemiologic and virologic differences between adenovirus species likely accounts for the findings of our study. While a number of species B adenoviruses have been associated with severe respiratory disease outbreaks among otherwise healthy adults, 5,12 species C adenoviruses are encountered much earlier in life as common causes of acute respiratory infection among infants and young children. 18, 19 Moreover, species C adenovirus infections are persistent; periods of latent infection, viral reactivation, and prolonged shedding of species C adenoviruses have been described. 20 This phenomenon of asymptomatic persistent infection may explain the endemic nature of species C adenovirus infection and may also account for observed milder forms of disease due to frequent interaction with the human host.",14.534575370346003,6.610354230392051

A new coronavirus was found to be a causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). SARS-HCoV caused a serious lower respiratory tract infection with high mortality. Diarrhea is common in this condition, and in one study was registered in 38.4% of patients. In the same study, SARS-HCoV was also isolated from intestinal tissue, and viral RNA was detected in stool samples. Moreover, non-SARS HCoVs can be found in stool samples of children with AGE. However, most of the HCoV findings were coinfections with well-known enteric pathogens -norovirus and rotavirus. It is also difficult to determine whether HCoVs in the respiratory tract in cases of AGE were primarily causing the respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms. HCoVs may also be found in occasional stool samples of children without gastroenteritis. These findings suggest that known HCoVs may at most have a minor etiologic role in AGE of children. 70 Human rotavirus (family Reoviridae, genus Rotavirus) in the past was considered to be responsible for the most severe episodes of diarrhea in children. 71, 72 There have been reports of epidemics in neonatal intensive care units caused by rotavirus or enterovirus that can determine cases of necrotizing enterocolitis or necrotizing enterocolitis-like symptoms: abdominal distention, bloody diarrhea, and septicemia secondary to enteric bacteria. Improved diagnostic tools for norovirus (family Caliciviridae, genus Norovirus): have shown that it has a major role in both epidemic and sporadic cases of gastroenteritis. 59, 73 Sapoviruses (family Caliciviridae, genus Sapovirus): mainly infect children younger than 5 years of age. 59 The illness is milder than that caused by noroviruses. 73 Antibody prevalence studies show that virtually all children are infected with sapoviruses by the time they are 5 years of age, indicating that sapovirus infection is widespread, although the illness most likely is sporadic with a high rate of asymptomatic infection. 59, 74, 75 Torque teno midi virus/small anellovirus (TTMDV/SAV) is a member of the family Anelloviridae. Although human TTV infection is ubiquitous and several infecting genogroups of the virus have been identified, to date there is no consistent evidence of a link between TTV infection of humans and specific disease. [76] [77] [78] [79] In a recent Hungarian study, viral shedding, molecular epidemiology, and genetic diversity of TTMDV/ SAV were studied in human body fluids (nasopharyngeal aspirates of children with acute respiratory diseases and serum, stool and urine samples collected from eight healthy children with previous TTMDV/SAV infection). In this study, shedding of TTMDV/SAV and related viruses was detected in two other human body fluids, feces and urine, suggesting the existence of fecal-oral/urinary-oral transmission routes beyond the originally presumed blood-borne and later-suggested respiratory route.

Viruses generally lack universally conserved genetic regions such as ribosomal RNA that are present in bacteria or fungi, although degenerate primers may occasionally target conserved regions within related virus groups.

Respiratory viruses are ubiquitous pathogens of the upper respiratory tract and cause pneumonia by progressive invasion of the respiratory epithelium, leading to diffuse inflammation that eventually overwhelms normal host defenses to infect the lower airways. Histologically, viral CAP is characterized by diffuse interstitial and parenchymal lymphocytic proliferation [51, 52] . Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses (PIV), influenza, adenovirus, and others have long been implicated as important pathogens [41, [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] (Table 1) . Pathogens recently implicated as a cause of pneumonia include human metapneumovirus (hMPV) [59] , human bocavirus (hBoV) [60] , and novel rhinovirus and coronavirus species [61] . Studies using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based detection methods have documented viruses in 60%-80% of children with CAP [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] , confirming the importance of RSV as the major cause of viral pneumonia (19%-42% of pneumonia cases) and also highlighting the role of rhinovirus (14%-26%), hBoV (2%-18%), hMPV (2%-12%), PIV (2%-11%), influenza (3%-10%), and adenovirus (2%-18%). Viral pathogens represent the most common cause of CAP in children less than 5 years of age, and especially those less than 2 years of age. Tsolia et al [68] also documented a high prevalence of viral pneumonia among older children who were hospitalized with CAP, although in contrast to young children, RSV was rarely detected (3%), whereas rhinovirus accounted for nearly half of the viruses detected. A consequence of highly sensitive diagnostics is the potential identification of colonizers and asymptomatic shedding from nonsterile sites rather than true causative pathogens. Epidemiologic studies that have included asymptomatic controls document a high prevalence of viral pathogens among controls (10%-47%), although viral detections are generally lower than that detected among cases (16%-70%) [66, 67, 69, 70] . These studies indicate that RSV is the only viral pathogen that is consistently associated with disease. Results for other pathogens are variable. Rhinovirus and hBoV are often implicated in infections with 2 or more pathogens [62, 63] , both are frequent causes of upper respiratory tract infections, and both exhibit prolonged shedding after acute infection [71, 72] . Nonetheless, rhinovirus has been recovered from the lower airways of experimentally infected adult volunteers [73] [74] [75] , and serologic evidence of acute infection with hBoV has been reported in children with CAP [76, 77] .

Clearly, the field of virology has grown to the extent that a ''state-of-the-art'' paper would be exhaustive in length. Accordingly, this review focuses on specific viral cell interactions that allow the virus to survive the cellular attack and evade the immune system, establish persistent infections, and cause chronic disease.

Asexual reproduction in the snail produces cercariae, another free-swimming aquatic stage with a lifespan on the order of a day, which penetrate the intact skin of a definitive host and mature into adult worms. The worms sexually pair and the female lays copious numbers of eggs that are the source of pathogenic response in the host. Some of these eggs find their way into the feces or urine, are excreted and the cycle begins again. The intermediate host, a freshwater snail and the two free-living aquatic stages are known to be subject to environmental stresses such as temperature 1 and shear forces present in the water column. 2 For S. japonicum, the species that causes schistosomiasis in east and southeast Asia, transmission is further complicated by the fact that a variety of mammals can serve as the definitive host, 3 including rodents, dogs, cats, pigs and water buffalo, the latter of which is particularly important to sustaining transmission in the lower Yangtze environment. 4 In China, considerable progress has been made since the 1950s controlling transmission of S. japonicum in humans and domestic animals.

The enclosure with the highest prevalence was an artificial reproduction of a tropical sylvan; it was fully enclosed and, therefore, was not open to the natural elements. The artificially high humidity and moderate temperatures might have contributed to the protection and sustained viability of the oocysts. Larger enclosures that were more exposed to the elements showed a decreased prevalence of Cryptosporidium. Although housing was one of the contributing factors to variation in prevalence, differences in animal density, species, age and oocyst-shedding intensity, and varying cleaning regimes among the three enclosures could also have contributed to the observed differences. Although this study had a small sample size and, ideally, should be repeated with a larger number of animals, it highlights the importance of housing as a possible risk factor for captive wildlife. Zoo architects and managers should consider this type of information when designing and maintaining animal enclosures. Based on morphometric data, all isolates from the Barcelona Zoo animals were identified as C. parvum and it was hypothesized that the transmission of the parasite could have occurred through water that had run off from one enclosure to another, or through the transport of fecal material on the boots of the zookeepers [16] . Without genetic characterization, it is difficult to draw any solid conclusions from these studies about transmission. The animals could have been harboring their own hostadapted Cryptosporidium genotype that would make the issue of transmission from animal to animal both within and among enclosures less of a threat. If the animals carried identical strains of Cryptosporidium, however, there would be a stronger case for cross-enclosure contamination.

Fortunately, they produce LRI only occasionally and sporadically. Adenoviral pneumonia, most commonly caused by types 3, 5, and 7, initially progresses much like the pneumonia described for RSV and parainfl uenza viruses (see Fig. 33-1) , but the illnesses can be extremely severe and can last for several weeks. Adenovirus types 3 and 7 have been associated with epidemics of LRI. 30 Risk factors for severe, potentially lethal disease include immunocompromise, congenital heart disease, and protein-calorie malnutrition. During the acute phase, chest radiographs often reveal extensive consolidation, particularly in perihilar areas ( Fig. 33-4) . These fi ndings, along with a frequent occurrence of high fevers, leukocytosis, and multisystem involvement, can make it diffi cult to discern such infections from bacterial conditions. Other systemic manifestations that sometimes develop are hepatic dysfunction (including Reye's syndrome 31 ), encephalopathy, coagulopathies, measles-like exanthems, and diarrhea. 32 The diagnosis is confi rmed best by the detection of the virus in tissues such as lung aspirate or biopsy specimens. Because asymptomatic shedding from the throat or gastroin-testinal tract is common in young children, isolation of the virus from the throat must be regarded as diagnostically supportive but not confi rmatory, and isolation from stools or rectal swabs needs to be interpreted even more cautiously. Serologic studies of paired acute and convalescent sera obtained at least 2 weeks apart may further aid in confi rming the diagnosis. Rapid detection has been used, including immunofl uorescence and immunoenzyme assays.

HIV-1-infected mothers have defective transfer of IgG antibodies across the placenta, resulting in lower titres of protective antibodies in the infant, which increases the period of susceptibility to MV infection prior to routine immunization. HIV-1-infected children that are vaccinated against MV might become susceptible to MV owing to progressive HIV-1-induced immunosuppression. Children with defective cell-mediated immunity might not develop the characteristic measles rash, and infection might therefore go unrecognized, with the potential for widespread transmission of MV, particularly in healthcare settings. Finally, HIV-1-infected children might have impaired cell-mediated immune clearance and prolonged shedding of MV 39 , increasing the period of infectivity and the spread of MV to secondary contacts. However, even if HIV-1-infected children lose protective immunity over time, the high mortality rate of HIV-infected children, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa where approximately one third of untreated HIV-1-infected children die by one year of age and half are dead by two years of age, is such that they do not live long enough for a sizeable pool of MV-susceptible children to accumulate 42 . This might change with increased access to antiretroviral drugs.

However, the prevalence appeared to decrease with age, with the highest prevalence of 29.0 % in the age group of less than 1 year old ( Table 1 ).

First, a heterogeneous network is used so that individuals have differing numbers of contacts, reflecting the important role of super-spreaders or coregroups in the transmission and persistence of infection. This adaptation is appropriate for a wide range of infections. We use a network based on observed social networks (Klovdahl et al. 1977) , but parameterizations from other networks produce comparable results. Second, a proportion of infected individuals are assumed to be asymptomatic: these individuals seldom seek treatment and consequently have a much longer infectious period (see electronic Appendix A). Figure 2a ,b shows the equilibrium prevalence of infection as control measures are varied. The axes reflect the effort expended on each of the two major control mechanisms: identification of those individuals with symptoms (x-axis) and the contacttracing efficiency ( y-axis). When the proportion of new cases that are asymptomatic is larger (figure 2b) the importance of contact tracing increases. As asymptomatics are rarely detected or treated, it may be impossible to eradicate the infection without contact tracing even if symptomatic individuals are identified and treated immediately. Contact tracing is essential for eradication when each asymptomatic case is expected to give rise to at least one more asymptomatic case, i.e. when (basic reproductive ratio of asymptomatics) × (probability of asymptomatic infection) Ͼ 1. Because asymptomatics may subsequently cause symptomatic cases, contact tracing can potentially identify and treat such individuals, dramatically reducing the force of the infection. The prevalence of infection in the population largely determines the optimal balance between the identification of symptomatic individuals and contact tracing. Contact tracing is favoured when infection is globally Figure 2 . Prevalence of infection using the pairwise model for an STD in a realistic heterogeneous network. Asymptomatic individuals, who primarily receive treatment through tracing, are included.

First, clinical testing was done at the discretion of the treating clinician. Thus, some patients may not have had testing ordered or had a residual specimen for testing at MDH, leading to an underestimation of cases. A second caveat is that children, particularly those aged <1 year, are more likely to be hospitalized for respiratory infections and therefore have respiratory specimens obtained for testing [36] . This is reflected in the fact that 57% of patients from the SARI surveillance program were aged <5 years. Third, no information was obtained about underlying medical conditions or follow-up data for outpatient cases, and thus, a comparative analysis of comorbidities and outcomes with SARI cases was not possible. Finally, influenza C virus was commonly codetected with other viral pathogens. When compared to culture-based methods, molecular detection methods such as ours frequently detect multiple infections, which poses a challenge to interpretation [37] . Viral nucleic acid may be detectable for prolonged periods of time, including in asymptomatic individuals, and it can be difficult to distinguish among symptomatic infection, asymptomatic shedding, and noninfectious viral debris [37] . Therefore, it will also be important to measure influenza C virus prevalence in asymptomatic controls to address the potential for asymptomatic shedding. Nevertheless, by conducting surveillance in a large population and by incorporating multiplexed testing for other known pathogens, we identified 24 cases with influenza C virus but no copathogens detected. This included 2 cases who became ill enough to warrant ICU admission. While we cannot rule out the possibility that another agent is the primary cause of symptoms, these data raise the possibility that influenza C virus has the potential to cause more disease than previously appreciated.",33.57022348100843,19.31771922577635

The young infants had minimal antibody responses, although there were detectable serum levels of IgG and IgA to the G protein.

A second dose of vaccine, the response to which can be used as a surrogate for reinfection, resulted in rare shedding of the virus and no evidence of enhanced RSV illness once infected.

HCT recipients appeared to be more affected than patients with HM. Although respiratory copathogens were frequently detected, the clinical outcomes of these patients were similar to those without copathogens. The mortality rate of HCT recipients by day 90 after developing HCoV LRTD was similar to rates seen with established respiratory pathogens including RSV, influenza virus, and PIV ( Figure 3 and Table 6 ) [16] [17] [18] . All 4 HCoV strains were identified in BAL samples regardless of the presence of copathogens, and at least 2 HCoV strains were present nearly half of the year.

In addition, respiratory copathogens were identified in more than half the episodes in this study (57%). Given the prolonged asymptomatic shedding and frequent detection of respiratory copathogens, attributing poor clinical outcomes to HCoV in the lower respiratory tract may be difficult.

More data are needed to define shedding duration in the immunocompromised population. In our study, clinical outcomes including intensity of respiratory support, days alive without hospitalization, and mortality were not significantly different between patients with and without other copathogens, suggesting that HCoV in the lower respiratory tract can contribute to severity of LRTD regardless of copathogens.

There are four predominant PIV serotypes including: PIV-1, PIV-2, PIV-3 and PIV-4 [27] . Until recently, PIV-4 was rarely isolated since most diagnostic assays available did not include reagents for the detection of PIV-4 and so less information is available on this PIV subtype. In the northern hemisphere, PIV occurs year-round with PIV-1 occurring most frequently in the fall, PIV-2 occurring in the fall to early winter and PIV-3 occuring in the spring and summer months [24, 27] . Infections caused by PIV are usually mild, ranging from asymptomatic shedding to the common cold, croup and bronchiolitis. Similar to RSV, PIV infection occurs frequently in children, with most children exposed to PIV-3 by the age of two and PIV-1 by the age of 5 [24] . The reported incidence of PIV in HSTC populations ranges from 0.2 to 18% with 13 to 43% progressing to lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) and 12 to 50% of these LRTI resulting in death with most infections caused by PIV-3 [18, 28] .

Many children enrolled in our childcare facilities were never symptom-free, particularly when considering cough and rhinorrhea. Each new illness episode that was close in timing to a prior illness episode was reviewed by the study staff and a consensus decision was made to decide whether this should be classified as a new episode versus a continuation of a prior illness. In general, children who developed new symptoms, as opposed to worsening of previous symptoms, were classified as having a new illness episode. Finally, we sequenced RSV from only 42% of episodes, though our ability to sequence viruses from clinical samples is consistent with other studies characterizing RSV transmission. 35 Our study shows that the childcare setting is a significant source of rapid child-to-child RSV transmission, and that once acquired, RSV leads to significantly greater symptom duration than other respiratory viruses. These results highlight the significant clinical and socioeconomic impact of RSV in the community, and emphasize that the childcare setting is an important potential site of interventions to reduce the burden of RSV disease.

Since then, the pathogen has become a major cause of foodborne and waterborne illness worldwide, and a medical and public health challenge. The microorganism is thought to have evolved by the horizontal acquisition of virulence genes that encode Shiga toxins and other virulence factors. Cattle, along with some other ruminant species, are the principal animate reservoir for E. coli O157:H7 strains. In these animals, the bacteria may be present in the gastrointestinal tract, particularly the terminal recto-anal junction, without causing clinical disease, and asymptomatic animals may shed them from these locations into the environment. Escherichia coli super-shedding and super-spreading by cattle is shaped by a multitude of factors, which can be grouped into pathogenspecific, host-specific and environmental causes.

For example, NPI efficacy is poorly quantified in the epidemiological literature, and it is not always known in what situations individuals may practice them most often. Thus, we assume that NPIs for the spreading disease are not used initially, but in reality there may be some baseline level of NPIs used in the population due to other circulating diseases. Moreover, we do not model the effects of NPI practices that infectious individuals may utilize, such as self isolation. Instead, we make the assumption that infectious NPI use is absorbed into the transmission rate. Also, the network we used in our simulations could be extended to distinguish family, friend, and work structures, where transmission rates to an individual can vary depending on what category certain network contacts fall in. Similarly, age structure can be introduced into the model. As children will be much less likely to effectively practice NPIs, disease transmission in these groups may be more rapid than our model predicts. Finally, we did not include the impact of asymptomatic infections, and assumed all cases were identifiable in our main results. However, we also considered a scenario where 50% of cases were asymptomatic (see SI), and the primary results regarding vaccine efficacy and vaccine availability delays across various transmission rates are qualitatively the same. Although the main results are similar, in future work that aims to model a specific disease, accounting for asymptomatic infections is an important factor.",15.41141959297487,4.791676360803247

Two types of outpatient controls without pneumonia included asymptomatic children and children with upper respiratory tract infection. In a preliminary analysis from one study site in rural Kenya, respiratory viruses were detected in most (60%) children less than 5 years old with pneumonia but also in controls (47%). 14 Of the viruses detected, RSV was the most commonly detected virus in case-patients but not controls with a statistically significant association between virus detection and pneumonia hospitalization. 14 In other pneumonia studies conducted in high-, low-, and middle-income countries, although the prevalence of specific viruses varies greatly, viruses are more commonly detected than bacteria, particularly in children. Prevalence of viruses can vary by geography and other factors, such as immunization coverage, as well as study design, including case definitions, specimen collection methods, and diagnostic tools applied; however, in most of these studies, certain viruses predominate, including RSV but also HMPV, AdV, and PIV. In a study of severe and very severe pneumonia conducted in Kenya and using multiplex PCR, a virus was detected in 56% of children less than 12 years old; RSV was most common and detected in 34% of children. 15 In a different study conducted in Mozambique, viruses were detected in 49% of children with severe pneumonia, and in this case, HRV (41%), AdV (21%), and RSV (11%) were the most common. 16 In similar studies, HMPV, AdV, PIV, and CoV combined account for 25% to 40% of pathogens detected in children when using PCR methods. 17, 18 In many studies, codetections (viral and bacterial) in children with pneumonia have been demonstrated in more than one-quarter of cases. 7, 14, 19 The role of viruses in adults has had increasing attention because viruses like RSV and HMPV have been commonly detected in systematic studies of hospitalized adults. 20, 21 Although the same viruses that circulate in children also affect adults, the prevalence of the viruses differs between children and adults with pneumonia and also compared with data from controls. For example, HRV has been commonly detected in adult pneumonia patients, including from sterile lower respiratory tract specimens; in contrast with children, HRV is not commonly detected among adult asymptomatic controls and is often detected as the sole pathogen in adults, whereas, in children, it is often codetected. 3, 4, 8, [22] [23] [24] [25] Influenza viruses are a known contributor to viral pneumonia, 25 as well as a precursor to bacterial pneumonia, and are a common cause of pneumonia among persons 65 years and older.

In very severe pneumonia, in children in low-income settings, chloramphenicol may be given first with benzylpenicillin and gentamicin in combination as an alternative [10, 11] .",14.399055776427744,8.806695886553024

Because most of these specimens do not come not directly from the lung, it is difficult to discern the association of a pathogen detection with pneumonia. Thus, many studies have enrolled asymptomatic controls along with pneumonia cases to help determine the possible contribution of respiratory viruses (attributable risk) to pneumonia at a population level. However, studies show variable prevalence of viruses among controls, possibly due to differences in definitions and methods for ascertainment of controls. 32 Different strategies for control enrollment may be applicable to different study objectives and settings. 32 In the EPIC study, all pathogens except for HRV were detected in 3% or less of asymptomatic controls; HRV was detected in 17% of pediatric controls compared with 22% of children with pneumonia (P 5 .04). 7, 8 In asymptomatic adult controls, only 2% had any pathogen detection, compared with 27% among the patients hospitalized with pneumonia; interestingly, HRV was rarely detected in adult controls (1%). 3, 8 In the EPIC study, the attributable fraction (AF) was calculated by comparing prevalence of viruses in pneumonia cases with asymptomatic controls, and adjusting for age, enrollment month, and enrollment city. In this analysis, the AF indicated that the detection of influenza, RSV, and HMPV among all patients, both children Epidemiology of Viral Pneumonia and adults, indicated an etiologic role. However, the detections of PIV, CoV, and AdV, particularly in children, did not demonstrate high AF for pneumonia. HRV was associated with pneumonia in adults but not children. 8 The exact role of HRV in pneumonia remains unclear and controversial, even when detected as a single pathogen, particularly because HRV can shed for greater than 2 weeks after a primary infection, making its detection at time of pneumonia challenging to interpret with respect to the current clinical illness. [22] [23] [24] Data from the EPIC study are similar to other US data from Singleton and colleagues, 33 which compared asymptomatic Alaskan children less than 3 years old from the community with children hospitalized with respiratory infections.

However, optimal IP&C strategies for respiratory viruses in the NICU population are unknown and highly variable as demonstrated in a nationwide study conducted in the United Kingdom [25] . Our data suggest that a combination of IP&C strategies including excluding family members with illnesses, excluding visitors less than 12 years of age year-round, and screening asymptomatic infants in close proximity to an infant with a respiratory virus decreases the transmission event rates, although our sample may have been too small to assess the sustained effect of the interventions over time. Excluding sibling visitors and screeningexposed infants are practices that have been implemented in some NICUs in the U.K [25] and others have shown that restricting sibling visitors reduced RSV [26] .

In the 21st century, using large-scale molecular virus screening, several novel viruses have been discovered in patients with respiratory infections. These viruses include human metapneumovirus (hMPV), polyomaviruses KI and WU, several coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, MERS-CoV) and human bocavirus (HBoV) as described by Allander et al. in 2005 [1-3] . The DNA virus HBoV is a member of the family Parvoviridae, genus Bocaparvovirus. HBoV is classified into genotypes 1 through 4. HBoV1 is predominantly found in respiratory tract secretions from children with RTD, and HBoV2-4 are found mainly in stool samples from patients with gastroenteritis [3, 4] . HBoV is predominantly present in winter and spring [5] . The average prevalence of HBoV in respiratory tract samples ranges from 1.0% to 56.8%, depending on the country. The worldwide estimate for the total prevalence of HBoV in respiratory infections is 6.3% [6] . HBoV has been reported worldwide in all age groups; however, it has mainly been detected in children who presented at the hospital with RTD. A high HBoV viral load could be an etiologic agent for severe LRTI, and these patients may develop bronchitis and pneumonia with fever, cough and peribronchial infiltrates detected on a chest X-ray [7, 8] . Low viral loads in coinfection indicate more asymptomatic shedding [9] . Furthermore, HBoV has been suggested as a cause of pediatric gastrointestinal (GI) infection [10, 11] and might even have a causal role in encephalitis [12] [13] [14] [15] . However, it has also been found in children with mild infections [16] and in asymptomatic ones, and therefore, the pathogenic role of HBoV is still under discussion [8, 17] . Classically, Koch's postulates have been used to establish a causal relationship between viruses and disease [18] . As there is no animal model so far for HBoV, proving its clinical relevance is challenging. However, HBoV can replicate in human airway epithelium cultures [6, 19] , and Deng et al. showed that HBoV1 induces damage to the airway epithelium (loss of cilia, disruption of the tight junction barrier, and a significant decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance) [20, 21] . Furthermore, serological diagnosis of HBoV has recently confirmed significant increases in IgG antibodies in children with pneumonia. These results support the idea that it is a true pathogen in RTI in children [22, 23] . Prolonged viral shedding has been described, about 2.5 months in outpatients and about 4.5 months to 1 year in hospitalized children, which probably explains why HBoV is detected in asymptomatic cases. This prolonged shedding may also explain why the rate of coinfection with other viruses is so high, ranging from 75% to 85% [24] .",17.053482100259775,7.777007270566651

More recently, it has been suggested that an increased HBoV load in respiratory specimens, viremia, and seroconversion can be used to differentiate acute infections from prolonged shedding [6, 7, 9, [19] [20] [21] [22] . In addition, a recent study in a limited number of children with RTI (n = 133) and asymptomatic controls (n = 28) demonstrated that spliced HBoV capsid messenger RNA (mRNA), as a measure for active viral replication, was more strongly associated with RTI, particularly lower RTI, than detection of HBoV genomic DNA [23] . Similarly, detection of mRNA has been used as a marker for acute infections with other parvoviruses [24] [25] [26] . On the basis of these findings, we hypothesized that spliced viral capsid mRNA produced during active replication may be a better marker than HBoV genomic DNA of acute RTI associated with HBoV infection. In this study, we tested our hypothesis by performing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis for both spliced capsid mRNA and genomic DNA on nasopharyngeal (NP) and oropharyngeal (OP) swab specimens from 1295 children hospitalized with CAP and 721 children undergoing elective outpatient surgery who were asymptomatic at enrollment (controls).

Movement of animals between farms is one of the most significant routes of disease transmission and is particularly hard to control for pathogens with subclinical infection. Renibacterium salmoninarum causes bacterial kidney disease (BKD) in salmonid fish, but infection is often sub-clinical and may go undetected with major potential implications for disease control programmes. A Susceptible-Infected model of R. salmoninarum in Scottish aquaculture has been developed that subdivides the infected phase between known and undetected sub-clinically infected farms and diseased farms whose status is assumed to be known. Farms officially known to be infected are subject to movement controls restricting spread of infection. Model results are sensitive to prevalence of undetected infection, which is unknown. However, the modelling suggests that controls that reduce BKD prevalence include improve biosecurity on farms, including those not known to be infected, and improved detection of infection. Culling appears of little value for BKD control. BKD prevalence for rainbow trout farms is less sensitive to controls than it is for Atlantic salmon farms and so different management strategies may be required for the sectors.",18.29168471168839,7.160205569515397

First, we assumed that the rate of zoonotic introductions into the human populations was constant. This assumption may be reasonable if MERS-CoV prevalence level in the zoonotic reservoir has reached an endemic state and the rate of animal-to-human contacts was stable throughout our study period. Similarly, we have not attempted to quantify changes in the baseline transmission rate or the relative transmissibility of hospitalized cases over time, but we fit our model solely to cases that occurred when pro-active surveillance was implemented in Saudi Arabia (Memish et al., 2014) . Further, we assume that asymptomatic cases do not transmit infection. However, given that MERS-CoV secondary cases have typically been traceable to an index case it seems unlikely that there can be much asymptomatic transmission as this would lead to difficulty in reconstructing transmission chains. Another limitation of our model is that parameters ˇ and l were not uniquely identified, although we were able to find reasonably well-bounded estimates of R. This is not entirely surprising, as a similar phenomenon occurs when a simple SIR model is fitted to the early exponential phase of an epidemic. In such a simple model, both ˇ (the transmission rate) and (the recovery rate) are not identifiable.

The fi rst documented case of infection due to PCR ribotype 027 in Ireland was in a patient transferred from a hospital in the UK, 41 and the only reported case in Western Australia was in a patient transferred from the USA. 57 Other anecdotal reports also suggest this as a possible (although unproven) means of international spread. For example, transfer of patients from Belgium was investigated as a potential source of introduction of C diffi cile PCR ribotype 027 to France in 2006 42 and the index case of infection with this strain in Switzerland had previously been admitted to hospital in Spain. 43 Another potential hazard is movement of people from the community across boundaries (eg, tourists, business travellers, international migrants, and military personnel).

Most coronaviruses cause diseases in their particular host species; 1 those that can infect humans through cross-species transmission have become an important threat to public health. Two serious coronavirus disease outbreaks have happened in the past two decades: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, 2 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012. 3 Since December, 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been recognised as the causal factor in a series of severe cases of pneumonia originating in Wuhan in Hubei province, China. 4 This disease has been named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by WHO. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to cause disease via a mechanism analogous to the SARS coronavirus, with potential damage to vital organs such as lung, heart, liver, and kidney, and infection poses a considerable risk to patients by the high prevalence of pneumonia. 5 By March 1, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 had led to 80 981 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China, and 44 067 cases in 117 countries. 6 A cohort study of 44 672 Chinese cases reported that 2·1% of patients were younger than 20 years, and 1·2% were asymptomatic. 7 Pneumonia is the leading cause of mortality in children. 8 Distinct immunological responses to viral infections can exist in children and result in severe damage to vital organs. 9 Although short-to-medium-term outcomes for children who recovered from SARS seemed good, the disease caused exercise impairment after more than 6 months. 10 A comprehensive literature search indicated that MERS was rare in children (31 cases identified between 2012 and 2016), 11 because transmission depends heavily on animal exposure and direct contact in the household or health-care facilities. Collectively, these two coronavirus diseases did not widely affect children because of the short-term epidemic of SARS and the strict transmission route of MERS. In a study of 15 children with COVID-19 (aged 4-14 years), six patients had small nodular ground-glass opacities in the lungs. 12 At the time of the COVID-19 outbreak, all schools were on the spring festival holiday, which might have prevented children from exposure to transmission sources.

Besides the study populations not being entirely comparable, another explanation for this discrepancy might be the fact that we had noticed a milder than usual RSV epidemic in the winter of 2010-2011 among children in our hospital in general. RT-PCR has been used as the diagnostic method in our study, as opposed to other neonatal studies (8) (9) (10) . In a study comparing multiplex PCR assays and conventional techniques for diagnosing respiratory virus infections in children admitted to the hospital with an acute respiratory illness, PCR was more sensitive and had the advantages of a shorter delay in specific diagnosis and a lower cost than immunofluorescence or culture (14) . Another study concluded that RT-PCR for respiratory viruses was found to be a sensitive and reliable method in pediatric intensive care unit patients with lower respiratory tract infection, with a twofold increase in the diagnostic yield as compared with conventional methods (15) . However, a limitation of the use of PCR assays has been acknowledged by studies showing that asymptomatic carriage of a respiratory virus occurs frequently in young children (16) and the presence of viral nucleic acids may not always reflect an association with infectious virus production (17) . This limitation most likely holds true for newborns as well, as is reflected by our findings showing that respiratory pathogens have been detected in 7.5% of neonates without respiratory symptoms. In addition, blood cultures remained negative in three children of whom nasopharyngeal aspirates tested positive for S. pneumoniae by RT-PCR in our study. Asymptomatic colonization with this specific bacterial pathogen has been demonstrated by Bisgaard et al. in 9% of neonates born from mothers with asthma (18) . In general, the Ct value may be of help in differentiating symptomatic from asymptomatic infections. Our data show that neonates in whom respiratory samples tested positive and contained lower Ct levels (i.e., higher viral loads) indeed were more often clinically ill than neonates with low viral loads. Regardless, our study design does not really allow us to draw conclusions regarding asymptomatic carriership because all the neonates from our population were hospitalized, and therefore we did not have a true ""asymptomatic"" comparison group.",12.480900606820862,11.752120964187839

Our data indicate that MERS-CoV affects both genders, and, although a few cases of MERS-CoV in children have been detected, it remains mainly a disease of adults across all age groups. To date, there is still no evidence of sustained community transmission. Despite extensive investigation and testing of thousands of contacts by the KSA-MoH, only a few instances of transmission to HCWs or family contacts have been identified. Almost all patients who died or who had been hospitalized had severe disease or other comorbidities [9, 10] . The mortality rate and severity of disease are exaggerated to some degree by the detection of such cases. The case-fatality rate has fallen in recent months, owing to the detection of milder and asymptomatic cases [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] .

Perhaps the most intuitive relationship to discuss is that between population density and risk of infectious disease. High population density means that individuals will have a greater number of contacts with others. Contact rates are an essential parameter in the risk of infectious disease transmission, particularly for those diseases with person-to-person modes of transmission (Anderson & May, 1991) . A higher contact rate generally corresponds to more transmission, all other factors being equal. Therefore, areas with high population densities are more conducive to disease spread. In addition, populations living in crowded conditions are also often those with the fewest resources (Baum, Garofalo, & Yali, 1999) . Crowding in situations of poor sanitation increases the spread of infectious disease through increased risk of exposure to infectious agents in the environment (Krieger & Higgins, 2002) . These factors contribute to the ongoing cholera pandemic, especially, for example, in areas such as the peri-urban slums of Brazil (Nations & Monte, 1996) . Similar concerns appear in other parts of the world, such as Russia, where overcrowded prisons and insufficient public health measures contribute to multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (TB) (Holden, 1999) . In Saudi Arabia, Muslim pilgrims gather annually during the Hajj, increasing risks of meningococcal outbreaks, hemorrhagic fever and even SARS (Ahmed, Arabi, & Memish, 2006) , and in Palestinian refugee camps in the Gaza strip, crowding and poor sanitation contribute to intestinal parasites and diarrheal diseases (Abu Morad, 2004) . Where dense populations coexist in poverty and inadequate infrastructure, environments may also increase the risk of vector-borne diseases by increasing contact with vector breeding sites (Afrane et al., 2004; McMichael, 2000) .",11.755802389482463,6.673939775203596

Another example comes from the Shetland Islands, off the Scottish coast. In the early 1900s the island inhabitants lived in small villages. Each island population was separated from the next island. Even in such isolated communities, several cases of varicella in children followed a single case of shingles in an adult [30] .

[10•] used PCR for rhinovirus, RSV, and coronavirus and recovered RNA from at least one of these viruses in the MEF of 48% of 92 children with AOM. In a study by Cone et al. [32] , DNA from human herpesvirus 6 was detected in 71% of MEFs from 49 children with AOM. These high rates of viral detection have inevitably raised the question of the real significance of these findings. Because of the very high sensitivity of the PCR technique, the question has arisen The specific viral cause of the URI could be determined in 41% of the cases. In children with AOM during a documented RSV infection, the same virus could be detected in the MEF in 74% of cases. The relative prevalence of RSV in the MEF was significantly higher than that of parainfluenza (52%) or influenza viruses (42%), which in turn were found significantly more often in the MEF than were enteroviruses (11%) or adenoviruses (4%). This study has two major implications. First, the results indicate that RSV has a particularly strong ability to invade the middle ear. Second, the different relative prevalences of the viruses in the MEF suggest that while some viruses may indeed enter the middle ear passively along with nasal secretions, others actively invade the middle ear and may contribute to the inflammatory process in the middle-ear mucosa. If all viruses found in the MEF were only ""innocent bystanders"" without any active role, they should be detected in the MEF at roughly equal rates during different viral infections. In this study, the relative importance of rhinoviruses could not be determined because the incidence of rhinovirus infections was too low for a meaningful analysis [33••] . However, a study by Pitkäranta et al.

Therefore, direct comparisons remained challenging, and therefore subgroup analysis was done to identify possible determinants of variation. We next stratified the prevalence data by age. EnV, MPV, RV and RSV were more prevalent in children, whereas AdV, BoV, CoV, IfV and PiV were more prevalent in adults. EnV and MPV were associated with asthma exacerbations in children [16, 17] , RV were frequently associated with asthma exacerbations associated with upper respiratory tract infection in children, and RSV was commonly linked to onset of wheezing in childhood [18, 19] .

When attempts are made to obtain samples from the lower respiratory tract, it is always possible for them to be contaminated with organisms that are causing colonization in the upper respiratory tract. Sputum is difficult to obtain from paediatric patients, and adult studies have shown the sensitivity and specificity to be sufficiently low such that some experts recommend obtaining sputum from adults with suspected bacterial pneumonia only in selected circumstances (9) . For patients with severe pneumonia, there is no consensus on the relative value of samples obtained by endotracheal aspirate, bronchoalveolar lavage or a protected brush specimen (10) , but all are superior to sputum. Direct lung aspiration is rarely done but has been described as a useful technique in children with bacterial pneumonia (11) . The ultimate way to determine if an organism is a pathogen is to obtain a lung biopsy, because contamination of such specimens is exceedingly rare. However, even that may not confirm a diagnosis if the patient has already received antimicrobials, or if cultures are not requested for the correct organism (such as mycobacteria). One problem with all techniques is that the sensitivity is limited by the fact that the area that is sampled may not be the one with the highest concentration of organisms. However, one basic principle that applies to specimens obtained from all lower respiratory sites is that an organism that is seen on a Gram stain is present in higher concentration than one detected only on culture; therefore, it is more likely to be a pathogen. Also, because polymicrobial lower respiratory tract infections are rare, it is more likely that the true pathogen has been identified if there is heavy growth of a single organism than if there is mixed growth.",19.32617874545336,8.61807751020658

These changes have led to recognition of the greater and more widespread role of respiratory viruses in CAP in all age groups. Although not addressed in this article, respiratory viruses are a very important cause of severe pneumonia and respiratory failure in patients who are immunocompromised, particularly recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplant. 1, 2 One challenge is that respiratory viruses in patients with CAP can be the sole cause of a viral pneumonia (often referred to as primary viral pneumonia); can be present as a coinfection (virus-bacteria or virus-virus); and can act as a predisposing factor to facilitate or worsen bacterial pneumonia. Moreover, detection of some viruses in the upper respiratory tract of asymptomatic patients is relatively common and therefore may indicate convalescent shedding or asymptomatic infection. 3 There are several critical questions that are not fully answered. What is the role of individual viruses in pneumonia? What is the prevalence of specific viruses among patients of CAP? Which patients are most likely to have viral pneumonia? What does the detection of a respiratory virus from a patient with CAP tell about the cause? How should viral detection effect clinical management and when can antibiotics be avoided or stopped?",14.922685509345184,6.963178985215661

Techniques based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have made the aetiological diagnosis of ARIs possible in children, and made us aware of the high prevalence of asymptomatic viral infections. 5, 6 Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and influenza virus (FLU) have been clearly identified as respiratory pathogens, and more recent studies have been analysing the role of other viruses such rhinovirus (RV) and human bocavirus (hBoV), although the high prevalence of coinfection with other respiratory viruses or their detection in asymptomatic patients pose challenges to the interpretation of these positive results. 7, 8 It is known that children with severe RSV infection that require hospitalisation are at high risk of developing asthma in the long term, even as late as age 18 years, as Sigurs et al. demonstrated. 9 There is also evidence of an increased risk of recurrent wheezing up to age 5 years in infants hospitalised due to bronchiolitis associated to hMPV. 10 There are fewer studies in children that have not been admitted to hospital, among which we would like to mention the classic studies by Stein et al., who analysed an unselected cohort and found that milder infections by RSV also increased the risk of developing wheezing. 11 In recent years, the role of RV as a long-term predictor of future asthma has also been investigated. A study of particular interest on the subject is that of Lemanske et al., 12 whose cohort of infants that had a RV infection with wheezing in the first year of life were at increased risk of having developed wheezing by age 3 years, with an odds ratio of 10. Most of the studies that assess the risk of developing asthma or wheezing have been conducted in selected high-risk populations. 13, 14 Furthermore, little is known about mild viral respiratory infections managed in outpatient settings in relation to the future development of wheezing, not to mention asymptomatic viral infections, although it is generally assumed that risk increases with increasing severity.

Fecal-oral transmission is most common, although environmental and fomite contaminations are also important sources of infection. Aerosolization of vomitus resulting in droplets that contaminate surfaces or are swallowed also contribute to transmission. Infected individuals are contagious up to 72 hours after recovery. The low infectious dose (\100 particles), multiple modes of transmission, prolonged duration of viral shedding even among asymptomatic people, and the ability to survive high levels of chlorine and varying temps (freezing and heating to 60 C) contribute to ease of norovirus transmission. Detection of viral RNA in stools by use of RT-PCR assays shows that virus can be isolated as long as 7 days after symptom onset. To reduce transmission of this highly infectious organism, several strategies need to be employed, including hand washing with soap and water, contact precautions, wearing masks while cleaning areas contaminated by feces or vomitus, and minimal handling of soiled linens and clothes (BIII). Use of alcohol-based hand rubs may be inadequate for preventing norovirus transmission [691] [692] [693] .",15.183618804625063,7.107044756197915

By air sampling, hPIV-1 was isolated from air obtained in only one of 150 infected children at a distance of 60 cm [24] . However, nasal secretions can travel a distance greater than 10 feet to contaminate surrounding fomites [23] . An experimental study demonstrated that hPIV can survive in stainless steel for 10 h [16] . Although the transfer of hPIV-3 from finger to finger or from finger to metal disc did not occur, hPIV-3 could be transferred from contaminated disks to clean hands [25] . Therefore, person-toperson spread by direct hand contact appears to be an unlikely mode of transmission, whereas contaminated surfaces may lead to direct self-inoculation. To date, only these pieces of indirect experimental evidence have supported contaminated surfaces as a mode of hPIV-3 transmission. In this context, the extensive environmental contaminations and prolonged environmental presence of hPIV-3 were clearly demonstrated, and these findings may partially explain why hPIV-3 is easily spread in the haematology ward. In addition, this emphasizes the importance of disinfection of environmental surfaces. It is noteworthy that hPIV-3 infection was documented in one minimally symptomatic healthcare worker who obtained this virus from the hPIV-3-infected patients. Although it is not exactly known whether asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic healthcare workers can transmit hPIV-3, asymptomatic hPIV-3 viral shedding in the nasopharynx among immunocompetent hosts and the previous outbreak reports suggest the potential role of asymptomatic healthy carriers in nosocomial transmission [9, 17, 26] . In our data, we could not carry out universal screening for healthcare workers during the outbreak, thus precluding our ability to define the precise role of none-tominimal symptomatic healthcare workers in nosocomial transmission. However, since the same nursing team cared for the index patients and the latterly infected cases of cluster 1, and one of the nursing team members (patient K in cluster 5) had documented hPIV-3 infection, healthcare workers may have a role in nosocomial transmission.

This may result from transmission, or specific patterns of clustering (i.e. species or age groups) within roosting sites. Species clustering could explain variation among sheets because Hendra virus prevalence was positively associated with P. alecto density, but negatively related to the density of P. scapulatus. It is important to note that while the protocol of collecting pooled urine excreted on sheets is logistically feasible and cost-effective, prevalence in pooled urine samples may be both clustered and overestimated if infected bats contribute to pooled urine multiple times. Nevertheless, increased P. alecto density was also associated with increased pulse amplitudes, suggesting that pulse characteristics are influenced by disease dynamics occurring in P. alecto populations. Field et al. [6] suggested that the negative association between P. scapulatus and Hendra virus prevalence was due to the dilution of positive samples by P. scapulatus urine, because Hendra virus has not been detected in the urine of this species. An additional hypothesis is that P. scapulatus density at a site indicates an increase in food availability because the presence of this species is also associated with flower blooms and nectar production [39] . Increased food availability may then reduce Hendra virus shedding by improving bat condition and immunocompetence. A third possibility is that prevalence in P. alecto may be reduced by high P. scapulatus abundance through a 'dilution effect' where higher bat species diversity lowers infection risk. [40] .

Although the largest annual pulse amplitudes tended to be clustered around winter months, the large variation in the timing of these pulses, and the lack of a recurring seasonal signal, suggest that seasonal factors (such as birth pulses, immigration and seasonal transmission) are not alone driving Hendra virus dynamics. We therefore suggest that variation in pulse amplitudes and timings occur because of combined effects of density-driven processes principally involving P. alecto, but also by density-independent factors. Low food availability, driven by climatic conditions that affect flowering, is a potential factor that could increase transmission or viral shedding via reduced immunocompetence. Alternatively, reduced rainfall could increase transmission by increasing contact rates between individuals aggregating around suitable habitats. Our analyses also showed that Hendra virus prevalence was only weakly correlated across sites and such correlations may be explained by the autocorrelation structure within the time series. Therefore, we suggest that site-specific prevalence values are determined by the climatic conditions and bat-virus dynamics occurring at small spatial scales.",15.107133933063317,3.204021054361849

No randomized trials have been conducted to evaluate the use of palivizumab after SOT; however, some experts support the use of immunoprophylaxis for infants less than 1 year of age who receive their transplant during the RSV season. 44 Adenovirus infection, although frequently asymptomatic, can cause a wide variety of infectious syndromes, especially in transplant recipients.

Adenovirus was the third most important viral infection following pediatric liver transplantation under cyclosporine in one series. 46 Its epidemiology is less well characterized after other SOT types but can be particularly severe early after lung transplantation, where it may be associated with fatal pneumonitis. 47 Adenovirus infection has been identified in up to 50% of pediatric intestinal transplant recipients, but many of these patients are thought to be experiencing asymptomatic shedding of adenovirus in their stools.

Children may shed and transmit RSV after they become asymptomatic, and we did not perform regular sampling in asymptomatic participants. 42 Although we captured ten days of symptom data, younger children may experience symptoms lasting longer. Further, we were not able to use a preceding asymptomatic period as criteria for a new illness episode. Many children enrolled in our childcare facilities were never symptom-free, particularly when considering cough and rhinorrhea. Each new illness episode that was close in timing to a prior illness episode was reviewed by the study staff and a consensus decision was made to decide whether this should be classified as a new episode versus a continuation of a prior illness. In general, children who developed new symptoms, as opposed to worsening of previous symptoms, were classified as having a new illness episode. Finally, we sequenced RSV from only 42% of episodes, though our ability to sequence viruses from clinical samples is consistent with other studies characterizing RSV transmission. 35 Our study shows that the childcare setting is a significant source of rapid child-to-child RSV transmission, and that once acquired, RSV leads to significantly greater symptom duration than other respiratory viruses.

Analytical results are obtained using the respective ratios of susceptible, exposed (incubating), and asymptomatic classes to the clinical symptomatic infective class. Conditions are given for bistability of equilibria to occur, where trajectories with distinct initial values could result in either a major outbreak where the disease spreads to the whole population or a lesser outbreak where some members of the population remain uninfected. This dynamic behavior did not arise in a SARS model without asymptomatic infective class studied by Hsu and Hsieh (SIAM J. Appl. Math. 66(2), 2006). Hence, this illustrates that depending on the initial states, control of a disease outbreak with asymptomatic infections may involve more than simply reducing the reproduction number. Moreover, the presence of asymptomatic infections could result in either a positive or negative impact on the outbreak, depending on different sets of conditions on the parameters, as illustrated with numerical simulations.

These include fomites on clothes, footwear, equipment, or feeding supplies (bottles, buckets, esophageal tubes-Salmonella can be found in saliva); as well as, water, colostrum, milk, conveyances (carts to remove dead calves and move newborn calves to hutches), wash water used in pens and under hutches, sprinklers, weigh scales, maternity pens, and sick cows. 20 Studies have shown increased fecal shedding in calves that did not receive antibiotic supplemented milk replacer, 17,19 on dairies where the maternity pen is used as a hospital pen, 19 when prophylactic antibiotics were given to newborn calves, and when the herd was not closed. 17 Reduced shedding and resistance to disease is seen with increasing age. 17, 20 CRYPTOSPORIDIUM Cryptosporidium parvum, C bovis (formerly bovine B genotype), 21 C ryanae (formerly deer-like genotype), 22 and C andersoni have all been reported in calves. 23, 24 Oocysts from C bovis and C parvum are indistinguishable based on size. 21 C ryanae oocysts are slightly smaller 22 and C andersoni are larger; the latter are primarily associated with subclinical disease from abomasal colonization in animals greater than 3-months old, usually adults. In a multistate study in the United States, C parvum was the primary species (w90% of Cryptosporidium) colonizing calves up to 4-weeks old and the only species found in calves less than 3-weeks old. 23 The peak prevalence of calves shedding Cryptosporidium was 66.7% at 2-weeks old when only C parvum was seen. C parvum only accounted for 1% of the Cryptosporidium found after weaning. C bovis and C ryanae were the most common types seen postweaning with peak postweaning shedding prevalence of 30% at 6-months old. The predominant species varies by region. C bovis was the most common type at all ages in Sweden where C parvum was only found in calves before weaning with 73% of C parvum-infected calves less than 2-weeks old. 24 Some reports in the literature show no statistical difference in shedding of Cryptosporidium between diarrhea and age-matched control calves; others report over 90% of calves shed the organism in the preweaning period. 6, 25 Several surveys have found Cryptosporidium was the most common or second-most common pathogen in the feces of diarrhea calves. The authors' laboratory (see Table 3 ) and most surveys report over 35% of diarrheic calves less than 30-days old shedding this agent. 5 Cryptosporidium has been associated with mixed infections; and a peak shedding prevalence at 7 to 14 days (53%-95%), both of which decline with increasing age. 6, 26, 27 Earlier surveillance studies did not determine the species of Cryptosporidium and often included calves older than 30-days old, which may explain the lack of correlation between shedding and diarrhea because some of the older calves may have been infected with C bovis.",13.647325621188607,7.6249674689266325

Several earlier studies have indicated that subclinical infections account for about one-third of infections (Nafta et al., 1970; Oker-Blom et al., 1970; Monto et al., 1979; Pettersson et al., 1980; Quarles et al., 1981) . Nonetheless, skepticism regarding asymptomatic spread of flu remains; some studies have suggested that virus shedding may sometimes occur before clinically significant symptoms or during subclinical symptoms, but virus shedding detected by nasal swabs cannot be equated to transmission of infection (Eccles, 2005) . By its nature, asymptomatic or subclinical flu cases are difficult to diagnose. Hence, it is impossible to precisely define the number of asymptomatic cases, not to mention the demanding task of tracing the number of infections by those asymptomatic cases. Consequently, clinical evidence of asymptomatic infection is extremely scarce and the magnitude of its contribution to spread of flu is hard to ascertain. In Longini et al. (2004) , it was assumed that the probability that a person will be symptomatic given that person has been infected is 0.67, based on population-level influenza cohort studies in the US. Moreover, they assumed that an asymptomatic infection is only 50% as infectious as a symptomatic infection. Intuitively, there might be a substantial (but poorly understood and inadequately quantified) difference in the respective transmission probabilities from asymptomatic person and symptomatic person to susceptible persons. Clearly, an infected person with clinical illness sheds more virus than does one with subclinical symptoms and also has illness manifestations (e.g., coughing) that contribute to the generation of infectious aerosols. On the other hand, infected persons with clinical symptoms may show reduced contacts if they are sufficiently ill to be confined to bed.

We found no difference between pneumonic SARS patients and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-positive patients in relation to age, duration and distance of exposure to source patients, handwashing, and use of gloves. These findings indicate that HCWs who are exposed to SARS can be infected with SARS, regardless of the intensity of exposure. However, mask use was significantly more common in asymptomatic SARS-positive versus pneumonic SARS-positive patients. Antibody titers against SARS-CoV were significantly lower in those who remained asymptomatic, consistent with reports from Hong Kong (12) . The person with the lowest SARS antibody titer in our cohort was the only one who had only indirect contact with 1 of the 3 initial patients, and she has remained asymptomatic. These observations suggest that the extent of exposure to SARS in persons who remained asymptomatic may have been lower, possibly resulting in a lower viral load of SARS-CoV, associated with less severe symptoms. A correlation with viral load and disease severity has been suggested (13); however, this hypothesis remains controversial as the development of severe respiratory distress is also thought to be due to an overwhelming immunologic response (1, 4) . Higher viral loads have been associated with increased severity in some but not all viral diseases. Any association between the infecting dose of SARS-CoV and severity of disease needs to be confirmed with animal studies. The low antibody levels observed in asymptomatic SARS-positive cases could also be because asymptomatic patients do not mount as much of an antibody response. It is also possible that cross-reactive antibodies were measured, although this is unlikely given the high specificity of our assay. The existence of asymptomatic or subclinical cases has public health implications, as they may either serve as a reservoir or as an unknown source of transmission. If asymptomatic persons contribute substantially to transmission but are not readily identified as having SARS, control measures will be hampered since they depend on the ready identification of persons who have been exposed to definite cases (14) . Based on our data in Singapore, transmission from asymptomatic patients appears to play no or only a minor role, as all but 1 of the pneumonic cases of SARS had a definitive epidemiologic link to another pneumonic SARS contact. Lack of transmission from asymptomatic patients was also observed in other countries with SARS outbreaks (1; http://www.who.int/csr/sars/en/WHOconsen-sus.pdf, 2003). As the survival ability of SARS-CoV in human specimens and in environments seems to be relatively strong (15) , determining whether asymptomatic patients excrete SARS-CoV is important. We were unable to determine this in our cohort, since these cases all occurred at a time when even the causal agent of SARS was not yet known and no diagnostic tests were available.",14.540053228080453,7.256260462442103

Indeed, an increasing number of studies show that immunosuppressive therapy is a risk factor for norovirus infection [15] .

Transplant recipients with such chronic norovirus infections may require adjustment (reduction) of immunosuppressive therapy [15] .

The main route of transmission in over 70% of outbreaks is person-to-person [7] thus favoring the occurrence of large outbreaks in semi-closed environments. The extensiveness of such outbreaks is explained by the low infectious dose of norovirus (18 virus particles are sufficient for infection), with shedding in stool for 20 to 40 days (also present in asymptomatic individuals) and by its long persistence in the environment (resistance to disinfectants, heating, freezing), up to two weeks on surfaces [17] [18] [19] .

Clinical signs of either primary or recurrent infection (oral herpetic lesions such as gingivostomatitis, oral and lingual ulcers, and conjunctivitis) are the exception (Carlson et al., 1997; Keeble et al., 1958; Weigler, 1992) , and usually require immediate euthanasia of the animal.

First of all, identifying viruses in the upper respiratory secretions of children with CAP may not indicate that they are really involved in causing the disease because it may only indicate a coincidental upper airways infection or be due to a carrier state or the prolonged shedding of a pathogen that caused a previous infection. However, viruses are generally detected in no more than 5% of asymptomatic subjects, although the prevalence of rhinovirus can be as high as about 15%. 19 Given the prevalence of each viral infection in our children, it is highly likely that the detected viruses played an important pathogenic role in determining CAP in most cases. However, as it has been demonstrated that viral ⁄ bacterial co-infections are common, it is possible that the CAP cases attributed to viruses by us were at least partially owing to concomitant viral and bacterial infections. The higher CRP levels and the greater frequency of alveolar CAP observed in rhinovirus-positive cases than in RSV-and influenzapositive cases may indicate a greater degree of bacterial involvement in some viral infections. We systematically performed blood cultures for all of the enrolled children in order to identify bacterial infections but, because this procedure is not very sensitive, most of the cases were negative. It is therefore not possible to draw any conclusions concerning the real incidence of viral ⁄ bacterial co-infections or to evaluate the importance of each virus in favouring bacterial super-infections. On the other hand, although it may be useful to culture sputum in order to identify respiratory bacteria responsible for CAP, 37 we decided not to do so because the importance of collecting sputum from children is widely debated and, even when complicated and uncomfortable procedures are used (including pharmaco-logical pre-treatment, saline aerosol, and nasal aspiration), only some of the specimens are considered adequate. 38 The second limitation is related to the fact that the study was conducted in the winter and early spring, and so it may have overestimated the role of infectious agents that only circulate during this period or underestimated viruses that have a prevalent circulation in other months.

In addition to having implications for the health and productivity of dairy cattle, these factors lead to an increased risk of zoonotic transmission. Foodborne exposure may occur when there is fecal contamination of beef carcasses at slaughter, contamination of crops by manure fertilizer, and contamination of water by manure run-off (Wells et al., 2001; Islam et al., 2004; Sivapalasingam et al., 2004) .

The bacteria survive in the environment for several months and can replicate under certain conditions of temperature and humidity [29, 57, 117] . Established risk factors for Salmonella infection (fecal shedding) in dairy calves include a high prevalence of fecal shedding in the adult herd and frequent or occasional use of the maternity area as housing for sick cows [51] . Separation of hospital and maternity facilities has been associated with reductions in the prevalence of Salmonella spp in herds with endemic infection [52] . The role of antibiotics in Salmonella shedding in calves is unclear; routine feeding of medicated milk replacer or milk replacer containing antibiotics was identified as protective for Salmonella shedding in two large-scale studies [51, 122] . Other investigators identified antibiotic treatment as a risk factor for Salmonella shedding in heifers within herds experiencing clinical outbreaks of salmonellosis [123] . In addition to being shed in feces, Salmonella can be shed in other body secretions, including nasal secretions, saliva, and milk. Infected saliva and nasal secretions can contribute to transmission by direct contact, aerosols, or contamination of shared feed and water sources [29, 124] .",16.354040405521086,6.900370567271364

The absence of large numbers of asymptomatic transmitters and the paucity of transmission during the first 5 days of illness explain the success of the public health measures of aggressive case detection and isolation in interrupting transmission of human-adapted SARS CoV and the control of the global disease outbreak. These features of SARS have been attributed to the observation that, unlike many other acute viral respiratory infections, SARS transmission has mostly occurred only after the fifth day of illness.

Likewise, because all of our samples were submitted for testing of ill children, the prevalence we report may not reflect the true prevalence in the community. To determine its true epidemiology, it will be important to determine the prevalence of HBoV infection among healthy children and the prevalence of antibody at different ages. In addition, the majority of our patients were admitted to the hospital, and because testing may have been per-formed only for children with more-severe illness, the severity of symptoms may have been exaggerated. Finally, although PCR is a powerful tool, there are potential problems associated with such high sensitivity. Small amounts of DNA from prolonged shedding following prior infection cannot be differentiated from DNA from active infection, and even small amounts of contamination within the laboratory can cause false-positive results.

It is however difficult to assess the pathogenic role of these viruses without examining samples collected from matched control populations. Three recent studies have sought to do this for WUV, reporting prevalence rates in symptomatic versus asymptomatic subjects of 7.0% versus 4.2% , 2.5% versus 6.4% (Abed et al., 2007) and 1.0% versus 5.4% (Norja et al., 2007) . However, these data must be interpreted with caution as each of these studies examined only small numbers of controls and some of these were not well matched to the symptomatic population tested. Interestingly, although Norja et al. (2007) reported a high prevalence of KIV (5.4%) and WUV (5.4%) in their control subjects, 5 of the 6 (83%) positive specimens came from subjects who were classified as immunosuppressed. If consistent, the presence of KIV and WUV in control populations may represent a latent or persistent infection with subsequent asymptomatic reactivation or prolonged shedding from a prior respiratory tract infection. Persistent shedding of WUV over a 6-8 week period was amongst a number of interesting observations reported in two children (1.5 and 4 years old) from St. Louis, USA, and WUV was also the only virus detected in a 1-day-old infant with respiratory symptoms raising interesting questions about possible transmission mechanisms of this virus .",18.67777883811967,6.15536976984602

Activation from silent infection can occur under immunosuppression, during pregnancy and during lactation. Individuals can be infected with multiple strains, meaning secondary infection as exogenous reinfection or endogenous reactivation may occur. HCMV disease with various symptoms can result from either primary or secondary infection, also in primary infection disease is more severe and more frequent. The outcome of congenital HCMV infection is variable.

Although the largest annual pulse amplitudes tended to be clustered around winter months, the large variation in the timing of these pulses, and the lack of a recurring seasonal signal, suggest that seasonal factors (such as birth pulses, immigration and seasonal transmission) are not alone driving Hendra virus dynamics. We therefore suggest that variation in pulse amplitudes and timings occur because of combined effects of density-driven processes principally involving P. alecto, but also by density-independent factors. Low food availability, driven by climatic conditions that affect flowering, is a potential factor that could increase transmission or viral shedding via reduced immunocompetence. Alternatively, reduced rainfall could increase transmission by increasing contact rates between individuals aggregating around suitable habitats. Our analyses also showed that Hendra virus prevalence was only weakly correlated across sites and such correlations may be explained by the autocorrelation structure within the time series. Therefore, we suggest that site-specific prevalence values are determined by the climatic conditions and bat-virus dynamics occurring at small spatial scales.",15.424910038523446,3.315242691272894

Toxoplasmosis has been found in humans and most warm-blooded animals. An estimated 500 million humans have been infected ii. Mode of transmission. Domestic and wild felids develop extraintestinal invasion with T. gondii analogous to that of the nonfelid hosts. In addition, as the definitive hosts in the T. gondii life cycle, felines develop intestinal infection, with the shedding of oocysts. Thus, the domestic cat is the primary reservoir for the zoonotic transmission of T. gondii in the laboratory environment. The three common modes of transmission are congenital infection, ingestion of T. gondii-infected tissue, and ingestion of toxoplasma oocytes or from direct exposure and consumption of contaminated food or water (Dubey, 1998) . Most postnatally acquired infections in cats are asymptomatic and have a variable prepatent period and pattern of oocyst shedding. The prepatent period can be as brief as 3 days if the cat has ingested mice or meat containing T. gondii cysts, or it can be as long as several weeks if oocysts have been ingested. Shedding of oocysts in the feces occurs for 1-2 weeks, during which time cats are considered a public health risk (Dubey, 1998) . Oocysts become infectious after sporulation, which occurs in 1-5 days. Oocysts survive best in warm, moist soil. Oocyst shedding is less likely to occur if the cat was infected by oocysts or tachyzoites than if infection resulted from the ingestion of Toxoplasma cysts. Oocyst shedding can be reactivated by induction of hypercorticism or by superinfection with other feline microorganisms, such as Isosporafelis (Chessman, 1972) . Oocysts of T. gondii have been observed infrequently in the feces of naturally infected cats (Ladiges et al., 1982) , and shedding usually precedes the development of antibody titers to T. gondii. The oocyst is very hardy and can survive freezing and as much as several months of extreme heat and dehydration. Importantly, high IgG titers do not prove recent or active infection (Dubey et al., 1995) .",16.570140879619007,9.97730219606932

Some members of the genus are readily detectable by CPE in cell cultures, notably polio-, coxsackie B-, echo-and enteroviruses. Members of the genus Enterovirus are among the most common causes of human infection, with an estimated 30 million infections per year in the USA. The viruses are associated with a broad spectrum of diseases ranging from mild febrile illness to myocarditis; meningoencephalitis; poliomyelitis; haemorrhagic conjunctivitis; herpangina; Bornholm disease; hand, foot and mouth disease; diabetes mellitus and neonatal multi-organ failure. Chronic infections are associated with conditions such as polymyositis, dilated cardiomyopathy and chronic fatigue syndrome. There is reason to believe that the health implications of enterovirus infections are not fully understood, particularly in terms of the longterm effects of chronic infections that are not readily evident from epidemiological data. Most infections, particularly in children, are asymptomatic, but still result in excretion of large numbers of the viruses that may cause clinical disease in others. Poliomyelitis, which caused severe mortality and suffering for a long time, has almost been eradicated by vaccination, but mutants of live vaccine strains are of concern. Since enteroviruses are excreted in large numbers by many people, they are detected in large numbers in raw and treated water supplies worldwide by techniques commonly used for water analysis.

Viral shedding starts within 24 hours before the onset of symptoms and peaks within 48 hours afterwards. 2, 45, 12, 48, 65, 70, 72, 84 Therefore, CDC recommends treating potential H5N1 patients as a contagion risk: respiratory/airborne precautions in addition to droplet, contact, and standard precautions as infection control practices for HCW and healthcare facilities. 2, 22, [31] [32] [33] 49, 85 Although H5N1 is inefficient at person-toperson transmission, it is likely to acquire this capability in the advent of a pandemic. 2, 19, 22, 23 Although not studied fully in all populations, the period of communicability of H5N1 can last for up to 3 weeks in children.

They may produce mild enteritis, but most cases of experimental and natural infections remain subclinical. FECV can establish persistent infection in the large intestine . By shedding the virus in the faeces, the asymptomatic FECVinfected carrier cats spread the infection to susceptible animals via the faecal-oral route. Although it is not considered a highly pathogenic agent, FECV presents a considerable health risk to cats because it is the parent of FIPV, which arises as a result of genetic alterations of FECV during the intestinal replicative phase of infection (Poland et al., 1996; Foley et al., 1997b; Vennema et al., 1998) . The resultant FIPV causes systemic infection and, consequently, various clinical forms of the disease may develop (Evermann et al., 1991; Herrewegh et al., 1997) . It has been suggested that the incidence of FIP in a cat population is more correlated to the FECV ® FIPV mutation rate than to the presence of FIPV variants (Vennema et al., 1998) . Thus, it is recommended that a population be monitored for the prevalence of asymptomatic FECV carriers in order to estimate the probability of the occurrence of FIPV and the chances for development of the disease. Since the detection of FCoV by virus isolation is difficult, the application of reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been proposed for surveying asymptomatic FCoV carriers (Herrewegh et al., 1995; Foley et al., 1997a) .",17.502059990133418,8.76350280134673

Equal detection rates were seen among patients with and without acute or chronic diarrhoea. While 17% appears to be a relatively high prevalence rate of viral carriage for adults, it is notable that CUNNINGHAM et al. included in this study were both at increased risk of exposure to enteric viruses; homosexual STD clinic attenders because of oral-anal sexual practices and the patients reported here because of crowded living conditions and close proximity to young children who could serve as viral reservoirs. The fact that natients admitted to Mama Yemo Hospital tend to be vGy sick (overall in-hospital mortality rate=41%) and frequently have advanced malnutrition impairing their resistance to infection may also account for the high rate of viral shedding reported here. Although the possibility exists that this high prevalence rate represents some nosocomial transmission, this is unlikely because most stools were obtained on the day of admission and all were obtained within 48 h of admission.

(41, 42) These data suggest that its role in early life LRTI may be underappreciated; however, further investigation is needed.",14.573022927755273,7.608545678923482

Redness and bulging of the tympanic membrane are characteristic findings in bacterial AOM. Second, AOM is associated with long-term dysfunction of the inflamed eustachian tube (ET), particularly in children less than 2 years of age.

Viruses elicit AOM in about 30% of children. A prolonged course of AOM has been observed when bacterial and viral infections are combined because viral infection is also associated with ET dysfunction in young children. Bacterial and viral testing of the nasopharyngeal aspirate is an excellent tool both for initial treatment and recurrence of AOM. Antibiotic treatment of AOM is mandatory in children less than 2 years of age to decrease inflammation in the middle ear but also of the ET particularly during the first episode. The best choice is amoxicillin because of its superior penetration in the middle ear. Streptococci pneumoniae with intermediary bacterial resistance to penicillin are particularly associated with recurrent AOM. Therefore the dosage of amoxicillin should be 90 mg/kg per day in three doses. In recurrent AOM with β-lactamase-producing bacilli, amoxicillin should be associated with clavulanic acid at a dose of 6.4 mg/kg per day. The duration of the treatment is not established yet but 10 days is reasonable for a first episode of AOM. OME may be a precursor initiating AOM but also a complication thereof.

(1985) deserves special attention; a high prevalence of cryptosporidiosis was reported in children with diarrhoea and in asymptomatic age-matched control children aged 5 months or younger. A comparison between breast-fed and bottle-fed children showed no difference. Living conditions in rural southern India, as the authors described, were unsanitary-there was no protected water supply; animals were kept adjacent to, or inside, houses; and there were no proper waste or sewage disposal facilities. Babies (and their mothers) were regularly exposed to high infectious doses which occasionally overcame the high level of maternal protection to cause diarrhoea or asymptomatic infection. As maternal protection waned gradually, the incidence of symptomatic infection increased in children older than 6 months while the number of asymptomatic infections decreased. By the age of 2 years, no further case of asymptomatic infection was detected, compared with a rate of 2.7% symptomatic infections. The total prevalence remained low because, by this stage, most of the children had had cryptosporidiosis. It is difficult to understand the basis for the conclusion of Mathan et al. (1985) that Cryptosporidium was unlikely to have been a major cause of acute diarrhoea in that population, given the data presented in their study. It is unknown whether the high prevalence of subclinical infections reported in this study is unique to that population, as no similar study has been made of a large randomized group of asymptomatic neonates. The occurrence of subclinical enteric infections in this age group is not unique to Cryptosporidium; asymptomatic rotavirus infection has been reported on several occasions (Bishop et af., 1979) . Unlike Mata (1986) , Mathan et al. (1985) found no difference in the prevalence of cryptosporidiosis among breast-fed or bottle-fed babies, which is interesting in light of the high proportion of asymptomatic infections. However, in experimental studies in animals, we showed that, while secretory antibodies are the key to protection against enteric infections due to rotavirus, high levels of circulating antibody of maternal origin are often sufficient to modify the clinical outcome (Tzipori and Williams, 1978) .",19.01244887244397,12.758986455063946

There are two important factors influencing the frequency in a given study; the age distribution of the population studied and the season of the year. The incidence is higher in children and during the wet, warmer months of the year. For instance, the study in Australia by Tzipori et al. (1983b) (Table 1) revealed an overall frequency of 4.1% compared with 7% for the three summer months, and 8.2% for children under 5 years of age. Similarly, the yearly average in British Columbia was 0.6% (Table 2) , but during the summer months it was recorded as 2.9% (Montessori and Bischoff, 1985) . A distinct seasonal trend was not observed in all countries. For instance, in the UK and in India no seasonal variation was documented (Casemore et al., 1985b; Mathan et al., 1985) . Indeed, Hunt et al. (1984) recorded a prevalence of 5% (Table 3) during late autumn and winter in a predominantly adult group. The study by Mathan et al. (1985) illustrated the relationship between temperature and rainfall; while oocyst excretion was detected during all seasons, shedding was reported to be more frequent during the months with rainfall and was lowest in January and February, which are cool dry months. The frequency can also vary depending on the age distribution of the children under study, as it has been shown to be much higher among children aged 12 months or less. In a Liberian study in which the total prevalence was 7.9%, 23% of cases were in children aged between 6 and 12 months (Hojlyng et al., 1984) , and of a total prevalence of 12.9% in Ghana, 21.6% were children in that age group (Addy and Aikins-Bekoe, 1986) .

It is unclear why such variation existed in adult population. While our data, along with others', suggest age differences in the prevalence of HRV species, there are as yet no data explaining reasons of these differences.

Because more children are now attending day-care centres, more attention has been focused on the frequent transmission of pathogens there. The congregation of a large number of young children, not previously exposed to infection, is an ideal setting for outbreaks to occur. Enteric infections that have been the cause of outbreaks of diarrhoea in day-care centres include rotavirus, shigella, Giardia and Clostridium dificile. Two detailed studies, one in Philadelphia (Alpert et al., 1986) and one in Texas (Taylor et al., 1985) , provide useful information. Alpert et al. (1986) found a higher prevalence of infection in household contacts (1 3 of 48 examined) of patients with symptomatic cryptosporidiosis, compared with only two of 56 contacts of asymptomatic children; these two were asymptomatic carriers. In contrast to the study by Hunt et al. (1984) , the illness lasted longer in children (8.3 days) than in adults (3.4 days). Taylor et al. (1985) , who carefully examined an outbreak of diarrhoea in which cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis were detected in almost equal numbers in a day-care centre (Tables 4 and 5), attributed the diarrhoea to the former. The different age distribution of the two infections was the key to discerning the cause of the diarrhoea in this outbreak. Cryptosporidiosis was commoner among children 6 1 2 months old and decreased with age towards 2 years, while giardiasis increased with age from 12 months onwards, peaking at 3 years. Eighteen children were infected with Cryptosporidium and 14 (78%) of them had diarrhoea; 5 of 35 (14%) children without diarrhoea were excreting Cryptosporidium oocysts. In contrast, only 5 of 18 (28%) infected with Giardia experienced diarrhoea, while 14 of 32 (44%) without diarrhoea were excreting Giardia.

In older children and adults, a fourfold rise in serum antibodies is often used as evidence of RSV infection, but asymptomatic infections in which viral shedding is low in titer often are not accompanied by serum antibody rises.

Rhinovirus may be responsible for lower respiratory tract infections in the transplant population; 7 however, asymptomatic shedding is also common. 8 In our study, every patient with SCID diagnosed since 2003 had at least one virus detectable by PCR in the lower respiratory tract.

This patient developed diarrhoea in the first weeks after SCT. Only one stool test was positive for cryptosporidium, and follow-up tests remained negative. We found one carrier of cryptosporidium prior to SCT. This patient developed diarrhoea twice in the post-transplant period, but no cryptosporidium could be detected during diarrhoeal episodes. Cryptosporidosis has been associated with diarrhoea and asymptomatic intestinal carriage. 13, 14 Intestinal infection may be related to activation of latent cryptosporidial infection. 15 In one prospective study, cryptosporidium was detected in the stools of 14% of haematologic cancer patients with diarrhoea, and in 1.4% of asymptomatic patients, 16 suggesting an aetiological role. However, other authors have not reported such a high incidence of cryptosporidial infections in transplant patients. 2, 17 No episodes of diarrhoea were associated with detection of viruses. This outcome is of note since other studies reported an incidence of viral enteritis in SCT recipients from 8% to 28%. 1,2,5 Seasonal influences were taken into account since our study period covered 12 months. Adenovirus and rotavirus were the most reported viral pathogens in cases of diarrhoea in SCT recipients. Conventional adenoviral serotypes do not frequently cause gastro-enteritis, but serotypes 40 and 41 are categorised as enteric adenoviruses. 18 Without serotyping it is difficult to prove that adenoviruses produce gastro-enteritis because of the prolonged period of asymptomatic faecal shedding after respiratory tract infection with traditional adenoviruses. 19 We found a positive ELISA and/or culture for adenovirus during surveillance cultures of faeces in three asymptomatic SCT recipients. After serotyping, one of the patients was positive for serotype 41. Intestinal infection with rotavirus is normally uncommon in adults, but chronic infection with this pathogen has been described in immunocompromised patients. 20 In northern Europe rotavirus infections occur seasonally, primarily during the cooler winter months. Rotaviral disease in SCT recipients can occur in epidemic clusters. 1, 5 We found a positive ELISA for rotavirus of stool specimens in four SCT recipients without diarrhoeal episodes. All patients with faecal shedding of adenovirus and rotavirus were treated as outpatients, and were probably infected by the environment. The time between SCT and first virus isolation in these patients was 69 days (range 40-101 days) after SCT. In addition, one patient was an asymptomatic carrier of echovirus type 9 before transplantation, and one SCT recipient was a carrier of a SRSV. Small round-structured viruses cause approximately 80% of the outbreaks of gastro-enteritis that occur in institutions such as nursing homes and hospitals in The Netherlands and other countries. 21 The virus is spread by the faecal-oral route, with an incubation period of 12 to 48 h. Astrovirus was not detected in stool specimens of our study population. Astroviral disease is frequent in children and similar to rotaviral illness, but less severe. Faecal shedding of the virus in asymptomatic children has been reported and nosocomial transmission can occur. 22 Some studies have described an association between moderate to severe GVHD and the occurrence of viral infection in allogeneic SCT recipients. 1, 5 We failed to reproduce this relationship in our study, due to low incidence of virus infection as well as a low incidence of GVHD (уgrade II; 32%), since all patients received T celldepleted donor marrow.",15.934175642021515,7.90491295366566

When considering the diagnosis of respiratory infection, the mechanism of transmission can highlight specific illnesses. The two main routes of transmission are via contact with droplets or the airborne route. Droplet spread involves usually large droplets containing organisms that drop out of the air quickly and require direct contact with the mucus membranes of the subject for transmission (usually within three feet). This occurs in cases of the common cold. Airborne transmission involves the travel of the infectious pathogen attached to dust particles or respiratory droplets that suspend in the air for prolonged periods of time; therefore, close contact is not required.

[1] [2] [3] [4] Rhinovirus (RV) makes up more than 50% of viruses isolated. Viral detection is associated with asthma exacerbation treatment failure. 5 Nevertheless, apparently well children with asthma may also harbor respiratory viruses in their airways. 1, [6] [7] [8] [9] Twenty-one percent of hospitalized children 3 years or older without wheezing tested positive for virus. 3 Similarly, 23% of children 2 years of age or older with well-controlled asthma tested positive for virus. 4 Virus detection rates in healthy children are higher in young children [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] and developing communities. 16 Given the high rate of RV transmission within families 17 and the 1-to 3-week duration of RV shedding after infection, most asymptomatic infections likely represent children convalescing from a symptomatic viral infection. 18 The impact of respiratory viral detection in children with asthma in a community environment is less well studied. In children from Madison, Wisconsin, virus-positive weeks were associated with greater asthma symptoms, as well as more frequent loss of asthma control. 19, 20 In a community cohort of children with asthma from Randrick, Australia (a suburb of Sydney), RV was detected in 25.5% of nasal samples and associated with increased cough, phlegm, wheeze, and chest tightness. 21, 22 No change in peak expiratory flow (PEF) or forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ) was seen. However, effects of natural respiratory viral infections on lung function and symptoms in urban children with asthma remain largely undefined. Patterns of viral respiratory illnesses may differ between urban and suburban children. For example, sick inner-city infants have lower rates of viral detection than suburban infants. 23 In addition, asthma is undertreated in urban children, 24 which may amplify the effects of viral infection. Finally, whereas we 25 and others [26] [27] [28] [29] have examined nasal cytokine responses of children with asthma to natural colds, potential effects of asymptomatic or mild viral infections have not been studied.",16.17163368836039,11.664558184854664

However, nosocomial outbreaks have been described in haematologic wards, often within a few days after an outbreak in the community [31, 43, 44, 46, [158] [159] [160] . Preventing nosocomial transmission of common respiratory viruses requires a multifaceted approach (Table 21 .4) that targets not only the modes of transmission, but also the source of the viruses [43] . Nosocomial outbreaks are believed to originate from infected patients and from infected health-care workers. Infection control measures include screening symptomatic patients for common respiratory viruses, early isolation of infected patients, screening healthcare workers and visitors for respiratory symptoms, and avoiding contact of symptomatic individuals with patients. Most haematologic wards do not allow children to visit patients, as children are highly prone to common respiratory virus infections and may exhibit viral shedding long after symptom resolution [39] . Continual reinforcement of standard hygiene measures, especially hand hygiene before and after contact with patients, is also strongly recommended. Awareness of the usefulness of these measures, and therefore adherence to the measures, are low, but can be enhanced by educational programs [161] . Most of the common respiratory viruses are transmitted by droplets or direct contact of infected secretions with the nasal mucosa or conjunctiva. Indirect transmission via contaminated fomites or devices is also possible, since these viruses may survive several hours on these surfaces [6, 7, 58] . Consequently, contact isolation of infected patients combined with droplet precautions is mandatory [162] . A gown, gloves, and a mask with eye protection must be worn for all contacts with infected patients. Airborne transmission of influenza is suspected [163, 164] but not yet proven, and two recent studies suggest that surgical masks may be as effective in preventing influenza transmission as masks with greater filtration capacity [165, 166] . Infection control measures have not been evaluated in randomised control trials, but a beforeand-after study suggests they may help to prevent the transmission of common respiratory viruses [43] . It must be pointed out that asymptomatic viral shedding, when present, limits the effectiveness of infection control measures [30, 65] . The optimal duration of isolation is unknown. Whether isolation should be prolonged in asymptomatic patients with persistent low-titre viral shedding detected only by molecular methods remains unclear. Since adenovirus acquisition is known to result also from endogenous reactivation, adenoviral infections may be chiefly related to the level of immunosuppression [39, 86] and, therefore, may not be effectively prevented by standard infection control measures.",16.20576866500879,9.835730985916223

In most studies HRV is not associated with severe disease, though reports of severe and even fatal disease possibly attributable to HRV exist. 265, 266 Indeed, adult LTRs with HRV detected on BAL were more likely to be asymptomatic than symptomatic (37 vs 9). 90 Liu found 14 of 28 respiratory viruses in pediatric LTRs were HRV, and there were no associated deaths or subsequent BOS occurrences. 267 In a pediatric bone marrow unit 82% of the 11 patients with HRV detected by nasopharyngeal aspirate were either asymptomatic or with coryza without LRTI, and all survived. 268 No association of HRV with LRTI was found in a study of 159 BAL from 88 immunocompromised patients, including LTRs. 269 However, the degree of immunosuppression influences the likelihood of developing LRTI. A retrospective cohort study evaluated the effect of RVI, including HRV, on patients undergoing nonmyeloablative versus myeloablative chemotherapy versus auto-HSCT patients. The incidence of any RVI was statistically less in the auto-HSCT, but LRTI was less common in nonmyeloablative versus the other two more immunocompromised groups. 51 Looking only at enterovirus and HRV in patients with hematologic malignancies, 15 HRV were found by PCR, and four of the 15 had signs of LRTI. Two of these patients developed LRTI subsequent to URI. However, one-half of the HRV LRTI cases were associated with coinfection by organisms known to cause LRTI. There were no deaths associated with HRV. 270 Another study in HSCT patients in the first 100 days post-HSCT found HRV in 22% of patients. In 87% of HRV-positive patients coryza and cough was present, with three patients progressing to LRTI. 258 Prolonged shedding of HRV in immunocompromised patients does occur. In the aforementioned study of HSCT patients the median shedding time of HRV was 3 weeks, whereas over 10% shed for more than 3 months. 258 In a small study of adult LTRs, three of 11 cases had prolonged shedding of HRV, one for more than 18 months. 271 Given that this most common of respiratory viruses can progress to LRTI in the most vulnerable patients, can severe disease be predicted by the viral load of HRV? Gerna et al looked at immunocompromised children (HSCT recipients) and adults (LTRs), and normal children and adults and found that immunocompromised adults tended to have lower PCR counts and be asymptomatic, whereas immunologically normal children had higher viral loads associated with more severe disease. 272 Overall, viral loads >10 (5) were associated with LRTI. The indirect effects of this most common of respiratory pathogens on acute and chronic rejection have been assessed by Costa et al, 273 who found no effect in 18 LTRs. Although not specifically HRV, at least one report does suggest an association of RVI with subsequent acute and chronic rejection. 147",13.307644598192145,5.986603147538661

The detection rate of 11 viruses during the same period increased from 34.7% to 59%, similar to that of the total detection rate of 60.6%. These findings suggest that HBoV is a major viral agent of respiratory episodes during late spring to early summer. However, the issue of a causal relationship remains unresolved. It is noteworthy that the detection of HBoV DNA was associated with a higher rate of coinfection than other viral agents. As demonstrated above, the prevalence of coinfection of HBoV was similar to that of adenovirus, which is frequently observed as a copathogen because of its long shedding period. In 2 previous studies, HBoV has also been found with other agents with prevalences of 17.5% and 55.6% [11, 19] . Thus, HBoV infection might occur incidentally to respiratory infections caused by other viral agents.

Some of the respiratory viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus, and the gastrointestinal viruses, norovirus, and rotavirus are predominantly spread by direct contact. As an illustrative example, RSV is the most frequent cause of nosocomial infection in pediatric wards and causes lower respiratory tract disease in 40% of young children. Prolonged shedding of RSV for 3-11 days has been observed in immunocompetent children (Hall, 2000) , and the virus can survive on inanimate surfaces for 6 h (Kramer et al., 2006) . All these factors contribute to fomite-mediated transmission of RSV in the hospital. The risk of nosocomial RSV transmission was not related to age or underlying disease, but to length of hospitalization (Hall et al., 1975) . Contact precautions with cohort nursing and wearing gloves and gowns during patient care resulted in a significant reduction in nosocomial transmission of RSV in three consecutive winters (Madge et al., 1992) . In another study, the incidence of nosocomial acquisition of RSV was significantly decreased after implementation of wearing gloves and gowns and isolation of case events though the duration of RSV shedding remained unchanged before and after the intervention (Leclair et al., 1987) .",15.641816418462142,12.687360074502827

Enteric viruses are mostly transmitted via the fecal-oral transmission route, and their shedding in the stool can continue for a long time after the gastroenteritis symptoms resolved. Depending on the conditions of infection, viral gastroenteritis patients can suffer from abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea and diarrhea potentially leading to serious dehydration. However, in some cases viral gastroenteritis remains asymptomatic or evolves into a chronic infection. The latter implies continuous viral shedding in the stool, which creates a reservoir for future outbreaks of newly developed pathogenic strains (Doerflinger et al., 2017; Graves, 2013; Shortland et al., 2014) . Viral gastroenteritis pathologies normally are self-limiting and generally resolve within 14 days, but they can turn life-threatening for immunocompromised patients and for infants in developing countries (Mcclarren et al., 2011) . In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported diarrheal diseases as the second leading cause of death worldwide in children under 5 years of age, estimated to kill more than half a million of these children each year (World Health Organization, 2017). Due to difficulties in their detection, the role for enteric viruses in eliciting diarrheal diseases was underestimated for a long time. However, after Kapikian identified in 1972 for the first time viral particles in the stool of a patient with diarrhea (Kapikian et al., 1972) , many enteric viruses capable of causing diarrheal disease were described (Bartsch et al., 2016; Bok and Green, 2012; Tsolenyanu et al., 2014) , of which the most common ones are introduced below.",14.479821924660897,6.562307991090419

The fact that the protective effect of OPV was seen particularly among those children who started daycare at a young age is probably due to their strong exposure to viruses causing OM. In addition, the protective effect was strongest at the age of 6-18 months when acute OM peaks. This fits also into the time period when the interfering effect of OPV is expected to occur, if the vaccine is given four times before age of 12 months. However, these results should be interpreted with caution, since the number of the study subjects was relatively small and certain possible confounding factors, e.g. antibiotic treatments during the follow-up could not be taken in to account.

Given the high prevalence and frequent extended shedding of HBoV and HRV, it is not surprising that these viruses were frequently detected in coinfections. This may simply be a result of persistent infection extending over a prolonged time period, making it more likely for an infection with a second virus to occur. The impact of persistent shedding on the severity of incident illness remains unknown. Our study found prolonged shedding of HRV for up to 41 days by PCR and of HBoV for up to 44 days following the onset of initial symptoms. We did not detect any extended shedding of HBoV when it was detected alone, yet extended shedding of HBoV was detected in 36% of multiple virus illnesses, similar to other studies evaluating HBoV time. This suggests that 2 potential pathways of HBoV infection may exist: one with a short, acute, and more symptomatic, single virus infection ( perhaps the primary infection) and the other pathway with a long-shedding, perhaps more indolent, infection during which other viruses are frequently detected. Long shedding patterns add another perspective to the ongoing challenge to determine when a detected virus is actually the cause of clinical symptoms [41, 42] . Reports of high rates of viral detection among asymptomatic children [25, 37, 43, 44] emphasize that not all viruses detected from a patient are necessarily causal agents of disease in that individual at the time they are detected.

Preschool and school age children are more likely than other infected household members to produce secondary cases among contacts, 52 a phenomenon attributed to density rather than to the duration of shedding in modelling analyses. 53 Accordingly, influenza models incorporating age structure 36, 54 do not explicitly allow for longer infectious periods in children. Although asymptomatic individuals are unlikely to be highly infectious, serological evidence of 'off season' transmission in families has been reported. 29 Models that allow for reduced infectiousness of asymptomatic cases have halved the infectious period 55 or lowered the probability of transmission. 10,56 Whether or not 'severe' cases shed more virus and are thus more infectious is questionable, as the host immune response plays a significant role in pathogenicity. 16, 57, 58 Presymptomatic transmission Viral shedding studies suggest that transmission could peak soon after the onset of illness in the index case. Ferguson et al. 37 and Fraser et al. 59 estimated that 30-50% of transmission occurred before symptom onset, assuming that illness would result in withdrawal to home. Some models incorporating household structure extend this idea, allow- ing continued exposure of the index case to family members while reducing community spread. 36, 56 This assumption has significant consequences for outbreak control, which will be more difficult if most transmission occurs before index cases can be identified. 59",19.976784694310133,6.379478346149758

These postulates were revised by the eminent virologist Thomas Rivers in 1937 to reflect the biology of viruses, which, as obligate intracellular parasites, cannot be isolated in pure culture [37] . Huebner [38] further modified these principles in 1957, during the heyday of virus discovery that followed the development of tissue and cell culture. Fredricks and Relman [39] eloquently applied these guidelines to sequence-based microbe discovery. There are numerous challenges in proving viruses as the etiologic causes of specific syndromes: prolonged viral shedding after acute illness (eg, enteroviruses); latent infection and asymptomatic shedding (eg, herpesviruses); clinical disease in a minority of infected individuals (eg, poliovirus); and recurrent asymptomatic infection of immune adults (eg, respiratory syncytial virus) are but a few of these challenges. Huebner proposed a ""Bill of Rights for Prevalent Viruses"" that comprised a ""guarantee against the imputation of guilt by simple association"" [38, pp. 434-437] consisting of 8 conditions: (1) isolation of a virus in culture; (2) repeated recovery of the virus from human specimens; (3) antibody response to the virus; (4) characterization and comparison with known pathogenic viruses; (5) constant association of the virus with specific illness; (6) reproduction of clinical illness in volunteer challenge studies; (7) epidemiologic studies (with controlled longitudinal studies offering the greatest value); and (8) prevention of disease by vaccination. The difficulty in meeting several of these conditions for HBoV, or for any other new virus, is immediately obvious. The recent successful culture of HBoV in primary airway epithelial cells may facilitate research into pathogenesis and the development of an animal model [40] . The available evidence shows that HBoV infects humans early in childhood and can be readily detected in a number of acute respiratory illness episodes in children; the frequency of HBoV infection implies a need for ad-ditional investigation. The present study by Martin et al [1] suggests that a refocusing of HBoV research efforts may be indicated.",15.925677330992054,10.913036071355641

Direct transmission from one host to another occurs during touching, biting, kissing, sexual intercourse, projection via droplets, as in sneezing, coughing, or spitting, or by entry through the skin. Indirect transmission includes aerosols of long-lasting suspended particles in air; this can be central among passengers on an aircraft being exposed to a TB patient or a measles carrier. Fecal-oral transmission such as foodborne and waterborne can occur easily, as well as by poor hygienic conditions with fomites, such as soiled clothes, handkerchiefs, toys, or other objects. Waterborne and foodborne diseases are still among the most common causes of death, particularly of children in low-income countries with poor infrastructure for water and sewage management.

The use of face masks, hand washing, gloves, gowns, and tissues when sneezing are all vital in implementing practices to reduce the spread of hospital-acquired infections and influenza. Promoting these simple measures is of utmost importance as hospital-acquired infections represent a major cause of morbidity and result in extended hospital stay, thus significantly elevating economic costs.

Previously, detection rates ranging between 43% and 63% have been described, 6, 12, 16, 17 with exceptions for very high rates among young children and infants. 18, 19 In asymptomatic children, higher frequencies of positive results have been reported. 20, 21 In particular detection of hRV and EV may represent a previous infection dating back 4-5 weeks, due to prolonged shedding of virus. 22 Lack of pre-existing immunity, greater viral exposure as well as an immature immune system may cause higher levels of viral replication and prolonged viral shedding in children. Templeton et al. reported a detection rate of only 24%, but hRV, hCoV, AdV or hMPV were not included in their panel. 23 Studies performed retrospectively on clinical samples will select for a short duration of symptoms as will studies including children, who tend to seek medical care early and who may shed more virus during a longer time period. Thus, the prospective approach and the adult population may explain the relatively low detection rate found in our sample. As the study period included the influenza season, we detected influenza A and B virus in a relatively high proportion of patients (41%), which is comparable to other studies of adults. 9 We detected a pathogen in only 2% of control subjects, both hRV.

In addition, the UK study included children between the ages 0 and 18, whereas our study excluded patients under 6 years of age.

This practice has been advocated for testing on symptomatic patients in order to detect viral infection before transplant, and positive testing has resulted in delay of transplantation when feasible. However, the practice of testing in asymptomatic patients may not be necessary and warrants further study [15, 16] . Similarly, in our study, pre-operative identification of respiratory viruses by rapid molecular testing in the absence of clinical symptoms did not predict increased morbidity or mortality. Correspondingly, patients in the present study who became symptomatic post-operatively whether they tested positive or negative did have a significantly prolonged LOS, intubation time, and more freqeuent respiratory complications. This is consistent with previously published studies in the literature, suggesting that screening should [3] [4] [5] [6] 14] . Similar to previous studies, HRV was the most common virus detected in our study when multiplex molecular testing is utilized. In 2016 Self et al. investigated the prevalence of respiratory viruses in 832 children with community acquired pneumonia and used 521 asymptomatic children as controls. They identified a virus in 69% of children with pneumonia and 25% of asymptomatic controls. HRV was the most common virus identified in the asymptomatic control group, accounting for over 70% of the viral isolates [17] . Interestingly, this same study also showed that asymptomatic HRV detection declines with increasing age, as HRV was detected in 24% of asymptomatic children less than 2 years of age, while in only 0.8% of adults older than 18 years of age [16] . The presence of HRV (+)PCR test result in otherwise asymptomatic children does not necessarily represent at an ""at risk"" group of patients. This is especially true in light of the fact that HRV has shown to persist in 50% of children for up to 2 weeks beyond the acute infection [12] . However, unlike HRV, RSV, HMPV, and PIV viruses are considerably more short-lived and rapidly cleared from the respiratory tract after an infection [18] . In a 2014 Swedish study, Influenza, RSV, and HMPV were identified in less than 1% of 209 asymptomatic controls [19] . Thus, unlike HRV, they are rarely detected in asymptomatic children; however, if identified, they almost always progress to clinically evident respiratory disease [17, 18] . With the advent of molecular testing, postponing surgery in PCR(+) HRV infants could result in the inappropriate delay of timely cardiac surgery. Future studies will need to address at what age PCR(+) testing for HRV may in fact predict adverse outcomes. While our study did not show a difference in outcomes for infants with RSV, HMPV, or PIV identified pre-operatively, our numbers were quite small.

Only 5% of infected individuals (2 of 39) had asymptomatic infection in the US study. In a study of infants admitted with RSV to intensive care units, Crowcroft et al reported a prevalence of asymptomatic infection, as determined by PCR of pernasal swabs, of 48% and 49% in the siblings and parents, respectively [23]. This suggests that the study by Hall et al [2] might have missed subclinical infections, particularly in older children and adults, owing to reduced sensitivity of the viral culture in asymptomatic cases. Alternatively, it is possible that in the present study, virus shed from asymptomatic cases was not viable, resulting in an overestimation of subclinical infections. We show that infection episodes with low peak viral load or absence of concurrent RSV infections in the household were associated with a reduced risk of ARD. In general, it appears that asymptomatic RSV infections are likely in individuals with previous exposure to RSV (and with concomitant high levels of neutralizing antibodies), such as older children and young adults [19].",27.935720553941536,14.748431303929738

Pretransplant screening for RSV and delay of transplant in adults is effective in reducing rates of pneumonia [20]. Our policy in pediatric patients is to delay transplant if patients have evidence of infection with RSV, influenza, adenovirus, or hMPV, even if patients are asymptomatic. Transplantation is not generally delayed for asymptomatic shedding of rhinovirus, bocavirus, or coronavirus. This study further enforces the risks associated with transplantation during documented hMPV viral shedding or disease. Because infection may result in such serious disease, potential modalities to treat or at least stabilize patients while white blood cells and/or immune function can return are considered and utilized in these patients. Treatment with IVIG and ribavirin is currently being utilized at our institution for severely immunocompromised individuals [21, 22]. Among the patients who received treatment, we demonstrated a 22% mortality rate as compared to a 2% mortality rate in untreated individuals.

We observed a strong positive correlation between the markers of RSV shedding (ie, duration and viral load) over the infection period (Figure 4) and the probability of spread. Longer RSV infection episodes or those with a higher peak viral load were more likely to be symptomatic than their counterparts. The presence of symptoms and correlates of the amount of virus shedding (ie, duration and load) were independently associated with the risk of within-household spread among the index cases, after adjustment for age and household size. These findings taken together indicate that symptomatic individuals were more infectious and, thus, better transmitters than those without symptoms. The correlation of ARD and the amount of virus shedding suggests that vaccines that decrease viral shedding severity upon exposure to RSV, even if they do not reduce the risk of infection itself, could diminish virus transmission in the population. However, 34% of the symptomatic RSV episodes had the illness appear on average 4 days after first detection of the virus. If individuals change their behavior as a result of symptoms, such as by reducing their contacts, the period of shedding before symptoms appear or the prevalence of asymptomatic infections might have an accentuated role in transmission of RSV in the population. Furthermore, the high frequency of asymptomatic RSV cases observed in this study, coupled with the nonnegligible infectivity of the asymptomatic state, suggests that these individuals could play an important role in the transmission of RSV in a population.",27.85124732257204,11.65609317243543

We did not screen asymptomatic children and may not have captured complete data on children who were evaluated solely as outpatients at other private clinics or hospitalized in other institutions. As the regional pediatric referral center, most immunocompromised patients are seen and followed at our institution but because of our large geographic referral area, it is possible that some children were seen elsewhere. Therefore, our study could be biased towards detection of more severe hMPV disease. Also, it is possible that a subset of earlier hMPV-positive cases were missed through use of DFA as compared to PCR, a more sensitive detection technique [12]. Furthermore, we were unable to capture all data at the time of clinical presentation, or to obtain full information regarding the clinical decision-making for the administration of ribavirin and/or IVIG. Therefore, the comparison of outcomes in patients who did and did not receive treatment is problematic, and the potential benefits of therapy are not readily evaluable. Unlike a previous hMPV study conducted in adult HSCT recipient patients in Italy [23], we did not assess hMPV shedding in asymptomatic patients and unfortunately cannot comment on rates of symptomatic versus asymptomatic shedding of hMPV in our patients. Finally, we were limited in our ability to classify disease severity based on hypoxemia, as some patients did not have oxygen saturations charted. We suspect that a higher proportion of our patients would be classified as having severe disease using criteria such as that used by Papenburg et al [5]. Although only 8 (15%) of our patients were identified as having acquired their hMPV infection nosocomially, the vast majority of the patients were seen frequently on an outpatient basis in clinic for blood draws, interventions, and chemotherapy, making it difficult to differentiate true community-acquired disease from that acquired in the hospital setting.",19.123003038284736,8.995798813681946

With the development of the oral polio vaccine (OPV) by Albert Sabin in 1961, the world was given the tools, with which to stop outbreaks, strengthen and build immunity, to ensure that children can grow up without the threat of polio. The combination of OPV and IPV led to the eradication of polio in the Americas, the western Pacific and Europe. Today, 80% of the world population lives in polio-free regions. Nevertheless, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria are countries where polio is still categorised as an endemic viral infection. It should be noted that in 2013–2014 an upsurge of polio in areas, which were considered polio-free, occurred. The confirmed circulation of wild-type poliovirus (WPV) in Israel and the outbreak of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in Syria mean that there is a high risk of the disease being reintroduced into Europe. Europe should implement a prevention policy, which is based on enhancing the vaccination of resident and refugee populations, strengthening surveillance and being prepared to rapidly respond to the identification of polio. In Greece, there is a national action plan, which includes programmes to sustain high levels of polio immunisation coverage, AFP surveillance and actions in the event of a suspected or confirmed poliomyelitis case.

As outbreaks are occurring in places where people interact with each other closely, transmission between children is likely to occur when schools open, thus triggering a second wave in the community.

It causes hoarseness of the voice and sometimes the lesions can cause obstruction of the upper airway track. In adults, the clinical behaviour differs, as the disease requires fewer surgical excisions than in children. In children, the lesions caused by HPV often need many surgical procedures before they become extinct and quiescent. Inverted papilloma, which is a type of squamous papilloma, is strongly associated with HPV subtypes 6 and 1 and its incidence in children is twice as high compared to adults (82). Fortunately, the majority of these lesions can be surgically removed and provide the young patient with a good prognosis. Microsurgery, transoral laser microsurgery (TLM) and endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) are some of the most frequent surgical methods of excision. A review of recent studies dealing with HPV lesions in children revealed only a few cases, which have been treated surgically. The most common approach of surgical treatment is using TLM. However, laser treatment can cause several complications, such as stenosis, burns of the airway tract and scars. An alternative to TLM are microdebriders (83). Microdebriders provide a more accurate excision, removing only the affected tissue and preserving the healthy tissue. The preservation of healthy epithelium is very useful, when repeated interventions are needed, particularly in children. When the lesion causes obstruction of the airway tract, a tracheotomy is necessary to keep the airway open. However, it should be avoided and performed only when it is an emergency because of the danger of spreading the disease to the respiratory tract (84). In the future, the association between HPV-related lesions in children and cancerous lesions in adults needs to be considered carefully, revealing the importance of vaccination in children against HPV (85).",15.844273568189504,7.482881099332101

The seroprevalence significantly increases in adolescence with the commencement of sexual activity. Mucosal HPV infection is often described as a sexually transmitted infection; however, the presence of such infections in infants and young children suggests that the virus may also be vertically and horizontally transmitted. There is strong evidence that maternal HPV cervical infection at the time of delivery can be transmitted to the newborn and there is a strong association between development of juvenile RRP and the presence of maternal genital warts during pregnancy (49). The detection of HPV DNA in spermatozoa and seminal plasma, as well as in amniotic fluid and placental tissue, suggests that periconceptual and prenatal transmission may also be possible (46,47). HPV can be transmitted horizontally (i.e., by kissing or touch) or to different sites by auto-inoculation (46,47). In the case of anogenital warts in particular, sexual abuse remains an important consideration.

In a review of the literature that goes back to 1965 and stretches to 2008, the prevalence of viruses in 15000 samples from asymptomatic subjects was higher by PCR than by conventional methods [158]. This casts some doubt on the clinical significance of PCR-positive viral findings overall. Several studies have, on the other hand, demonstrated that positive PCR results are clinically relevant at least as far as HRV is concerned. Identification of HRV correlates with respiratory symptoms, dual HRV infections are rare and overall, the prevalence of recurrent or persistent respiratory viral infections (excluding TTV and HBoV) is low (3-4%) [96, 158-160]. Positive findings with PCR correlate with systemic or local immune responses in children and in adults [161-163]. These findings, which mainly apply to HRV and not to HBoV, suggest that HRV-PCR positivity probably reflects a true, current respiratory infection with or without symptoms, rather than residual nucleic acids from some other distant infection. Of course, any findings in upper airway samples do not necessarily reflect the situation in lower airways [164]. Multiple PCR analyses of single samples (multiplex PCR) may sound attractive, but the sensitivity for identification of individual viruses may be lost compared to single virus PCR [165].

Despite these limitations, there seems to be sufficient evidence to conclude that facemasks, hand hygiene and reduced crowding are effective in reducing the spread of influenza.42 Hand hygiene would be relatively simple for travellers to implement and several studies suggest that the use of alcohol based sanitizers and hand washing after touching contaminated surfaces can be effective.43,44",15.541510672506568,7.113313751317965

We considered episodes that occurred in the same household within 10 days before and after onset of a confirmed case as possible RSV-ARI cases, which might have overestimated RSV transmission among children in the household. Second, we did not consider asymptomatic cases in our analysis. A previous study has reported that 17.3% of RSV infections are asymptomatic among children <5 years old and that these asymptomatic cases play an important role as a source of transmission [31]. Third, since we collected the data of ARI episodes and clinical specimen only from children <5 years old, we could not capture the entire picture of household RSV transmission. In total, there was no possible index case for approximately 70% (44 of 62) of the young infants with RSV. A previous study has shown that parents and school-age children also play an important role as a source of RSV infection for infants [13]. Moreover, we could estimate R0 by using the cases <5 years old. There might be a secondary case infected by children <5 years old. Therefore, R0 in our analysis might be underestimated, and further study is warranted to understand RSV transmissibility among entire population including ≥5 years old. Fourth, we did not consider RSV transmission from outside the household. For example, contact with playmates and other infants in a day care center might be an important source of infection for infants. It is possible that they acquired RSV infection outside of the household. However, we could not analyze this possibility due to the study design. More detailed epidemiological studies, including social network analysis, are required to understand the complete RSV transmission dynamics. Despite these limitations, we managed to gain insight into RSV transmission patterns in a household, especially for young infants. We also estimated epidemiological parameters, such as the serial interval and R0. We believe that accumulation of such data in different settings will help establish more effective control measures against RSV in the future.",16.3952496298504,11.706305834345345

Consumption of raw meat of infected animals, in particular pigs, as well as occupations involving contact with pigs or biologic pig materials have been identified as possible routes of transmission. Different studies have shown that in swine workers the prevalence of subjects with detectable serum anti HEV immunoglobulin G (IgG) is higher than in general population [13], but data regarding seroprevalence might be affected by the different kits used for the analysis, showing significant variability in levels of sensitivity. Therefore, the real incidence of HEV infection in the general population and among workers cannot be estimated yet and further research is needed.

A largely asymptomatic infant with COVID-19 with high viral load was reported in Singapore, and this case highlights the difficulties in establishing the true incidence of COVID-19, as asymptomatic individuals may play important roles in human-to-human transmission in the community [13] . A study focused on 24 asymptomatic infections identified that the infection period of asymptomatic patients may be as long as three weeks, and the infected patients may develop into serious diseases [14] . Furthermore, the bad habits of young children such as sucking hands, putting their hands all around and unwilling to wash hands could be important risk factors in contact transmission for children. Thus, it is necessary to guarantee family daily prevention to keep children from COVID-19 infection and assure awareness of the importance of its early diagnosis. Also, during the epidemic period, children's health clinics and vaccination clinics should be reduced reasonably, and parent-child activities, kindergartens, primary schools, and other group activities related to children should be suspended. In clinical case, screening was mostly based on the epidemiological track record. Additional basis were raised body temperature and symptoms of the respiratory tract. For children, it is more important to trace close contact history, and pathogen examination needs to be timely executed along with longitudinal monitoring through viral nucleic acid detection. Further isolation recommendations and ongoing nucleic acid testing are also recommended for discharged patients [14] . Additionally, it appears crucial to follow up with infants'respiratory as well as gastrointestinal symptoms and vital indications steadily, which is the most susceptible population in children, at mild onset that could progress into severe at a later stage [11] .",16.203800815298333,8.056905186458389

We also examined the effect of the size of clusters imputed on the results and the difference was trivial between average cluster size three and five. An important issue in analyzing transmission of COVID-19 is the amount of silent transmission. As mentioned earlier, some infectious subjects may transmit their infection before they become symptomatic. As long as their descendant cases also go on to develop symptoms their transmission link may still be established. However, when infected subjects who remain completely asymptomatic could be infectious to susceptible contacts, the appearance of such contacts, when symptomatic, could not be linked to their immediate ancestors. Given the fact that symptoms seem to be milder in those who are young, such unobservable transmission cannot be excluded [26] . Silent transmission has been seen in other infectious diseases [27] where, notably, asymptomatically infected subjects appeared to cause fewer transmission.

Of these infected individuals, only six were aged 0-19 years, 152 were aged 20-59 years and 476 were 60 years and older. Despite the near absence of children on the ship, 328 of the 634 infected individuals were asymptomatic. These data clearly indicate that asymptomatic infections are not limited to the paediatric population. Therefore, perhaps one of the most effective public health intervention strategies would be to identify and isolate asymptomatically infected adults, as it is these individuals who have numerous contacts outside the home and may be contributing to viral spread.",13.854405828991395,6.345719271935623

The presence of HBoV in asymptomatic individuals raises questions regarding the role of the virus in gastrointestinal infections as a pathogen or just a bystander (16) .

Accordingly, it is possible that within a household cluster children were not correctly identified as the index case of the infection (i.e. the first to develop symptoms) and were instead mistakenly identified as a contact case. To exclude this possibility, we reanalysed the data looking at the number of families where an adult was identified as the index but one or more children were identified as asymptomatically infected ( Figure 1 ). However, even if we assume that all asymptomatic children in these families were in fact the index case, only 6/28 (21%) children were identified as the index case in the household cluster ( Table 2 ). These data suggest that even if children are being mistakenly overlooked as the index case, they are still likely to only have accounted for a limited percentage of household cluster transmissions of SARS-CoV-2.",14.400128824452317,5.8083916165221865

We show that the impact of asymptomatic transmission depends on generation intervals (i.e., time between when an individual is infected and when that individual infects another person). If the generation-interval distribution of asymptomatic transmission differs from that of symptomatic transmission, then estimates of the basic reproduction number which do not explicitly account for asymptomatic cases may be systematically biased. Specifically, if asymptomatic cases have a shorter generation interval than symptomatic cases, R 0 will be over-estimated, and if they have a longer generation interval, R 0 will be underestimated. We also show that as the length of asymptomatic generation intervals increase, estimates of the realized proportion of asymptomatic transmission during the exponential phase of the epidemic decrease.

It may be different for either of two reasons, one of which we attempt to quantify here. It could be less if those who travel for some reason are less well integrated into the social mixing that produces infection, for example if they tend to have stayed in certain parts of the city or in hotels. This aspect could conceivably increase or decrease prevalence in travelers relative to residents. Here we quantify a second difference, which is that some travelers (whom we refer to as visitors) will have been in the city only for a short time and had less exposure to the infection than residents. This effect, we find, is most pronounced when the epidemic is growing slowly, when the visitors have stayed only briefly, and when the duration of detectable infection is short. We find that for plausible parameters for COVID-19, prevalence in visitors staying only 3 days could be as little as half that of residents, but for longer stays of over a week the visitor prevalence should be 80% or more that of residents. Assuming that the traveler population is a mix of visitors of various durations and residents, this suggests that underestimation of source population prevalence due to the presence of short-stay visitors could be appreciable but more modest than the effect of imperfect detection.",8.009677519622647,2.750055695278566
