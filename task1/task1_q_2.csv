In Iran, the first cases of COVID-19 were officially announced between February 19 and 23, 2020 and it soon became clear that Iran is one of the countries that is worst-hit by COVID-19 outbreak (1, 2) . It is now evident that most cases of COVID-19 disease develop mild respiratory and constitutional symptoms (3), while some cases are asymptomatic (3, 4) . Involvement of other organs, including liver and kidneys has been reported in patients with COVID-19 (5). Many questions remain unanswered about associations and presentations of COVID-19. Shohada-e-Tajrish Hospital, a university hospital located in Tehran, Iran, was designated as one of the main centers providing diagnostic and healthcare services for patients suspected to be infected with the new virus. Here, we share our experience regarding computed tomography (CT) findings suggestive of COVID-19 disease among patients who underwent radiologic investigation due to traumatic injuries. Several trauma patients had findings on their chest and/or abdominal CT scans, which were suggestive or highly suggestive of COVID-19 (1). The findings were noted in the lung bases that were visible on an abdominal CT scan or on a clinically indicated spiral CT scan of the chest. The most frequent mechanisms of injury were fall and car accident. Conscious patients did not report dizziness or loss of consciousness before the trauma and most of them did not have any symptoms related to COVID-19 (e.g., fever, shortness of breath). To our knowledge, there is no study or report about the possible association between COVID-19 and trauma in the lit-erature. So, the mentioned observations could be just a coincidence, but this association could still be proposed as a research objective. The importance of this finding is that CT characteristics of COVID-19 could be seen in patients who were admitted to the hospitals not due to COVID-19 related symptoms, but because of chest and abdominal trauma. This issue should be considered by health care workers serving trauma patients and it should be kept in mind that during an outbreak of respiratory infections, in particular COVID-19 disease, every attempt should be made to protect the health and safety of the staff even when providing care for trauma patients.",33.18270308669315,11.375851602242063

The total reported infections by February 25th (08:30 h Norway time) had increased to 79,331 in at least 30 countries [10] , among which more than 97% are reported in mainland China [10] . The total death toll has reached to more than 2600 [10] , which surpasses by three times the total number of deaths during the SARS outbreak in 2003 [11] . In order to control the rapid spread of the COVID-19, the epidemic center, Wuhan, a city with more than 10 million residents, was placed on effective lockdown on January 23th and the lockdown measures were shortly after implemented in the whole of Hubei Province [12] . The number of city lockdowns in China had increased to more than 80 by the beginning of February. Besides, tourist sites were closed across the country, public gatherings were cancelled and people was encouraged to stay at home [13] . All school activities were suspended [13] . and instead, online platforms have been used for teaching and learning. The implementation of lockdown policies has effectively restricted both inbound and outbound transportation in Hubei Province [6] , and the mobility of people within the cities has been largely reduced [13] . In Wuhan, within two weeks, several temporary hospitals have been established to provide more clinical beds and medical service for the COVID-19 infection. This has led to significant logistics challenges in both forward and reverse directions. From the reverse logistics perspective, the rapidly increased amount of medical waste due to the COVID-19 outbreak needs to be collected and treated in a timely, safe and effective manner in order to minimize the virus spread and the risk to humans. Taking into account the real-world challenge faced in Wuhan, a novel multi-objective multi-period mixed integer linear program is modeled for the reverse logistics network design of medical waste management in epidemic outbreak, which aims at improving the decision-makings related to the temporary facilities and the transportation planning. Meanwhile, the model could provide quantitative analysis and managerial insights into the system performance.",24.872737338875467,8.88349744802431

COVID-19 is a self-limiting disease in more than 80% of patients. Severe pneumonia occurred in about 15% of cases as revealed in studies with large cohorts of patients. The gross case fatality is 3.4% worldwide as of February 25, 2020. This rate is 4.4% for patients in Wuhan, 4.0% for patients in Hubei and 0.92% for patients outside of Hubei. The exceedingly high fatality in Wuhan might be explained by the collapse of hospitals, a large number of undiagnosed patients, suboptimal treatment or a combination of these. Up to date, we still do not have any specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents but an anti-Ebola drug, remdesivir, may hold the promise. As a nucleotide analog, remdesivir was shown to be effective in preventing MERS-CoV replication in monkeys. Severity of disease, viral replication, and lung damage were reduced when the drug was administered either before or after infection with MERS-CoV [10] . These results provide the basis for a rapid test of the beneficial effects of remdesivir in COVID-19. Other antiviral agents worthy of further clinical investigations include ribavirin, protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir, interferon α2b, interferon β, chloroquine phosphate, and Arbidol. However, we should also bear in mind the side effects of these antiviral agents. For example, type I interferons including interferon α2b and interferon β are well known for their antiviral activity. Their beneficial effects at an early phase of infection are well expected. However, administration at a later stage carries the risk that they might worsen the cytokine storm and exacerbate inflammation. Notably, steroids have been experimentally used widely in the treatment of SARS and are still preferred by some Chinese physicians in the treatment of COVID-19. It is said to be capable of stopping the cytokine storm and preventing lung fibrosis. However, the window in which steroids might be beneficial to patients with COVID-19 is very narrow. In other words, steroids can only be used when SARS-CoV-2 has already been eliminated by human immune response. Otherwise, SARS-CoV-2 replication will be boosted leading to exacerbation of symptoms, substantial virus shedding, as well as increased risk for nosocomial transmission and secondary infection. In this regard, it will be of interest to determine whether the report of fungal infection in the lungs of some patients in Wuhan might be linked to misuse of steroids. Nevertheless, the screening of new pharmaceuticals, smallmolecule compounds and other agents that have potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects will successfully derive new and better lead compounds and agents that might prove useful in the treatment of COVID-19.",27.634830128444946,11.445757664196492

In general, epidemiologists use mathematical formulas with clear and acceptable assumptions to calculate the infectivity index. For this purpose, ""basic reproduction number"" termed R0 is used, and it indicates the expected number of cases directly infected by one contagious case in a population that everyone is supposed to be susceptible. For viral pathogens in MERS and SARS epidemics, the index was approximated to be 2, indicating that each infected person could infect two people on average in an effective contact. However, for COVID-19, the calculated value in a study was slightly higher and the index value based on data calculated in Wuhan, China was 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9) (17) and it shows that the infectivity of COVID-19 is higher than previous epidemics originated by coronavirus (18) . In other studies, R0 has been reported with different values, the lowest of which corresponds to the WHO report of 1.95 (1.4-2.5) (19) and the highest value is 6.47 (95% CI 5.71-7.23) (20) . A review study estimated an average R0 for COVID-19 of 3.28 with a median of 2.79 and an IQR of 1.16 (21) . As an explanation for variety of the calculated indices is that different calculation methods were used and calculations were done at different times of epidemics. As previously noted, certain assumptions have been made in calculation of this index. Initial reports on a family in one of the provinces of China show that all six-members of a family, aged 10-66 years were infected within a short period after one member returned from Wuhan (8) . As a conclusion, this index is changing over time, and its reduction may reflect effectiveness of preventive measures, so that reaching a value less than one (less than one new case per effective contact with an infected person and transmission) implies that the epidemic is controlled in the community (6).",29.80114157781341,10.019771029302163

Although a 30-bed ward in an infectious disease hospital in Wuhan was established for psychiatric patients on 3 February 2020, the rapidly escalating number of cases has led to a severe shortage of hospital beds. As an alternative, isolation wards have been established in psychiatric hospitals for psychiatric patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19, but this option could increase the risk of hospital-acquired infection especially if there is inadequate capacity for infection control in these hospitals [1] . Another option is to establish specific quarantine facilities for clinically stable psychiatric patients with mild-moderate symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Gymnasiums, exhibition centers and sports centers have been converted into 'Fang Cang' (temporary quarantine hospital facilities) for infected patients with mild symptoms [14] (Figure 1 ). In conclusion, the COVID-19 outbreak has raised numerous challenges for psychiatric hospitals in China to safely manage patients' major psychiatric disorders in addition to preventing and treating COVID-19. In addressing these challenges, future community mental health system reform is necessary to re-balance the system by re-distributing resources from hospital-centric services to community-based and primary care services.

A large number of patients present to clinics and health centers with mild common cold symptoms such as dry cough, sore throat, low-grade fever or body aches. Patients usually go to the emergency departments if the symptoms of the clinical manifestations worsen after a few days. Because of the wide spectrum of clinical symptoms, research on biomarkers and clinical criteria predicting prognosis is of high priority to enable differentiating cases that require further interventions in the early phase of the disease (10) . No approved drug regimen has been introduced to treat infected cases so far, antiviral treatments are used to alleviate the disease symptoms. Studies on Remedesevir, as an antiviral agent, revealed its in vitro activity against the COVID-19 virus and its safety was proven in Ebola trials. Another proposed treatment is Chloroquine, an old drug for treatment of malaria, with apparent effectiveness and acceptable safety against COVID-19 associated pneumonia (48, 49) . Evaluating the efficacy of anti-influenza drugs such as Umifenovir and Oseltamivir against COVID-19 virus is interesting but lacks any biological plausibility. Using monoclonal antibodies has been suggested as an attractive choice among inactive prophylactic methods; however, its effectiveness has not been proven in other viral respiratory diseases and influenza, yet (50, 51) . Steroids and methylprednisolone seem to be widely used in the recent pandemic. However, in case of MERS, it has been shown that the drug prolongs the presence of the virus and WHO does not recommend its use for COVID-19, except for patients with acute respiratory distress syn-drome (ARDS) (52, 53) . The effectiveness of other medicines and regimens such as Chloroquine, Vitamin C, and Chinese medicine, as well as Lopinavir/Ritonavir combination therapy and Remedesevir are being evaluated in China. Even though randomized clinical trials are important for improving prognosis and interrupting transmission of disease, researchers and healthcare providers should concentrate on alleviation of the disease among subgroups of patients and in different phases of the disease (54) . In addition, since the emerging virus has become a serious global concern, there is a need for rapid development of a vaccine. There are a few vaccine candidates developed in response to outbreak. However, an effective anti-viral medication or a vaccine that has been evaluated for safety and efficacy against COVID-19 is not available yet, and most vaccines are still in the preclinical testing stage (55, 56, 57) .",26.643393753969576,8.228936305295791

Since the first case of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, up to March 19th, 234073 people in the world have been infected with COVID-19 and 9840 people have died because of COVID-19 infection (6) (7) (8) (9) . On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) labeled the outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). On February 12, 2020, WHO named the disease caused by the novel coronavirus ""Coronavirus Disease 2019"" . A team of international experts, with a range of specializations, has tried to manage this outbreak (10, 11) . Pneumonia caused by COVID-19 is a highly contagious and infectious disease declared a health emergency by the World Health Organization (11) (12) (13) . The exact way of disease transmission has not yet been determined, but the researchers found that the virus spreads through respiratory droplets like the flu, and air precautions are very necessary given the lack of information in this area (14). With the spread of the coronavirus, concerns have been raised about its intrauterine transmission from mother to fetus in pregnant women (2, 3, 15) . Viral pneumonia is one of the leading causes of pregnancy deaths worldwide (16) . Important questions raised due to the spread of COVID-19 in-clude: Are the symptoms of pneumonia in pregnant women different from those of non-pregnant women? How likely are maternal and neonatal mortality? Does it cause pregnancy complications or premature birth? and How much COVID-19 is transmitted to the baby (3, 17) ? Given the importance of the issue and the lack of sufficient evidence, the present study aimed to review the published evidence in this regard.",35.687995918683804,11.970285722446848

In this regard, a study by Chen et al. in China on 9 pregnant mothers with COVID-19 found that none of the newborns had postpartum complications such as COVID-19 infection and prematurity (12) . This finding is in line with the results of a previous study on SARS-CoV-1 that was done by Wong and colleagues (15) . However, acourding to some studies, infection with COVID-19 during pregnancy can cause complications for both the mother and the fetus; including preterm delivery, respiratory distress, fetal distress, coaglopathy accompanied by liver dysfunction and death of the mother. The newborn and the mother with confirmed COVID-19 should be isolated in different rooms and be screened very carefully (4, 7, 21, 23) . Also, according to Chen et al., the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 in pregnant women were not significantly different from those of non-pregnant women, with common symptoms including chest pain, shortness of breath, fever and lethargy (12) . Also, Liu et al. found that Pregnancy and childbirth did not aggravate the course of symptoms or CT features of COVID-19 Pneumonia (16) . Overall, due to lack of evidence, scientists and researchers could not confirm vertical transmission of COVID-19 infection from placenta, during delivery and breast milk in the perinatal period (17) . In some studies, evaluating both cesarean and normal vaginal delivery in mothers with COVID-19 showed that neither type of delivery affected their newborns and all of the studied newborns were negative for COVID-19 infection (12, 15, 16, 24) . Previously published studies have demonstrated that being affected with SARS during perinatal period is associated with a high prevalence of harmful maternal and neonatal side effects including disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, abrupt abortion, preterm childbirth, intrauterine growth retard, neonatal intubation and need of newborn to be admitted to neonatal intensive care unit, and organ failure (17, 25) . Generally, our review of literature showed that pregnant women infected with COVID-19 and their newborns had less problems than would be anticipated for those with SARS-CoV-1 infection. Although the findings should be interpreted with percaution because of the small sample size, the results are mostly in line with the findings by Zhu and colleagues (24) that was done on ten newborn who were born to mothers with COVID-19 pneumonia. Also, the clinical manifastations reported in pregnant women with positive COVID-19 are similar to those reported for non-pregnant women infected with COVID-19 and relatively good clinical outcomes have been reported for COVID-19 infection in pregnant women compared with SARS-CoV-1 infection (26, 27) .

Cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) is a phenomenon of immune hyperactivation typically described in the setting of T cell-engaging immunotherapy, including CAR-T cell therapy but also anti-PD-1 agents [15] . CRS is characterized by elevated levels of IL-6, IFN-γ and other cytokines, provoking consequences and symptoms related to immune activation, ranging from fever, malaise and myalgias to severe organ toxicity, lung failure and death. In parallel, one of the most important mechanism underlying the deterioration of disease in COVID-19 is represented by the cytokine storm, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome or even multiple organ failure [16] . The cytometric analyses of COVID-19 patients showed reduced counts of peripheral CD4 and CD8 T cells, while their status was hyperactivated. In addition, an increased concentration of highly proinflammatory CCR6+ Th17 in CD4 T cells has been reported, and CD8 T cells were found to harbor high concentrations of cytotoxic granules, suggesting that overactivation of T cells tends to contribute to the severe immune injury of the disease [17] . Moreover, the pathological findings associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome in COVID-19 showed abundant interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate in the lungs, dominated by lymphocytes, once again implying that the immune hyperactivation mechanisms are at least partially accountable for COVID-19 severity [17] . Considering these aspects, the hypothesis of a synergy between ICI mechanisms and COVID-19 pathogenesis, both contributing to a counter-producing immune hyperactivation, cannot be excluded.",30.14461338216408,9.224016245136859

The mentioned val- ues were also reported for patients with MERS-CoV, where elevated ALT, AST and LDH was observed (6) . Another study indicated that 2-11% of patients with COVID-19 had liver co-morbidities and 14-53% of cases had abnormal ALT and AST levels during progression of COVID-19 disease (12) . Furthermore, Shi et al. studied patients whose COVID-19 diagno- sis was confirmed by computed tomography (CT) scan while in the subclinical phase and found that incidence of AST abnormality among these patients was significantly lower than those diagnosed after the onset of symptoms (13) . Therefore, liver injury is more prevalent in severe cases compared to mild cases of COVID-19.

We have found that the number and percentage of WBC, LYM and NEU were significantly different between positive and negative RT-PCR cases for COVID-19/or SARS-CoV-2. In comparison to the normal range, we found low WBC and LYM counts in patients with positive RT-PCR COVID-19, whereas NEU counts were higher in these patients. In previous reports, low LYM and WBC counts were found in most patients, which is in line with our study (14) . Laboratory studies showed leucopenia with leukocyte counts of 2.91 ÃŮ 109 cells/L, 70.0% of which were NEU (15) . Therefore, our result suggests that NEU might not be affected with SARS-CoV-2 in the initial phase of the disease. It also suggests that SARS-CoV-2 might mainly act on lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes, as does SARS-CoV. Virus particles spread through the respiratory tract and infect other cells, inducing series of immune responses, and causing changes in number of peripheral white blood cells such as lymphocytes (11) . Some studies suggest that a substantial decrease in the total number of lymphocytes indicates that coronavirus affects many immune cells and inhibits cellular immune function (11) . Tsui and others reported that high neutrophil count on admission of COVID-19 patients, and elevated LDH level were independent predictors of an adverse clinical outcome (16) . In the present study, ROC curve was used to analyze the specificity and sensitivity of different variables in suspected COVID-19 patients. The AUC of laboratory parameters such as ALT, CRP, AST, LDH, and NEU indicated that they could be used to predict the presence of COVID-19 disease, while those of albumin and WBC were below the reference line of ROC curve, indicating that they were poor predictors of the disease. The data is in line with results reported by Wang et al. (17) and Gao et al. (4) . In the current study, the AUC of CRP, ALT, LDH, urea and NEU were above 0.80; thus, they are effective and have very good predictive value for predicting COVID-19. It seems that, some blood laboratory parameters could be used in screening cases with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19. Considering the significant difference in laboratory parameters evaluated in this study between the 2 groups, one can hope to model or predict the results of coronavirus testing based on routine laboratory tests.",31.27589452537149,11.036610441856457

This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of laboratory parameters in predicting cases with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19. Methods: This diagnostic accuracy study was conducted on suspected COVID-19 patients, who presented to Behpooyan Clinic Medical center in Tehran (Iran) from 22 February to 14 March, 2020. Patients were divided into two groups based on the results of real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19, and the accuracy of different laboratory parameters in predicting cases with positive RT-PCR was evaluated using area under the ROC curve (AUC). Results: Two hundred cases with the mean age of 41.3± 14.6 (range: 19-78) years were studied (0.53% male). The result of RT-PCR for COVID-19 was positive in 70 (35%) cases. Patients with positive RT-PCR had significantly higher neutrophil (NEU) count (p = 0.0001), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (p = 0.04), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p = 0.0001), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (p = 0.001), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (p = 0.0001), and Urea (p = 0.001) levels in serum. In addition, patients with positive RT-PCR had lower white blood cell (WBC) count (p = 0.0001) and serum albumin level (p = 0.0001) compared to others. ALT (AUC = 0.879), CRP (AUC = 0.870), NEU (AUC = 0.858), LDH (AUC = 0.835), and Urea (AUC = 0.835) had very good accuracy in predicting cases with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19, respectively. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that level of LDH, CRP, ALT and NEU can be used to predict the result of COVID-19 test.

First, several online mental health services have been constructed across different areas, however, unified national management and coordination policies are still inadequate, which could result in uneven distribution and wastage of medical resources, let alone evaluating the efficacy of these services. Second, online mental health services are the predominant assistance measure and therefore, some people (e.g., older adults) who may have limited access to smartphones and the broadband internet, may benefit less from the services [42] . Third, frontline health professionals may have limited time and energy to access to these services due to heavy workload.

There are such cases with every infectious disease. They are also present during the flu epidemics, but they are extremely rare. This suddenly gives us another possible strategy for quarantine exit, where children and those under 50 years of age could first emerge if they do not have any underlying illnesses. Here, after this table, it already seems like we are beginning to have an increasing number of options to get out of quarantines and learn to live with this virus until the vaccine becomes available.

It is possible that among some of them COVID-19 accelerated this inevitability by a few weeks or months.

The new virus is thought to have originated from an animal-to-human spillover event linked to seafood and live-animal markets. The infection has spread locally in Wuhan and elsewhere in China, despite strict intervention measures implemented in the region where the infection originated on Jan 23, 2020. More than 500 patients infected with COVID-19 outside of mainland China have been reported between Jan 1 and Feb 14, 2020. Although laboratory testing for COVID-19 quickly ramped up in China and elsewhere, information on individual patients remains scarce and official datasets have not been made publicly available. Patient-level information is important to estimate key time-to-delay events (such as the incubation period and interval between symptom onset and visit to a hospital), analyse the age profile of infected patients, reconstruct epidemic curves by onset dates, and infer transmission parameters. We searched PubMed for publications between Jan 1, 1990, and Feb 6, 2020, using combinations of the following terms: (""coronavirus"" OR ""2019-nCoV"") AND (""line list"" OR ""case description"" OR ""patient data"") AND (""digital surveillance"" OR ""social media"" OR ""crowd-sourced data"").

We found a heavy skew of infection towards older age groups, with substantially fewer children infected. This pattern could indicate agerelated differences in susceptibility to infection, severe outcomes, or behaviour. However, a substantial portion of the patients in our database are travellers, a population that is usually predominantly adults (although does not exclude children). Furthermore, because patient data in our dataset were captured by the health system, they are biased towards the more severe spectrum of the disease, especially for patients from mainland China. Clinical reports have shown that severity of COVID-19 is associated with the presence of chronic conditions, 16, 17 which are more frequent in older age groups. Nevertheless, we would also expect children younger than 5 years to be at risk of severe outcomes and to be reported to the healthcare system, as is seen for other respiratory infections. 18 Biological differences could have a role in shaping these age profiles. A detailed analysis of one of the early COVID-19 clusters by Chan and colleagues 19 revealed symptomatic infections in five adult members of the same household, while a child in the same household aged 10 years was infected but remained asymptomatic, potentially indicating biological differences in the risk of clinical disease driven by age. Previous immunity from infection with a related coronavirus has been speculated to potentially protect children from SARS, 20, 21 and so might also have a role in COVID-19. In any case, if the age distribution of cases reported here was to be confirmed and the epidemic were to progress globally, we would expect an increase in respiratory mortality concentrated among people aged 30 years and older. This mortality pattern would be substantially different from the profile of the 2009 influenza pandemic, for which excess mortality was concentrated in those younger than 65 years. 21 In our dataset, we saw a rapid increase in the number of people infected with COVID-19 in several provinces of China, consistent with local transmission outside of Hubei province.

As a first line of treatment, along with the antiviral drugs, clinicians are using SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies targeting the S1 domain of the COVID-19 spike glycoprotein [1] . Very recently (25 January 2020) the first and complete genome sequence of COVID-19 was deposited in the NCBI (GenBank: MN908947.3) providing the key to the likely structure and glycosylation pattern of the viral proteins and consequent mode of interaction with the host cell. Similar to most other coronaviruses, the outer membrane spike glycoprotein, known for its glycosylation [3] , is the prime host interacting protein with host cell targets (such as ACE2, CD26, Ezrin, cyclophilins and other cell adhesion factors) important for cell adhesion and virulence [4, 5] . However, the specific host cell factors or proteins that facilitate the novel COVID-19 remain elusive. The current study was thus undertaken to predict the COVID-19 spike glycoprotein structure and glycan shield pattern that has great implications for understanding the viral camouflage and mode of cell entry, potentially assisting the development of new vaccines, antibodies, small-molecule drugs and screening of the human host targets.",29.364436499067892,12.573464861637415

COVID-19 is now rapidly spreading worldwide, and this letter is written as the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a global emergency on January 31st amid concerns about a growing outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. Most of the published articles on COVID-19 have highlighted lungs as the main organ involved in the disease, while few articles have reported SARS-CoV-2 involvement in other organs, including liver and kidneys, which can impair the metabolism and excretion of the medications taken to treat the disease. According to Zhang et al. the incidence of hepatic abnormalities significantly increases after infection with COVID-19 and during the course of the disease, which may indicate the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the liver or side effects of the medications used by patients (1) . Also, Xu et al. have reported steatosis and liver injury in the liver biopsy of a patient with COVID-19 (2) . In addition to liver injuries, some articles have also reported an increased incidence of acute renal injury following COVID-19, which could be due to the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the inflammation induced by the disease, or a synergistic effect of both on kidneys (3, 4) . Additionally, Cheng et al. have reported that patients with acute renal injury have a higher mortality rate compared to other patients (3) .

Medicines currently prescribed to treat COVID-19 include Oseltamivir, Lopinavir / Ritonavir, Ribavirin, and Chloroquine Phosphate or Hydroxy Chloroquine Sulfate. All of these medicines are metabolized in the liver. Most of the metabolites derived from Oseltamivir, Ribavirin and some of the metabolites of Lopinavir / Ritonavir, Chloroquine Phosphate and Hydroxy Chloroquine Sulfate are found in the urine due to renal excretion. Therefore, injury to the liver and kidneys can impair metabolism, excretion, dosing and expected concentrations of the medications, which can increase the risk of toxicity using the aforementioned medications. According to the reports, liver and kidneys can be damaged in patients with COVID-19, which may make reaching the therapeutic dose of the medicines difficult and increase the risk of adverse drug reactions in patients. As a result, frequent and careful monitoring of liver and kidney functions in patients with COVID-19 can lead to early diagnosis of liver and kidney disorders, and also help in achieving the optimal therapeutic concentrations and reducing the risk of adverse drug reactions.",28.872365692211282,11.556344425810954

Interestingly our docked model supports this despite the variability between these spike proteins' S1 domains, with the same CD26 residues in close proximity to the active region of S1 domain in COVID-19. We also observed additional residues (Q286, I287, N338, V341, R336) of CD26 predicted to interact with the S1 domain of the spike protein via van der Waals or by hydrogen bonding.

Some of these unique residues of S1 domain are also predicted interact with the ACE2 protein [6] .

Firstly, COVID-19 is a novel disease just recently recognised. The first version of a guideline for diagnosis and management of COVID-19 was announced on 16 January 2020. It took time for the medical professionals to learn about the virus and the disease in order to make correct diagnosis. Secondly, the diagnosis of COVID-19 requires two independent confirmatory laboratory tests, which should be taken at least 1 day apart. Our results showed that the lag correlation is shorter for the suspected than for laboratory-confirmed cases.

There is no valid information available on pregnant women and their complications. But given previous epidemics (SARS and MERS), as well as mental and physical changes during pregnancy (2) , pregnant women are more likely to be affected by the virus. On the other hand, the Coronavirus epidemic has created stress and anxiety for pregnant women in different parts of the world. Concern and stress in pregnancy are associated with side effects such as preeclampsia, depression, increased nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, preterm labor, low birth weight, and low APGAR score (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . In the Coronavirus pandemic, pregnant women cited the following reasons for their concerns: -Many pregnant women have had a birth plan before the pandemic, but are currently worried about how their families (mothers) will be present, given the urban and quarantine constraints; moreover, even if there is no inter-urban restriction, they may be worried about their families being infected during transportation. -Many pregnant women do not go to visit their physicians due to concerns that they may be exposed to the Coronavirus in the hospital environment or on the way to the hospital and may be post-term. Or on the contrary, due to stress and worry they want an early termination and elective cesarean section. -Many pregnant mothers are employed and constantly use sodium hypochlorite and alcohol detergents to control and prevent the virus, which can lead to poisoning. Some other pregnant mothers might become highly stressed and anxious, and overuse these detergents. Increasing mothers' awareness about the transmission of Coronavirus, risk factors, and red flags, as well as providing tele-counseling for pregnancy care and tele-triage could help reduce their anxiety and worry. It is also recommended that in cities where home birth and home services after birth are available, the medical team provide these services at home while maintaining safety.",26.110323464995776,8.964951348944657

Depending on the CFR value, the government response toward COVID-19 may vary, and estimates of CFR can also influence the strictness of policy judgement and the extent of containment and mitigation measures. For instance, a well-known CFR estimate for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong in 2003 was approximately 17% [3] , roughly indicating that one out of five diagnosed cases would die of the disease. SARS containment measures were implemented as early as possible due to high estimates of CFR. The total volume of deaths, i.e., mortality, is determined by the product of the CFR and the total number of cases; it should be remembered that our perceived severity of the COVID-19 epidemic can be directly influenced by the absolute number of deaths.",28.67091351524844,9.821374775341889

Answering this question requires accurate forecasting the spread of confirmed cases as well as analysis of the number of deaths and recoveries. Forecasting, however, requires ample historical data. At the same time, no prediction is certain as the future rarely repeats itself in the same way as the past. Moreover, forecasts are influenced by the reliability of the data, vested interests, and what variables are being predicted. Also, psychological factors play a significant role in how people perceive and react to the danger from the disease and the fear that it may affect them personally. This paper introduces an objective approach to predicting the continuation of the COVID-19 using a simple, but powerful method to do so. Assuming that the data used is reliable and that the future will continue to follow the past pattern of the disease, our forecasts suggest a continuing increase in the confirmed COVID-19 cases with sizable associated uncertainty. The risks are far from symmetric as underestimating its spread like a pandemic and not doing enough to contain it is much more severe than overspending and being over careful when it will not be needed.

Structural analysis shows that COVID-19 probably derives from a bat SARS-like coronavirus, which has mutated in the spike glycoprotein (protein S) and nucleocapsid N protein The positive-sense RNA genomes of COVID-19 is differ from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV approximately 29.9 kb, 27.9 kb and 30.1 kb, respectively [6] .

Sequence analysis revealed that COVID-19 is identity 80% more than to SARS-CoV and 50% to the MERS-CoV which originated in bat [7, 8] . In addition to that, spherical external spike protein displays a characteristic crown shape can be observed under an electron microscope [9] .

To identify the COVID-19 origin, obtaining virus sequences from immediate animal sources would be the most definite method. The first ORF (ORF1a/b) translates two polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, and encodes 16 nonstructural proteins (NSP) which takes two-thirds of viral RNA. The remaining ORFs encode structural proteins including spike (S) glycoprotein, small envelope (E) protein, matrix (M) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein. COVID-19 also possesses accessory proteins that interfere with the host innate immune response [8] .",31.69048973230921,11.767266497591544

Coronavirus disease 2019 has spread rapidly around the globe, including Asia, North America, Europe, and Africa. 1 The 2019 novel coronavirus is likely similar to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. They belong to the Betacoronavirus genus and can cause severe respiratory disease, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary oedema, and respiratory failure. 2 Tracheal intubation for invasive mechanical ventilation is the mainstay therapy to correct hypoxaemia. Preoxygenation with the standard bag-valve mask oxygenation followed by rapid-sequence intubation has been proposed in non-severely hypoxaemic critically ill patients requiring tracheal intubation to reduce the risk of aspiration and desaturation. However, a previous study reported that 23% of patients had SpO 2 <90% during intubation. 3 Thus far, more than 80000 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in China. Person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 has been described, including in many healthcare workers. 4, 5 Rapid-sequence fibreoptic bronchoscopic tracheal intubation in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia may reduce the risk of viral spread.

Early detection and treatment could help to halt the deterioration and reduce the investment of follow-up medical resources. All the cases in the study were treated in time after symptoms onset.

All the structural and accessory proteins are translated from the sgRNAs of CoVs. Four main structural proteins are encoded by ORFs 10, 11 on the one-third of the genome near the 3 0 -terminus. The genetic and phenotypic structure of COVID-19 in pathogenesis is important. This article highlights the most important of these features compared to other Betacoronaviruses.",29.71286809505078,11.289999303433978

Several abnormalities also have been observed including cellular immune deficiency, coagulation activation, myocardia injury, hepatic and kidney injury, and secondary bacterial infection. 16 In the majority of cases of severe disease and death, lymphopenia and sustained inflammation have been recorded. Notably, these observations in COVID-19 patients are similar to those who suffered from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during the 2003 epidemic. There may be a biological mechanism behind this epidemiological anomaly. 17 Several kinds of vaccines and antiviral drugs that are based on S protein have been previously evaluated. Du et al. showed vaccines can be based on the S protein include full-length S protein, viral vector, DNA, recombinant S protein and recombinant RBD protein. Considering that, in the in vitro study, antiviral therapies are design based on S protein include RBDeACE2 blockers, S cleavage inhibitors, fusion core blockers, neutralizing antibodies, protease inhibitors, S protein inhibitors, and small interfering RNAs. 18 There are some recombinant compounds such as IFN with ribaverin which has only limited effects against COVID-19 infection. 1 The receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 has a higher affinity for ACE2, while it is a lower affinity for SARS-CoV. 1, 19 Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and its homologue ACE2, belongs to the ACE family of dipeptidylcarboxy dipeptidase. However, their physiological functions are varied. On the other hand, ACE2 serves as the binding site for COVID-19. Based on this information, Gurwitz suggested using available angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1R) blockers, such as losartan, as therapeutics for reducing the severity of COVID-19 infections. 20 At present therapy is based on identifying and developing monoclonal antibodies that are specific and effective against COVID-19 combines with remdesivir as a novel nucleotide analog prodrug that was used for the treatment of the Ebola virus disease. 17, 21 To understand the rate of virus spread among people, it is crucial to figure out whether COVID-19 is mutating to improve its binding to human receptors for infection considering its high mutation rate. Any adaptation in the COVID-19 sequence that might make it more efficient at transmitting among people might also boost its virulence. 22 The COVID-19 is expected to become less virulent through human to human transmissions due to genetic bottlenecks for RNA viruses often occur during respiratory droplet transmissions. 3",26.816658690354082,10.754272215737203

In order for the virus to complete entry into the cell following this initial process, the spike protein has to be primed by an enzyme called a protease. Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) uses a protease called TMPRSS2 to complete this process. 10, 11 In order to attach virus receptor (spike protein) to its cellular ligand (ACE2), activation by TMPRSS2 as a protease is needed (Fig. 4) . 10 After the virus enters the host cell and uncoats, the genome is transcribed and then translated. Coronavirus genome replication and transcription takes place at cytoplasmic membranes and involve coordinated processes of both continuous and discontinuous RNA synthesis that are mediated by the viral replicate, a huge protein complex encoded by the 20-kb replicase gene. 12 The replicase complex is believed to be comprised of up to 16 viral subunits and a number of cellular proteins. Besides RNAdependent RNA polymerase, RNA helicase, and protease activities, which are common to RNA viruses, the coronavirus replicase was recently predicted to employ a variety of RNA processing enzymes that are not (or extremely rarely) found in other RNA viruses and include putative sequence-specific endoribonuclease, 3 0 -to-5 0 exoribonuclease, 2 0 -O-ribose methyltransferase, ADP ribose 1 0 -phosphatase and, in a subset of group 2 coronaviruses, cyclic Genotype and phenotype of COVID- 19 3 phosphodiesterase activities. 13, 14 The proteins are assembled at the cell membrane and genomic RNA is incorporated as the mature particle forms by budding from the internal cell membranes. 15",27.807345779085615,9.281867921819845

The primary site of pharmacological action is the lung, as 16 herbs to lung meridian, which indicated that the decoction is mainly specific for lung diseases. In addition, it can play the role of dehumidification through the rise and fall of the spleen and stomach, and exhibited the protection for heart, kidney and other organs. Among the potential targets screen, most of them co-expressed with ACE-2, the receptor of COVID-19, indicating the potential improvement of COVID-19. It can inhibit the replication of COVID-19 by acting on multiple ribosomal proteins. COVID-19 can lead to strong immune response and inflammatory storm [4] . Functional enrichment analysis showed that QPD could inhibit and alleviate excessive immune response and eliminate inflammation by regulating immune related pathway and cytokine action related pathway [5] .

Respiratory droplets and contact are the main routes of transmission of COVID-19 [2] . However, the fetal-oral routes may also be a potential human-to-human transmission [3, 4] . Admittedly, recent studies have reported the detection of the virus (SARS-COV-2) in feces [4] [5] [6] . SARS-COV-2 infects human cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [7] , and the expression of ACE2 in the small intestine is significantly higher than that in the lung [8] . In theory, the intestine is the target organ for SARS-COV-2 infection. In fact, diarrhea as a bowel symptom is not rare in COVID-19 patients. Although the occurrence of diarrhea is not as high as that of fever and cough, it may be the first symptom of COVID-19. Here, we summarized the occurrence of diarrhea that are currently publicly available (Table 1) . A total of 2506 COVID-19 patients were included, of which 145 had diarrhea before admission and the overall occurrence of diarrhea was 5.8% (145/2506). In our own data, the occurrence of diarrhea is 6.3% (4/64) (not yet published). Differential occurrence of diarrhea across studies may be due to different criteria for determining diarrhea. Another possible reason is that the patient's bowel movements were not listed as the focus of observation. In general, diarrhea is not a common symptom in patients with COVID-19. More attention is needed because diarrhea is a reminder that SARS-COV-2 invades the intestine. In autopsy reports of patients with COVID-19, staged narrowing and expansion of the small intestine may be a more intuitive warning [9] . Future research should focus on how long SARS-COV-2 persists in the feces of COVID-19 patients with diarrhea. This helps to better manage discharged patients and to properly dispose of the patients' feces, thereby avoiding potential sources of SARS-COV-2. Clinicians, especially digestive physicians, should pay close attention to the atypical symptoms of COVID-19 and take personal protection against the feces of patients. When discharged from home, patients with COVID-19 should pay special attention to hand hygiene and avoid sharing toilets with family members.

Efforts have been made to search for a reservoir host or intermediate carriers from which the infection may have spread to humans. Initial reports identified two species of snakes that could be a possible reservoir of the COVID-19. However, to date, there has been no consistent evidence of coronavirus reservoirs other than mammals and birds [10, 18] . Genomic sequence analysis of COVID-19 showed 88% identity with two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses [19, 20] , indicating that mammals are the most likely link between COVID-19 and humans. Several reports have suggested that person-to-person transmission is a likely route for spreading COVID-19 infection. This is supported by cases that occurred within families and among people who did not visit the wet animal market in Wuhan [13, 21] . Person-to-person transmission occurs primarily via direct contact or through droplets spread by coughing or sneezing from an infected individual. In a small study conducted on women in their third trimester who were confirmed to be infected with the coronavirus, there was no evidence that there is transmission from mother to child. However, all pregnant mothers underwent cesarean sections, so it remains unclear whether transmission can occur during vaginal birth. This is important because pregnant mothers are relatively more susceptible to infection by respiratory pathogens and severe pneumonia (https://www.thelancet.com, DOI:https://doi.org/10. 1016/S0140-6736(20)30360-3).",33.31897375853275,12.156919629176407

The COVID-19 forms a clade within the subgenus sarbecovirus [25] . Based on the genetic sequence identity and the phylogenetic reports, COVID-19 is sufficiently different from SARS-CoV and it can thus be considered as a new betacoronavirus that infects humans. The COVID-19 most likely developed from bat origin coronaviruses. Another piece of evidence that supports the COVID-19 is of bat origin is the existence of a high degree of homology of the ACE2 receptor from a diversity of animal species, thus implicating these animal species as possible intermediate hosts or animal models for COVID-19 infections [20] . Moreover, these viruses have a single intact open reading frame on gene 8, which is a further indicator of bat-origin CoVs. However, the amino acid sequence of the tentative receptor-binding domain resembles that of SARS-CoV, indicating that these viruses might use the same receptor [5] .",32.94731612244739,11.671073499161231

Furthermore, both IgG and IgM antibodies started to increase on around day 10 after symptom onset, and most patients had seroconversion within the first 3 weeks.

The first cases were reported in December 2019 [4] . From December 18, 2019 through December 29, 2019, five patients were hospitalized with acute respiratory distress syndrome and one of these patients died [5] . By January 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection, less than half of these patients had underlying diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease [6] . These patients were presumed to be infected in that hospital, likely due to nosocomial infection. It was concluded that the COVID-19 is not a super-hot spreading virus (spread by one patient to many others), but rather likely spread due to many patients getting infected at various locations throughout the hospital through unknown mechanisms. In addition, only patients that got clinically sick were tested, thus there were likely many more patients that were presumably infected. As of January 22, 2020, a total of 571 cases of the 2019-new coronavirus (COVID-19) were reported in 25 provinces (districts and cities) in China [7] . The China National Health Commission reported the details of the first 17 deaths up to January 22, 2020. On January 25, 2020, a total of 1975 cases were confirmed to be infected with the COVID-19 in mainland China with a total of 56 deaths [8] . Another report on January 24, 2020 estimated the cumulative incidence in China to be 5502 cases [9] . As of January 30, 2020, 7734 cases have been confirmed in China and 90 other cases have also been reported from a number of countries that include Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Japan, Singapore, Republic of Korea, United Arab Emirates, United States, The Philippines, India, Australia, Canada, Finland, France, and Germany.

Further, the first case of human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 was reported in the US on January 30, 2020 (https://www.cdc.gov/media/ releases/2020/p0130). The CDC has so far screened > 30,000 passengers arriving at US airports for the novel coronavirus.

Given the high attack rate [77] [78] [79] and prolonged aerosolization of this virus, [20] augmented infection control and containment training for OR, ICU and floor teams is necessary. [73, 80] Teams should seek to minimize AGPs and limit the length of these procedures whenever possible. For example, anesthesia may consider avoiding bag-mask ventilation, employing rapid sequence intubation techniques, and applying intratracheal or intravenous lidocaine to avoid postoperative coughing. [81, 82] specific multilevel risks of surgery and potential compromise in oncologic efficacy with deliveryrisks of alternative therapies in the context ofa multidisciplinary setting discussion andalong with shared patient-provider decision-making. Despite the amplified risks, surgery will still be indicated for many patients and appropriate preparation will be critical to ensure the safety of the patient, provider and all other involved HCWs. Legend AGE: aerosol-generating event; AGP: aerosol-generating procedure; TLM: transoral laser microsurgery; TORS: transoral robotic surgery *: Frequent, serial re-evaluation of patient-and surgical-risk will be required, particularly with anticipated improvements in management of patient-level risk. At the time of manuscript submission: there is known COVID-19 community spread with unknown disease prevalence; 1% of patients develop symptoms 14 days after exposure; among patients who develop symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 incubates for a median of five-days during which time viral shedding occurs; ~15% of COVID-19-positive individuals are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic throughout the course of their disease; ~20% of patients with COVID-19 will have exhibit false negative SARS-CoV-2 tests. Therefore, there is justification for a conservative assessment of patient-risk for COVID-19. Despite this judicious approach, a ""low-risk"" patient could still be COVID-19 positive, particularly if the patient is not reliable, does not report breaches in quarantine or positive symptoms, or is asymptomatic with a false-negative test. Improved COVID-19 test sensitivity and faster specimen processing, analysis and result generation may be reasonably feasible and could substantially improve management of patient-level risk. **: Surgery-and post-surgery-specific risks may diverge according to this algorithm. For example, a patient undergoing a parotidectomy with neck dissection would present medium surgery-specific risk of COVID-19 transmission to operating room personnel and low-post-surgery-specific-risk of nosocomial COVID-19 or transmission to HCWs involved in postoperative care -assuming admission to a designated, COVID-19-free unit. A patient undergoing partial glossectomy for an early-stage oral cavity cancer and neck dissection without free tissue transfer would present high-surgery-specific risk of COVID-19 transmission to operating room personnel and medium post-surgery-specific risk of nosocomial COVID-19 or transmission to HCWs involved in postoperative care.",29.210702490421966,10.96522553966889

This hypothesis has led some European countries to produce initial policies relying on decreased transmission rates during the summer months, 3 and the belief that African countries will face smaller epidemics than their European counterparts. However, no strong evidence base exists for such claims; SARS-CoV-2 might have simply arrived later to warmer countries. We used data from the COVID-19 data repository of the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering (Baltimore, MD, USA) to plot the cumulative number of cases since the diagnosis of both the first patient and the first five patients by country, both in Europe and Africa (figure). Although the first confirmed COVID-19 cases occurred later in west Africa than in Europe, once these first cases were confirmed in west Africa, the expansion in the number of confirmed COVID-19 was rapid. Of particular concern are Burkina Faso and Senegal, which saw sharp increases in the number of cases soon after the initial cases were confirmed in these countries. Cases in both countries might evolve in a similar way to what was observed in European countries with the most expansive epidemics (ie, Italy and Spain, where SARS-CoV-2 spread quickly after case number five was detected).

It is unclear how and where unsheltered people experiencing homelessness will be moved to if quarantines and lockdowns are implemented. In such a scenario, closures of shelters and other high-density communal settings (eg, drop-in centres and soup kitchens) are possible, which could increase the number of unsheltered people experiencing homelessness and reduce their access to needed services. Lockdowns and disease containment procedures might also be deleterious to the mental health of people experiencing homelessness, many of whom have fears around involuntary hospitalisation and incarceration. 11 In response to COVID-19, the State of Washington has declared a state of emergency, allowing cities to take extraordinary measures, which has included King County moving people infected with COVID-19 to housing units that were originally intended to provide housing for people experiencing homelessness. 12 As other cities follow suit, these actions might further displace people experiencing homelessness and put them at greater risk of COVID-19.

It is important to mention here that although the cerebral damage may complicate a COVID-19 infection, it appears that it is the widespread dysregulation of homeostasis caused by pulmonary, renal, cardiac, and circulatory damage that proves fatal in COIVD-19 patients. With that being said, a dominant cerebral involvement alone with the potential of causing cerebral edema in COVID-19 can take a lead in causing death long before systemic homeostatic dysregulation sets in. Access of the COVID-19 virus to the brain via the transcribrial route, as described previously for other CNS targeting pathogens, 7 could have been the case in a recently reported patient with hyposmia and the cases of acute respiratory failure in COVID-19, 5 which needs to be further elucidated by isolating the SARS-CoV-2 virus from the zones that are in proximity to the olfactory bulb. It is expected that the differences in the sequence of spike proteins between COVID-19 virus and SARS-CoV ( Figure 2A ) will enable scientists to identify epitopes in COVID-19 virus for the development of monoclonal antibodies against this virus. With the recent COVID-19 outbreak, there is an urgent need to understand the neurotropic potential of the COVID-19 virus in order to prioritize and individualize the treatment protocols based on the severity of the disease and predominant organ involvement.

To limit the virus spread, those in the USA are canceling both smaller (∼100 people) and large meetings, researchers are limiting their travel both overseas and within the country, and student college and graduate school visit weekends are being postponed or stopped altogether. Still, there is much uncertainty about how to proceed and what other measures should be taken. Since the outbreak began in China, Chinese scientists have already faced many of the questions that those of us in other locations are now asking. We therefore asked several Chinese scientists to discuss the strategies that they are pursuing to limit the impact of the virus both on their research and on society. Some of the actions taken by the scientists and the government under this extreme situation may have a long-term influence and shift our future research and funding paradigm. We anticipate that their perspectives will be valuable to the community. global lifethreatening concern in recent days. The war against COVID-19 there has now reached the most critical moment, as confirmed COVID-19 cases have peaked for several days, and almost all the people in Wuhan City have been screened for suspected case identification (as of late February). We cannot imagine how people there are sacrificing to control the spread of COVID-19. As alumni of Wuhan University that is located in the center of Wuhan city, we became deeply saddened and worried as we watched the entire city cope with an unprecedented emergency situation. We wanted to provide a glimpse of what chemical biologists have been working on, from the perspective of scientists in China. In the past 40 days, we have heard more stories of hope and resilience than of worry and grief in China, where 1.4 billion people are doing their best to bring this serious outbreak under control. Right now, the epidemic situation outside Hubei is gradually improving, and the situation inside Hubei has shown signs of stabilization. It is noteworthy that although it is mandated that most people have to stay at home as a quarantine procedure, scientists in China have been increasingly devoted to combating COVID-19, with several clinical trials currently underway. As for scientists throughout the world, researchers in China are making extraordinary efforts toward rapid advancement of diagnostic and treatment approaches, and are doing so under highly challenging personal circumstances with extensive restrictions on not only travel, but day-to-day activities. As mentioned by WHO officers, Chinese scientists have been extremely professional in the face of this epidemic and have made their findings rapidly available to researchers around the world to coordinate global efforts to characterize, treat, and mitigate the spread of COVID-19. One team led by Yongzhen Zhang from Fudan University completed the deep sequencing of COVID-19 and made its whole genome sequence publicly available on January 10, 2020. 1 Medical experts, virologists, structural biologists, and medicinal chemists have made significant contributions in areas such as epidemic prevention and control, patient treatment, virus classification and traceability, structure analysis, and clinical drug development. The current progress relied on the rapid development of science and technology, as well as the dedication of scientific researchers. During the epidemic, almost all industries not related to any antiepidemic efforts were halted due to the lock down of transportation and lack of manpower. It has been extremely difficult to complete highlevel scientific research under such an extreme situation.",30.55094007144413,11.486482231532678

The APhA has also recently issued a tool --Preparedness and Prevention Guidance during Coronavirus Pandemic --to help pharmacists be prepared. 3 For preparing clinicians to respond to health threats and emergencies related to disease outbreaks and disasters, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) Clinician Outreach and Communication Activity (COCA) is a vital information source. 3 In addition, many reference documents are now being made available to pharmacists so they can have access to the latest updates regarding COVID-19 management. The American Society of Hospital Pharmacists (ASHP) has recently initiated a comprehensive online resource that includes most of the COVID-19-related pharmacy information and free, 60-day open access to ASHP drug information. 4 It should be noted that pharmacists should regularly review these pharmaceutical recommendations because changes are expected as information about the virus accumulates. Below are directions to some of these online resources: patients, they need to pay attention to protecting themselves. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that healthcare staff wear appropriate eye protection, surgical masks, long-sleeved gowns and gloves when entering a room containing suspected or confirmed COVID-19-infected individuals. WHO has also recommended using a particulate respirator that is at least as protective as a US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health-certified N95 when performing aerosol-generating procedures such as tracheal intubation, non-invasive ventilation, tracheostomy, cardiopulmonary resuscitation or manual ventilation before intubation or bronchoscopy). 5 However, self-isolation of pharmacists who have been in contact with suspected COVID-19 individuals are not obliged to wear these unless otherwise ordered by health protection professionals. 6",30.87637045206504,10.384337379313079

Together with our social, occupational, and personal life, the new corona virus poses novel challenges for all physicians, including dermatologists. Despite the virus not being dermatotropic, several skin conditions have emerged, mainly as a result of prolonged contact to personal protective equipment and excessive personal hygiene. Pressure injury, contact dermatitis, itch, pressure urticaria, and exacerbation of pre-existing skin diseases, including seborrheic dermatitis and acne, have been described. We have focused on the dermatologic aspects of COVID-19 infection, so that dermatologist may be aware of the skin complications and the preventive measures to be taken in the COVID-19 pandemic.

Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 5 Because diseases with epidermal barrier interruption could enhance the virus acquisition through indirect contact (5), dermatology patients might be at an increased risk for developing the infection. This suggests that dermatology departments and private offices should develop appropriate preventative measures. (5). Use of a sanitary mask itself may not be sufficient protection from the virus transmission, so that goggles should be used to decrease the risk of conjunctival contamination. COVID-19 has a relatively low-resistance to disinfectants. As a result, a variety of regimens have been proven effective, ranging from 75% ethanol, peracetic acid, chlorine, and UV disinfection to a hot water bath at 56°C(132.8°F) for 30 minutes (4).",27.42183952876146,8.119163966892911

The SARS-CoV-2 virus shares 79.5% of the genetic sequence of SARS and has 96.2% homology to bat coronavirus. 4 The intermediate animal vector between bats and humans for SARS-CoV-2 is currently unknown but has been linked epidemiologically to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. 5 Although initially a zoonotic virus, SARS-CoV-2 is now spread human-to-human with higher infectivity than MERS and SARS but a lower fatality rate. 3 The clinical presentation of COVID-19 can range from mild non-specific respiratory symptoms to severe organ dysfunction such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that can lead to death. 1,6,7 Most cases of COVID-19 appear to be mild with the most common symptoms being fever (83-98%), cough (46-82%), myalgia/fatigue (11-44%) , and shortness of breath (31%). 7 Risk factors for more severe illness requiring hospitalization appear to be older age and having underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, lung disease and cardiovascular disease. 7 Early reports suggest that for more severe cases the median time from first symptom onset to the development of shortness of breath and/or need for hospitalization ranged from 5 to 8 days. 6-8 Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, it is reported that 5 to 26.1% have required admission to the intensive care unit. 6, 8 The reported fatality rate for hospitalized COVID-19 patients has ranged from 1.4 to 15%. [6] [7] [8] The incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 appears to average 5.2 days but may range from 2 to 14 days and potential asymptomatic infection has been reported. 7, 9 Of note for gastroenterologists, patients may complain of gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea or diarrhea. 7 In the prior SARS coronavirus outbreak, diarrhea was reported in up to 25% of patients. 11 Interestingly, the cell entry receptor ACE2 appears to mediate entry of SARS-CoV-2 (similar to SARS) and has been demonstrated to be highly expressed in small intestinal enterocytes. 11 ACE2 is important in controlling intestinal inflammation and its disruption may lead to diarrhea. 11 The reported frequency of diarrhea among COVID-19 patients has varied from 2 to 33% and was one of the prominent symptoms reported by the first case in the United States. 11,12 SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the stool of COVID-19 patients. 12, 13 So while COVID-19 appears to primarily spread through respiratory droplets and secretions, the gastrointestinal tract may be another potential route of infection, highlighting importance of personal protective equipment during endoscopy. Further, some of the more common laboratory findings described in COVID-19 patients include liver function test abnormalities. In addition to leukopenia (reported in 9-25% of cases) or leukocytosis (24-30%), elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase have been seen in up to 37% of cases. [7] [8] [9] More recent descriptions of patients in China also noted around 10% of patients were also noted to have elevated total bilirubin levels. 8 Gastroenterologists should be aware of these potential gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19.",26.93460403579124,11.311758603097765

Both cause major infection-related morbidity and mortality around the world. Tuberculosis was the leading cause of mortality from an infectious disease worldwide in 2018, causing 1·2 million deaths. 1 COVID-19 has infected more than 300 000 people and caused over 13 000 deaths in the first quarter of 2020 alone. 2 Both COVID-19 and tuberculosis can present with respiratory symptoms, and diagnosis and treatment of people with tuberculosis, or tuberculosis and COVID-19 co-infection, are likely to be compromised during the COVID-19 pandemic. Older people and those with comorbidities are at increased risk of severe disease and adverse outcomes in both diseases. 3, 4 And, as we are discovering for COVID-19, both diseases have considerable social impact-including stigma, discrimination, and isolation-in addition to the economic impact from country productivity losses and catastrophic costs to individuals and households. 5 There are also stark differences. While tuberculosis is a slow pandemic and has accompanied humankind for millennia, 6 the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19 is new and spreading rapidly around the world. Tuberculosis has been labelled a pandemic many times over the past three centuries, whereas this is the first COVID-19 pandemic. Children are less severely affected by COVID-19, whereas 1·1 million children had tuberculosis disease in 2018, of whom 200 000 died. 1 The vast majority of cases and deaths from tuberculosis occur in low-income and middle-income countries, whereas high-income countries have low rates. 1 By contrast, Europe became the second epicentre of COVID-19 after China, which might explain, in part, why COVID-19 can be expected to mobilise more global resources and person-power in a year than tuberculosis has in decades. However, underprepared and vulnerable countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Central and South America might soon see substantial rises in COVID-19 cases and deaths, and concerted, collective action must be taken now to avoid catastrophe. 7 There are many unknowns. The clinical and epidemiological interactions of COVID-19 with tuberculosis (with or without HIV) are likely to be highly complex. Simply put, tuberculosis transmission might rise because of increased respiratory symptoms associated with COVID-19, or decline owing to COVID-19-related self-isolation and quarantine. There is increasing recognition of the millions of people treated for tuberculosis who have residual, long-term lung damage 8 who are likely to be at a higher risk of severe disease and death from COVID-19. Because of extreme pressures on health systems, exacerbated by COVID-19, people with tuberculosis are likely to face decreased access to diagnostic and treatment services, which might also result in adverse outcomes.",34.431722556895224,11.877484520148409

Rapid detection tools such as FilmArrayTM Respiratory Panel can aid in early diagnosis of causative pathogens. As demonstrated in this report, the development of mild COVID-19 illness was insidiously initiated and persisted for a long period. The prolonged duration of SARS-CoV-2 detection in naso-oropharyngeal specimens of the COVID-19 patients with mild illness is of concern in epidemic areas. Clinical manifestations of viral respiratory infections range from asymptomatic or flu-like symptoms such as fever, nonproductive or productive cough, myalgia, rhinorrhea, and sore throat, to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or multiple organs failure. 10 Various viral pathogens cause community-acquired infections during the cold season in Taiwan. Of which, influenza A/B, human Metapneumovirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus 1/2/3, coronavirus 229E/NL63/OC43, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus, are the most common. 11 The lack of specificity for clinical symptoms, laboratory data, and chest 13, 14 is the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from COVID-19 patients who were asymptomatic or presented flu-like symptoms. 15, 16 Under this circumstances, quarantine and active surveillance of suspected patients and the application of rapid detection tools for etiology confirmation is strongly recommended.

First, collectively, Africa needs a unified continent-wide strategy for preparedness and response. The strategy must be comprehensive, and member states, donors, and partners should immediately commit to releasing financial resources to support country-customised implementation plans derived from the strategy. To help develop a common strategy that will allow for effective coordination, collaboration, and communication, the African Union Commission, Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), and WHO, in partnership with African countries, have established the Africa Taskforce for Coronavirus Preparedness and Response (AFTCOR). The partnership has six work streams: laboratory diagnosis and subtyping; surveillance, including screening at points of entry and cross-border activities; infection prevention and control in healthcare facilities; clinical management of people with severe COVID-19; risk communication; and supply-chain management and stockpiles. Because mitigating the potential spread of COVID-19 in Africa will require rapid detection and containment, the laboratory work streams of AFTCOR, Africa CDC, and WHO are working closely to expeditiously scale up diagnostic testing capacity linked to enhanced surveillance and monitoring-eg, at the beginning of February, only two countries in Africa had the diagnostic capacity to test for COVID-19. However, as of Feb 25, 2020, more than 40 countries would have been capacitated to accurately diagnose COVID-19 infection, thanks to the coordination efforts of AFTCOR. 6 As testing becomes more available, it is possible that more cases might be detected. Second, any effective preparedness and response strategy for COVID-19 requires a committed political will; as such, the African Union Commission, Africa CDC, and WHO convened, on Feb 22, 2020, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, an emergency meeting of all ministers of health of 55 member states to commit to acting fast and collectively to develop and implement a coordinated continent-wide strategy. AFTCOR taskforce was formed, and a continent-wide strategy was endorsed at the end of the emergency meeting, with a call for strong coordination of efforts. To prevent the occurrence of a social, health security, and economic tragedy, actions agreed at the emergency ministerial meeting will need to be acted on quickly, before any additional COVID-19 cases are introduced to the continent, and result in sustained human-tohuman transmission. The potential social, economic, and security devastation that COVID-19 could cause in Africa should be enough of an incentive for African governments to invest immediately in preparedness for the worst-case scenario. Third, commitment and release of financial resources from partners and donors before a crisis hits Africa will help anticipate demand and address supply chain management, mapping, and stockpiling of COVID-19 response needs, such as large quantities of personal protective equipment, gloves, surgical masks, coveralls, and hoods, and medical countermeasures like antiviral agents. Supplies of these items will be limited in Africa because of reduced manufacturing capacity.",29.313248114092172,9.669721354252156

There was no mention about the death rate among pregnant women with COVID-19, however, the case fatality rate among MERS-pregnant patients was about 35% and was not statistically different when compared to the overall MERS case fatality rate [7] . In the MERS cases, 40% had C-section and this is much lower than 100% C-section rate in the case of COVID-19. This difference may reflect a variance in the practices between different countries. Another difference is the high fetal demise rate of 30% among pregnant women with MERS compared to 0% among COVID-19. The fetal demise rate among 12 pregnant women with SARS was 25% [8] .

The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 as public health emergency after it spread outside China to numerous countries. Thus, an assessment of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with novel approaches is essential to the global debate. This study is the first to develop both time series and panel data models to construct conceptual tools that examine the nexus between death from COVID-19 and confirmed cases. We collected daily data on four health indicators namely deaths, confirmed cases, suspected cases, and recovered cases across 31 Provinces/States in China. Due to the complexities of the COVID-19, we investigated the unobserved factors including environmental exposures accounting for the disease spread through human-to-human transmission. We used estimation methods capable of controlling for cross-sectional dependence, endogeneity, and unobserved heterogeneity. We predict the impulse-response between confirmed cases of COVID-19 and COVID-19-attributable deaths. Our study reveals that the effect of confirmed cases on the novel coronavirus attributable deaths is heterogeneous across Provinces/States in China. We find a linear relationship between COVID-19 attributable deaths and confirmed cases whereas a nonlinear relationship is confirmed for the nexus between recovery cases and confirmed cases. The empirical evidence reveals that an increase in confirmed cases by 1% increases coronavirus attributable deaths by~0.10%-~1.71% (95% CI).

The outbreak has already caused global alarm. On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization It has been revealed that SARS-CoV-2 has a genome sequence that is 75%-80% identical to that of SARS-CoV, and has more similarities to several bat coronaviruses [6] . SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh reported human-infecting member of the family Coronaviridae, which also includes SARS-CoV and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV. It has been identified as the causative agent of COVID-19. Both the clinical and the epidemiological features of COVID-19 patients demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to intensive care unit (ICU) admission and high mortality. About 16%-21% of people with the virus in China have become severely ill, with a 2%-3% mortality rate [1, 4] . However, there is no specific treatment against the new virus. Therefore, it is urgently necessary to identify effective antiviral agents to combat the disease and explore the clinical effect of antiviral drugs.",27.39929499150347,9.821216363433608

According to a survey of 2216 GI doctors from all over China early in the outbreak of COVID-19, the awareness of digestive system damage and involvement in COVID-19 was low, ranging from 31% to 35% [3] . To counteract this, the CSG rapidly organized a group of experts including gastroenterologists working in the forefront of COVID-19 patient care to discuss and reach a consensus on management of digestive disorders involved in COVID-19 (Table 1 ) [4] .This consensus includes recommendations regarding transmission route, clinical manifestation spectrum of digestive system involvement, practical guidelines on treatment based on the latest publications, and precautions regarding endoscopic procedure. In addition, cautions for GI outpatient clinic have been proposed [4] . The CSG is comprised of 25 committees of sub-specialty depending on the disease spectrum. As a response to the increasing concern and inquiry about COVID-19 risk from the community of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in China, the Chinese IBD Committee affiliated to CSG has issued timely recommendations for managing IBD patients in early February 2020, which is probably the first guideline regarding IBD and COVID-19 in the global community [5] . The guideline includes practical recommendations regarding immunosuppressive agent and biologics use, diet, Epidemics and public health crises pose great challenges to health care delivery.

Although rigorous attempts were made to confine the disease, this infection has continued to spread throughout the world. At the date of this publication, there are confirmed COVID-19 cases in 162 countries worldwide with growing concern that the infection will quickly reach pandemic proportions. As per Bruce Aylward, head of a World Health Organization (WHO) expert mission to China, the world is ""simply not ready"" to contain this outbreak. 4 China's extraordinary measure of instituting a quarantine in Wuhan and surrounding areas afforded the world a few months of lead time to prepare. However, according to the Dr. Tom Frieden who is the former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a coronavirus pandemic is inevitable. 5 The number of confirmed cases and patient deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have already exceeded those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS). 6 Healthcare systems worldwide should be prepared for an unusually high volume of patients in the next few months. This will include patients with COVID-19 in addition to patients requiring emergent care for other illnesses. Rapid diagnosis is essential for efficient patient triage. The RT-PCR test kits disseminated by the CDC are considered the gold of standard for COVID-19 diagnosis 7 , but several studies have shown that a negative initial PCR does not exclude COVID-19 infection 8, 9 . Additionally, it may take up to 48 hours to receive the final results, which limits the utility of this diagnostic test during initial triage of these patients in the emergency setting. In a recent study published in Radiology, based on a retrospective study of 1014 patients, the diagnostic sensitivity of chest CT for COVID-19 is significantly greater than that of RT-PCR (98% vs 59%), but the specificity is limited (25%) 7 . Proposed explanations for the decreased sensitivity of RT-PCR include low viral load, immature development of RT-PCR technology, and suboptimal clinical sampling. This study concluded that chest CT can be used as a screening tool for COVID-19 in cases with a high pretest probability, as evidenced by patients demonstrating clinical manifestations compatible with COVID-19 infection. Therefore, it is expected that there will be a significant interest in increasing in the number of imaging studies ordered for suspected cases of COVID-19 from both Emergency Medicine Department and Inpatient services. Given the low specificity of CT for diagnosing COVID-19, the American College of Radiology (ACR) does not recommend the use of CT for screening or as a first-line test for diagnosing COVID-19. 10",29.65109974290229,10.102525802834371

Given the propensity of these emerging infections to rapidly cause severe respiratory failure in many patients and, in the case of COVID-19, the high transmission rate of the virus and unclear overall case-fatality rate, the critical care response should be part of a larger pandemic plan to reduce transmission and prevent deaths. These preparations for the COVID-19 outbreak should involve the provision of ECMO in sufficiently resourced settings. Careful patient selection for ECMO is needed because patient age and comorbidities appear to influence outcomes in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Moreover, several variables, such as reversibility of the pulmonary disease process, risk of secondary pulmonary infections, and the role of antiviral drugs and other disease-modifying factors, might affect outcomes with ECMO.

Some studies suggest a high rate of AKI events upon COVID-19 infection, whereas a recent study from Wuhan, China, reported that AKI happened in <5% of the hospitalized patients with this viral infection. 11 As more studies are underway, it is prudent that during an active COVID-19 we ensure the mitigation of PEW risk and immediate correction of PEW in all patients with kidney diseases including transplant recipients.

In such cases, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be considered as a rescue therapy. In a study of ECMO for ARDS in patients with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a similar coronavirus disease emerged in 2012, a significant decrease of inhospital mortality rate and length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay was found in patients treated with ECMO compared to those managed with conventional therapy [1] . However, with COVID-19, concerns have been raised about high mortality rate observed in an early report which included data on ECMO in infected patients [2] . It has been suggested that the compounded immunologic insult by both infection and extracorporeal circuit may counterbalance or even offset survival benefits [2] .

The challenge is even greater in patients with diabetic and hypertensive kidney disorders or proteinuric patients, since many of them have received ACE inhibitors or ARB agents. Additionally, emerging data suggest that derivatives of the antimalarial agent quinine such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may help against COVID-19 infection; some of these drugs are actively used in infected dialysis patients. 1 While clinical trials are underway to test these and other agents and related hypotheses, an important question for the nutrition community is whether there are certain nutrients and food patterns that can prevent the viral infection or mitigate its severity.

[3] Since 2002 there have been two other global outbreaks of highly-pathogenic coronaviruses: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). While SARS and MERS are not identical to SARS-CoV-2 in their genetic structures or clinical manifestations, the recent outbreaks of these viruses may provide insights on the effects of COVID-19 in the context of pregnancy. The literature on SARS and MERS in pregnancy are limited to a handful of case reports and series. [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] Many of these cases involved severe morbidity including the need for intensive care and cardiorespiratory support. Notably, there were cases of maternal mortality associated with SARS and MERS infection. The only published case-control study showed that pregnant women with SARS experienced worse outcomes than nonpregnant women of similar age. [10] Reports varied with respect to the effects of SARS and MERS on pregnancy outcomes. Spontaneous abortion has been reported among women infected with SARS and MERS in the first trimester.4 As well, stillbirth, intrauterine growth restriction, and preterm birth have been reported in pregnancies affected by SARS and MERS in the second and third trimesters. [4, 9] It is important to note, however, that a number of pregnancies had good outcomes despite maternal infection with SARS or MERS. [6, 7, 8] Broadly speaking, and drawing upon our knowledge of other respiratory illnesses in pregnancy, adverse It remains to be seen whether the effects of COVID-19 on pregnant women and their fetuses will be similar to those of SARS and MERS. To date, the reported case-fatality rate for the general population infected with COVID-19 is lower than that of either SARS or MERS (estimated at 1%-2% vs. 9%-10% and 35%-40%, respectively). Similarly, by now, there have been over 60 cases of pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 in China and the vast majority of these women have had mild to moderate pneumonia. [11, 12, 13, 14] To date here has been one case of severe maternal morbidity secondary to COVID-19 reported. [12] This 31-year-old woman was infected at 34 weeks gestation and went on to experience severe respiratory compromise and multi-organ dysfunction requiring extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The pregnancy outcomes of the reported cases have been largely good, [11, 12, 13] with spontaneous and iatrogenic preterm labour being the most commonly reported adverse pregnancy outcomes. One stillbirth has been reported and this occurred in the case of severe maternal illness reported by Liu et al. [12] Given the limited data, it is too early to determine if higher rates of adverse outcomes are expected in pregnant women infected with COVID-19. As with SARS and MERS, pregnancy outcomes are likely to be strongly correlated with degree of maternal illness. [12] There has been no evidence of vertical (mother-to-infant) transmission found in any cases of SARS, MERS, or COVID-19. Additionally, analyses of amniotic fluid, serum, placenta, and breastmilk from pregnant women confirmed to have SARS or COVID-19 infection have found no detectable viral RNA, [8, 13] further supporting that vertical transmission is unlikely. Importantly, maternal infection with SARS, MERS, or COVID-19 has not been associated with teratogenicity. However, because of the small number of reported cases of infection during the first trimester (when embryogenesis occurs), risk of congenital anomaly associated with COVID-19 cannot be completely excluded.",24.634657009080726,7.814072169634191

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) and SARS-CoV-2, which have been responsible for the SARS epidemic in 2002 to 2004 and for the more recent coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic, respectively, interface with the RAAS through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an enzyme that physiologically counters RAAS activation but also functions as a receptor for both SARS viruses. 1, 2 The interaction between the SARS viruses and ACE2 has been proposed as a potential factor in their infectivity, 3, 4 and there are concerns about the use of RAAS inhibitors that may alter ACE2 and whether variation in ACE2 expression may be in part responsible for disease virulence in the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. [5] [6] [7] [8] Indeed, some media sources and health systems have recently called for the discontinuation of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), both prophylactically and in the context of suspected Covid-19. Given the common use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs worldwide, guidance on the use of these drugs in patients with Covid-19 is urgently needed. Here, we highlight that the data in humans are too limited to support or refute these hypotheses and concerns. Specifically, we discuss the uncertain effects of RAAS blockers on ACE2 levels and activity in humans, and we propose an alternative hypothesis that ACE2 may be beneficial rather than harmful in patients with lung injury. We also explicitly raise the concern that withdrawal of RAAS inhibitors may be harmful in certain high-risk patients with known or suspected Covid-19.",27.970265254966908,10.345139470157395

One study showed that patients infected with COVID-19 who had underlying hypertension had increased odds of death (OR 3.05 [95% CI 1.57-5.92, p b .001]) compared to those without hypertension. Similarly, coronary artery disease was associated with increased odds (OR 21.4 [95% CI 4.64-98.7, p b .0001]) of death [40] .

When analyzing the largest case series to date (44,672 confirmed COVID-19 cases), the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that patients with cardiovascular disease had a case fatality rate of 10.5% and those with hypertension had a case fatality rate of 6%, both of which were higher than the overall case fatality rate of 2.3% [39] (Fig. 2) .

Patients with cardiovascular disease made up 4.2% of the COVID-19 cases, but were responsible for 18.3% of the COVID-19 deaths ( [42] , Fig. 2 ). This may be due to the fact that patients with history of coronary artery disease or acute coronary syndromes may have reduced or impaired cardiovascular functional reserve, and the COVID-19 infection may either precipitate a myocardial infarction (type 1 myocardial infarction), increase myocardial demand leading to worsening ischemia and necrosis (type 2 myocardial infarction), or increase metabolic demand that leads to heart failure and death [43] .",27.29249529717847,9.106240279196147

On the basis of this study, firstly we provided the proportion of severe versus common cases of the COVID-19 infection, which was approximately 1:4, the ratio of severe to mild, non-pneumonia and asymptomatic cases were 18%, 73%, 4% and 5% respectively, the changes and prognosis of those four categories should be future observed in hospitals. 13 asymptomatic cases were the close contacts who were found by medical observation in this study. If not insulated for medical observation, they would not seek health care or visit hospital and cannot be found in the special period, and will spread to the other close contacts.

Early detection, diagnosis, treatment, and quarantine and isolation strategies of patients with COVID-19 can significantly prevent and control the transmission of the virus. By appropriately identifying the infected individuals and minimizing the transmission of the virus in the community, it is possible to effectively control the spread of infection. The early clinical symptoms of COVID-19 lack specificity, and its etiology is difficult to identify through computed tomography scans. Therefore, the handbook guide [1] suggests that the gold standard of diagnosing COVID-19 is real-time fluorescence-based real-time isolation rooms and install air purification systems. Therefore, our hospital designed and set up a special room under negative pressure for nasopharyngeal swab sampling, with an air change rate of 12 times per hour. To prevent close contact between suspected cases and the sampling collector, a transparent acrylic board with two openings for sampling was set up to separate the two areas for them ( Figure 1 ).

The COVID-19 epidemic is unique because of its scale, the speed of its spread, the lack of pre-existing scientific data and the importance of media coverage. 1 It impelled the hospitals taking charge of the cases to face the many new challenges associated with the outbreak. 2 However, the resilience of health systems in response to COVID-19 is under question, including in high-income countries. 3, 4 Health system resilience can be defined as the capacity of health actors, institutions, and populations to prepare for and effectively respond to crises; maintain core functions when a crisis hits; and, informed by lessons learned during the crisis, reorganise if conditions require it. 5 Bichat-Claude Bernard hospital is a 1000-bed University hospital in Paris belonging to the Assistance Publique -Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP), the largest hospital system in Europe employing more than 90,000 people in 39 hospitals. The hospital is one of the reference centres in France for patients with suspected or confirmed emerging infectious diseases, such as patients with Ebola or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Bichat hospital managed the first three COVID-19 cases in Europe diagnosed on January 24 , 2020 6 and has managed more than 400 COVID-19 patients since. On March 31, 2020 more than 280 patients with COVID-19 are hospitalized in the hospital including 65 in Intensive Care Units (ICU). In order to provide data on health systems resilience during COVID-19, we describe, at the hospital level, the key elements of the response to COVID-19 including the challenges and issues to anticipate following the experience of our centre (Table 1) .",29.172123293021464,11.351319094477793

Considering the speed of transmission of COVID-19, individuals from vulnerable health systems are at particular risk. An example is the Eastern European countries that in recent years faced health system vulnerabilities due to post-communism delayed reforms, corruption, and the emigration of physicians [3] . Romania is a concerning example of a vulnerable health system [3] with the highest governmental instability within the EU [4] , the leadership of the Romanian Ministry of Health changed 25 times in 27 years, a turnover three times higher than in other EU countries [4] . In its recent history, Romania experienced a series of economic crises (in the 1990s, and in late 2000s) which forced an estimated~5 million people to emigrate, including in countries where currently COVID-19 was identified (especially in Italy, Spain, Germany and United Kingdom). Many of these migrants regularly travel back to Romania which increases the likelihood for COVID-19 to spread [1] to Romania. Rising public awareness among migrant travelers and providing hygiene products is highly suggested to limit the spread of COVID-19. After the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Romanian Ministry of Health released late January a set of recommendations and proceeded to the acquisition of medical equipment with the purpose of initial identification of travelers that show COVID-19 symptoms [5] . As the Romanian government collapsed on February 5th, 2020, public auctions were suspended and the confusion among population is very high combined with the political instability. As this unstable situation continues how will Romania cope with the spread of the COVID-19 by incoming travelers? Romania has 14 international (out of 16) airports that are highly connected with airports across all EU (in 2019, over 23 million passengers used these airports), including from countries where COVID-19 was already identified in the EU. The vulnerability is even higher considering the high potential of false-negative rate of diagnostic of COVID-19 that already has been documented [6] and the lack of personnel. As such, public awareness, widespread public health measures, and close collaboration with countries from which incoming travelers are arriving in Romania is a key to limit the spread of COVID-19 and promote the wellbeing of travelers and the members of the community (resident or diaspora).",30.46013480314281,11.052771580577227

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is undermining this sense of security because it is proving both highly transmissible (like H1N1) and not too deadly (unlike Ebola). The result is a relatively easily transmitted virus with a case fatality rate currently estimated as well above that of the seasonal influenza. With its high transmissibility and rapid global circulation, COVID-19 is being compared with the deadly Spanish flu outbreak of 1918. 1 On 30 January, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern. Since erupting in China, it has claimed thousands of lives there, and has now spread globally, causing infections, death and growing alarm. The WHO's initial focus was on managing droplet and contact transmission, but it has since recognized the role fomites play as well. 2 Fomites are important because while populations generally protect themselves from clearly observable droplet transmissions (coughing, sneezing), being invisible, fomite transmission is regularly overlooked both in hospitals and communities. 3e5 Consequently, during the community saturation phase, fomite transmission may play a larger role than droplet transmission as a mechanism in emergent infectious diseases. 3e6 In this paper we argue that by implementing enhanced Traffic Control Bundling (eTCB), 6 an extension of the TCB deployed by Taiwan during the 2003 SARS outbreak, countries can interrupt the community-hospital-community transmission cycle, thereby limiting COVID-19's impact.",29.77149138386082,10.32383407093347

As of 00:00 on March 6, 2020, approximately 98,332 persons have been infected across the world(NHC, 2020), the figure that has already far exceeded the numbers for SARS in 2003 and MERS in 2012 (Huang et al., 2020; Wong et al., 2015) . Moreover, other than a certain degree of progress in the control and prevention of the epidemic in China, the situations in other countries have deteriorated. Without proper protective measures, COVID-19 may be transmitted through airborne droplets from coughing and sneezing, as well as close contact. Furthermore, air transmission and feces-mouth transmission have not yet been verified, though there are signs that such transmission means are possible (WHO, 2020). As people gain more knowledge about the disease, the prognosis for the majority of patients infected by COVID-19 has been relatively promising, but the prognosis for a small number of patients in critical conditions, especially seniors and patients with chronic diseases, are less optimal (Zhu et al.,2020) . The enclosed management model employed at most psychiatric hospitals represents a daunting challenge for effective control of infectious disease and thwarting outbreaks within institutions. The Fourth People's Hospital of Chengdu is the ninth most influential hospital in terms of scientific research and one of the largest psychiatric medical care centres in southwest China. We propose the following suggestions and strategies for psychiatric hospitals during the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic. At present, COVID-19 symptoms mainly include fever, dry cough, and fatigue, but some infected patients may not show any symptoms. Therefore, preliminary screening, pre-examination and triage, and fever clinic management at psychiatric hospitals are particularly crucial. Medical care staff should earnestly document patient information such as name, gender, age, job, home address details and phone number. In case of possible violent behaviors exhibited by psychiatric patients, security personnel should be garrisoned at clinic zones to maintain order. All staff at the clinic should be equipped with the appropriate protective equipment. Signs should be posted to remind patients to protect their respiratory system and frequently wash hands. During the epidemic period, patients who match critical psychiatric illness standards and who are considered as potential carriers of COVID-19 shall be kept within the infection quarantine ward to receive treatment according to potential virus carrier protocol. For patients who match critical psychiatric illness standards but are not considered as potential carriers of COVID-19, they should be kept within the psychiatric transition and observation ward for 14 days, as per clinic and emergency room protocol, before being transferred to a regular ward when relevant conditions are met.",25.43131914263487,8.187251052100779

It can be effective but might require intensive public health effort and cooperation to effectively reach and monitor all contacts. Previous work has shown that when the pathogen has infectiousness before symptom onset, control of outbreaks using contact tracing and isolation is more challenging. Further introduction of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to new territories is likely in the coming days and weeks, and interventions to prevent an outbreak following these introductions are a key mitigating strategy. Current planning is focused on tracing of contacts of introduced cases, and rapid isolation. These methods have been used previously for other novel outbreaks, but it is not clear if they will be effective for COVID-19.Added value of this studyWe use a mathematical model to assess the feasibility of contact tracing and case isolation to control outbreaks of COVID-19. We used disease transmission characteristics specific to the pathogen and give the best available evidence if contact tracing and isolation can achieve control of outbreaks. We simulated new outbreaks starting from 5, 20, or 40 introduced cases. Contact tracing and isolation might not contain outbreaks of COVID-19 unless very high levels of contact tracing are achieved. Even in this case, if there is subclinical transmission, or a high fraction of transmission before onset of symptoms, this strategy might not achieve control within 3 months.Implications of all the available evidenceThe effectiveness of isolation of cases and contacts to control outbreaks of COVID-19 depends on the precise characteristics of transmission, which remain unclear at the present time. Using the current best understanding, around 80% of symptomatic contacts must be traced and isolated to control over 80% of outbreaks in the model.

As our mathematical model is based on the latest and large scale real-time data and it should provide an additional advantage over the other modelling studies for COVID-19. Secondly, our model was not based solely on mobility data and a large proportion of that data was from the phase of the pandemic when countries had already taken measures and travel bans were in place. The only limitation of our model is that we did not consider the worldwide temperature differences and seasonality of coronavirus transmission. If 2019-nCoV, similar to influenza, has strong seasonality in its transmission, our epidemic forecast might be biased. Furthermore, we did not account for a vaccine to become publicly available to reduce the impact of the pandemic. But even in the absence of a vaccine, human behaviour and the environment itself can alter the likelihood of spread. Hospitals isolate infected people or they may self-quarantine. A further decrease also often occurs as an outbreak matures as people become immune because of previous exposure, reducing the number of susceptible hosts. It has been recently reported that COVID-19 can stay active in aerosol droplets for 3 hours and viable on solid surfaces for 72 hours so new precautionary measures according to this information can reduce viral spread. 11 Further action might include a ban on paper currency notes, a suspension of all cardboard box packed delivery of items and discouragement of human-to-human contact.

Children 0-14 years were 59% (95% CI 7-82%) less susceptible than individuals 65 years and over.
