The S protein gene therefore constitutes one of the most variable regions within the CoV genome. GD in M. fuliginosus and BtCoV HKU8 in M. pusillus showed a higher degree of genomic similarity than any of the other CoVs, except in the S region. Phylogenetic analysis of the S protein revealed that BtCoV HKU8 clustered with HB, rather than with GD; indeed the BtCoV HKU8 S protein exhibited higher identity with HB than the other three Lineage 1 CoVs, including GD. Phylogenetic analysis, similarity plots, bootscan analysis, and recombination-breakpoint analysis suggested that recombination occurred around the S region among BtCoV HKU8, GD, and HB (Wu et al., 2015) , which may have facilitated adaptation of the virus to a new bat species, finally leading to interspecies transmission (Graham and Baric, 2010; Song et al., 2005) .

Areas that have the highest occurrence of recombination are located in regions of the genome that code for nonstructural proteins 2, 3 and 16, and the structural spike glycoprotein. The extent of the recombination observed, suggests that this may be one of the principal mechanisms for generating genetic and antigenic diversity within IBV.

We feel that the 15% divergence must be primarily non-adaptive because adaptation should occur rapidly and then reach a natural optimum. Yet, we see that divergence increases in a remarkably linear manner. Furthermore, the virus does not seem to be converging on a new optimal genotype since polymorphism remains extreme (over 50%), since many polymorphic sites have more than two alleles, and since codon specificity is declining over time. Codon patterns can inform us about the origin of the virus, and they tell us that H1N1 is not only drifting away from that original codon use, but it is also drifting away from the host codon preferences. When grown in mouse cell culture, 2009 H1N1 viruses exhibited variation in replication rates, virulence, and pathogenicity, but these did not match the severity of clinical symptoms in humans [66] . Thus, at this time, the exact relationship between mutation load and the severity of infection remains unknown. Yet, selective adaptation is limited to only those amino acids that produce significant phenotypic effects [42] , and, since a viral genome in the absence of reassortment is essentially a single linkage block, it is expected that many more than just adaptive mutations occur.

Our results are also relevant in the context of a series of experimental studies recently conducted to understand potential adaptive changes in the 2014 Ebola virus Makona outbreak in West Africa. Whereas initial studies suggested human adaptation with increase of replication level during the outbreak 46-50 , later studies found that a late-outbreak strain rather caused reduced virulence and prolonged survival of experimental animals 51 . These results provide another reminder of the fact that outbreak-associated mutations do not have to increase replication or virulence.",13.766571378016263,8.259081921335385

In another work [34] carried out with a different virus variant (obtained upon expression of the infectious clone pACYCQβ [48] ), the temperature had to be gradually increased (in three steps) from 37 • C to 43.6 • C degrees to avoid virus extinction. Alignment of the virus genomes cloned in pACYCQβ and pBRT7Qβ showed the presence of two silent substitutions in the latter (C1257U and C2249U). These substitutions, together with G4A, U192C, and C2201U (also silent), were a necessary requirement for the virus obtained upon expression of pACYCQβ to adapt to a high temperature [34] .

The phenotypic difference depends on the presence of full ORF8, with enhanced replication as opposed to the deletion variant. Earlier experiments in which no clear differences in replication have been noted were aimed at the identification of strong attenuation markers as necessary for live vaccine development, and hence worked at very high MOIs at or above 1 22 . We have also included such high MOIs in our experiments for comparison, and our results were highly concordant with those earlier studies. For instance, like in the study by Yount et al. 22 , differences between viruses with full ORF8 and 29nt deletions were only about three-fold at MOI = 1. Natural infection, however, does not involve high virus doses 37 . When a virus is passed from human to human, the stochastic nature of infection success implicates that inocula just below or above one unit of human-infectious virus are transmitted. For instance, during influenza A transmission in ferrets as few as 2 virus units were transmitted between animals 38 . Under conditions of inter-host transmission, the observed phenotypic differences as observed in our study may have significant effects on viral fitness 37 .",13.45681267258161,7.42919890927098

The lower the rate of change, the smaller the drop in fitness the population experiences in each of the environments to which it is exposed. This means that the selective pressure under change has a low intensity at any point of the process and adaptation will occur through the selection of beneficial mutations that provide small effects on fitness [17] [18] [19] [20] . Since these mutations are relatively abundant [21] [22] [23] , there could be a diversity of accessible pathways for adaptation to gradual changes. In contrast to this, rapid environmental changes usually produce strong fitness drops that severely decrease the population size and, thus, the associated genetic diversity [24] [25] [26] [27] , making it difficult to find the scarce, large effect mutations that would make adaptation possible, unless those mutants already exist in the population, in which case the population bottleneck might help them to fix. The situation is even harsher when a particular combination of mutations is required for optimal adaptation. Due to the generally lower number of adaptive solutions to rapid changes, evolution would be more constrained under this condition than when changes take place at a slower rate [28] . Additionally, because epistatic interactions among mutations of small effect are weaker [29, 30] , it has also been suggested that gradual regimes would allow for populations to reach higher fitness values.",14.291952970070087,7.378729922428583

Generally, the reduction in the population size that accompanies abrupt environmental changes makes it difficult to generate and select adaptive mutations. However, in systems with high genetic diversity, as happens in RNA viruses, mutations with beneficial effects under new conditions can already be present in the population, facilitating adaptation. In this work, we have propagated an RNA bacteriophage (Qβ) at temperatures higher than the optimum, following different patterns of change. We have determined the fitness values and the consensus sequences of all lineages throughout the evolutionary process in order to establish correspondences between fitness variations and adaptive pathways. Our results show that populations subjected to a sudden temperature change gain fitness and fix mutations faster than those subjected to gradual changes, differing also in the particular selected mutations. The life-history of populations prior to the environmental change has great importance in the dynamics of adaptation. The conclusion is that in the bacteriophage Qβ, the standing genetic diversity together with the rate of temperature change determine both the rapidity of adaptation and the followed evolutionary pathways.",15.581978021192281,7.322719939892197

One of the most frequent approaches for detecting novel variants in target genes is using direct gene sequencing. However, due to increasing number of newly identified missense variants, it is often difficult to interpret the pathogenicity of these variants as not all the mutations alter protein function, and the ones that do may also have different functional impacts in disease [15, 16] . Thus, prior to detailed analyses, novel variants cannot be easily classified as either deleterious or neutral, because of their unknown functional and phenotypic consequences. Therefore, further research should be conducted to validate the genetic diagnosis when a novel missense variant is discovered. Preferably, in vitro characterization of novel variants should be undertaken; however, due to facility limitation, it is often not practicable to experimentally verify the impact of large number of mutations on protein function [17] . Another robust approach to substantiate the pathogenicity is using animal models by generating the homologous mutation that recapitulates the human phenotype; but, similar to in vitro studies, these are time-consuming, labor-intensive, difficult and expensive, making this approach unfeasible to experimentally determine the pathogenicity effects of all novel identified variants [18] .

[52] Identification of animal pathogens destined to become significant EIDs within the human population still remains beyond current technical capacity. However, the initial poor adaptation of many emerging zoonotic pathogens may provide a window of opportunity during the initial, stuttering transmission phase into humans enabling the nascent EID to be targeted within its animal host at a stage when it is still amenable to control. Following such pathogen identification, a self-disseminating vaccine platform provides one means to pre-emptively control the emerging pathogen. Adaptation of new technologies such as CRISPR/Cas9 will also greatly increase the ease and speed with which these new vaccine vectors can be constructed following identification of a target pathogen. [53] The next five years has the potential to place us in the position of being able to achieve high vaccine coverage against 'nascent' zoonotic pathogens in animal species involved in transmission that are otherwise inaccessible to conventional vaccination. For many 'high-risk' zoonotic pathogens, this reduction in zoonotic flow into the human population may decrease the probability of complete adaption to the human host with global significance.",14.05179387684245,6.624455807849294

However, pathogens emerging from an animal source are often initially poorly adapted to their new human host in terms of sustained human to human transmission. [20] Mechanisms involved in adaptation are unclear and will presumably be idiosyncratic to the particular emerging pathogen, but have been suggested to impart a requirement for repeated introductions into the human population before a successful adaptation event results in full human adaptation. [20] This requirement may provide a potential 'window of opportunity' for immunological targeting of the pathogen within the animal transmission species, thereby stemming its continued zoonotic flow prior to acquisition of full adaptation to humans. Self-disseminating vaccines are a vaccine strategy that may in some instances be better suited than conventional vaccines to immunologically contain emerging pathogens within their non-human host in challenging under-resourced 'hotspots'. Disseminating vaccines are designed to exploit the ability of replicating virus-based vectors to spread through their animal host populations without the need for direct inoculation of every animal. In this strategy, vaccination of a limited number of 'founder' animals is used for initial introduction of the vaccine into the target population. As the vaccine is engineered to express target antigens from the EID pathogen of interest, its spread from vaccinated to non-vaccinated animals will result in coordinated spread of EID-specific immunity throughout the targeted animal population.",11.683145575387933,6.105736968350689

The cost of PCR amplifying and Sanger sequencing up to 100 candidate regions is small compared to the cost of resequencing itself. The false negative rate on the other hand is very important. In order to associate genotypic change to phenotypic change it is critical to know with some certainty that all of the important mutations were detected. Nimblegen estimates that the false negative rate for SNPs is less than 5% (Tom Albert, personal communication). We found that only half of the small sequence differences actually present were reported as SNPs. If we consider detection in ROI probes as well, then 7 out of 8 small sequence differences were detected, yielding a false negative rate of 12.5%. Given the small sample size, this rate may be consistent with Nimblegen's claims. CGS is meant for the detection of SNPs, but ROI data also reveals deletions and IS-element insertions. The false negative rate for detection of IS element insertions was double the rate for small sequence differences, possibly because CGS has not been optimized for detection of insertions. Conceptually, insertions and inversions could result in a more pronounced hybridization difference at the insertion site. If the insertion site/inversion breakpoint occurs in the middle of the region covered by a probe, then genomic DNA will only match one half of the probe or the other. Detection of insertions might be improved by manipulation of the hybridization/wash conditions or changes to the algorithm to specifically identify probe series indicative of insertions.",15.68945996425467,8.499245069043548

Pharmacokinetic data suggest the possibility of a drug regimen administered fortnightly for HIV infected individuals. Proteins and other macromolecules drain from SC sites into both blood capillaries and the lymphatic system. In animals, proteins with molecular weights of greater than 16,000 daltons have been observed to drain primarily into the lymphatic system following SC administration [98] . Such proteins transit through lymph fluid and typically are not absorbed significantly into the blood until they reach the thoracic duct. Since the molecular weight of PRO 140 is approximately 150,000 daltons, a substantial amount of SC PRO 140 can be expected to drain into the lymphatic system and potentially encounter CCR5+ cells in lymphoid tissues prior to reaching the bloodstream. For these reasons, serum concentrations may not provide a full picture of the overall exposure following SC dosing of PRO 140. SC infusion is currently used by individuals with primary immunodeficiency to self-administer at home significantly larger amounts (approximately 11 grams) and volumes (approximately 70 mL total, up to 15 mL/site) of the weekly SC-administered immunoglobulin [99] . Self-administration of 324 mg SC PRO 140 would be much simpler in comparison.

As a rule, vascular pathology is caused by multiple factors, involving genetic and environmental ones, whereas the current clinical treatments mostly target individual molecules involved in the pathophysiological pathways; this approach to genotype/ phenotype studies is governed by the ""one-gene/one-phenotype"" hypothesis. At the same time, science is moving ahead and the combination of genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics has described the origin (etiology) and essence (pathophysiology) of vascular-dependent pathologies in a big-data fashion and also revealed new and unrivalled relationships between the omic variability and the restricted definitions of clinical phenotypes of vascular disease [240] . The phenomics strategy was announced about two decades ago [241, 242] , which gradually changed the conventional phenotype/genotype/genome approach to a new systematic phenome/genome/proteome study. A phenome is the whole set of an organism's phenotypic traits as a result of the expression of genome and specific environmental influence. Phenomics is a novel approach to quantitatively correlate multiple phenotypic traits to variabilities in transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, interactome, and environmental factors, together with genome. The development of phenomics will not only define a set of biomarkers for diagnosis of vascular pathology, but also reveal novel targets for combination therapy, as well as novel testing systems for animal-free chemical safety assessment, thus making a revolutionary paradigm shift in the preclinical testing of drugs and clinical treatment of these devastating diseases [240, 243] . In parallel, very similar concepts of toxicometabolomics have developed, known as ""toxicity pathways"" and ""toxicity signatures."" Toxicometabolomics is intended to integrate our understanding of the toxicokinetics of chemicals and the toxicodynamics of physiological and biochemical response to toxic effects, as well as to specify the concepts of homeostasis, stress, and mechanisms of adaptation to the effects of foreign chemical compounds. The result of this integration can be a complete mapping of the ""toxicity pathways"" and creating a ""toxome""-a holistic understanding of the mechanisms of action of substances and the relationship between the dose, time, and consequences of exposure [212, 244] . These two scientific directions are almost ready to converge due to development of common algorithmic and computational models and tools. Interestingly, the computational collaboration between different institutions is now considered as one of the most difficult problems, because existing approaches cannot manage with the growing volume of heterogeneous data and provide an adequate computational environment for consistent scientific analysis [245] .",13.126837379462371,6.014956902816293

If the avian traits were always found in avian isolates and human traits always in human isolates, only the shaded cells on the main diagonal would be filled. In such a case, however, it is hard to see how viruses would ever make the jump from birds to humans, since so many traits would have to change simultaneously, and indeed the off-diagonal cells are not empty. Finding avian-adapted traits in viruses isolated from humans most often occurs in zoonotic cases, showing that not all human-adapted traits are required for the first human infection.

Consistent with the results herein, both observed similarities between TMEM41B and VMP1 deletions. On the basis of these phenotypic similarities, one immediate hypothesis is that TMEM41B and VMP1 function as a complex. Indeed, Morita and colleagues were able to isolate a VMP1/TMEM41B-containing co-complex in the presence of n-dodecyl-β-D-maltoside/cholesteryl hemisuccinate (DDM/CHS) [53] , although such a complex was not observed in other detergents [54, 55] . It remains an important future goal to establish whether TMEM41B's function is dependent on its interaction with VMP1. A potential clue comes from studies of DedA proteins in Escherichia coli, which share pfam09335 with TMEM41B and VMP1 [56] and are distantly related to bacterial LeuT transporters [57] . E. coli cells lacking the DedA homologs YqjA and YghB have a defect in proton import that can be rescued by overexpressing a Na + /K + -H + antiporter [58, 59] .

However, it is clear that the changes are not present in currently identified sialoside-binding sites (18, 54) , which raises alternative hypotheses that include mutation-induced allosteric restructuring of sialoside-binding sites. Alternatively, the mutations may restructure distinct receptor-or coreceptor-binding sites, such as presumed binding sites for orthologous CEACAMs on MHV S proteins (69), or sites for CEACAM5 (70) or GRP78 (71) on MERS-CoV S proteins.",16.061753262434245,8.740970244282328

The error-prone replication of influenza genomes can facilitate rapid emergence of viruses with amino acid substitutions that alter the receptor binding characteristics of the HA (Lakdawala et al., 2015) . Increased transmissibility may result from mammalian receptor adaptation, either because the virus shedding form the infected donor host is increased, or because the ability of virus to infect the recipient host at a low dose is enhanced, or for both of these reasons.

Some are well-established, while others are under active development. They include: Protein structural analysis to identify properties of individual amino acid residues and pairs of residues. A number of approaches have been devised to make use of databases of genome sequences and inferred protein sequences of influenza virus isolates, alone or in combination with metadata on the source (species), date of isolation and passage history of the isolates. Characterizing the predictors -at the level of individual amino acid residues within a proteinof variability or conservation can assist in identifying the major selection pressures on that protein. Evolutionary analysis of the predictors of high rates of nonsynonymous substitutions within HA showed solvent accessibility and proximity to the sialic acid receptor binding site are the strongest predictors of high nonsynonymous evolutionary rates (Meyer and Wilke, 2015) . Comparisons of residue-specific evolutionary rates in avian and human lineages can help to assess which sites are specifically involved in human adaptation and which may be evolving in avian reservoirs with potential consequences for human adaptation (Meyer et al., 2013) . Innovative use of metadata associated with sequences deposited in databases will be required to ensure that computational inferences from these databases are reliable. For example, methods that aim to identify sites under positive selection in the HA protein frequently find regions or sites that seem to contradict experimental evidence (Meyer and Wilke, 2015; Tusche et al., 2012; Kratsch et al., 2016) . Several of these apparent contradictions can be resolved by accounting for viral passaging. For example, passaging in regular MDCK cells produces a strong signal of positive adaptation underneath the sialic-acid binding site; this signal is entirely absent in unpassaged virus or virus passaged in SIAT1 MDCK cells (McWhite et al., 2016) . At the same time, passage bias mutations are assumed to increase fitness of the strain in the respective species and are often necessary to grow in culture at all. Therefore, sites associated with isolates passaged in mammalian cultures vs. those passaged in embryonated hen's eggs have the potential to further identify sites associated with mammalian or human adaptation. Metadata can also help to point to individual amino acids associated with human adaptation. For example, one proposed computational approach is to find potentially zoonotic human-isolated sequences when the majority of their database hits from preceding years were of animal origin. This serves, on one hand, as systematic survey to derive lists of times and places of likely zoonotic events and, on the other hand, provides close sequence pairs of zoonotic human and their putative animal precursors. In those pairs, common sites that repeatedly changed from the animal to the human zoonotic isolates could be reasoned as being involved in human adaptation. Combining these sites with those from passage changes, provides strong evidence for the involvement of a particular site in host adaptation. Network analysis of the level of sequence covariation of pairs of residues among protein sequences in the database has led to the identification of groups of mutually covarying sites, which have been used to define features of the HA protein that play a role in determining glycan receptor usage . Complementary to such covariation analysis is the analysis of predicted molecular interactions. Using X-ray co-crystal structures or modeled structural complexes of HA-glycan receptors, molecular features have been defined as distinct networks of inter-residue interactions involving key residues that make contacts with the different glycan receptor topologies. These features go beyond hallmark residue analyses and more accurately predict how amino acid variations in the receptor binding site impact the inter-residue interactions and glycan receptor binding specificity (Raman et al., 2014) . Similarly, network analysis of amino acid residues predicted to have significant interactions has shown that antigenic sites on the HA interact with residues controlling glycan receptor binding specificity, and that changes in these antigenic residues can then lead to changes in receptor-binding affinity (Soundararajan et al., 2011) . It seems likely that as these different lines of evidence -structural location, biophysical interaction, sequence covariation, sequence evolutionary rates, association with zoonotic or in vitro adaptation, etc.-begin to be understood at the resolution of individual amino acids within an influenza protein, such overlapping approaches will yield clearer understanding of the genetic and structural bases of host adaptation to human infection and transmission. A significant step toward such integration is the recent release of the FluSurver online tool which automatizes influenza sequence and structure analysis and highlights mutations that could alter the discussed traits based on extensive literature-derived genotype to phenotype lists, structural visualization of the mutation positions and their geographic and temporal frequency of occurrence and cooccurrence for epidemiological relevance (http://flusurver.bii.a-star.edu.sg and directly from within GISAID http://www.gisaid.org). In particular, the tool has been successful in picking up mutations affecting host receptor binding as well as pH dependency (Cotter et al., 2014; Maurer-Stroh et al., 2010) . However, also in this approach, annotations of the effects of mutations are based on inference from similarity to mutations studied in specific sequence contexts, which in most cases will not be identical to the investigated input sequences. Association studies. Understanding the genetic basis of adaptive phenotypic change is a central goal in biology, and influenza poses special challenges and advantages relative to other organisms. Association studies have begun mapping the genomes of Arabidopsis thaliana to over 107 quantitative traits and the genomes of humans to over 100,000 (Bergelson and Roux, 2010; Leslie et al., 2014) . These studies often investigate genetic variation at the scales of single nucleotide polymorphisms, alleles, and loci. Motif-based approaches have already proven useful in influenza (e.g., the insertion of multiple basic amino acids indicates highly pathogenic H5 and H7), and such simple, robust correlations simplify the prediction of phenotypic traits. Recent investigations of influenza (Thyagarajan and Bloom, 2014; Ashenberg et al., 2013; Pinilla et al., 2012) have shown that many mutations have roughly consistent impacts across diverse backgrounds. A complication of all association studies is confounding from genetic linkage and diverse environmental selective pressures. Although influenza's genes might be tightly linked over short time scales, the virus evolves quickly, and many traits can be assumed to be under stabilizing selection. Thus, association studies that appear statistically impractical now may be feasible with a few more years of expanded surveillance. As reviewed here, however, influenza often breaks simple genetic rules, perhaps due to epistasis (e.g., [Bloom et al., 2010] ). High-dimensional genotype-phenotype relationships obscure simple correlations from association studies. A relevant lesson comes from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which amassed sequences from thousands of diverse tumors to investigate the mutations leading to different cancer types. Although metastatic cancers are typically conceptualized as possessing six main phenotypic traits (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011) , TCGA revealed that the genetic commonality among tumors of any given type is shockingly low (Kandoth et al., 2013; Ledford, 2015) . Human genomes are much larger and more complex than influenza's, however, and so it is possible that an influenza atlas might reveal more patterns, which could inspire hypothesis-driven experiments (Weinberg, 2010) .",14.200463092462028,8.374086547541154

The limited repertoire of cell lines from few species of bats and their tissues have led to studies where viruses have been propagated and studied in cell lines that are derived from unrelated or closely related species of bats. This important topic was recently reviewed by us and a call for collaboration and sharing of resources was put out to advance bat-virus interaction studies at a faster pace (138) . Similarly, inability to isolate majority of the ""detected"" bat viruses have led to studies in bats and bat cells with human isolates of closely related viruses (24, 26) . These studies have demonstrated that infected bats do not develop disease, raising speculations on the role of bats as reservoirs. However, these observations have been made in limited species of bats. Isolating a bat virus and investigating virus replication and pathogen-host interactions in cells from the source species of bat will represent true natural processes and enable us to better predict factors that lead to pulses of increased virus replication and shedding in bats (116, 149) . An interesting study to investigate species specific antiviral responses would be to infect multiple bat species with Tacaribe virus and monitor the outcome of infection.

In this study, the novel point mutation virus is most likely not a panda-adapted virus spreading among pandas, but more likely a spill-over from dogs. Because host adaptation involved complex interactions among both surface-exposed and buried capsid mutations that together altered cell infection and immune escape properties of the viruses [33] . In this study, the virus VP2 gene coding change at nt 3894 (VP2 residue 370, Gln→Arg) was interesting because it has not been detected previously in any other strains. We speculated that the mutation has two aspect functions. On the one hand, residue 370 was close to residues 375 and 377, it has indicated that residues 375 and 377 are associated with the ability of CPV to hemagglutinate or alter pH dependence of hemagglutination [34] , On the other hand, residue 370 was adjacent to residue 379 and 384, while the 379 and 384 residue affects canine transferrin receptor (TfR) binding to determined the canine host range [35] . So, we made the inferences that R370 might be involved in a required conformational change, or it might mediate an effect on receptor binding through the neighboring residues, and is likely to have had an effect on the parvovirus host range. This observation suggests that the glutamine to arginine mutation may also affect host DNA±protein interaction.

It is unclear whether the list of sites and phenotypic traits associated with human adaptation is nearly complete or will continue to grow as we experience additional pandemics. At least for the traits of receptor binding (Childs et al., 2009) (Table 2) and acid stability (Table 3) , full human adaptation may not be required to initiate a pandemic in a virus that is otherwise well-adapted for humans. Thus, whether or not the list of traits required for pandemic is now complete, our understanding of where the threshold lies for being sufficiently humanadapted continues to change.",19.498707512222936,7.0506824618539445

One alternative is to perform similar experiments starting from avian viruses that are not highly pathogenic in mammals, and/or are related to currently circulating human seasonal viruses, so that immunity would already be present in the population. Such experiments can provide the same degree of causal rigor as gain-of-function in highly pathogenic avian viruses with novel surface antigens and can elucidate general principles of mammalian adaptation, but they cannot confirm that the same changes would be observed in other strains that are not used in the experiment. A recent report shows a related way forward: the recreation of the steps of mammalian adaptation using viruses whose HA and NA are already circulating in humans (Lakdawala et al., 2015) . Such loss+gain-of-transmissibility experiments reconstruct the properties of naturally occurring seasonal human strains, from laboratory-generated, avian-adapted (or at least human-deadapted) precursors. Reconstructing such seasonal strains should pose a risk similar to that of working with the seasonal strains themselves, less than that of a novel subtype. A 2011 report employed a similar strategy, demonstrating the importance of HA activation pH in mouse adaptation by selection experiments on a live attenuated H5N1 vaccine strain lacking the NS1 gene (Krenn et al., 2011) . More recently, a 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus was modified to express a mutation that increased pH of HA activation, then selected in ferrets for droplet transmission, and it was found that a second site mutation partially restored the lower pH of activation of the selected virus . One limitation of de-adaptation strategies is that the acquisition of transmissibility is perhaps most likely to evolve by reversion of the de-adaptation changes. As with all gain-of-function and loss-offunction studies, epistatic effects of other loci in the genetic background of the viruses used in such studies set limits to the generalizability of such experiments. Another kind of alternative is simple characterization of ferret transmissibility of naturally occurring highly pathogenic strains without selection for airborne transmission. This approach can provide correlative evidence for the importance of genetic differences but cannot prove the mechanistic role of any particular change.",13.449898769700443,6.954739445036024

According to the knowledge at the time, early human isolates of 2009 (and presumably their swine precursors) would have had an HA intermediate between human and avian adaptation in terms of receptor binding. They had an activation pH outside the range previously seen in human viruses and more typical of avian viruses. Moreover, these viruses lacked the amino acid residues then thought to confer human adaptation for the polymerase complex. We must imagine that had this strain been detected in swine surveillance prior to the pandemic emergence, genetic as well as phenotypic considerations would have marked it as low risk, creating a false-negative risk assessment. Given that this virus did in fact create a pandemic, it is evident that failure of a nonhuman influenza virus to fully meet the three criteria discussed in this review does not disqualify it from posing a significant risk of a pandemic.",13.819606404804134,6.245979862864842

These were chosen from a longer list of candidate traits (Table 1 ) because they span the viral life cycle ( Figure 1 ) and their role in host adaptation has been extensively studied. All three are believed to be required for an influenza virus to cause a pandemic; consistent with this assumption, all three traits have been present to some degree in the earliest viruses isolated in pandemics since the 20th century, though some have been enhanced by subsequent evolution during seasonal transmission in humans. Moreover, for each of these three traits, viruses isolated from avian hosts typically do not show the mammalian-adapted phenotype, reflecting divergent selection pressures in the two classes of hosts (Tables 2, 3, and 4). All three traits changed in the adaptation of zoonotic H5 influenza viruses to droplet transmission in ferrets (Imai et al., 2012; Linster et al., 2014) .

Very little research has investigated the potential effect of observed climate change/variability on the evolution and adaptation of pathogens [56] , that is changes in the climate (e.g. mean temperature and rainfall, patterns of seasonality, etc.) on over decadal time scales. In particular, seasonality is expected to be an important driver of pathogen evolution (see [64] [65] [66] and references therein), as periods of high transmission are followed by population bottlenecks reducing strain diversity and causing rapid genetic shifts. Furthermore, external periodic perturbations (e.g. seasonality in temperature, rainfall) can resonate with the natural frequencies of the ecosystem, promoting emergency or suppression of particular strains of the pathogen [66] .

Following outbreaks of the Ebola virus relative Marburg virus (MARV) at the mine in Kitaka Cave, the nearby ""Python Cave"" in Queen Elizabeth National Park in Uganda (32, 33) , and the Goroumbwa Mine in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (31), a number of Egyptian fruit bats were found to be infected with MARV (5, 6, 24, 34) .

Besides potential applications of temporally scaled phylogenetic analyses to the dating of important evolutionary events such as host range or vector preference switches, recently developed phylogenetics based approaches could be used to pinpoint the geographical locations where these events occurred [218, 252, 253] , determine whether they were associated with altered adaptive evolution rates [176, 217] , and, based on the phenotypic information gathered from sampled contemporary viruses, indicate what the likely biological effects of these evolutionary events were [254, 255] . Coupling of such analyses with advances in both the computational inference of ancestral recombinant virus genome sequences [256] and cheap DNA synthesis means that the opportunity now exists for us to literally recreate infectious ancestral recombinant virus genomes [257] and use these to directly determine things like their neutralization susceptibilities, host ranges, tissue tropisms and vector specificities. Put simply, from the perspective of studying recombination, these new analytical techniques have finally provided us with the tools to definitively determine the adaptive value in ssDNA viruses of this important evolutionary process.

It is thus reasonable to assume that this biased knowledge of the natural diversity of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus limits our current understanding of fundamental aspects of the biology of this species and, as a consequence, our abilities to control zoonotic spillovers to humans. Future studies aimed at understanding the ecology of these viruses and advancing the accuracy and resolution of evolutionary analyses 41 would benefit greatly from adjusting our research and sampling strategies. This needs to include an expansion of our current research focus on human pathogens and their adaptation to specific hosts to other viruses in this species. To illustrate the great potential of species-wide studies, it may again be instructive to draw a parallel to H. sapiens, and specifically to the impressive advancements in personalized medicine in recent years. Results of extensive genetic analyses of large numbers of individuals representing diverse populations from all continents have been translated into clinical applications and greatly contribute to optimizing patient-specific diagnostics and therapy. They were instrumental in identifying reliable predictive markers for specific diseases as well as genomic sites that are under selection. It thus seems reasonable to expect that genome-based analyses with a comparable species coverage will be similarly insightful for coronaviruses. Also, additional diagnostic tools that target the entire species should be developed to complement existing tools optimized to detect individual pathogenic variants (a proactive approach). Technical solutions to this problem are already available; for example, in the context of multiplex PCR-based assays 42 . The costs for developing and applying (combined or separate) species-and virus-specific diagnostic tests in specific clinical and/or epidemiological settings may help to better appreciate the biological diversity and zoonotic potential of specific virus species and their members.

The price of survival for a species is continual evolution. Survival, for viruses, requires cell entry, a precondition long antedating necessity to evade more complex host defenses, including interferons and other cytokines and adaptive immune responses, while for cells, and complex cellular organisms, cell wall defenses, including receptor polymorphisms, form a principal barrier against viral invasion. Viral survival -effectively meaning RNA pol survival -on an evolutionary timescale, as argued previously [28, 44] , requires control of mutation and replication rates in a manner adaptively responsive to constantly changing biota and this implies dynamic linkage of RNA pol fidelity and processivity with quasispecies phenotypic and antigenic diversity, meaning an autoregulatory linkage -Replicative homeostasis -between RNA pol fidelity and processivity and envelope proteins, as argued previously [28] . By definition, evolutionary co-adaptation occurs in response to adaptations in locally prevalent interacting species. Natural selection for beak variation(s) in Darwin's finches occurs as a consequence of concrete survival benefits these variations -mediating, for example, enhanced food harvesting interactions with other variable plant or animal species -confer to individual Galapagos Island birds, rather than any inexorable hypothetical 'improvement' in beak function for finches in general. If a species is widely distributed in space, but population mixing is slow or incomplete, locally prevalent interactions with other species will vary and regional genetic variations will arise and be maintained, hence progressive divergence from the original genotype (speciation) may result.",11.837633033367492,5.458367774804805

In the present article, we introduce mutation into a mathematical model in a similar way although avoiding forceful restrictions put upon mutant strains and allowing the mutant virus to have similar characteristics to the wt virus. The difference between mutant and wt strains occurs when focusing the study on specific phenotypic characteristics. A number of studies employ fitness to investigate the survival of a population in dynamical systems that present competition or coexistence [22 -24]. As an accumulative property resulting from various phenotypic traits, fitness is a convenient measure of the overall success of the population. In the case of virus evolution, fitness can be considered proportional to the infection rate of the virus [25 -27], and measured by the infection rate when other parameters are fixed. It is known that infection rates differ between strains, a fact which has significant implications for the evolution of virulence and strain coexistence in nature [28] . Even the balance between genetic diversity and competition is believed to be achieved due to the possibility of coexistence among strains with differences in infection rates [29] . In other words, a direct competition for infecting available cells mediates the stable coexistence only when competitive abilities in viral clones satisfy certain pairwise asymmetries [30] .",14.497656014281112,8.903501955023566

One such mechanism, genetic locus amplification in response to selective pressure, has been observed in both viruses and bacteria [16] [17] [18] 21] . Here we demonstrate that amplification of the exogenous gene rhtrs1 is sufficient to block potent PKR-mediated inhibition and improve VVDEDK+RhTRS1 replication in AGMderived PRO1190 cells. This adaptation also expanded the species tropism of the virus, enabling markedly improved replication in otherwise resistant human and rhesus monkey cells. Importantly, VVDEDK+RhTRS1 failed to replicate in HFF to a level sufficient to sustain transmission upon serial passage, demonstrating that adaptation in PRO1190 was a critical intermediate step to expand the viral species tropism.

We show that even distantly related viruses within a viral family share highly conserved genetic signatures of host specificity; reinforce how fitness landscapes of host adaptation are shaped by host phylogeny; and highlight the evolutionary trajectories of RNA viruses in rapid expansion and under great evolutionary pressure. We do so by (for each dataset) unveiling a set of phenotype characteristic mutations which are shown to be functionally relevant, thus providing new insights into phenotypic relationships between RNA viruses. These methods also provide a solid statistical framework with which the degree of host adaptation can be inferred, thus serving as a valuable tool for studying host transition events with particular relevance for emerging infectious diseases. These methods can then serve as rigorous tools of emergence potential assessment, specifically in scenarios where rapid host classification of newly emerging viruses can be more important than identifying putative functional sites.",30.338367339030576,11.803056700646366

With the expansion of the gene (driver) under positive selection, the adjacent linked gene (hitchhiker) is duplicated in the process of segmental duplication. The pseudogenization of the hitchhiker occurs in an ancestral species following the duplication process. During the birth-and-death evolution, the hitchhiker that gains more copies may be either the pseudogene or the functional gene, which is determined by the fate of its adjacent driver. The former scenario is the less-is-hitchhiking hypothesis. The less-is-more, lessis-less and less-is-nothing hypotheses depend on the phenotypic change of the loss-of-function variant, which can be advantageous, deleterious or tolerated, respectively. However, the less-is-hitchhiking hypothesis provides another explanation for the driving force of the loss-of-function variant expansion that does not involve phenotypic consequences.

Moreover, there is no clear phylogenetic classification related to the expression pattern or the confounding antimicrobial function of these a-defensins, although many functional studies indicate that a-defensins are effective microbicidal peptides against a wide variety of microorganisms. Previous studies have demonstrated that the a-/h-defensin multigene family, like many other multigene families, is subject to birth-and-death evolutionary process with frequent gene duplication, pseudogenization and significant positive selection [42] [43] [44] . However, the molecular evolution of the undocumented antimicrobial spectra that are composed of functionally divergent a-/h-defensins in humans and closely related primates should be further explored. In this study, the phylogenetic classification, sequence divergence and structural diversification of the primate a-/h-defensins were investigated using molecular evolution and molecular dynamics analyses. Furthermore, the evolutionary processes involved in the emergence of cyclic h-defensins and their subsequent loss of function in humans, chimpanzees and gorillas require investigation. Loss of function is a major driving force for phenotypic change and can be advantageous, deleterious or tolerated, as explained by the hypotheses of less-is-more, less-is-less and less-is-nothing, respectively [45] . Because of the frequent gene duplication and functional redundancy within multigene families, losing certain members is usually ''tolerable''. However, the h-defensins have significant antiviral activity that is higher than that of a-defensins and b-defensins, including anti-HIV-1 activity [39, 46] . The loss of functional h-defensin seems to be ''deleterious''. Therefore, the expansion of pseudogene DEFTP and the loss of functional DEFT in humans, chimpanzees and gorillas cannot be well explained by the three hypotheses noted above. The evolutionary fate of hdefensin genes may be influenced by other factors, which should be further investigated.

Although many biochemical and structural studies have focused on DNA sequences containing successive, adjacent guanines that spontaneously fold into G4s, evidence for their in vivo relevance has recently begun to accumulate. Complete sequencing of the human genome highlighted the presence of ∼300 000 sequences that can potentially form G4s. Likewise, the presence of putative G4-sequences has been reported in various viruses genomes [e.g., Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), papillomavirus (HPV)]. Many studies have focused on telomeric G4s and how their dynamics are regulated to enable telomere synthesis. Moreover, a role for G4s has been proposed in cellular and viral replication, recombination and gene expression control. In parallel, DNA aptamers that form G4s have been described as inhibitors and diagnostic tools to detect viruses [e.g., hepatitis A virus (HAV), EBV, cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV), severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS), simian virus 40 (SV40)].

The increase in viral fitness correlates with deep changes in the patterns of host's gene expression, illustrating that the subtle but dynamic interplay between the pathogen and the plant shifts as the virus adapts to its host. Under the experimental conditions imposed, it may be speculated that natural selection may had favored viral genomes that avoided plant defense mechanisms as suggested by the observation of stress-related genes not being activated after infection with the evolved virus (Table 2 ). Therefore, perhaps as a consequence, increases in the strength of symptoms, virus accumulation and transmissibility have been observed. These phenotypic changes are associated to a few genomic changes fixed in the viral genome. In particular, the development of symptoms is associated to a single substitution in the viral VPg protein, whereas ulterior mutations in other viral components simply magnify symptoms. Our starting hypothesis was that viral adaptation occurs throughout the integration of viral replication processes within host physiology and circuitry of genetic and metabolic interactions. Necessarily, this integration has to affect the patterns of host's gene expression. Our experiments directly test this hypothesis, supporting its validity and, furthermore, pinpointing some physiological processes that may be targeted by the virus as it improves its fitness.

This enhances infectious disease emergence and reemergence, often causing new pandemics. Influenza viruses are a classic example of emerging and reemerging infectious agents, by their ability to undergo multiple genetic changes and evolve in response to changing host and environmental conditions [2, 51, 65, 105] . The IDs emergence threat thus persists as long as pathogens continue to undergo genetic changes and human and environmental activities that favour pathogen adaptation to infection in humans continue. However, findings suggest that virulence of pathogenic microorganisms may be caused by factors other than genetic variation. In the 2013-2016 West Africa Ebola virus disease outbreak, for example, even though rapid genomic variation could be responsible for virulence and transmission rates, pathogenesis studies did not find significant association between change in the virus with the magnitude of the outbreak, suggesting factors extrinsic to the virus to be responsible [63] . This depicts the complex nature of factors that may lead to infectious disease emergence and the enormity of the infectious disease challenge. There is therefore no promise that advances in infectious disease detection and control strategies can successfully stop new diseases from appearing, as each new disease brings unique challenges. Besides, the fact that so far only one human infectious disease (smallpox) has been successfully eradicated and there are many more whose pathogenesis have yet to be understood suggests that elimination of a disease once it gains way into human population is a hard task that deserves all persistent efforts to terminate its persistence.",13.877623780301782,7.754620331829837

Full-genome sequencing of TEV-At17 indicates that six changes have occurred during adaptation (first six rows in Table 1 ); three of them were non-synonymous. The first non-synonymous change, A1047V, affected the P3 protein. P3 localizes in nucleus and nucleoli in association with the NIa protein and participates in virus amplification through its interaction with the CI protein [20] . In other potyviruses, P3 is also involved in systemic movement [25, 26] . The second mutation is a T1210M replacement in the 6K1 peptide. This short peptide has been implicated in plant pathogenicity since its deletion results in symptomless infections [20] . Finally, the third amino acid replacement observed is L2013F in the VPg domain of the NIa protein. VPg is covalently attached to the 59 end of the viral RNA and has essential functions in the viral replication and, relevant for the problem in hand, it has been reported as a key determinant in host-genotype specificity for systemic movement or replication [20] and it has been recently demonstrated that the proper interaction between the translation initiation factor eI4B and VPg is necessary for TEV infection [27] . In conclusion, these three mutations may explain the observed improvement in virus amplification and pathogenicity.

Maughan and coworkers attempted to evolve populations of a laboratory strain of B. subtilis with a hypersporulating phenotype by repeatedly heat-shocking cultures. While their efforts to enrich for hypersporulators failed, other studies revealed that asporogenous mutants evolved readily [60, 61] , confirming many early studies ( [62] and references therein). With the exception of the studies by Maughan et al., most ofthese investigators applied selections intended to inhibit sporulation rather than to enrich for strains with elevated sporulation rates. The 1013 lineage was never heat-shocked during its many transfers; thus the adaptations seen in this work are the result of balancing sporulation versus vegetative growth for prolonged periods on agar slants. However, because undomesticated isolates were observed to sporulate to 98-100% [60] , we cannot formally exclude the possibility that in vitro culture of the 1942 strain following its isolation for an unknown period by the University of Wisconsin might have selected for a hyposporulating variant. In this scenario, the H101Rand A98P mutations would represent suppressor mutations. We consider this possibility unlikely, given the phenotypic similarity of two environmental isolates in the UW collection (1942 and NRS-356). Furthermore, a progression toward darker pigmentation and greater hemolysisis evident in the ''military'' lineage ( Figure 2B ). These phenotypic changes are associated with the accumulation of additional mutations including a P145L substitution mutation in sigH, a positive regulator of sporulation [63, 64] and an A13P mutation in scoC, a negative regulator of sporulation [65] . Together, the strains analyzed in this study suggest strong selective pressures on the genes in the sporulation pathway, and more carefully controlled studies should be carried out to determine the dynamics of in vitro evolution and adaptation of spore-forming organisms, as has been done extensively in E. coli [66, 67, 68, 69, 70] .",14.100191049484465,6.744859677998045

The concept of resilience, it has been argued, provides a useful way of thinking through some of the complexities of adaptation (Nelson et al. 2007) . Broadly conceived, resilience is understood as the ability to cope with the various and sometimes unexpected shocks and stresses of climate change, and as being at 'the core of adaptation' (Conway 2009 ). This approach is termed here the 'literal' approach as it builds on commonplace understandings of resilience that refer to a 'quality or fact of being able to recover quickly or easily from, or resist being affected by, a misfortune, shock, illness, etc.' 3 In relation to contemporary climate change policy, such literal understandings of resilience are a function of development: 'if people are better fed and in better health, and have better access to education, jobs and markets, then they will be more resilient to climate change' (Conway 2009) .",15.61639762807864,8.469853809586589

In debates about pastoralists and climate change adaptation, two key positions are evident (see also Robinson and Berkes 2010) . On the one hand, many contend that climate change will push already-stressed pastoralist systems into a state of collapse, leading to a vicious circle of poverty, environmental degradation and violence (see Catley et al. 2013 for review). On the other hand, other researchers argue that pastoralism has inherent flexibility and resilience: under future climate change scenarios it may have 'an important role to play where other livelihoods are likely to fail' (Nassef et al. 2009 ). In practice, there is widespread appreciation that the situation is more complex, but polarized views that either support pastoralism or try to find alternatives to it are still influential.

The major focus of these approaches was to evaluate the immunogenicity and efficacy in the context of NiV challenge infection. In those studies, efficacy has been mostly associated with the generation of NiV-specific antibodies, and immune monitoring is mainly relying on the detection of virus-neutralizing antibodies [31, 60, 61] .

If parasite strains vary in host preference, selection imposed by drug treatment in humans may lead to a shift in host preference, favouring strains that prefer nonhuman hosts. Observations from Guadeloupe suggest such a process may have occurred in S. mansoni there. Phenotypic and genetic studies suggest the recent adaptation of S. mansoni (back) to its rodent host has resulted in a phenotypic change (the time of cercarial emergence), that may decrease the risk of human infection (Theron 1984; Theron et al. 1992) . Even in a country as large as China, there is evidence that some genetic and phenotypic isolation may be occurring, with a more rodent-philic S. japonicum being selected (Wang et al. 2006; Lu et al. 2009 Lu et al. , 2010a Lu et al. ,b, 2011 Rudge et al. 2009 Rudge et al. , 2013 . Further, it appears S. japonicum in China may show local adaptation to the use of different definitive host reservoirs; in hilly regions where nocturnal rodents predominantly maintain transmission, cercariae are being shed from Oncomelanaia snails in the late afternoons and evening, while in lowland habitats where bovines drive transmission, early morning shedding occurs, which coincides with the timing of peak bovine water contact (Lu et al. , 2011 . Such patterns may be the consequence of intense human chemotherapeutic pressure in China, selecting increasingly zoophilic parasites. This raises the question of what may happen when drug-imposed selective pressure ceases. The answer may depend on the extent of parasite divergence by the time this pressure is removed. If no genetic isolation has evolved between parasite genotypes circulating in humans and animals, one would predict continued transmission to humans and reestablishment as a human disease. This situation may be relevant currently for S. japonicum in the Philippines (Rudge et al. 2008) and China ), where, although adaptation towards different host species does appear to be occurring, species-specific private alleles (alleles found only in a single population) appear to be circulating across both human and animal hosts. However, if complete or near complete genetic isolation between parasites in animal and human hosts occurs, one could predict the evolution of an exclusively zoophilic parasite. Findings from Taiwan may indicate such an outcome, where although S. japonicum continues to infect a broad range of animals, it now appears unable to infect humans (Fan 2006) .",17.37509067254987,7.076637976261023

These barriers can be classified into three major groups; (i) viral entry through availability of the cellular receptor and proteases, (ii) viral replication and subversion of the host innate immune system followed by (iii) viral egress and release of infectious progeny virus. Our results clearly demonstrate that IDV fulfils most of these criteria for humans, as there is no fundamental restriction for viral replication and the sequential propagation of IDV within well-differentiated hAEC cultures from different donors did not lead to major genetic changes. Since only a single non-synonymous mutation was detected in the HEF protein among multiple samples. It is possible that this non-synonymous mutation results in some advantageous adaptation for the virus, however, since there is currently no reverse genetic system available for IDV, we cannot assess its functional relevance in our model at this time. Furthermore, we cannot assess whether IDV can be transmitted between humans with our model. Nonetheless, it has been demonstrated that IDV can be transmitted between both guinea pigs and ferrets, of which the latter is a surrogate model for assessing the transmission potential of emerging Influenza A viruses among humans [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] . This knowledge in combination with the detection of IDV in aerosols collected at an international airport, and the limited epidemiological data of IDV prevalence among humans, warrants the need for increased surveillance of IDV among humans [19, 20] .",14.448887396098172,6.67015379556452

The identification of two new influenza A-like viruses, HL17NL10 and HL18NL11, has expanded the number of potentially zoonotic IAVs. This raises important questions with respect to the origin and evolution of IAV and poses public health concerns. Recent findings demonstrated that the likelihood of reassortment between conventional IAVs and bat IAVs is limited. The inability to exchange viral RNA segments is restricted by RNA packaging signals and a matching NP. Although the risk of reassortment is low, the potential of adaptation to other mammalian hosts cannot be excluded at present. The reconstitution of synthetic HL17NL10 and HL18NL11 viruses marked a milestone in bat IAV research and allowed for the first time the characterization of the mechanisms of virus entry and cell tropism. Even though HL molecules play crucial roles in bat IAV entry, the replication cycle of bat IAVs may not follow the canonical life cycle of conventional IAVs. Moreover, the ability to infect human cell lines suggests that transmission of these viruses to the human population is still a possibility. The use of recombinant bat IAV for experimental infection of bats will provide deeper insight into their tropism and transmission model in the natural host. Importantly, identification and characterization of cellular receptors mediating virus entry will undoubtedly lead to clarification of the tissue tropism and zoonotic potential of these viruses.",15.870467528284435,9.632434583309585

Seroprevalence for WNV is generally low in European studies of wild birds (1-10%, reviewed in [46] ). The only WNV screening study of birds from the Nordic countries showed very low seroprevalence (0.1%) among the 104 sampled species, and no signs of exposure to WNV in the seven tested waterfowl species. [47] However, there are several reasons to include WNV in the present review. Firstly, WNV antibodies have been found in mute swans in Poland, Germany and Serbia. [46, 48, 49] Secondly, the virus has spread steadily northwards, a process likely exacerbated by climate warming. [50] Thirdly, several of the mosquitoes that are competent vectors for WNV are widespread and common in the Nordic countries (Culex pipiens, Coquillettidia richiardii and at least 14 other species), and other species are expanding northwards (e.g. Aedes albopinctus [51] ). Fourthly, swans and geese occur mainly in wet habitats where also mosquitoes are common, increasing the risk of virus amplification and subsequent spread. Finally, small WNV outbreaks with 10-40% fatality rates in humans with neurological symptoms have occurred as close as Romania, Serbia and Russia. [46, 52, 53] At present, WNV is not a health issue in the Nordic countries, which is also mirrored by the relative few studies conducted hitherto.

We have tested 215 swine sera collected from the REBOV affected farms using IFA and IgG-ELISA specific for REBOV-NP and -GP, and NT. NT is the gold standard of serological assay in many virus infections. However, since REBOV needs to be cultured in highcontainment laboratories, we performed an alternative NT using the VSV-pseudotype bearing REBOV-GP. This avoided the use of infectious REBOV, enabling the work to be carried out at low containment. Previously it has been shown that VSV-pseudotype bearing ebolavirus GP mimicks ebolavirus infection [23] , Approxymately 70% of the swine sera from REBOV affected farms were REBOV antibody positive. This indicated that swine are susceptible to REBOV infection. Unfortunately, we could not analyze the IgM antibody responses in swine, since after the sera were heat inactivated the gamma globulin fractions were precipitated with ammonium sulfate, and reconstituted in PBS prior to be testing. An indication of the IgM responses to REBOV would have provided evidence of a recent infection. Thus, it is still unclear if REBOV infection was spread during epizootics or whether a population of the animals in the farms was infected with REBOV prior to the epizootics. The swine not associated with the epizootics, in Tarlac, are considered to be free from REBOV infection. These samples were collected in 2010, over 2 years after the epizootic, and from animals born after the epizootic. Moreover, we could not analyze the swine specimens near the affected farms in 2008. Thus, in this study, it is not clear if REBOV infection in 2008 was limited in the affected farms. Further study is necessary to conclude if the swine population in the Philippines is generally free from REBOV infection. Recently, it has been shown that the experimental infection of swine with REBOV alone resulted in subclinical infection with rapid clearance of the virus [24] . Alternatively, ZEBOV has been shown to replicate to high titers in experimentally infected swine and to cause severe lung pathology resulting in transmission of the virus to naïve animals [25] . Thus, swine has been shown experimentally to be highly susceptible to ZEBOV infection. Furthermore, some amino acid mutations in NP and/or VP24 in ZEBOV resulted in adaptation of the virus to guinea pigs and mice [26, 27] . Thus, we cannot rule out the possibility that mutations introduced in the REBOV genome during serial transmission in swine will result in adaptation of the virus to swine in future. In this regard, a regular serological survey of REBOV infection in swine in the Philippines is desirable. The serodiagnosis systems presented in this study might be useful for such a survey.",13.59892870117218,8.779510823837388

IBV is usually associated with respiratory disease in domestic fowl, and was believed to have a limited host range. Chicken is the only natural host. Similarly, coronaviruses originated from human and other animal species were considered to have narrow host specificities until the identification of SARS-CoV as the causative agent of SARS outbreaks in 2003. The current model of animal origin of SARS-CoV highlights the importance of cross-species adaptation and transmission of animal coronaviruses to human. Cross-species transmission of virus infection has long been recognized as a way for the emergence of many zoonotic diseases. The molecular basis for this phenomenon would lie on the rapid adaptation of certain viruses to a changing environment through selection of minor variants from quasispecies, accumulation of mutations, recombination between minor variants, and reassortment of their genomes. A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms that control these events would be essential for providing safeguards to limit the impact of these devastating diseases. In this study, we show that acquisition and enhancement of the cell-cell fusion activity by amino acid substitutions in the S protein are critical for interspecies adaptation and infectivity of IBV to cultured cells. Data present clearly show that the L857-F mutation in the heptad repeat 1 region of S proteins derived from cell-culture-adapted IBV is important for adaptation of the virus to cell culture systems, and an additional mutation in the S1 region (G405-D) could enhance this process. As S protein carrying the L857-F mutation is able to induce cell-cell fusion, but losses the activity when F857 was mutated back to L, it suggests that induction of cell-cell fusion is an essential step in adaptation/ selection of IBV to cultured mammalian cells.",15.439697756010656,7.930306344005889

In the early years of the twenty-first century, as the U.S. reeled from the 9/11 terrorist attacks, which were shortly followed by the anthrax spore attacks, the focus was primarily on biosecurity. At that time, the concern was that terrorists and state actors would use the tools of the molecular biology revolution to create new and more devastating biological weapons. However, as the years passed and no new attacks developed, combined with the attribution of the anthrax spores in mail attacks to a lone insider in a U.S. government laboratory (Bhattacharjee and Enserink, 2008) , this security threat appeared to recede. At the same time, a series of unfortunate biosafety lapses in government laboratories heightened concerns about biosafety. Hence, today people (at least those outside the security community) appear to be more worried about an unintended release of a pathogen with pandemic potential than a deliberate biological attack. This change in emphasis from biosecurity to biosafety has developed slowly and could easily change if there is another deliberate biological attack or if becomes apparent that adversaries are developing biological weapons.",14.003929986073448,8.389568816353734

Studies of niche differentiation suggest a key new direction for understanding and modeling infectious disease transmission, building on prior work that uses serotypes to consider the heterogeneity in which pathogens infect which people. To date, heterogeneity is mostly considered in terms of acquired immunity or proxies for it, such as age. Studies such as the age-stratification of pneumococcal gene content [14] suggest signatures of interplay between host immunity and pathogen evolution. Vaccine escape is one of the most important manifestations of these interactions; deepening characterization of the immune responses of hosts in which escape mutants arise and transmit most successfully offers a particularly exciting and developing field [97] .

However, few viral replication studies focus on duck LPAI H5N2 viruses. In this study, we characterized the phenotypic variations between the two genetically close duck LPAI H5N2 influenza viruses and revealed three major findings that helped us better understand the epidemiological aspects of influenza. First, variations of LPAI H5N2 viruses involved both intra-host and inter-host levels in ducks that may increase viral diversity, population dynamics, and continuous evolution. Second, intra-duck variations (shown in p518-L vs p518-S) included three residue substitutions in PA (P224S), PB2 (E72D), and M1 (A128T), whereas inter-duck variations (shown in DV518 vs DV413) contained the other three mutations in HA (N170D), NA (I56T), and NP (Y289H). These differences indicate that two levels of viral variations were involved in the mutations of different genes. Third, phenotypic variations of duck influenza p518-L strain with better replication in MDCK cells (compared to p518-S and p413) imply that duck-LPAI viruses may have a stronger potential to infect mammalian hosts under certain epidemiological settings [30, 36, 37] .

Here, we analyze adaptation in~1300 virus-interacting proteins manually curated from a set of 9900 proteins conserved in all sequenced mammalian genomes. We show that viruses (i) use the more evolutionarily constrained proteins within the cellular functions they interact with and that (ii) despite this high constraint, virus-interacting proteins account for a high proportion of all protein adaptation in humans and other mammals. Adaptation is elevated in virus-interacting proteins across all functional categories, including both immune and non-immune functions.

On average VIPs experience much more purifying selection than non-VIPs. This means that mechanically, a smaller proportion of amino acids can possibly be targeted by adaptive evolution in VIPs. A naïve comparison of VIPs and non-VIPs would therefore tell more about the difference in purifying selection than about the difference in the amount of adaptation. Instead, the idea is to compare adaptation in the 1256 VIPs with adaptation in 1256 non-VIPs with the same overall average and variance in levels of purifying selection.

This intrinsic biological property facilitates rapid adaptation of the virus to changing circumstances, a major contributor to the frequent outbreaks of mutated or newly emerging RNA viruses in humans, livestock, and other host organisms. The poor fidelity of RNA virus genome replication is attributed primarily to the fact that errors made by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) go uncorrected. This lack of proofreading results in ""quasispecies"" populations of closely related viral genomes that are subject to continuous natural selection. As the accumulation of an excessive number of deleterious mutations can result in ""error catastrophe, "" the low fidelity of their replication is thought to have restricted genome size, which for most RNA virus families is (well) below 15 kilobases (Steinhauer et al., 1992; Drake and Holland, 1999; Eigen, 2002) . This evolutionary trade-off between RNA virus genome size, replication fidelity, and adaptive capacity has been explored both from a fundamental perspective and in the context of antiviral drug development (Crotty et al., 2001) . The balance between quasispecies diversity and viral fitness appears to be easily disturbed, suggesting that RNA viruses in general may operate close to their error threshold (Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard, 2005; Vignuzzi et al., 2006; Manrubia et al., 2010) . Clearly, in the absence of countermeasures to reduce the overall error rate, similar issues would be expected upon the significant expansion of RNA virus genome size.",12.332572891485064,7.354061802188534

It is possible that full replacement of mDPP4 disrupts its non-MERS-CoV-related functions, including T-cell homeostasis, that could affect the course of disease, and the use of different MERS-CoV strains may also affect outcome. A side-by-side comparison of these models will help in elucidating and reconciling these differences.

We further use an increasingly strict level of evidence for the presence of adaptation, by including only proteins with increasingly low BUSTED P-values; that is, increasingly high probability that adaptation occurred somewhere on the tree ( Figure 5A ).

In Figure 5 -figure supplement 3 we further show that this excess of adaptation in VIPs is due to i) more VIPs with signals of adaptation than non-VIPs, ii) more branches of the tree per VIP showing adaptation, and iii) a greater proportion of codons evolving adaptively per branch.

Given the similarity of the physiological response to influenza virus between ferrets and humans, ferrets have been used to study influenza proteins [94, 95] and to assess the effectiveness of anti-viral compounds at ameliorating disease progression [89, [96] [97] [98] . However, the limitation of ferrets is that while they are highly susceptible to infection, intramuscular or other immunization routes with noninfectious antigen results in the poor antibody response. In the light of the importance of immunogenicity studies of existing or novel vaccines, this is a huge drawback for the use of ferrets [87] .",17.485494004293187,11.134010030141837

However, a significant drawback of the mouse model is that wild mice are in fact not susceptible to influenza because they express the antiviral protein Mx1 which is part of a GTPase family with known antiviral functions [91] [92] [93] , and laboratory viral strains require prior adaptation to mice.

Bats have superseded rodents in harboring greater number of viruses and also having greater proportion of zoonotic viruses [63] . It is therefore crucial to understand how evolutionary pressure may have a role in the emergence of new viral strains. A recent study found that henipavirus genomes are best adapted to pteropid bats [64] . Adaptation of genomes refers to better capability of the virus to use host cellular machinery for its replication and protein synthesis, which is usually governed by natural selection; diversity in codon usage bias may contribute to it. Codon usage is an interspecies bias where one codon is selected over other synonymous codons in a particular species [65] . Natural selection for viral variants works by selecting codons matching host tRNA abundance. It also selects for variants with the advantage of not activating innate response genes, such as those for toll-like receptor 9. Codon bias analysis suggested that henipaviruses have the highest level of adaptation to pteropid bats. It would be interesting to study whether other viruses also show such codon bias towards their reservoir hosts. We might be able to use such codon bias studies in the future to identify reservoir hosts of spilled over viruses. Due to coevolution with the reservoir host, the viruses would have a codon bias specific towards their reservoir host. Apart from codon bias, natural selection based on receptor utilization also has a role to play in the evolution of viruses. Variation in the efficiency of bat coronaviruses to recognize human receptors show that the viral spike protein evolved in a stepwise manner to infect human cells [66] . Despite several other receptor-binding studies [67, 68] , the mechanism of adaptation to new hosts is not definitively understood.",11.109535623701113,8.110197269110971

This is a consequence of high mutation rates operating during RNA genome copying, due to the absence of proofreading-repair activities in the relevant RNA-dependent RNA polymerases and RNA-dependent DNA polymerases [1, 2] . Most phylogenetic relationships among RNA viruses have been established using the consensus (or population) genomic sequences that represent a weighted average of multiple, closely related sequences present at each time point, in each virus sample obtained for analysis [3] . Phylogenetic relationships established with consensus viral sequences have been instrumental to classify viruses and to determine origin of emergent viruses and rates of virus evolution [1, 4, 5] . For many purposes it is important to analyze phylogenetically the relationship among different genomes from the same mutant spectrum of a viral quasispecies. This type of analysis may reveal the existence of genome subpopulations within mutant spectra that might encode different phenotypic traits. Also, it allows the calculation of average genetic distances among individual components of the mutant spectrum, a parameter that can be a predictor of biological behaviour [1] . As an example, a study with a poliovirus mutant which displays a -3-to 5-fold higher template-copying fidelity than the wild type documented that a narrow mutant spectrum impeded the virus to reach the brain of susceptible mice and produce neuropathology [6, 7] . An early study documented that complexity of the coronavirus murine hepatitis virus quasispecies influenced the pathogenic potential of this virus for mice [8] . A broad hepatitis C (HCV) virus mutant spectrum was associated with poor response to treatment by ribavirin and interferon α [9] , and rapid early evolution of the virus led to a chronic infection [10] . Some studies have found an association between a reduction of mutant spectrum complexity of HCV at early stages of treatment and viral clearance ( [11] ; reviewed in [12] ). Recently, the role of the mutant spectrum in adaptation of West Nile virus has been documented [13, 14] . Therefore, there is a need to develop methods to describe the relationship among components of mutant spectra in viral populations.",12.332686743292497,5.873066428208004

In addition, we reconstructed the ladder-like phylogeny of H3N2's haemagglutinin gene (HA) from dated European sequences collected in 1968-2009 (see Figure 1 and Text S1). To represent H3N2's global phylodynamics, we focus on a class of spatially structured phylodynamic compartmental models that formalize probabilistically how evolving, antigenic variants interact epidemiologically. These antigenic variants might correspond to the major antigenic clusters that are distinguishable in H3N2 antigenic maps [31] , but can in principle also represent a different phenotypic resolution. The evolutionary dynamics of viral genotypes are separately formulated for each antigenic phenotype because genetic distances do not necessarily easily translate into phenotypic relationships [5] . Spatial substructure has been incorporated in several models of H3N2 phylodynamics to reflect the global circulation of the virus [4, 8, 32] . We adopt here a simple source-sink framework, where the sink is thought of as the Netherlands into which viral genetic diversity and antigenic strains are imported on a seasonal scale from a source population where the virus persists [9, 33] . We fit and assess two distinct models to the combined features of sequence and incidence data described in Figure 1 and Table 1 .

So, understanding Vero cell adaptation of variant PEDV might help us to develop a new vaccine against the re-emerging PED. During the cell adaptation process, some mutations are responsible for cell adaptation, some for attenuation, and some for both [28] . Normally, the mutations occurring in the early stage of passages are related to adaptation. In this study, the cell cultures of parental strain YN1 and different passages, i.e., YN15, YN30, YN60, YN90, YN144, and YN200 were collected for sequencing. The sequencing results would be more specific if we used the plaque purified isolates as the sequencing samples. In the early passage-YN15-only the nucleotide sequences change of NSP11, S, ORF3, and M were noted. S glycoprotein (surface antigen) is the major surface protein in PEDV, which is responsible for viral receptor binding [29] [30] [31] . M protein was an important viral assembly process-associated protein [32] . ORF3 was the only accessory gene of PEDV and the variation of ORF3 during the cell culture adaptation process resulted in the virulence decrease of the PEDV [33] , as happened in TGEV [34] . It is believed that the variation of ORF3 between parental virulent strains and attenuated strains could be markers for both attenuation and cell adaptation of the virus [26, 29, 35] .

The nucleotides of other non-structural genes, NSP1, NSP3, NSP9, NSP11, were increasing changing during the passage. The nucleotides changes of these genes might play an important role in the transcriptional regulation and virus adaption and virulence. The aa change rates in the structural proteins were higher than those of the non-structural proteins, and the ORF3 was the most mutable gene. Besides early termination at 145 aa in ORF3 protein, it also had 8 aa changes just before the terminated position. The aa changes before the early termination position of ORF3 seemed to be a reason for virus adaptation. The ORF3 was therefore believed to be the most important gene responsible for the Vero cell adaptation of PEDV through in vitro passage. The E, S and M protein were highly changeable proteins, but after the 90th passage, the E protein became stable, the S protein was increasingly changed and the M protein reached a plateau from passage 15-90. Then from passage 90, the M protein changed faster than the S protein, and they reached the same mutation rate level at passage 200 (1.08%). The N protein was a conserved protein, with only two aa changes, and the mutation rate was 0.45% (Table 2 ) (Figure 1) . Table 3 shows that the variation of attenuation in both classical and variant PEDV strains can be characterized by 9-26 aa changes in ORF1a/b and S proteins, 1-3 aa deletions in S protein, early termination and 8-12 aa changes in ORF3, 1-3 aa changes in E, M and N proteins, and the nucleotide sequences' synonymous mutations of genome (RNA) sequence might also be involved in attenuation. However, to explore which nucleotides mutations contributed to the attenuation of PEDV we could use the reverse genetic approach. The early termination of ORF3 could be the attenuation and cell adaptation marker of the PEDV [26, 29, 35] , whereas in our pig infection experiment, the ORF3 early termination strain, YN15, was still virulent to piglets.

The small, simple genomes of viruses are ideal for study, as even a single non-synonymous mutation can alter the phenotype. Viral evolution and epidemiology are interdependent; the continued spread of a virus via vector species into new hosts relies on its ability to adapt (Pybus and Rambaut, 2009) , although both processes are subject to drift. One aspect of viral adaptation, of any given species, is the bifurcation of an ancestral sequence or population into two or more lineages that over time develop novel phenotypic characteristics, utilize novel vectors, and infect new host species.

In this study, a variant PEDV strain YN1 was isolated, serially propagated on the Vero cells and was characterized for 200 passages. To better elucidate the molecular basis of Vero cell adaptation of variant PEDV strains, we sequenced, compared, and analyzed the full-genome sequences of parental YN1 and passages 15, 30, 60, 90, 144, and 200. The results showed that the variations increased with the viral passage. The nucleotides sequences of non-structural protein (NSP)2, NSP4-7, NSP10, NSP12 and NSP13 genes did not change during the Vero cell adaptation process. After comparison of the variation characteristic of classical, variant virulent/attenuated strains, it was found that attenuation of PEDV virus was associated with 9´26 amino acid (aa) changes in open reading frames (ORF) 1a/b and S protein, early termination in ORF3, 1-3 aa changes in E, M and N protein and some nucleotide sequences' synonymous mutations.

These residues have undergone positive selection for mutations that compromise the interaction between the betaretrovirus entry glycoprotein and TfR1 [18] . At the same time, the entry glycoprotein receptor binding site (RBS; F 40 HGFR 44 residues at the N-terminus-proximal region of the MMTV surface subunit (SU) domain [20] ) has evolved to acquire compatibility with particular host TfR1 orthologs [18] . The molecular arms race between MMTV Env and rodent TfR1 driving endless rounds of 'positive selection' for mutations that affect interaction between the virus and host as well as above mentioned evidence support the concept that MMTV-like viruses once circulated more widely in nature and that they are particularly adept at overcoming cellular barrier preventing cross-species transmissions.

Introduction of the identified mutation, leading to single amino acid substitution (G42E), into egfp-containing recombinant MMTV virions enhanced their ability to bind to and infect human cells.

Knock-out of TFR1 gene from the human genome did not decrease the susceptibility of Hs578T cells to virus infection. Furthermore, the expression of human TfR1, in contrast to mouse TfR1, did not enhance the susceptibility of MMTV-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cells. Thus, human TfR1 is dispensable for infection and another cell surface molecule mediates the MMTV entry into human cells. Conclusion: Taken together, our data explain the mechanism enabling MMTV to form 'host-range variants' in non-murine cells that has been known for a long time, the basis of which remained obscure. Our findings may expand our understanding of how viruses gain capability to cross species-specific barriers to infect new hosts.",13.008032427147652,8.123122979273864

Depending on the representative concentration pathway (RCP), and based on the 2007 horse census, there could be at least 112-165,000 more horses at risk (175-260% increase). Because there is considerable uncertainty around the potential outcomes of climate change on disease occurrence in new areas more research is needed, first to verify predictions and then to better manage the consequences (Braks et al. 2013) . Furthermore, the ultimate spillover risk scenario by 2050 will also depend on horse densities and socio-economic processes, and how these processes interact with climate change. Therefore, one potential area of ecological and epidemiological research is the role of novel ecological interactions between flying foxes and other organisms such as food sources that could experience distributional shifts and impacts as result of human activities. We need to understand if these novel interactions and processes affect the dynamics of bat populations, HeV, and spillover risk (Williams et al. 2003; Sala et al. 2009 ). Consequently, we emphasise the need to undertake regular risk assessments to quantify HeV exposure in horse populations and to consider the potential consequences of a larger horse population at risk.",16.16078251453333,8.10272568710876

Thus, the efficacy of an S1 recombinant protein emulsified with the adjuvant Montanide™ ISA 206 VG was evaluated as a potential vaccine candidate. We showed that immunized llamas were efficiently protected against MERS-CoV infection; no infectious virus was detected in the nose of any of the vaccinated animals and viral RNA shedding remained low (Cq ≥ 34), with the exception of one llama (No. 15). Viral mRNA was also detected in the nasal cavity of this llama, which might be from intracellular viral mRNA from cells harvested in the nasal swabs; nonetheless, we could not detect any infectious virus. Neutralization of the virus by antibodies at mucosal level may have inhibited infectious viral particle production. The lack of detectable infectious virus in the vaccinated llamas despite being infected, renders these animals unlikely to transmit the virus further to other animals and thus blocking the transmission chain. In addition, our studies revealed a mutation (S465F) in the spike protein encoded by this viral RNA, which may suggest a potential escape variant being produced. However, the emergence of the same mutation in another vaccinated llama, in one naïve in-contact animal and in other three directly inoculated llamas was revealed. In addition, the capacity of vaccinated animals to induce NAbs against this variant when isolated, indicate that it is unlikely an escape variant induced under antibody pressure.

The importance of such a population structure is strengthened by considering five parameters that characterize a mutant distribution: average number of mutations per genome, virus population size, genome length, mutations needed for a phenotypic change, and virus fecundity (Table 2) . Despite all cellular organisms being highly polymorphic genetically (in that distinct alleles from a gene are represented among individuals of one biological species), the level of heterogeneity of RNA virus populations confers a much greater adaptability than the levels of polymorphism estimated for cells. This is a consequence of parameters 2 and 3 (listed in Table 2) : as an example, a viral genome of 10,000 nucleotides has a total of 3 × 10 4 possible single mutants (disregarding fitness effects of mutations), which is a figure well below the population size of many natural virus populations. In contrast, the total number of possible single mutants for a mammalian genome is about 10 10 , well above the population size of mammalian species. That is, the capacity to explore sequence space (a concept discussed in the chapter by Biebricher and Eigen in this volume, which refers to the total number of possible sequences available to a genetic system, reviewed by Eigen and Biebricher 1988 ) is far greater for viruses than for cellular organisms. This confers adaptability to viruses (with amply recognized biological implications) and renders viruses suitable experimental systems for probing evolutionary concepts (see Domingo et al. 2001; Flint et al. 2004 , and other chapters of this volume).",14.067176087495953,8.020995706646685

Bartoloni (Florence, IT) Antibiotics are the most commonly purchased class of drugs in lowresource countries, where the infectious diseases are extremely frequent and the bacterial infections are the major cause of death, especially in childhood. The phenomenon of microbial drug resistance, which represents a global public health problem, is particularly serious in these countries, as resistance rates are even higher than in industrialised countries and the therapeutic options are often unavailable or too expensive. Surveillance of antibiotic susceptibility is a key element to provide updated information on the magnitude and trends in resistance, and to plan and monitor intervention strategies aimed at preserving the therapeutic efficacy of antibiotics. In low-resource countries, effective surveillance programmes are difficult to implement for a number of reasons, including scarce financial resources, lack of laboratory facilities and, where laboratories do exist, lack of quality control, reliable reagents and adequate supervision. In these settings, the development of reliable and low-cost alternative methods could facilitate the implementation of large-scale surveillance. There is an increasing agreement about the importance of extending the surveillance of antibiotic resistance to the commensal microbiota of humans and animals. This bacterial population, although not being a specific target, is continuously exposed to the selective pressure generated by antimicrobial chemotherapy and may become a potential reservoir of resistant strains that can cause infections, and of resistance determinants that can be transferred to pathogenic bacteria. Therefore, surveillance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria carried by healthy individuals is considered an indicator of the spread of antibiotic resistance that could also be useful to predict the emergence of resistance in pathogenic bacteria. In this perspective, resistance patterns of some members of the commensal microbiota, such as the faecal Escherichia coli, have been evaluated in various epidemiological settings. For this purpose, different microbiological approaches have been implemented and evaluated as useful tools to conduct large scale resistance surveillance studies and to monitor resistance control programmes in a cost-effective manner.",16.708435092275266,10.095242071019335

No less concerning, chronic respiratory infection by P. aeruginosa is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) and a frequent complication of other respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or bronchiectasis. Due to a complex multifactorial adaptive process, once established, P. aeruginosa chronic infections are almost impossible to eradicate with antibiotics. The underlying factors driving this situation include (i) the transition from the planktonic to the biofilm mode of growth, associated with a significant reduction of antimicrobial susceptibility, (ii) the extraordinary capacity of P. aeruginosa for acquiring resistance to nearly all available antibiotics through a complex interplay of intrinsic and mutation-driven resistance pathways, (iii) the intense genetic adaptation and phenotypic diversification process taking place within the CF lung and (iv) the frequent emergence and fixation of mutator phenotypes, often resulting from a nonfunctional DNA mismatch repair system caused by the inactivation of mutS or mutL genes leading to increased (up to 1000-fold) spontaneous mutation rates. Moreover, results from recent research argue that the four factors are intimately interconnected and act synergistically to establish life-long persistent infections that are highly recalcitrant to the activity of antimicrobial agents: the biofilm mode of growth is found to facilitate development of mutation-driven resistance, selection of mutators, genetic adaptation and phenotypic diversification; conversely, mutator phenotypes are shown to significantly enhance mutation-driven resistance, biofilm development, genetic adaptation and phenotypic diversification.",16.863759053704683,9.403456752037147

For example, they have been used to assess prognosis and guide therapy in several forms of cancer, to stratify patients according to risk of long-QT syndrome, and to shed light on the response to certain drugs, such as antiepileptic agents (Priori et al., 2003; Siddiqui et al., 2003; Van de Vijver et al., 2002) . Our understanding of how living organisms and systems within organisms interact with each other and respond to the environment all changes dramatically in this genomic era. Full benefit from genomics tools in combating viral diseases requires understanding the dynamics of infection with regard to viral diversity, evolution, and epidemiology, in combination with a better understanding of the pathogenesis of the infection and the molecular basis of the host response to infection. In this chapter, we describe how genomics may aid in mitigating viral threats, by highlighting potential roles and limitations of genomics approaches in surveillance and diagnostics, and development of vaccines and antivirals (Figure 97 .2). As the clinical outcome of an infectious disease depends on properties of both the pathogen and the host, a distinction is made between viral genomics and host genomics.",13.611287670982259,6.854644021569025

The seminal program DOCK, originally described in 1982 by Kuntz et al. [17] , has evolved as the first VS tool. Later, other programs were successfully applied in VS, such as GOLD [91] , FlexX [92] , Glide [93, 94] or Autodock [95] , to name the most popular prototypes. These have been recently reviewed [96] [97] [98] [99] [100] [101] [102] . All docking tools follow slightly different concepts. This might give individual programs a particular advantage in one task with respect to another -for example, incorporating aspects such as flexibility of ligand and receptor or restraining the docking search engine to particular regions in configuration space (e.g. mapping a protein-based pharmacophore) [103] . However, all docking tools are still far from perfect. An even more challenging, but carelessly disregarded, aspect of docking is the appropriate consideration of water molecules. As indicated above, water molecules are involved in binding in about two-thirds of the known protein-ligand complexes. However, most docking tools ignore them simply because conclusive concepts of how to consider them correctly are missing. If structural evidence is given, preplacement of water molecules in a docking run is a feasible strategy [66] . The docking tool Slide [104] treats preplaced water molecules in a way that still enables their replacement by ligand atoms in docking. The particle concept in FlexX [105] enables the placement of water molecules 'on the fly' during the course of the generation of individual docking solutions. In the docking tool GOLD, water molecules can be switched on or off, and can spin around their principal axes to achieve good contacts with a docked ligand [106] . Recently, the popular docking tools DOCK and FlexX have been equipped with features that enable docking on a preconceived pharmacophore or property distributions [107, 108] . Consideration of such criteria will drive docking solutions especially into regions either frequently trapped by other bound ligands or featured by complementary analytical tools as being particularly relevant for binding. The program AutoDock [95] performs docking on a precalculated grid, storing potential values from any sort of interaction field [109] . In the original implementation, Lennard-Jones and Coulomb potential values are used. Sotriffer et al. [110] replaced these by knowledge-based potentials, originally implemented into DrugScore. The latter potentials have proven to be powerful for discriminating, and rank among multiple ligand poses. The potential grid approach in AutoDock also enables one to average across the fields produced by various protein frames, so that the conformational degrees of freedom of a protein can be considered. In addition, adapted fields optimized with respect to the binding properties of some known actives in the comparative molecular field-type approach 'adaptation of fields for molecular comparison' (AFMoC) [111] can be used as target potential values in AutoDock [112] . The latter docking tool performs multiple stochastic searches on the potential hypersurface; accordingly, the frequency of occurrence of certain docking solutions can be used as an additional figure of merit for their relevance [113] .",13.711623225189026,6.668872675053151

For one, methods need to be cost-effective and in a high-throughput format. Although it has been contemplated that within two decades it will be possible to sequence anyone's entire genome for less than $1000, this may be complicated by ethical, legal, social, and societal issues. Existing DNA sequence and/or method intellectual property claims may have an impact on development of multi-gene diagnostic tests (Chandrasekharan and Cook-Deegan, 2009 ). In addition, although seemingly far-fetched at present, privacy measures regarding genetic information need to be enacted and signed into law, to prevent abuse of such data by, for example, insurers or employers, which may one day become a realistic situation. Secondly, a large investment in bioinformatics tools, databases and data management is required, to make optimal use of the generated data. Thirdly, clinical diagnosis of disease will largely change when use of genomics-based tools becomes standard operating procedure, and molecular diagnosticians will need to gain experience in interpreting the data generated by these radically different and rapidly evolving techniques. However, as with so many other molecular biology tools that have found their way into the clinical setting, there is no reason why genomics-based tools could not transition from the research setting into the clinic in the future, despite the hurdles that need to be overcome (Ten Bosch and Grody, 2008) .",13.827424165983162,6.133838223499762

Synthesizing our data and previous studies, we offer the following conceptual framework to explain our observations, acknowledging that expanded studies are necessary to confirm its broader application. We propose that the stringency of transmission bottlenecks and the main evolutionary forces driving them may change throughout the host adaptation process. We speculate that at earlier stages of host adaptation, there may not be one ''most fit'' virus that is able to outcompete the rest of the population after transmission to localized regions of the respiratory tract (Karlsson et al., 2015; Lakdawala et al., 2015; Matrosovich et al., 2004) . A non-mutually exclusive hypothesis is that a larger inoculum may be required to found infection in the absence of a single highly fit variant. These hypotheses could explain the surprising finding that the first transmission bottleneck was loose, even though relatively few ''avian-like'' viruses would be expected to be fit for transmission in mammals. Indeed, we speculate that viruses that are well adapted for transmission in a particular host species would again exhibit loose transmission bottlenecks, as most variants would be of similar transmission fitness; the recent observation of loose genetic bottlenecks in transmission of seasonal influenza viruses among human household contacts supports this hypothesis (Poon et al., 2016) .",13.655733631029747,5.794997177612045

This is supported by many examples where viruses repeatedly escape through the exact same amino acid change, not just through mutation from one amino acid to any other. For example, in experimental cross-species infections of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) from sooty mangabeys (SIVsm) into rhesus macaques, viral replication was initially weak due to restrictive TRIM5 alleles [27] . However, viral escape occurred in four different macaques and in all cases involved the same single amino acid change (R97S) in the capsid protein. In another example, there have been multiple independent cross-species transmissions of SIV from chimpanzees (SIVcpz) and possibly gorillas (SIVgor) to humans, giving rise to HIV-1 groups M, N and O. A single amino acid position in the gag-encoded matrix protein underwent the same mutational substitution (M30R) in all of these crossspecies transmissions [28] . When HIV-1 was passaged back through chimpanzees, this mutation reverted. Similar to these two examples from the HIV field, there are many amino acid positions in the influenza genome that have characteristic mutations depending on the source species, suggesting that the web of selective constraints in each species repeatedly results in viruses acquiring signature adaptive mutations [29] . The focused routes of adaptation seen in these examples are a reflection of the massive and multi-factorial constraints imposed by the host.

Two experimental adaptations of SARS-CoV to murine hosts by serial passage independently identified a substitution in the Spike gene at residue 436 which alone has been shown to enhance infectivity and pathogenesis in mice, and is predicted to allow stronger binding to the murine ACE2 receptor [29, 57, 58 ] . However, substitutions outside of Spike are necessary for the full lethal disease phenotype in MA15, and presumably also in v2163 [57] . For example, two other proteins, nsp9 and nsp13, contained mutations in both mouse-adapted strains, MA15 and v2163. Additionally, single substitutions in the M gene are common to MA15 and adaptation to persistent infection of human tubular kidney cells, suggesting the M protein influences tropism or pathogenesis by facilitating the efficiency of particle egress [59] . The substitutions common to both mouse-adapted strains suggest potential SARS-CoV virulence factors in the later stages of adaption to a novel host, and indicate potential mutation driven emergence pathways. The mouse-adapted viruses may not represent true cross-species transmission events, as SARS could already replicate in the mouse lung, but it is notable that the most conserved change in both mouse-adapted strains enhances receptor binding at the same Spike residue. Further, serological studies indicate multiple crossspecies transmissions into humans in the years before the epidemic, suggesting that the virulence factors contributing to the later stages of adaptation to novel hosts, in Spike or elsewhere, are critically important [23] .",12.630946780501286,6.0577835945690355

Characterization of mutants with point or deletion mutations in the S protein has helped to establish links between the variations and the functions or altered antigenicity and virulence of viruses. Through sequence analysis of wt virus, two ts mutants, a revertant and different passages of a cold-adapted IBV, data presented in this study not only mapped the defects of the ts mutants to the S gene, but also revealed the molecular events occurred during evolution of the IBV S gene. Compared with the parental wt virus, mutations that are identical in the two ts mutants and the revertant might be associated with the cold-adaptation phenotype, while those identical only in the two mutants but different from the revertant and wt virus were considered to be linked to the ts phenotype. According to this criterion, the Q 294 -to-L 294 mutation in the S protein that exists in the two ts mutants, and interestingly, occurred at a highly conserved domain among IBV viruses immediately downstream a variable domain in the S1 subunit may be responsible for the ts phenotype.

Ecophylogenetics provide a basis to disentangle the relative contributions of host relatedness (phylogeny) and host ecology (e.g., interaction networks, demography) to parasite-sharing patterns among different host populations ( Figure 3C [78] ). Integrating phylogenetics with community ecology could help in understanding patterns of host phylogenetic clustering and overdispersion across spatiotemporal scales. This holds great potential for the development of new tools to predict parasite host breadths (H P and H O in our proposed framework), a key component of understanding disease transmission dynamics at the landscape level [56, 77] .

However, implementation of culture-independent testing methods in clinical microbiology will increase over the next decade not only due to the continued development of multiplexing methods (real-time PCR, liquid suspension bead-based arrays) but also due to improvements in future generations of sequencing platforms that increase capacity and read length while reducing cost (Martinez and Nelson, 2010) .

This is reflected by the adaptation of particular pathogens to their hosts, the efficiency of the parasite to exploit the host effectively for replication and, crucially, the transmission to new hosts. In order to ascertain the specific role of each host species in pathogen epidemiology, it is imperative to combine large screening efforts, molecular-based phylogeny approaches and infection experiments, which unfortunately is rarely met. Compounded with this, we have limited understanding of the role of mallards as hosts for pathogens: are these birds the central reservoir, important but not central to the epidemiology or merely permissive to spillover infection? Moreover, variation in pathogen phenotypic characteristics is usually unknown, such as variation in virulence, pathogenicity, survival in the environment and duration of infection. These properties will depend on both host and pathogen and likely are variable among genetic variants and/or strains of the pathogen. Regardless, our current catalogue of disease-causing agents is probably an underestimation, and with the advent of deep sequencing and more sensitive screening tools, we will likely uncover numerous new disease-causing agents such as picornaviruses (Woo et al. 2010) or disentangle complex epidemiology of known pathogens in new hosts such as coronaviruses ).",12.849018544067095,9.695747639276785

For example, although the 7b gene of feline coronavirus is easily lost upon virus adaptation to cell culture, it is strictly maintained in naturally occurring strains and its loss was correlated with reduced virulence (Herrewegh et al., 1995) . Recent studies also showed that some of these group-specific genes are not essential for viral replication in cell culture, but their deletion, by reverse genetics, attenuates the virus in the natural host (de Haan et al., 2002; Ortego et al., 2003; Haijema et al., 2004) .",11.40824872739843,6.994176863339603

Many of the interactions might be a result of a lack of adaptation by the virus. The viruses that have been discussed in this article are recent pathogens of humans and might not have been in circulation for a sufficient time to have adapted. In the case of influenza, which is the pathogen that has circulated in humans for the longest period of time, the level of glycosylation has gradually increased with a concomitant attenuation of disease. As yet, all of these pathogens are of concern to global public health and an understanding of the role of cellular processes such as glycosylation in the biology of viral infection is one step towards developing successful treatment strategies. Much has been learned about the importance of glycosylation to proper viral protein function and the interaction between pathogen-associated carbohydrate and portions of the innate and adaptive immune systems. This knowledge can now be applied to the development of novel therapies to strike at this vital element in virus biology. Recently, investigators have discovered plantand bacterial-derived lectins that have high specificity for the carbohydrate found on the virus surface. These compounds, which include the cyanobacterial cyanovirin-N (CV-N), plant lectins Urtica dioica agglutinin, Galanthus nivalia and concanavalin A, can interfere with attachment and also directly neutralize HIV-1 and influenza virus in vitro [68] [69] [70] [71] .

The genome organization of Ark DPI is 5 0 -Rep1a-Rep1b-S-3-M-5-N-3 0 , as shown in Fig. 1 . In this comparative study, we found only 21 nucleotides differences between virulent and avirulent ArkDPI strains, which result in 17 amino acids changes (see Table 2 ). A single amino acid substitution was found in the p87 protein at nucleotide position 1,107. A similar kind of single amino acid change was reported previously in this coding region (nt 529-1,263) when challenge and vaccine viruses of the M41 strain were compared [14] . The role of the p87 protein is not clearly defined, but it may have a negative effect on PL pro -mediated proteolytic cleavage at the p87/p195 site [30] . The amino acid substitution found in the region of PL1 pro at position 945 is unpredictable, because PL1 pro , is inactive in IBV [30] . Two nucleotide differences were observed in viral proteinase PL2 pro and one of them is silent. The amino acid substitution from acidic Asp to neutral Gly found in PL2 pro region could be considered an important one. This amino acid substitution is very close to the active catalytic site (nucleophile cysteine) of PL2 pro and could possibly interfere with proteolytic processing. Therefore, we speculate that this amino acid substitution may restrict viral maturation or replication. The amino acid substitution found in domain Y and p9 is difficult to predict because of role of both is unknown. A substitution of Ser to Pro was found in the virulent strain at nucleotide position 10,036 in the HD3 domain. Earlier, it was shown that some of the ORF1aencoded hydrophobic domains are involved in membrane association of the replication complex of members of the Nidovirales [21, 24, 25] . Hence, this substitution might be critical for adaptation of virus by controlling the replication rate of the virus in different hosts. One amino acid substitution was found in the growth-factor-like (GFL) protein, which is involved in the growth factor signaling pathway [16] .

This is most evident between FLAV U1 and U2 (also referred to as the 19K protein) that share ∼20% amino acid sequence identity and ∼58% similarity (Fig. 4B ). There is no second consecutive ORF in the FLAV N gene corresponding to WONV U4 but there is a small alternative ORF within the N gene encoding a polypeptide of 66 amino acids (7.9 kDa). In addition to the N, P, M, G and L proteins, three virus-induced proteins have been reported in FLAV infected cells and in virions (Boyd and Whitaker-Dowling, Table 1. 1988).

For example, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the cellular receptor used by the newly emergent Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), is absent in mice. Therefore, a virus native to another species must often be adapted to mice through multiple passages. This technique selects for viruses with mutations that increase virulence, but may also alter pathogenesis. In the case of SARS-CoV, 15 passages of the Urbani strain in young BALB/c mice resulted in a virus (MA15) that is lethal in mice. Aspects of disease seen in severe human cases of SARS were reproduced by MA15 as the result of six coding mutations associated with host adaptation. On the other hand, adaptation of yellow fever virus to mice altered the disease from hepatitis to encephalitis, and the mouse-adapted virus was encephalitogenic (not hepatotropic) in nonhuman primates. Over the last few decades, numerous techniques to alter the mouse genome have been developed.

During the infection process, C. albicans has the potential to adapt to different host niches and to survive the attack of phagocytes, such as macrophages. Previous evidence suggests that microevolution plays a central role in this process. For example, Forche et al. [1] found that C. albicans rapidly reacts to its environment by undergoing chromosome-level genetic variations, which are sufficient to generate new variants of C. albicans. In this study, we used an in vitro experimental microevolution approach to identify factors and activities necessary for survival within, and escape from, macrophages. Using this system, we also investigated whether C. albicans can utilise alternative signal transduction pathways under selective pressure. First, we analysed a range of mutants with defects in hyphal-formation for capacity to escape from macrophages. Normally, four hours post-infection, more than 50 % of wild type cells escaped from macrophages. Although none of the tested mutants achieved such high escape rates, many were capable of lower levels of escape. An efg1/cph1 double mutant, on the other hand, was entirely unable to escape. We therefore chose this strain for further investigation and monitored its adaptation to macrophages during a series of co-culture passages. After 23 passages, the efg1/cph1 mutant began to exhibit dramatic phenotypic changes and formed filaments. These filaments enabled the evolved mutant to escape from macrophages. Surprisingly, the strain was also now able to form filaments under other conditions and, in contrast to the original efg1/cph1 mutant, has regained the ability to invade epithelial cells. Furthermore, it has significantly higher virulence in an alternative model of infection. The phenotype was stable in the absence of selective pressure, indicating that microevolutionary events have bypassed the reliance on Cph1 and Efg1 for filamentation. QRT-PCR, PFGE and high-throughput sequencing did not indicate major chromosomal rearrangements. These and further investigations of the genetic cause of the adaptation will yield insights into the genomic and genetic plasticity of this important fungal pathogen during adaptation to specific host niches.",11.935097881608353,6.420514363009334

However, the quasispecies might occasionally experience deep reorganizations that are not reflected in the consensus sequence. Variants at memory levels are an example, since those genomes carry mutations that, in spite of never being detected in the consensus sequence, can have a profound influence in the adaptation of the population. When the environmental conditions are relatively constant the virus population can be maintained in evolutionary stasis, with the result that the consensus sequence keeps almost invariant through time. This situation usually occurs in viruses infecting the same host during very long time periods, as influenza in birds or hantavirus in rodents. Evolutionary stasis does not mean, at short evolutionary time scales, that the mutation rates decrease: It represents instead an equilibrium between mutation and selection that yields a consensus sequence mostly without changes. A virus that is kept invariant for a long time can experience an acceleration in the fixation of mutations when the environment is altered, as it occurs during the infection of a new host. A recently studied example is the coronavirus causing the SARS epidemic [107] .

Renaming the believed causative agent of COVID-19 to indicate it as a type of SARS does not alleviate the concern that different strains use different mechanisms: very few point mutations might change the modes of cell entry. The entry types with represented examples are as follows [4] . Genus Alphacoronavirus: human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV), porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus (PEDV), and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV).

Genomicsbased methods have already allowed a significant advance in our understanding of the evolution and spread of bacterial pathogens. In the developed world, whole genome sequencing is being established for routine use in clinical microbiology, both for tracking transmission and spread of pathogens, as well as prediction of drugresistance profiles, allowing rapid outbreak detection and analysis in almost real-time, as evolution occurs in the wild [54 ] . Except for influenza A viruses, genetic correlates (surrogates) of the ability of a zoonotic pathogen to efficiently overcome the interspecies barrier and allow rapid spread within the human population are poorly defined. Any emergence of novel molecular patterns in microorganisms results from an evolutionary process driven by factors not encoded for in genomes and determined by the frequencies of genome alterations occurring under natural conditions. The broad introduction of 'omic's' technologies, advances in global data exchange capabilities and the advent of (bio)informatic tools allowing processing of large data collections ('big data') have put the technical capacity to integrate phenotypic data from clinical, from epidemiological and from experimental studies in vitro and in vivo at our disposal, with relevant target species like livestock in particular, and allow genome-wide association studies.

TI cells contain abundant caveolae (see Fig. 8 -2D) and express caveolin-1. 42 Caveolae have diverse functions including endocytosis and membrane trafficking, 43 and, in addition, they are believed to play an important protective role by providing a source of membrane to protect against cellular lysis. Recent studies of TI cells injured in vitro have confirmed that membrane repair by lipid recruitment is facilitated by the caveolar endocytic pathway and by the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton close to the site of wounding. 44, 45 On the basis of studies in animal models of lung injury, it has been believed that the injured alveolar epithelium is repaired by proliferation and transdifferentiation of TII cells to TI cells, with TI cells regarded as terminally differentiated cells without proliferative potential. 46, 47 However, on the basis of recent in vitro studies, cultured TI cells have been shown to have a high proliferative potential. 48, 49 Both the potential proliferative capacity and phenotypic plasticity of the TI cell in vitro raise the possibility that TI cells in vivo may participate in lung repair after injury.",10.955885198422864,7.446438834416874

It is well-known in clinical microbiology that certain important pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis, takes a relatively long time (6-8 weeks) to grow and manifest the subtlest phenotypic characteristics such as its volatile fatty acid profi le . This length of time is, ostensibly, short compared with the animal and plant species with generation time exceeding tens of years and should not impress the zoologists and botanists. Yet it is only common knowledge that phenotypic characteristics of plants and animals, such as the presence and color of fl owers, presence of appendages or cranial size, can be affected by environmental factors, the exact stage of growth and life cycle. A relevant example may be cited from our fi eld: certain fungal species, collectively known as the dimorphic fungi, exhibit a yeast phase and a mould phase. Not only are the two phases very distinct by visual inspection, they are usually associated with very different profi les of metabolite production (Woo et al., 2010 and potential reproductive strategy . What may complicate the issue further is the reversible nature of the phase switch (Woo et al., 2003c) ; so if the switch had not been recognized and the two phases classifi ed into relatively unrelated groups by a phenetic approach it could produce a taxonomy that is more perplexing than useful.

In recent times, Western societies have witnessed the rise of a new class of emerging (and re-emerging) pathogens that are extremely insidious and virulent, including, to name just a few: the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, HIV/AIDS, West Nile, Huntavirus, Ebola, the Lyme disease virus, the avian flu virus, the monkey pox virus, and the hoof-and-mouth pathogen (Drexler, 2003; Levy and Fischetti, 2003; Garrett, 1994 , Institute of Medicine, 1992 . The bacteria E. coli O157:H7 involved in the contamination of the Walkerton groundwater is another example from this new group of pathogenic threats. The emergence of these new pathogens has several important implications for planning in general and rural planning in particular. First, it needs to be recognized that a wide range of social and environmental factors are involved in the evolution of these pathogens as well as in the onset of the respective disease epidemics themselves. Such factors include: ecological, human demographic and behavioural changes; travel and commerce; technology and industry; microbial adaptation and change; and the breakdown of public health measures. For this reason, whether contamination occurs within the groundwater source, through the food distribution system, or through the air and soils, the wider contextual factors that could amplify or mitigate the spread of the pathogen need to be considered as part of the assessment and planning process. In particular, the possible interactions of such factors need to be studied. For example, as is argued below, the need to monitor groundwater for pathogens may not be possible under the tight fiscal circumstances that many resource-based communities face.",11.748137191834223,8.345934804842631

As discussed in this review, genetics-based variability in the disease outcomes evidenced by animal models, and in particular different inbred murine strains, represents important progress in the field, at least in the context of P. aeruginosa infection. Overall, these studies highlight how mouse models can be exploited to mirror host genetic diversity and the associated host defense variations. Future studies may exploit CC mice and mouse models of P. aeruginosa infection and will reveal genetic loci associated with the severity of acute or chronic lung infection as previously demonstrated for other respiratory pathogens (Ferris et al. 2013; Gralinski et al. 2015) .

Conclusions and Overview References","Diversification of viruses within infected organisms, even when it involves limited genetic change, is of consequence for viral pathogenesis and persistence. This is because one or a few mutations may suffice to change important biological properties of viruses (such as host cell tropism, resistance to antibodies, to cytotoxic T lymphocytes or to inhibitors, among other traits; Table I ). Small numbers of mutations in components of mutant spectra are easily attainable by diversifying populations of viruses during acute or chronic infections. Even when a mutation that confers a phenotypic change results in a modest fitness decrease, compensatory mutations can have an opportunity to rescue genomes with normal or nearly normal fitness values (Cassady et al., 2002; Escarmís et al., 1999 Escarmís et al., , 2002 Lá zaro et al., 2002; Liang et al., 1998; Nijhuis et al., 1999; Wang et al., 1996; Yuan and Shih, 2000) .

Viral fitness determined ex vivo may be a relevent indicator of disease progression in vivo (Ball et al., 2003) . Within-host variation is the first step in the process of long-term diversification of viruses in successions of transmission events from infected to susceptible hosts. Comparison of consensus nucleotide sequences of independent isolates of the same virus originated from a single source of infection allows a calculation of the rate of evolution. As expected from the complex quasispecies dynamics, rates of evolution for RNA viruses are not constant with time (a ''clock'' does not operate) and are often in the range of 10 À2 to 10 À4 substitutions per nucleotide and year. These values can also vary for different genomic segments of the same virus. In sharp contrast, rates of evolution for cellular genes have been estimated in 10 À8 to 10 À9 substitutions per nucleotide and year. Interestingly, DNA viruses, even those with small genome size, display widely different rates of evolution. As an example, such rates have been estimated in 1.7 Â 10 À4 substitutions per nucleotide and year for canine parvovirus and in the range of 1 Â 10 À7 to 3 Â 10 À8 substitutions per nucleotide and year for some papovaviruses (reviewed in Domingo et al., 2001) .",12.287094334867408,7.54028879904487

The frequency of mutations in DNA viruses may be several orders of magnitude lower than in RNA viruses, whose replicative enzyme, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, lacks proof-reading activity. The error frequency in RNA viruses is also variable, and, in some of them, any newly synthesized genomic RNA molecule contains on an average a mutation. Such viruses exist on the edge of mutational catastrophe: even a few-fold increase in the error frequency may result in population extinction. Nevertheless, a certain level of replicative infidelity is highly advantageous for viruses since it confers a potential for changing and adaptation. For example, replicative errors are one of the major factors contributing to the development of drug-resistance and hence to the scarcity of efficacious antiviral drugs. Interestingly, a single point mutation in the poliovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase increases its fidelity several-fold. However, the more accurate mutant is less fit: not only it develops drug-resistance less readily, but is also less neurovirulent Kirkegaard, 2003, 2005; Vignuzzi et al., 2006) . A heterogeneous population, as a group, may have advantages over a more homogeneous population. The advantages may be due not only to a greater potential for adaptation but also to the possibility of mutual cooperation.",18.548014147644004,11.631603259094224

One is mitigation, i.e. to limit the risk factors, and the other is adaptation, which means that although all efforts must be made in seeking to limit the negative impacts of industrial development, some degree of inevitable environmental or agriculture changes should be accepted. Mitigation and adaptation share the same ultimate purpose, which is to reduce undesirable impacts (Swart and Raes, 2007) . The bottom line is that the more effective mitigations undertaken now, the less need will there be for adaptation in the future. The most successful example is the current responses to climate change, which is undertaken by a majority of all countries (Dowlatabadi, 2007; Willbanks and Sathaye, 2007) . However, even the most rigorous mitigation efforts cannot avoid further impacts of climate change because of historically committed emissions, making action on adaptation essential. At the same time, adaptation cannot be allowed to rule indefinitely, so urgent mitigation is needed to avoid the worst effects of climate change. Investigations needed to answer how to best balance these demands are proposed to be implemented in community-based studies involved by local stakeholders to get more evidence-based results (Willbanks and Sathaye, 2007) .",20.444908564675238,10.50549955853416

The most elegant work came from studies of gradual adaptation of MHV to Syrian baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells. The resulting passaged virus grew efficiently in murine, hamster, human, and primate cells, clearly demonstrating the ability of coronaviruses to cross species barriers (Baric et al., 1997) . This report was remarkably prescient, coming less than 10 years before the natural experiment of SARS-CoV transmission from animals into humans. The SARS epidemic created a unique opportunity to study the changes in an animal virus as it encountered a previously unexposed human population, both geographically and temporally. A study of 63 isolates of SARSCoV, including animal and human strains was performed by the Chinese SARS consortium to determine rates of mutation along the course of the epidemic (Chinese, 2004) . Complete sequencing of the isolates allowed detailed direct and statistical analysis of adaptation in SARS-CoV, and it led to conclusions about the most variable regions of the genome during the course of the epidemic. As expected, the S coding region demonstrated the most mutations resulting in non-synonymous amino acid substitutions, at a rate indicating significant positive selective pressure, and in a manner suggesting early rapid change and late purifying adaptive changes (Chinese, 2004) . Surprisingly, however, the ORF1a polyprotein showed a rate of nonsynonymous substitutions similar to that in the S gene, also tracking with early rapid change and late purifying mutations (Fig. 1) . The ORF1b polyprotein, in contrast, had little evidence of rapid change or positive selective pressure.",15.202538216759256,8.870856511222643

A remarkable example of this is the 1918 Spanish flu, which killed about 30-50 million people, or ∼2% of those infected. In fact, influenza virus is in most cases a nonpathogenic or slightly pathogenic avian enteric virus. To infect a human, an avian flu virus should change its receptor specificity, which depends on the interaction of viral hemagglutinin (HA) with a cellular membrane glycoprotein receptor. Generally, it is sufficient to change only two amino acid residues in the avian HA to allow it to efficiently recognize the human receptor. Such a change in the host range may be achieved by either mutations in the avian HA or acquisition by an avian virus of the HA gene from human influenza virus as a result of genetic exchange (reassortment) between these viruses during mixed infections. Adaptation of flu viruses to humans may also require mutations in other viral genes. The severity of the infection depends not only on the efficiency of viral reproduction in the new host but also on the balance and interplay between host defense and viral counter-defense mechanisms.",13.102477020015286,8.311887245472757

Through cross-host transmission events these viruses may substantially broaden their host range. Animal-to-human zoonotic transmissions led to worldwide spread of viruses such as hCoV-OC43 and NL63, that mainly cause common cold like symptoms in humans. The recent zoonotic introduction of two more pathogenic viruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, on the other hand revealed the damage these viruses can do to human society. Evidence that SARS-CoV emerged through zoonotic transmission came from genetic analyses of virus isolates from infected humans and palm civets during the SARS epidemic [1] . The virus underwent rapid adaptation in both hosts, primarily in the receptor binding domain of the viral spike protein, to allow more efficient infection of human cells. Subsequent surveillance studies identified at least 60 novel bat coronaviruses worldwide, including ancestors of SARS-CoV. Now there is substantial evidence that Chinese horseshoe bats are natural reservoirs of SARS-CoV like viruses [2, 3] . These viruses were isolated from bat fecal samples and they use the same host viral receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), from humans, civets and Chinese horseshoe bats to enter cells [4 ] . Recent studies further document the capacity of this virus to jump the species barrier [5] . Currently, twelve years after the outbreak several potential scenarios are revealed that might explain the emergence of SARS-CoV. Although adaptation of the virus that led to a pathogenic variant may have primarily taken place in the civet cat, it may also have occurred first in humans and spread subsequently to civet cats. Alternatively, recombination events between viruses present in bats may occur relatively frequently, leading to variants in bats that are already pathogenic for humans [5] . In this review we summarize the current evidence found so far for cross host transmission of MERS-CoV, a virus that was identified three years ago.",15.769294545476239,7.709639421998073

The spike protein of CoV HKU4 binds to DPP4, however, it does not mediate viral entry into human cells because of the inability to become activated by human endogenous proteases [9, 10] . In fact, two residue differences between the two spikes account for their different capabilities to mediate viral entry into human cells [11] , revealing a potential adaptation of MERS-CoV to become more pathogenic in humans. Although these studies provide clues about the origin MERS-CoV, to date no close relative has been identified in bats that is capable of using DPP4. Studies in Saudi Arabia to investigate the presence of MERS-CoV in bats were unable to recover additional sequences beyond a 190-nt fragment from the conserved polymerase gene in a single specimen [12] . The subsequent characterization of an African bat virus closely related to MERS-CoV showed that this bat virus roots the phylogenetic tree of MERS-CoV [13, 14] . However, spike gene sequences obtained from bat CoVs characterized thus far are still phylogenetically distantly related to MERS-CoV. Theoretically the initial host switch from bats may have taken place in Africa. In the absence of hard evidence that bats act as the reservoir of current MERS-CoV zoonotic transmissions, subsequent studies focused on other animal species. Phylogenetic analysis of DPP4 indicated that human, macaque, horse, and rabbit DPP4 cluster together with bovine and porcine DPP4, which are somewhat more distantly related ( Figure 1 ). Small animals, including ferret and mice, are more divergent with respect to the DPP4 virus binding region [15] , which has consequences for MERS-CoV binding and capacity to infect cells [16] . In fact the presence of a glycosylation site in the virus binding domain of DPP4 prohibits MERS-CoV infection of these small animal species [17] . On the other hand several studies demonstrated the potential of MERS-CoV to infect cells of different species in vitro [16, 18] . Further experimental evidence is needed to prove their in vivo susceptibility to MERS-CoV. Besides receptor functionality, the distribution of the DPP4, presence of enzymes able to cleave the spike protein and cause fusion are potentially critical in the host range of MERS-CoV. Innate and specific host responses may negatively affect the outcome of the infection resulting in the inability of the virus to spread efficiently.",14.486638104093002,7.703184855292413

Fisher proposed that as the dimensionality of the phenotype increases, the probability of a mutation being beneficial decreases due to its pleiotropic effects and different dimensions of the phenotype. The phenotype dimensionality is defined by the number of organism's parts (phenotypic characters -denoted hereafter as n). Kimura and Orr then expanded Fisher's work and showed that Fisher underestimated the cost of complexity by not incorporating the lower fixation probability of mutations with a limited phenotypic effect following the effect of stochastic drift (Kimura, 1983; Orr, 2000) . Orr (2000) further showed that the average fitness increase rate is inversely proportional to n for small and medium n and much faster for large n. In other words, the adaptation rate of complex organisms is lower than the one of simpler ones. Welch and Waxman (2003) examined the robustness of Orr's model by introducing different mechanisms (such as varying magnitude of mutations, modularity (Wagner, 1996; Wagner and Altenberg, 1996; Baatz and Wagner, 1997 ) and a constant mean mutational chance per phenotypic character). They showed that the relation between the complexity and adaptation rate is robust to most variations of the model. Gillespie (1994 Gillespie ( , 1984 Gillespie ( , 1983 ) extended Fisher's model and proposed the mutational landscape model. Orr (2003 Orr ( , 2002 further extended his work and found different patterns that characterize the adaptation of DNA sequences.

One clear lesson learned from virus infection studies in the CC and preCC so far is that phenotypic correlations present within any set of characterized founder strains or knockouts are likely to be broken apart within the CC, unless there are strong causal relationships between the correlated phenotypes. For example, a complete disassociation was seen between different aspects of SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) induced pathology and disease within the preCC population [40] . Furthermore, QTL mapping will often show that distinct loci affect individual, distinct pathologic traits, as seen in both the influenza preCC and SARS-CoV preCC studies [38, 40] . These results highlight one main impetus for utilizing GRPs such as the CC (i.e., the discovery of novel phenotypic relationships and distinct genetic markers), but they also point to a critical consideration in the design and analysis of studies in these systems.

The name is derived from Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking Glass, in which the Red Queen states, ""Now here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place."" Clarke and colleagues (1994) examined fitness changes in distinct competing clonal populations of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) cultured in vitro. To accomplish this, they used quantitative relative fitness assays to measure fitness changes in VSV populations that initially were competitively equal. When sequentially passaged together, one of the VSV populations was inevitably totally displaced by the other. ""Winner"" and ""loser"" strains were then mixed with the ancestral wild-type strains to examine absolute fitness changes. In all cases, the derived virus populations were able to outcompete and displace their ancestral populations. In this important experiment, evolutionary change continually proceeded in such a way that overall survivability of present generations surpassed that of previous ones and was lower than those of the future. In other words, populations are competing in a ""zero sum game,"" where they must adaptively ""run"" just to stay at the same relative fitness level (Van Valen, 1973) . This effect has only been experimentally examined in VSV; therefore, whether or not it occurs in the evolution of other viruses (especially DNA viruses) cannot been addressed here.",12.509720943221474,8.680040361133376

The direction and extent of this change is determined by a combination of stochastic and environmental factors that are specific for a given time, space, and taxon. Therefore, the offspring of individuals or groups selected for reproduction in one biological circumstance are by no means guaranteed to thrive in the following generation since the selective environment may be slightly or radically different. An admittedly poorly defined and at times controversial evolutionary term, adaptation essentially refers to characters that arise and persist as a result of such selection and thus confer upon their bearers the ability to succeed genetically in a specific environment.

Influenza viruses found in their natural hosts do not seem to pose a threat, however, once disturbed or have migrated to another host there are two means in which they can enter the human species: assortment or adaptation in an intermediated host (Gregor, 2005) . The increase of CAFOs incorporating rice-duck farming (Gregor, 2005; Clauss and Osterhaus, 1998) , pigwaterfowl-fish aquaculture (Gregor, 2005; Taubenberger and Morens, 2006) ; and live poultry markets (Gregor, 2005; Shortridge, 1999) are all implicated in the emergence of an influenza virus with pandemic potential. With the expansion of the intensive poultry CAFOs to 10-millionbird-mega-farms could account for the dramatic genetic shift resulting from the change in the ecology and epidemiology of avian influenza and other EIDs. In China alone, there are now over 10 billion potential reservoirs EIDs to exist and change (Woo et al., 2006) . This translates into the greater risk of genetic drift and a greater degree of reassortment by just simple probability to a novel strain. This model alone can offer with evidence that Galliform species (i.e., terrestrial birds such as chickens, turkeys and quail) may serve as a suitable intermediate hosts to influenza to convert to more virulent strains. The drivers of pathogen emergence change the overall pattern of the pathogen-host-environment interactions leading to either (i) a pathogen showing up in a novel host; (ii) a mutant pathogen with novel traits causing more frequent or more severe disease while remaining in the same host; or (iii) an invasion process involving a novel geographic area (Engering et al., 2013) . The disease emergence starts with an existing disease complex or pathogen-host-environment complex. While the three emergence categories are broadly speaking distinct, there are also gray areas, between existing and emerging disease events and at the interface of the three disease emergence categories, creating ambiguity in where the disease will emerge and it what way.",11.670092272202142,6.041175793214627

Spillover from sylvatic cycles could potentially generate large outbreaks [100] . However, the limited detection of sylvatic DENV is partially attributed to misdiagnosis of human DENV infections or confusion with other etiological agents that share similar clinical signs and symptoms, or nondetection due to subclinical presentation. Another possible explanation for the limited spillover potential is the requirement for adaptation to peridomestic vectors and/or human hosts.

The extent of DENV diversity was examined with similar methodologies as those used previously [8, 61, 67] . Early studies based on partial genomic consensus sequences indicated that adaptation in mosquito cells, unlike adaptation in vertebrates or alternating cycles, has a minimal effect on DENV evolution. These results contrasted with those for WNV [84, 102] , where genetic diversity was shown to correspond to substantial phenotypic diversity. This discrepancy could be attributed to the inherent limitation of consensus (Sanger) sequencing, where each nucleotide at a given position of the viral genome only reflects the majority and does not represent the true mutant swarm. Subsequently, a comprehensive study simulating the DENV transmission cycle or adaptive specialization in vertebrate or mosquito cell lines examined the trade-off hypothesis by employing clonal (plaque-purified, with a defined sequence) or passaged, uncloned (where the determined sequence represents the consensus of the population) DENV [62] . While an inherent limitation of this study was the utilization of consensus sequencing to monitor the evolution of viral populations, which could mask the presence of minority mutant populations, the data supported the hypothesis that releasing DENV from host alternation facilitates adaptation. However, there was limited support for the hypothesis that such alternation necessitates a fitness trade-off. An interesting observation of this study was that alternately passaged clonal DENV exhibited fitness gains, an observation attributed to the acquisition of both host cell-specific and amphi-cell-specific adaptations, or to recovery from fitness losses arising from bottlenecking due to biological cloning [62] . An equally important observation indicated that DENV adapted exclusively in the vertebrate cell line or alternating between vertebrate and mosquito host cells led to the emergence of a qualitatively and quantitatively distinct mutation spectrum from exclusive passage in the invertebrate cell line, which signifies the role of the depth and breadth of intrahost genetic diversity in shaping the adaptive phenotype [84] .",14.024158988362899,8.76787791241032

Furthermore, the results from some in vitro studies (St Louis encephalitis virus [SLEV]; e.g., [66] ) did not translate into in vivo adaptations, suggesting that cell culture observations may not be relevant to natural arbovirus transmission, in that monocultures do not accurately represent the complexity of multicellular hosts. Moreover, some studies employing the same virus and similar experimental designs have also shown incongruent results, suggesting that differences in cell infection conditions, including cell type, temperature, multiplicities of infection, number and length of passage series, passage histories of virus strains, use of cell lines with defective innate immune responses and ways of measuring viral fitness, may affect outcomes. To circumvent these issues, in vivo evolution studies using arthropod vectors and vertebrate models of infection that better represent natural arbovirus transmissions have supplemented in vitro studies. Building on related studies from 1975, which showed that the alphavirus Ross River virus serially passaged in mice became more virulent while Ross River virus passaged alternately between mice and A. aegypti did not (reviewed in [18] ), observations from in vivo studies largely support earlier in vitro conclusions. Artificially releasing an arbovirus from one host allows for specialization via increased fitness in the passaged host. VEEV passaged ten times in hamsters was five-times more fit than its progenitor, and mosquito-passaged VEEV was more infectious for mosquitoes [67] . In contrast to cell culture observations, alternately passaged VEEV experienced no detectable fitness gains in either host, supporting the idea that in vivo dual-host cycling selects for viruses that are adapted to both host types, but that fitness increases in both hosts are not a requisite for maintenance in alternating cycling [67] . Serial passage of WNV via inoculation into the C. pipiens thorax (artificially bypassing midgut infection) produced WNV that was more fit than its progenitor in C. pipiens, but that experienced no replication cost in chicks [68] . Using a more natural oral infection route that did not circumvent midgut infection, another WNV study found that chick-specialized virus showed fitness gains in chicks and C. pipiens, whereas mosquito-passaged virus experienced reduced fitness in chicks and little change in mosquitoes [69] , again supporting cell culture data showing that artificially releasing an arbovirus from host alternation allows for rapid fitness gains in the passaged host. The fact that fitness losses are not always observed in bypassed hosts in vivo suggests that while arboviruses experience fitness trade-offs via host alternation, host-specific adaptation to sequential passage sometimes comes at little cost in the bypassed host, especially for WNV. Studies with another flavivirus, SLEV, show somewhat conflicting results. Neither mosquito-specialized SLEV passaged by intrathoracic inoculation nor chick-passaged virus experienced gains in host-specific fitness, suggesting that SLEV may already be highly adapted to both invertebrate and avian hosts [70] . The disparities in patterns of in vivo adaptation between SLEV, WNV and VEEV may reflect virus-specific evolutionary traits (e.g., differences in host utilization, genome organization, rates of recombination, composition and breadth of mutant swarm, mechanisms of transmission and seasonality) or, alternatively, could result from differences in experimental designs. While intrathoracic inoculations ensured the infection of Culex mosquitoes in SLEV and some WNV studies [68, 70] , infection, replication and dissemination from the mosquito midgut may present additional selective constraints on the virus that were experimentally circumvented. To ensure high-titer blood meals for serial mosquito cycling, the VEEV study pooled multiple infected mosquitoes, which also potentially confounded results by representing viruses from many vector infections instead of a single mosquito [67] . Nevertheless, despite the problems of in vivo arbovirus evolution studies, the use of vectors and relevant vertebrate hosts in lieu of cells better simulates the complex environmental pressures faced by arboviruses.",11.650842150265161,8.24303411054111

Antigenic drift occurs because the virus' RNA polymerase has no proofreading function; therefore substitutions are introduced resulting in a somewhat predictable error rate between 1 3 10 23 and 8 3 10 23 substitutions per site per year. 8 Antigenic drift may contribute to the agent's ability to elude the host immune response, but generally it does not result in significant virulence changes in the virus. By contrast, antigenic shift can radically change the virus' pathogenic potential. Antigenic shift generally occurs by reassortment of heterologous influenza virus gene segments when the host is co-infected with two different influenza subtypes. The influenza genome is segmented and the gene segments of different influenza viruses can reassort to create unique viruses. 8 For example, if a host is co-infected with H5N1 and H3N2, then new reassortant viruses such as H5N2 and H3N1 can result. Antigenic shift can greatly increase virulence or host adaptation in a single viral generation. This shift may potentially advance zoonotic potential and certainly enhances the ability to elude the host immune response.",14.33772816831409,6.545245575915661

Given the increased ecologic pressures and widespread conversion of native forests into oil palm plantations and other agricultural settings in sylvatic DENV foci, the question of whether human strains could reinvade the forest cycle becomes epidemiologically relevant. Diallo and colleagues examined whether human DENV strains have lost fitness for transmission by sylvatic vectors by comparing the vector competence of sylvatic and various peridomestic populations of Senegalese mosquitoes using both human and sylvatic DENV-2 strains (reviewed in [42] ).

In addition, most investigators who applied human factors principles and methods to infection prevention issues assessed only one human factors element such as training, technology evaluations, or physical environment design. The most significant gap pertains to the limited use and application of formal HFE tools and methods. Human factors engineers have developed, tested, and validated rigorous formal techniques and tools in numerous domains. However, investigators assessing usability and those assessing the physical environment were the only ones who used rigorous HFE methods to address infection prevention issues. Moreover, few investigators have evaluated the interaction among human factors variables [57••] as described by the systems engineering initiative for patient safety (SEIPS) model. This model posits that people (e.g., healthcare workers) interact in a system that includes other people, the tasks they are doing, the organization (e.g., healthcare facility), the environment, and the available technology and tools [127, 128] . Pressure or change in one portion of the system causes pressure or change in the other portions. Thus, if people designing infection prevention interventions do not take into account the effect the intervention has on all portions of the system, the interventions are likely to be ineffective. For example, if well-designed, usable hand hygiene technology is placed in a location where healthcare workers cannot see it or access it, the device will not promote use. If this device is placed where healthcare workers can see it and access it easily but they have not been trained to use it or trained when to use it, the device is unlikely to increase compliance.",11.036702744496907,5.598812592344051

A large number of experimental arbovirus evolution studies have focused on understanding mechanisms of fitness trade-offs in order to understand the unique ability of RNA arboviruses to simultaneously evolve in alternate hosts. These studies employed similar experimental designs: arboviruses were serially passaged in vertebrate or invertebrate cells, or alternately passaged between the two cell types to simulate natural cycling, and the fitness of progeny viruses was assessed relative to progenitors. Studies of this type reveal three general patterns of arbovirus evolution: fitness gains after serial passage in vertebrate or invertebrate cells (except in certain cases [60] ) and losses in bypassed host cell types (DENV, EEEV, Sindbis, vesicular stomatitis [VSV] and Rift Valley fever viruses) [18, [61] [62] [63] [64] , reduced fitness in novel cell types (VSV) [65] and fitness increases after alternating passage (DENV, EEEV, Sindbis and VSV) [18, 54, 61, 62] .

Once adaptation has taken place, the adapted virus may lose or maintain the pathogenic potential for the former (donor) host (as an example of maintenance of virulence for a donor and recipient host in FMDV see Nuñez et al. , 2007 ) . A core (or basal) genetic composition of a viral pathogen may be in itself a predictor of pathogenic potential, as profusely documented with natural or laboratory-generated, attenuated variants of many viral pathogens. To take infl uenza A virus and the threat of a human infl uenza pandemics as examples, out of the 16 hemagglutinin (H) and 9 neuraminidase (N) subtypes circulating among animal reservoirs, some potentially threatening forms being more carefully kept under surveillance include H 5 N 1 , H 7 N 7 , H 9 N 2 , and H 2 N 2 viruses. The expansion of the H 5 N 1 subtype among wild and domestic avian species and human contacts since 2005 has resulted in over 300 human cases in nearly 50 countries, with more than 50% deaths, as well as the killing of millions of poultry ( Wright et al. , 2007 ) . Key parameters for an avian infl uenza virus to give rise to a human infl uenza pandemic include acquisition of receptorrecognition specifi city for human cells, and the capacity for effi cient human-to-human transmission ( Parrish and Kawaoka, 2005 ; Suzuki, 2005 ) . This capacity can be expressed as the basic reproductive ratio (Ro) which is the average number of infected contacts from each infected host (review in Nowak and May, 2000 ) . "" Epidemiologic fi tness "" has been used to describe (through samplings of defi nitory genomic sequences, diagnostic surveys, etc.) the capacity of a virus to become dominant (relative to related viruses or variants) during epidemic outbreaks ( Domingo, 2007 ) . In the case of human infl uenza virus, the acquisition of high epidemiological fi tness depends on multiple gene products. Critical substitutions in H may modify the receptorbinding specifi city of infl uenza viruses, and such substitutions have been found in minority subpopulations of infl uenza virus in several surveys. In one study, two substitutions in H identifi ed in a human infl uenza virus from a fatal human case, were shown to modify the receptor-binding preference of H of a H 5 N 1 virus from sialic acid-2,3 galactose (associated with replication in avian hosts) to both sialic acid-2,3 galactose and sialic acid-2,6 galactose, both associated with binding to human-type receptors, each expressed preferentially in different sites of the human respiratory tract ( Auewarakul et al. , 2007 ) . Thus, in infl uenza virus, and probably many other pathogenic viruses, both epidemiologic fi tness and replicative fi tness are multigenic traits ( Grimm et al. , 2007 ) .",13.378976936516075,7.65035827595186

Fitness is a complex parameter that measures the degree of adaptation of a living organism or simple replicons to a specifi c environment (as general reviews see Williams, 1992 , and Reznick and Travis, 1996 ) . For viruses, fi tness values have been measured as the relative ability of two competing viruses to produce infectious progeny reviewed in Domingo and Holland, 1997 ; Quiñones-Mateu and Arts, 2006 ) . In the standard protocol, competitions are started by infecting cells or organisms with a mixture of a reference wild-type virus (given arbitrarily a fi tness value of 1) and the virus to be tested, in known proportions. The progeny viruses are used to initiate a second round of infection, and the process is repeated a number of times (serial infections). Then, the logarithm of the proportion of the two competing viruses at each passage defi nes a fi tness vector, the slope of which is the logarithm of the fi tness of the test virus relative to the reference virus ( Figure 4 .1 ). The two competing viruses must be distinguishable by some phenotypic trait (e.g. a clear difference in the ability to replicate in the presence of an antibody or a drug) or by some genetic change, such as nucleotide substitutions that allow the proportion of the two viruses to be determined by densitometry of a sequencing gel or by their specifi c amplifi cation by real time reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using discriminatory oligonucleotide primers.

In efforts to isolate the YFV, these scientists placed Asian species rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) in sentinel cages atop forest canopy level platforms in the Zika Forest area located near Entebbe, Uganda, presumably in a location where they could serve as potential hosts for the local mosquito population known to be vectors of the YFV. Blood samples isolated from one of these ""sentinel"" rhesus macaques (monkey 766) when injected into the brains of Swiss albino mice led to sickness of these mice. Homogenates of brain tissues from these sick mice led to the isolation of several filterable viruses, amongst one that was called the Zika virus766 because of the forest and the number of the monkey (hence, its name) [4, 5] . These viruses were also isolated from mosquito populations from the same location and thus reasoned to be circulating and being kept endemic by virus host interactions between the indigenous monkey species (that include 13 species with the colobus species monkey being predominant) and mosquitoes. The fact that the virus was isolated from ""sentinel"" Asian rhesus macaques implies that there must have been an adaptation of the virus from the African monkey species to the Asian monkey species (jumping of species). Whether such adaptation was instrumental in further transmission of this virus and whether such adaptation led to increased pathogenicity remains unknown. It should be noted that sera collected from blood samples of several local individuals residing in the same area during the same time period were found to contain antibodies against the Zika virus presumably suggesting that the virus was already circulating in the human population. However, there were no reports of any disease. What is not clear is the specificity of the antibody test that was utilized at the time since there is considerable cross reactivity among the flaviviruses. It was first isolated from a human in 1969 in Nigeria, though the illness caused by the virus, Zika fever or Zika disease has been known to infect humans since the early 1950s [6] .

However, a rigorous proof of the association is lacking. Moreover, most of the published studies have focused on the association of immune assay results with outcomes that can be clearly defined and captured (eg, survival or NRM) rather than with infections.

Using the ferret model, we trace the evolutionary pathway by which an avian-like virus evolves the capacity for mammalian replication and airborne transmission. During initial infection, within-host HA diversity increased drastically. Then, airborne transmission fixed two polymerase mutations that do not confer a detectable replication advantage. In later transmissions, selection fixed advantageous HA1 variants. Transmission initially involved a ''loose'' bottleneck, which became strongly selective after additional HA mutations emerged. The stringency and evolutionary forces governing between-host bottlenecks may therefore change throughout host adaptation. Mutations occurred in multiple combinations in transmitted viruses, suggesting that mammalian transmissibility can evolve through multiple genetic pathways despite phenotypic constraints.

Deciphering the mechanisms of any disease requires a deep knowledge of how multiple and concurrent signal-transduction pathways operate and are deregulated. Inescapably, the intricacies of signaling pathways, which are often highly interconnected and temporally and spatially regulated, can be dissected only by systemlevel approaches. Coupled with compendium analysis, systems biology has the potential to discover novel pro-host therapeutic targets. By providing a more robust overview of the host cellular machinery and its response and interaction with a virus, these kinds of analyses offer inroads toward the development of innovative therapeutics that can act in concert with the host defense mechanism. Several notable case studies support the use of full systems-scale analyses in rational antiviral drug development.

Synthesizing our data and previous studies, we offer the following conceptual framework to explain our observations, acknowledging that expanded studies are necessary to confirm its broader application. We propose that the stringency of transmission bottlenecks and the main evolutionary forces driving them may change throughout the host adaptation process. We speculate that at earlier stages of host adaptation, there may not be one ''most fit'' virus that is able to outcompete the rest of the population after transmission to localized regions of the respiratory tract (Karlsson et al., 2015; Lakdawala et al., 2015; Matrosovich et al., 2004) . A non-mutually exclusive hypothesis is that a larger inoculum may be required to found infection in the absence of a single highly fit variant. These hypotheses could explain the surprising finding that the first transmission bottleneck was loose, even though relatively few ''avian-like'' viruses would be expected to be fit for transmission in mammals. Indeed, we speculate that viruses that are well adapted for transmission in a particular host species would again exhibit loose transmission bottlenecks, as most variants would be of similar transmission fitness; the recent observation of loose genetic bottlenecks in transmission of seasonal influenza viruses among human household contacts supports this hypothesis (Poon et al., 2016) .",14.299805388893777,6.020421014344824

Another research group had similar findings when analyzing the virus in eight cats that died of FIP, in that extraintestinal virus from FIP lesions in the majority of cases (74%) had deletional mutations in the 3c gene, leading to truncation of the protein, while fecal virus in all cats had an intact 3c gene and presumably functional 3c gene product. 225 One phenotypic change in the virus associated with FIP disease production appears to be efficiency of replication in monocytes and macrophages, in that viruses causing FIP have acquired significant tropism for macrophages. Although FECV may spread beyond the intestines, it does so at relatively low levels, probably because of a poor ability to replicate in monocytes and macrophages. 144, 192, 269 The virus of FIP, on the other hand, replicates at high levels in macrophages and may disseminate throughout the body. Macrophage tropism appears to reside in a region of the spike protein. 254 Quantitative differences in viral RNA levels in the blood of cats with and without FIP have been found. 143 Rising amounts of viral RNA in the blood seen in end-stage disease may indicate enhanced viral replication and disease progression. This increased viral replicative capacity may be a key element of FIP pathogenesis. It is likely that the viral properties responsible for development of FIP do not lie in a single or, even necessarily, the same mutation in all cases, but instead lie in the high mutability of the virus prevalence of FIP. 91 In addition, higher interferon-gamma concentrations were associated with FIP lesions, indicating that, at least at the tissue level, cell-mediated immunity may contribute to lesion development. 91 In particular, it indicates that local activation of macrophages by interferon-gamma may be occurring, leading to enhanced viral replication. 22 In contrast, a systemic increase in interferon-gamma concentrations, as indicated by elevated expression in blood, may protect infected cats from disease. 89,91",12.763459404060605,8.888210795235908

This mixing gives the progeny virus the phenotypic properties (e.g., cell tropism) dependent on the proteins incorporated into the particle, without any genetic change. Subsequent generations of viruses inherit and display the original parental phenotypes. This process can occur easily in viruses with naked capsids (nonenveloped) which are closely related (e.g., different strains of enteroviruses) or in enveloped viruses, which need not be related to one another (Figure 3 .4). In this latter case, the phenomenon is due to the nonspecific incorporation of different virus glycoproteins into the envelope, resulting in a mixed phenotype. Rescue of replication-defective transforming retroviruses by a helper virus is a form of pseudotyping. Phenotypic mixing has proved to be a very useful tool to examine biological properties of viruses.

This revelation can predict the outcome of an infection of naive or experienced host population with an emergent virus strain. Prevalence of specific amino acid appears to be virus specific. Moreover, there is a preferential usage of only few codons for most prevalent amino acids, e.g., CGC in human viruses and AGA in bacteriophages for Arginine [3] for example. It has been documented that single amino acid change in a key position of H5N1 NS1 protein can markedly increase its pathogenicity through immune modulation in host [30] .

Although co-evolutionary studies have been successful in few small DNA viruses (parvoviruses, polyomaviruses and papillomaviruses), sequence analysis of RNA viruses pose some problem owing to high mutation rates in their genes and rapid emergence of reassortants. Still, predicting the future course of viral epidemiology or emergence of a new virus is difficult because evolution is probabilistic and the issues are complicated by several factors like host ecology, environmental parameters, human migration and land use patterns. Emergence of a new epidemic depends on several factors like, the ability of a virus to infect new host through mutation/reassortment of its genome, extent of contact between the host population and the virus reservoir and on host immunity. However, the genetic mutations that facilitate virus adaptation to new host are likely to reduce its fitness in the donor host [46] .

Very different genetic and enzymatic patterns were observed among the isolates analyzed and no predominant dominant clone was observed across samples from unrelated individuals. Instead, rather unique individual patterns were identified (11, 218, 239, 265) . In addition, it was observed that the same clonal types were often found in closely related individuals, such as parents and offspring, siblings and spouses, suggesting horizontal and vertical transmission (280, 372, 377, 380) . It was shown that typically only 1-2 clones would colonize any given individual (11, 20, 219) . Even though the source of the clonal types and transmission could be determined with those studies, the relevance of the differences across strains remained to be elucidated. The observation that the detection of P. gingivalis was not a determinant for the occurrence of periodontitis suggested that the genetic and/or phenotypic differences observed across the isolates could perhaps explain why some P. gingivalis carriers would develop periodontitis and others would not. Most of the studies that associated clonal variability with disease status have suggested that individual clones or genetic types may express different phenotypic characteristics. The hypothesis was that clusters of clones/strains would express specific phenotypic characteristics which would confer virulence (113) .",11.441018022491921,6.972734154351588

Use of selective genetic codons or differential use of synonymous codons in gene expression is characteristic of a genome in a species [33, 54] . Therefore, analyses of the extent and causes of these unique codon choices and nucleotide composition are essential to understand viral evolution and virus-host interactions [52] . Recently, researches in codonusage and amino acid preferences in viruses have kindled interesting proposition with regard to fine-tuning of existing virus phylogenies and viral adaptation towards their hosts [3, 17, 31, 52, 60] . It is known at least in E. coli, Saccharomyces and Drosophila [17] , that codon-usage determines gene expression at the level of translation [24] . Recent studies on virus codon-usage patterns indicate that mutation pressure may be more important factor than translational selection in determining codon-usage bias [17] . The study of codon-usage patterns in viruses can be rewarding with respect to understanding not only viral gene expression and vaccine development but also virus adaptation, evolution and host-virus interactions [9, 17] . Adaptation to host codon-usage pattern can also help explain both tissue and species specificities of these viruses, and thus cross-species transmissibility [9] .",12.27751648117878,6.555224670881254

Fungal dimorphism, which is the ability to adopt another morphologic state, clearly is tied to virulence. Mutants of C. albicans that cannot switch to the hyphal form are avirulent in certain in vivo models, although both forms likely contribute to pathogenesis. 167 In a second adaptation, phenotypic switching, colonies of fungi change during in vitro growth. Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and H. capsulatum display phenotypic switching, and different phenotypes are associated with degrees of virulence. 168-171 H. capsulatum spontaneously gives rise to mutants that have less capsule, are less virulent, and are not cytotoxic to macrophages. 170 The signal for dimorphic fungi to change form is usually temperature. Many fungal species germinate within the host with increased temperature, allowing for dissemination within the host. Calcineurin is found in many yeast and mammalian cells and in C. neoformans. This protein mediates the ability of the fungus to grow at 37° C. 172 Temperature and heat shock also are mediated by the calcium-dependent protein cyclophilin B in Aspergillus. 173 Adaptation to mammalian pH is controlled genetically in Candida albicans.

GPC has the potential to shape many attributes of individual phenotypes and/or the distribution of phenotypes in populations. Importantly, understanding what drives the evolutionary implications of GPC requires not only quantifying how GPC affects individual performance (i.e., estimating selection gradients) but also considering the patterns of phenotypic covariance within groups (or aggregations at other levels). Another key aspect to studying the impact of phenotypic variation is to quantify the extent to which individuals and those they interact with modulate each other's behaviours. How this underpins phenotypic covariance is rarely studied. A fascinating area for further theoretical and empirical research is the idea that these parameters can evolve (or coevolve), and this could potentially have profound effects on the dynamics of phenotypic adaptation. We emphasise the urgent need for theory to be expanded to support empirical research, and the need for future research that is tightly focused on the mechanisms determining the formation of groups in terms of individual phenotypes and group composition (for example, do groups reflect the underlying distribution of individuals in the wider population, or do individuals actively choose groups according to phenotypic composition?). We further emphasise the need for theoretical advances in understanding the co-evolution or co-dependence of group composition with the expression or value of individual phenotypes (through indirect effects). The study of the selective consequences and evolutionary outcomes of GPC is an area of increasing interest across a breadth of research areas. It will continue to be an exciting area of research, with potential to contribute to many classical questions in ecology and evolution.",17.55455700170836,7.369390457760735

GPC can only matter when it introduces differences, or equalises existing differences, in fitness across different phenotypes (b y and b yz differ from zero). Assuming this is the case, GPC will have stronger selective consequences when the phenotypes of the members of a group or community are non-random (the covariance COV zy is high). An important prediction here is that net selection has the potential to be stronger in smaller groups (because, by definition, COV zy decreases with group size). Similarly, relatedness among group members leads to a higher covariance (COV zy ), and therefore groups with high relatedness should experience stronger selection arising from GPC. Higher covariance can also arise from habitat preferences, segregation, or local adaptation coupled with limited dispersal. Hence we expect GPC to be associated with stronger selection in these situations. Note that some aspects of GPC (e.g., the average phenotype of a group) can co-vary with the phenotype of its members to a greater extent than other aspects (e.g., the variance, or the highest phenotypic value).",12.271930407041356,7.3137790865639

In this review, we argue that mammalogists are uniquely placed to contribute to addressing these challenges because in-depth knowledge of mammal species is fundamental to the development of wild model systems that could accelerate discovery in disease ecology. The use of animal models-species for which a broad range of diagnostic, molecular, and genetic tools have been developed-in tightly controlled laboratory environments has been instrumental in driving progress in the biomedical sciences. However, in natural populations, disease processes operate in the context of enormous genetic, phenotypic, and environmental variability. Understanding diseases in animal populations (including humans) thus requires investment in ""wild animal models"" that explicitly include individual variation and relevant environmental gradients. Wild mammal groups such as primates and rodents have already been identified as potentially useful models of infectious diseases in the wild. Here, we discuss the enormous potential that ungulates hold as candidates for wild model systems. The diversity, broad geographic distribution, and often high abundance of species in this group make them a highly accessible target for disease research. Moreover, a depth of background knowledge, close relationships to domesticated animals, and ongoing management of many wild ungulate species provide context, tools, and opportunity for cutting-edge research at the interface of ecological and biomedical sciences. Studies of wild ungulates are already helping to unravel some key challenges in infectious disease research, including the role of parasites in trophic cascades, the consequences of climate change for disease dynamics, and the systems biology of host-parasite interactions.

One remarkable example of the threat to public health posed by such viruses is the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 2003 outbreak in Asia (Tsang et al., 2003) . Zoonotic strains of HEV have the potential to cause serious disease and mortality (Aggarwal, 2011; Mizuo et al., 2005; Patra et al., 2007) in infected patients or change into phenotypes that may become more transmissible among humans (Krawczynski et al., 2000; Purdy et al., 2012a) . The need to assess the risk of HEV outbreaks calls for genetic surveillance of the emerging zoonotic strains in their reservoir hosts. Genetic variation and covariation are important molecular mechanisms for genomic diversification and adaptation of viruses during intra-host evolution. Epistasis plays a crucial role in viral evolution (Bonhoeffer et al., 2004; Sanjuan et al., 2004) . Epistatic interactions among sites along the viral genome are widespread (Campo et al., 2008; Donlin et al., 2012) and frequently observed in the form of coordinated (Campo et al., 2008) and compensatory substitutions (Khudyakov, 2010; Yi et al., 2007) .

Coordinated substitutions among genomic sites were shown to be associated with response to combined interferon and ribavirin therapy among hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected patients (Aurora et al., 2009; Lara et al., 2011b) and resistance to lamivudine among hepatitis B virus infected patients (Thai et al., 2012) .

Poverty has already been noted as a major constraint to adaptation to climate change related disruptions to subsistence hunting and fishing in Arctic regions with implications for food security (Furgal, 2008; Furgal and Seguin, 2006; Turner and Clifton, 2009; Wolfe et al., 2007) . A number of behavioral and psychological conditions associated with poverty including substance abuse, addiction, stress, family disruption, alienation, and compromised education are also strongly associated with limited capacity to identify and respond to risks PHAC, 2008; Tanner and Mithcell, 2008) . Research has identified how social networks which increase uptake of adaptive measures and are essential to well-being and managing climate change can be undermined by addictive behaviour (Chan et al., 2006; Beaumier and Ford, in press; Ford et al., 2006a; Pearce et al., 2009 ). Notwithstanding, a critical factor in moderating the effects of climate change on Aboriginal health lies in the adaptability and the resilience of Aboriginal peoples (Ford, 2009a; Ford and Furgal, 2009; Furgal, 2008; Furgal and Seguin, 2006) . Aboriginal peoples have a deep attachment to their lands and their cultures, and this forms part of identity, which is a determinant of health . However, Aboriginal cultures and identity are not static or fixed in time. Aboriginal peoples are adaptable if they are allowed to, and current rates of poverty, and associated health impacts challenge this capacity. Secondly, poverty is a major constraint on institutional capacity to respond to climate change. Institutions with jurisdiction over reserve and territory-based Aboriginal populations are challenged by human and financial resources, and exacerbated by the challenge of poverty (Adelson, 2005; . Substantial shortfalls remain in meeting basic needs, and planning for future health problems frequently ranks behind other existing challenges (Mathias et al., 2008) . Even in Nunavut, which is globally believed to be a climate change 'hot spot' and where awareness of climate change is high, health systems at a local and territorial level have not had the financial or human resources to assess or plan for climate change health impacts; poverty related issues are more pressing (Boyle and Dowlatabadi, in press; Ford et al., 2007) . To compound these difficulties, it has also been argued by some policy makers that resources and attention directed to climate change should be invested in poverty alleviation, with climate change perceived as a distant, diffuse, and uncertain threat (Mathias et al., 2008) . This is ill-advised on a number of levels yet is challenging institutional response to climate change. Firstly, climate change has the potential to exacerbate poverty, further increasing health vulnerability to climate change. Secondly, climate change projections for Canada in the IPCC (IPCC, 2007c) and Lemmen et al. (2008) are now widely believed to be conservative, with significantly greater impacts projected (Barber et al., 2008; Schellnhuber, 2008) . Finally, addressing climate change and poverty need not be a zero sum game: climate policy has significant potential for co-benefits and can be mainstreamed into ongoing health activities and planning (Campbell-Ledrum and Woodruff, 2007; Ebi and Burton, 2008; Ebi and Semenza, 2008; Patz et al., 2008) .",15.247118263642225,7.589736489673537

The CE technique is helpful in evaluating different alternatives or strategies. As was mentioned before, most of the time the analysis is supported by epidemiological models that simulate expected effects given a specific strategy. Sensitivity analyses in such evaluations should also indicate when an alternative strategy should be preferred. In the ex post monitoring, the main focus could then be to monitor whether key indicators are reaching tipping points so alternative strategies need to be considered. A complicating factor in ex post CE analysis is that the control or context variables are no longer constant (in contrast with ex ante CE analysis using modelling tools in which these variables are controlled), but are changing at the same time as the intervention efforts are made (and maybe in different directions for different member states). As such, this likely affects the linkage between the intervention and the final impact, and for a sound CE analysis the impact of the change in context variables on the programme performance need to be corrected for. The reason why in the literature ex post evaluations are relatively scarce is probably because of the many complexities involved and because CE analysis is especially interesting when comparing different alternatives. Once a strategy is chosen for implemen-tation (as is the case in an ex post situation) comparison with (hypothetical) alternatives (that could have been chosen) is often of less interest.",12.82703697524503,7.422706370996558

We employed a Bayesian network (BN) analysis of HEV3 and HEV4 to detect epistatic connectivity among protein sites and its association with the host specificity in each genotype. The data imply coevolution among $70% of polymorphic sites from all HEV proteins and association of numerous coevolving sites with adaptation to swine or humans. BN models for individual proteins and domains of the nonstructural polyprotein detected the host origin of HEV strains with accuracy of 74-93% and 63-87%, respectively.

The KI15 as well as the SC14 virus were less virulent than the others. Pigs from an age of 6 months onward usually develop less pronounced signs of disease after influenza A virus infection (R. Dürrwald, unpublished data). The difference of 4-5 weeks in age of pigs of the KI15 group in comparison to the other groups can be neglected, especially since a similar virus (SC14) showed similar characteristics. Despite the fact that the JE09 and the JE10 viruses induced disease in pigs, a comparison of the virulence parameters (dyspnea, lung lesions, virus load) indicated a gradual decrease in the virulence already in these early isolates of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses: HA09 > JE09 > JE10 (see P values in the Results and the figure legends) . The data support the notion that there is a gradual adaptation of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses to their new hosts associated with a reduction in their capacity to induce severe disease. This process took place in humans and was shared by the virus isolated from a pig. The results obtained Influenza viruses are generally well adapted to replication in their reservoir host. In the case of spillover infections, the virus has to modify its replication properties to propagate in the new host [30] . Since the first isolation of a human influenza virus, 3 different subtypes, H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2, had been successful in establishing virus lineages in the human population. Viruses of other subtypes (eg, H5N1, H7N9) occasionally infect humans and may cause severe or fatal disease in infected individuals; however, these viruses were so far not able to spread the infection among the population, which is a sign of insufficient adaptation to the spillover host [27, 31, 32] . The A(H1N1) pdm09 virus was able to replace the seasonal H1N1 lineage. The adaptation of the virus to the human host was accompanied-as demonstrated by our data-by a reduction of virulence for pigs. The A(H1N1)pdm09 virus is easily transmitted between humans and pigs but transmission between humans seems to be more easily accomplished than that between pigs because the virus did only rarely establish stable lineages after primary incursion into the pig population and preferred to acquire new genes (ie, N2) before establishing stable propagation in pigs [33] . Thus, the original A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was most probably not yet well adapted to mammalian species, including pigs and humans, despite its ability to replicate efficiently in the latter. This may be the reason for the severe course of disease in infection experiments with HA09 and JE09 virus.",13.299935040229013,6.868025084409821

However, genetic modifications could make them more virulent, produce uncharacteristic clinical signs, increase their resistance to treatment and vaccines, and even change their transmissibility or host range. Genetic modifications could be made using the tools of synthetic biology; such activities might be an example of dual-use research. 19, 20 For instance, in 2005, the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic virus was reconstructed, 21 and the poliovirus was synthesised nearly 20 years ago. 22 The addition of an immuno-modulatory gene to the mousepox virus genome in 2001, 23 rendered a mousepox vaccine ineffective, and this technology could potentially be applied to the smallpox virus. 24 The recent synthesis of the extinct horsepox virus 24 has been a reminder that the smallpox virus could be reconstructed, and that the regulations that have been put in place to prevent the misuse of powerful, cheap, and globally available tools must be reconsidered. 25 This possibility has also raised the issue of whether research results should sometimes be censored, or even refused publication, if the potential to cause harm is too high. 19",14.334649309920675,11.589733535938056

H5N1 viruses are exemplary for their pathogenic potential because they cause repeated epidemics in domestic poultry worldwide, and have infected over 600 people since 1997 (de Jong et al., 1997; Kandun et al., 2006) , with 60% mortality reported amongst confirmed cases (Gambotto et al., 2008) .

Imai et al. (2012) introduced random substitutions in the globular head of HA of A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (VN1203), and subsequently tested the viruses for α2,6-SA receptor-binding preference. Two substitutions in HA, Q226L and N224K, were selected to produce a reassortant virus carrying the mutated VN1203 HA and the remaining genes of pH1N1. Since this virus was not readily transmitted between ferrets, further adaptation was achieved by serial virus passaging in ferrets, to yield an airbornetransmissible virus. During adaptation to ferrets, two additional substitutions in HA were acquired: N160D and T318I. N156D resulted in the loss of the same putative N-linked glycosylation site that was lost through the T160A mutation as identified by Herfst et al. T318I is located close to the fusion peptide and was shown to have the same phenotype as H110Y identified by Herfst et al. It was quite surprising that two independent studies, using different H5 HAs and different experimental procedures, came to similar conclusions on the critical substitutions in HA and the phenotypic traits leading to airborne transmission of H5N1 virus (Fig. 3) . First, the affinity of both airborne Indo05 and VN1203 was tuned toward increased α2,6-SA receptor binding and decreased avian receptor binding, although 2,6-SA binding was relatively low compared to that of human H3 viruses. This shift was associated with differences in specificities for α2,6 sialosides (de Vries et al. 2014) .

In particular, a filamentous morphology due to a fine interplay between the M and NA gene has been found to be important for transmission of pH1N1 virus (Campbell et al. 2014) .

However, further studies are required to verify a change in morphology upon acquisition of R95K in H7N1 virus and its effect on transmission.

It has been shown in previous studies that the removal of this specific glycosylation site increased the binding of H5N1 viruses to α2,6- SA and supported efficient replication of H5N1 viruses carrying the Q226L alone or in combination with G228S (Gao et al. 2009; Wang et al. 2010) . It can be speculated this glycosylation site interferes sterically with binding to cellular receptors and that its removal tunes the receptor-binding properties and replication of viruses harboring the receptor-binding changes Q226/G228S. Moreover, both Linster et al. and Imai et al. highlighted a previously overlooked critical phenotypic trait for airborne transmission of H5 viruses: a decrease in the threshold pH at which membrane fusion is achieved by HA and that is correlated with an increased thermostability. After influenza viruses attachment to the cell surface by the binding of HA to SA, the virus particle is internalized by endocytosis. An irreversible conformational change of HA, which is triggered by a decrease of the pH in the endosome, mediates the fusion between the viral and the endosomal membranes, allowing the viral genetic material to be released in the cytoplasm. The pH at which the HA conformational change is triggered is specific to the HA and is important for virus infectivity. Viruses possessing an HA for which the conformational change is triggered at relatively high pH may be more likely to lose infectivity upon exposure to low pH in the extracellular environment. Differences between the pH thresholds at which avian and human virus HAs induce membrane fusion have been suggested to point at this phenotype as a host range determinant (Galloway et al. 2013) . The conformational change of HA from a non-fusogenic to a fusogenic state can also be triggered at neutral pH when the HA is exposed to increasing temperature (Carr, Chaudhry and Kim 1997) . Both Linster et al. and Imai et al. showed that the introduction of substitutions leading to α2,6-SA preference increased the pH threshold for HA-mediated fusion and decreased the thermostability of HA. Amino acid substitutions H110Y and T318I in HA, found respectively by Linster et al. and Imai et al. upon adaptation to ferrets, both restored the pH threshold for fusion to the wild-type levels or even below. It still remains unknown whether the H110Y and T318I substitutions primarily compensate for the decreased pH stability caused by the substitutions responsible for α2,6-SA preference, or whether they reflect other stability phenotypes that are critical for airborne transmission of H5 influenza viruses, such as thermostability, stability in mucus, aerosols or respiratory droplets.",12.582760990056396,8.22576728178814

This adaptation in ferrets also resulted in changes in the antigenic properties of the virus. These results suggested that avian H9N2 viruses require little adaptation in mammals following reassortment with a human influenza H3N2 virus to become airborne transmissible between ferrets. Similar reassortment experiments were performed with pH1N1 virus. In contrast to H3N2, a reassortant containing the wild-type avian H9N2 HA and NA with the internal genes of pH1N1 virus was readily transmissible without the need of further adaptation, pointing again toward the crucial role of internal genes in airborne transmission. However, when only the wild-type H9N2 HA was combined with the remaining genes of pH1N1 virus, airborne transmission was abolished, suggesting that an optimal balance between HA and NA activi-ties was required for airborne transmission (Kimble et al. 2011 ). More recently, Kimble et al. (2014) showed that other reassortant viruses between pH1N1 and H9N2 were also airborne transmissible. Collectively, these results showed that avian H9N2 viruses and pH1N1 viruses, both of which have been isolated from pigs, are genetically compatible and can lead to the generation of novel reassortant viruses with airborne transmission potential in mammals with or without the need of further adaptation.",13.312168660934404,7.305648992569717

Other studies revealed a close interplay between the M and neuraminidase (NA) segments affecting virus morphology and transmissibility in mammalian hosts (Lakdawala et al. 2011; Ma et al. 2012; Campbell et al. 2014) Most experiments performed on pandemic viruses have been loss of function (LOF) experiments. They were conducted using fully transmissible viruses and aimed to dissect what made them transmissible, by reverting mammalian adaptation substitutions and assessing their impact on transmission (Tumpey et al. 2007; Pappas et al. 2010; Roberts et al. 2011) . These LOF experiments can give clues on determinants that are necessary for a given phenotype, but not on determinants that are strictly sufficient for this function. Although changes in receptor specificity and enhanced viral replication in mammalian hosts are prerequisites for cross-species transmission and host adaptation, studies on airborne transmission of human and avian influenza viruses demonstrated that these traits were necessary but not sufficient to result in airborne transmission between mammals (Maines et al. 2006 (Maines et al. , 2011 Herfst et al. 2012; Imai et al. 2012) , meaning that some pieces of the puzzle were still missing. Gain-of-function transmission (GOF-TXM) experiments are necessary when one aims to pinpoint the minimal molecular and phenotypic traits for a given phenotype, i.e. airborne transmission of influenza viruses. GOF-TXM experiments are also needed if we wish to investigate if viruses that have not yet acquired the potential of airborne transmission could acquire this trait in the future. Several recent GOF-TXM experiments conducted in different laboratories have improved our knowledge of the viral factors required for airborne transmission of influenza viruses. Moreover, these experiments showed that airborne transmission in mammals was not an exclusive property of the few virus subtypes that have caused human pandemics (H1, H2 and H3 influenza viruses). GOF-TXM experiments have indeed demonstrated that other virus subtypes, like H5N1, H9N2 and H7N1, can also overcome the natural barriers that prevent them from being airborne transmissible.",12.480338932303841,6.683815494606781

Human influenza viruses carrying the K119N mutation show improved growth in eggs and appear to exhibit enhanced virulence in the mouse model [9, 14] . Glycosylation at position 119 is essential for improved virus protein yield in eggs [14] . Egg adaptation of human influenza viruses is known to increase their affinity for the 2,3-sialic acid (SA) receptor and concomitantly impairs their ability to bind to 2,6-SA [11] . Although it is clear that influenza virus tropism depends on several viral and host factors and not only on HA specificity, the presence of the K119N mutation exclusively in the virus isolated from the LRT might indicate a more efficient binding/replication of viruses carrying this mutation to/in cells expressing 2,3-SA.

In this context, as previous analyses have suggested (Moncayo et al., 2004) , our findings support the notion that for the sylvatic strains to effectively colonize the urban environment, the virus needs a number of silent, adaptive nucleotide substitutions to optimize the codon usage to invertebrate host cells, while maintaining a compositional base balance suitable for efficient alternate spread among both human and insect hosts.

Considering the underlying driver of outcomes provides useful information for prevention opportunities, including those that can be prioritized across multiple sectors or to solve multiple challenges.

Reversing the trajectory of outcomes requires addressing these underlying drivers, and determining the full scope of major mitigating or exacerbating factors is important for improving understanding of disease ecology dynamics; to look only at climate change could miss intricacies and causality from other factors. For example, climate change is commonly proposed as the reason for the expansion of vector range leading to VBD. However, despite sensitivity to climate, VBD spread may be more dependent on habitat loss and social factors 56 dissues likely to increase through large-scale land conversion to meet growing food demands and expansion of human settlements in the coming decades.

The implications of land-use change for biodiversity loss and the associated loss of ecosystem goods and services present deeper implications for social welfare. For example, decreases in pollination services and reduced access to wild foods may affect food and nutritional security and livelihoods; a potential decline in access to medicinal plants used by a large proportion of the developing world as a source of primary health care may lead to negative health outcomes across indigenous and local communities; inadequate nutrient cycling harms clean water sources and leads to soil erosion and may contribute to the prevalence of waterborne diseases, thereby decreasing ecosystem and community resilience to extreme weather events; and biodiversity loss threatens access to natural resources with biomedical and pharmaceutical importance and weakens ecosystem integrity and resilience to climatic changes. All of these ecosystem services are also correlated to quality of life, mental and physical health, and social welfare. 10 The scope of climate change, its underlying drivers and health outcomes extends widely beyond measurable disease burden and immediate mortality. For example, the IPCC projects climate change will increase the displacement of people and potentially their exposure and vulnerability to extreme weather events, particularly in developing countries. 51 This will modify risks for violent conflicts by amplifying well-documented drivers of conflicts such as poverty and economic shocks. Flow-on effects may include significantly increased risk for civil and political conflict over dwindling resources, and mental health issues arising from trauma, displacement, conflict, and more limited access to natural resources used for food, medicines, and cultural and spiritual fulfillment. 52, 53 Such challenges relate to defense and peacemaking initiatives, with the US Department of Defense 2014 Climate Change Adaptation Roadmap anticipating growing need for disaster relief and humanitarian assistance abroad as well as potential international instability coupled with threats to operations and supply chains. 54 The drivers of climate change may themselves result in displacement of populations.

Further investigation of the six amino acid mutations in mouse-adapted SARS-CoV identified a single amino acid change within the S protein as necessary, but not sufficient for the observed increased pathogenicity, compared to wild-type SARS-CoV.

Another potential shortcoming is that control populations were not included in the study; therefore, the frequency of rhinovirus or coronavirus infections in ambulatory populations, in populations hospitalized with nonrespiratory conditions, or in asymptomatic populations cannot be determined.

Dynamics at this scale are fundamental as within-host evolution is the ultimate source of all viral genetic diversity, and therefore it must be understood before models that link different evolutionary scales can be properly developed (BOX 2) . Additionally, within-host analyses can reveal the evolutionary processes that underlie some aspects of clinical disease. In practice, such analyses have so far been limited to viruses that establish chronic infections lasting months or years, and for which measurable amounts of genetic change occur between viral samples; this is particularly the case for HIV infection and, to a lesser extent, for HCV and hepatitis B virus 72 infection. strong natural selection is clearly the dominant force determining HIV evolutionary dynamics in hosts: HIV phylogenies display a high turnover of short-lived lineages that is driven by host immune selection, analogous to the pattern observed for influenza A virus at the global scale 2 (BOX 2). Correspondingly, HIV genetic diversity at any particular time is low but slowly increases over the course of chronic infection 73 . Numerous analyses have quantified HIV adaptation and evolution using gene sequences, particularly for the viral envelope gene. These studies have found that these processes correlate with the rate of progression to clinical AIDs [74] [75] [76] and the rate at which HIV evades neutralizing antibody responses 77 . equivalent studies of HCV infection have found that viral adaptation predicts the outcome of acute infection 78, 79 and that HCV diversity correlates with levels of liver damage 80 .

Arguments can be advanced on both sides and there is currently little good data to choose among them. For example, one model of viral emergence posits that adaptation to a new host species during the early period of an epidemic is of fundamental importance, because this raises the basic reproductive rate of the virus, R 0 , to greater than 1, so that sustained transmission networks can be established (Anita et al. 2003) . This adaptive process is thought to occur during the ""stuttering chains of transmission"" that might characterize the early stages of an epidemic (Anita et al. 2003) . Hence, those viruses that have not evolved humanto-human transmission are simply those that have not yet fully adapted to our species as R 0 <1 (and human-to-human transmission would surely be favored by natural selection because it increases the number of secondary infections). Empirical evidence for this theory comes from one of the best-documented cases of emergence, that of the carnivore parvoviruses (ssDNA viruses). In this case, the feline parvoviruses that infected cats jumped to dogs in the early 1970s, therein giving rise to the canine parvoviruses, an event that was accompanied by strong positive selection and an extremely high rate of nucleotide substitution (Shackelton et al. 2005) . Direct adaptation to a new host species also seems to have been central to the emergence of the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (Brault et al. 2002) . Further, although there is no strong evidence to date that the cross-species transmission event from dengue virus in monkeys to dengue virus in humans involved adaptive evolution in the latter (Twiddy et al. 2002) , experimental studies imply that adaptation to the principal vector of dengue virus in an urban human setting, the Aedes aegypti mosquito, is a crucial prerequisite for sustained human transmission (Moncayo et al. 2004 ).",10.976973446978041,6.162231257031875

In other words, successful emergent strains are those that are in some sense preadapted to establish productive infections in the new host species (see the chapter by Childs et al., this volume), so that the probability of emergence then becomes a function of the frequency of exposure. Indeed, that the majority of emerging infections (in humans at least) result in dead-end infections implies that even short-term transmission chains are difficult to establish for most viruses because they lack the necessary mutations. Moreover, for the majority of emergent viruses it has been difficult to show that cross-species transmission is associated with adaptation in the recipient host. To take two high-profile examples, although some sequence analyses suggest that SARS-CoV was subject to adaptive evolution during its early spread through humans (Yeh et al. 2004) , it is unclear whether this was adaptation to the new host or selection for immune escape. Similarly, while the transition from SIVcpz in chimpanzees to HIV in humans seems to have been associated with a change in selection pressure (Sharp et al. 2001) , it is unclear whether this reflects adaptive evolution or a relaxation of selective constraints. Finally, viral exposure to hosts of the right genetic configuration may also be of critical importance in the establishment of new infections. For example, it might be that a particular host HLA type is a more willing recipient of an emergent virus than another. In these circumstances, it is the particular combination of viral sequence and host immune system that is necessary to start a successful infection.",10.830379399598327,4.739088320264458

Facultative symbionts, such as entomophagous nematodes, are both free living and symbiotic (Sudhaus 2008) . The adaptation of being symbiotic is that it increases the habitat breadth of the symbiont, and inhabitation of a living organism removes the organism from competition with other organisms encountered living freely in the habitat. Thereby, the relationship allows the symbiont an escape from competition. So that may be the reason for a life history strategy in which both symbiotic and free-living phases exist.

In the most extreme example, genetic bottlenecks can result in inefficient natural selection and rapid genetic drift (see also the chapter by Escarmís et al., this volume). This can result in the random fixation of mutations that can be deleterious for an organism without sufficient recombinatorial capacity or opportunity, resulting in progressive fitness declines via Muller's ratchet; such effects have been demonstrated for the arboviruses VSV (Duarte et al. 1992) and EEEV (Weaver et al. 1999) . Genetic drift can also facilitate the sampling of novel phenotypes, which cannot be selected in a step-wise fashion due to the lack of intermediate genotypes with improved fitness and the complexity of the selective landscape. A small population size could therefore be essential to allowing certain mutants to persist in nature. When bluetongue virus was placed in a laboratory transmission cycle involving Culicoides sonorensis vectors and sheep or calves, individual gene segments appeared to evolve independently by genetic drift in a host-specific fashion (Bonneau et al. 2001 ).

It also means that the same strategy could be applied to other BSL-4 pathogens, such as Lassa, Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever, and Junin viruses, in addition to highly pathogenic emerging viruses. Looking ahead, throughput for HTS assays conducted in high-containment laboratories could be improved by going to higher density 1,536 microtiter plates in place of the currently used 384 version. Bacterial and yeast assays have been conducted at BSL-2 23 in a 1,536-well microplate format and short-term viral assays also have the potential to be done in this format; each of these could be implemented in higher containment laboratories when the throughput is needed. New technologies present an opportunity to bring different types of assays into HTS for infectious agents. Multimode plate readers have been used to monitor a wide variety of endpoints, including fluorescence, absorbance, fluorescence polarization, and luminescence, proximity-based endpoints like fluorescence resonance energy transfer or alphascreen and time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer. The use of high-content images has recently been incorporated into the HTS process. Moreover, while this is possible in BSL-2 containment laboratories, it is not practical to have the current generation of HCS instruments in higher level containment laboratories. The instruments are large and require significant service support, both of which are impractical in a BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratory. What is practical are laser scanning cytometers, which can perform many HCS-type assays using a small robust instrument that is no more difficult to manage than a multimode plate reader and almost as fast. Instruments like the TTP Acumen and Mirrorball and the Molecular Devices Velos fall into this category. The Mirrorball is unique in that it is a laser scanning cytometer with a narrow field of focus. This enables plate-based FACS and ELISA style assays in a no-wash format. This instrument has been used to monitor cell surface expression of viral proteins by addition of an antibody, specific to the viral protein of interest, directly to the assay plate. This is followed by addition of a fluorescently labeled secondary antibody. The plate is then imaged on the laser scanning cytometer to detect cell-associated fluorescence as a measure of viral infection. This can be done without a fixing step or any wash steps. It has also been used to monitor virus infection and the spread of a GFP expressing virus (unpublished data). This is an enabling technology that will allow development of HTS assays for viruses that do not produce CPE or cannot be modified to express a reporter gene. It can also be used to monitor expression of fluorescent proteins in engineered viruses or cell lines, expanding the types of assays that can be applied to antiviral drug discovery. Another technology that has become more common in HTS applications is qPCR, where it has been used as a secondary assay to monitor mRNA levels in compoundtreated cells. At the SR HTS Center, qPCR technology has also been used to quantify the number of virus particles directly from the supernatant taken from infected cells. This provides a way to monitor virus titer reduction as an assay endpoint. Development is underway to adapt this technology to qPCR in a 1,536-well format for screening in the BSL-2 laboratory. For high-containment laboratories, the 384well format may be the practical limit and while that might not be high enough throughput for an HTS campaign, it would be a powerful counter screen for compounds identified in the other types of assays described here.",12.664633312799786,9.034121669970343

Moreover, studies of the pathogenesis of many viral infections, including those that result in myelin destruction, demonstrate an important role for the host immune response in tissue damage. In this review, we focused on two well studied examples of virus-induced demyelination. In both cases, myelin is damaged or destroyed during the process of virus clearance. Treatment with anti-inflammatory/pro-resolution factors such as regulatory T cells or IL-10 ameliorates host tissue damage but as especially evident in TMEV infections, may diminish virus clearance, resulting in more virus-induced tissue damage as well as additional targets for the host response. Of all the therapeutic modalities described above, virus-specific Tregs appear to be most useful since they preferentially down modulate virus-specific immune responses that may be pathogenic. However, adaptation of virus-specific Tregs to human disease will require substantial amounts of work. Approaches that increased Tregs in infected patients, especially those that targeted virus-specific epitopes, would be required to maximize effects on deleterious immune responses without significantly inhibiting virus clearance.

However, it has long been known in the evolutionary literature that this approach can lead to false positive conclusions, because the counts are not independent observations, but instead are correlated due to shared ancestry [33, 34] .

Gervasi, David J. Civitello, Holly J. Kilvitis Even apparently similar hosts can respond differently to the same parasites. Some individuals or specific groups of individuals disproportionately affect disease dynamics. Understanding the sources of among-host heterogeneity in the ability to transmit parasites would improve disease management. A major source of host variation might be phenotypic plasticity -the tendency for phenotypes to change across different environments. Plasticity might be as important as, or even more important than, genetic change, especially in light of human modifications of the environment, because it can occur on a more rapid timescale than evolution. We argue that variation in phenotypic plasticity among and within species strongly contributes to epidemiological dynamics when parasites are shared among multiple hosts, which is often the case.",13.898496608171548,6.969000480156929

The ratio of nonsynonymous (dN) to synonymous substitution rate (dS), i.e. v, which is widely used as a measure for selection pressure (Yang and Nielsen, 2002) , has been employed in several studies to detect positive selection on viral genes of SCoV and SLCoV. Firstly, the v values of structural genes were found to be higher than that of the non-structural region, suggesting the structural proteins might have been under a stronger selection pressure Song et al., 2005) . Moreover, the v value of S gene in the strains from early phase is significantly larger than that of those from middle and late phases (CSMEC, 2004) .

Major vaccine manufacturers are at various stages of developing cell-derived vaccines for seasonal and pandemic influenza (Refs 103,104), and a cell-derived seasonal influenza vaccine is already on the market in Europe (Ref. 105) . Cell-derived vaccines assume much significance with respect to pandemic preparedness since their production is not exposed to anticipated vulnerabilities in the supply of embryonated eggs in a prepandemic/ pandemic scenario. Additionally, cell-based vaccine manufacturing in closed scalable bioreactors reduces the risk of exogenous contamination. Following the identification of the pandemic strain, it has a shorter lead manufacturing time of one to three months compared with approximately five to six months for the egg-based approach (Ref. 106). The cell-based production of influenza vaccines minimises the selection of any virus variants with reduced immunogenicity and altered antigenicity, which might sometimes result during the adaptation of virus strains to eggs in an egg-based vaccine manufacturing process (Refs 107,108,109). However, some of the limitations of the cell-based vaccine approach are the lack of standardised reagents and the potential safety concern regarding the introduction of adventitious agents during the cell-based vaccine manufacturing process (Ref. 110 ).",13.661892694886138,6.261564296413921

Among 3 mutants, srr7 showed the most markedly attenuated neurovirulence. Its attenuation was likely due to the reduced growth in the CNS relative to wt virus, although such difference was not observed in cultured cells [21, 26] . Srr mutants showed a slightly reduced fusogenicity in cultured cells relative to the wt virus with a low multiplicity of infection (unpublished data). Their reduced fusogenicity could account for the decreased viral spread in the mouse brain and eventually the low viral growth. Alternatively, the difference in growth between srr7 and the wt virus in the mouse brain, but not in cultured cells, could be attributed to the difference of brain target cell sensitivity to these viruses. It is also possible that srr7, but not wt virus, induces some factors, such as interferon or cytokines, unfavorable for JHMV replication in the brain. Srr7 has a mutation in the amino acid at position 1114 (Leu → Phe) in the S2 subunit [26] , suggesting that this amino acid is important for manifestation of high neurovirulence. An MAb-escaped variant J2.2-v1 isolated from the DL strain of JHMV has a mutated amino acid at position 1114 (Leu → Phe) and this virus showed an attenuated neurovirulence [10, 34] . Although cl-2 and JHM-DL S proteins have two more different amino acids (position 298, Ser versus Thr; position 781, Val versus Gly), the mutation of the identical amino acid at position of 1114 resulted in a similar phenotypic change. This suggests the importance of this particular amino acid in the high neurovirulence of JHMV. However, we cannot exclude the possible involvement of the mutation outside the S gene of srr7. A virus with a mutation at position 1114 amino acid alone, which can be generated by a targeted RNA recombination [17, 20, 25] , should be tested for its neurovirulence.",12.913409060423003,6.156039645437945

Hence, the identification of the subpopulations of the cells infiltrating the brain based on their phenotypic and potential functional characteristics may provide information regarding their role(s) in viral clearance in the local CNS environment.",11.262456234078664,7.83686772140202

For example, in the area of climate change adaptation, the ''no-regrets'' doctrine implies that any climate adaptation measure that yields benefits even in the absence of climate change is considered viable within this doctrine. So, in the area of flood preparedness, for example, practices such as rainwater harvesting to improve water efficiency are justified on economic grounds, regardless of objectives to mitigate climate change. Under conditions of uncertain risk projections, therefore, policymakers may tend to develop cost-conscious responses, with effectiveness considerations only secondary in importance if at all (read, policy underreaction). A successful policy design under these circumstances may point at policy tools that, after their initial impact, create net social benefits under all future risk projections, with no or low costs and committed resources, in a way which can be framed as costeffective and does not involve hard trade-offs with other policy objectives.",17.090922051528025,7.718633908878391

The multiple cell types of the HAE culture system provide additional target cell populations for newly emerged viruses and these cultures can provide a resource for the rapid amplification of newly identified viruses for future study. Comparison studies of human versus avian influenza strains on human tracheobronchial cell cultures have demonstrated that the preferred sialic acid species for the respective virus actually reside on different cell types, which can restrict the amount of replication the avian virus can make prior to additional adaptation to the potential human host (Ibricevic et al., 2006; Matrosovich et al., 2004) . Airway cultures from tracheo-bronchial cells from a range of animal species have also been established greatly increasing the number of viruses that can be studied, allowing the study and amplification of both zoonotic and human isolates. In addition, zoonotic viruses can be passaged on human cultures to identify mutations that arise during adaptation providing a unique look at the evolution of potential human pathogenic strains.

In addition, the success of each for delivery in vivo depends on many factors, such as route and tissue uptake. The greatest success has been attained for local delivery to tissues, e.g., PLGA microspheres and electroporation for muscle delivery.

Molecular methods for resistance detection (Table 19 .3) may be applied directly to the clinical specimen, providing simultaneous detection and identification of the pathogen plus resistance characterization. Likewise, they are useful in detecting resistance in viruses, slow-growing or nonviable organisms, or organisms with resistance mechanisms that are not reliably detected by phenotypic methods. However, because of their high specificity, molecular methods will not detect newly emerging resistance mechanisms and are unlikely to be useful in detecting resistance genes in species where the gene has not been observed previously. Furthermore, the presence of a resistance gene does not mean that the gene will be expressed, and the absence of a known resistance gene does not exclude the possibility of resistance from another mechanism. Phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods allow laboratories to test many organisms and detect newly emerging as well as established resistance patterns.

Within the last decade, almost 30% of all emerging infectious diseases were caused by vector-borne pathogens (Jones et al. 2008 ). These emerging pathogens include infectious agents that are imported into non-endemic areas by travellers or trade (e.g. West Nile virus in North America, chikungunya virus in Northern Italy) and organisms that have been newly identified and associated with a new disease (e.g. Nipah virus). Additionally, pathogens that were already endemic in a certain country or region might become more widely spread due to ecological or other changes (Sutherst 2004) . Among other reasons for disease emergence, climate change potentially alters the exposure of humans to vector-borne pathogens by changing the spatial and seasonal distribution of conditions that are favourable for the establishment and survival of vectors and vector-borne agents (Kovats et al. 1999; Haines et al. 2006 ). In addition to other requirements (e.g. risk assessment studies, emergency preparedness plans), adaptation to climate change needs a surveillance system which is capable of documenting the incidence and geographical distribution of vector-borne diseases and timely detecting new events of autochthonous transmission.",12.991717147993764,11.415115981160305

These two processes enable the generation of novel combinations from two existing genotypes. Moreover, these often large genetic changes may provide the potential for adaptation to a new host species (Parrish et al., 2008) .

Viruses of animal origin that have successfully entered the human species are the causative agents of important infectious diseases, such as AIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and pandemic influenza (5, 13, 30) . The molecular basis of virus adaptation to new host species is poorly understood. It is clear that adaptation can result from mutations in viral envelope components which may alter the receptor specificity or uptake efficacy of the virus. For example, massive structural alterations of the envelope seem to have occurred during adaptation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus from bats to humans (18) . Recently, it became clear that alternative mechanisms can also lead to successful virus adaptation to new host species. In the case of the avian influenza A virus strain SC35, two amino acid changes in the PB2 polymerase subunit which enhance the activity of the viral polymerase complex can confer viral replication competence in mice (4) . Similarly, a glutamic acid-tolysine change at position 627 of the PB2 protein rendered an avian H5N1 influenza A virus isolate highly pathogenic for mice (8, 25) . In the case of Ebola virus, adaptation to mice was associated with mutations in VP24 and in the nucleoprotein, both of which antagonize the innate antiviral immune response (3) .

One hACE2 Tg mouse died after infection with rSARS-CoV-ΔE p16, but a greater percentage of mice challenged with rSARS-CoV survived when compared to those immunized with unpassaged virus (Figs. 1 and 7) . It should be noted that the gain in virulence was relatively minor since the LD 50 of SARS-CoV in hACE2 Tg mice is 250-800 PFU while only 1/20 hACE2 Tg mice died after infection with 12,000 PFU rSARS-CoV-ΔE p16. No evidence for increased virulence was observed in BALB/c mice, consistent with the extreme susceptibility to infection exhibited by hACE2 Tg mice. Tissue culture adaptation of viruses most often results in the generation of viruses that are attenuated in animals. However, SARS-CoV was in a state of active adaptation to both palm civets, an intermediate host, and humans, when the epidemic was terminated in 2003 (Chinese, 2004; Kan et al., 2005; Song et al., 2005) . Thus, it may not be surprising that the virus underwent further adaptation after tissue culture cell passage. The single mutation that was detected in rSARS-CoV-ΔE was in the S protein, although not in the region responsible for binding to the host cell receptor (Wong et al., 2004) . Further development of a rSARS-CoV-ΔE vaccine will require additional passage through Vero E6 and human tissue culture cells to determine if the virus continues to undergo further adaptation to primate cells and possibly, gains (or losses) in virulence and immunogenicity. This potential for a gain in virulence indicates that it will be important to introduce additional mutations into the virus to ensure safety. One obvious candidate for mutation is nsp1, since this protein is involved in modulating the host immune response (Kamitani et al., 2006; Narayanan et al., 2008; Zust et al., 2007) .

Until Taubenberger and his colleagues recently sequenced the genome of the virus responsible for the 1918 influenza pan- Although this new knowledge increases concern that H5N1 avian influenza may drift into a strain that fulfills the conditions necessary to produce a pandemic (Table 1) , it also allows the World Health Organization (WHO) to monitor for key changes in H5N1 viral sequence which may enable human-to-human transmissions.",15.701640520711067,9.075689345575137

If this holds for virus populations, recombination and reassortment may be the primary evolutionary factors permitting adaptation to propagation within a new host species; however, several virus species well known for their ability to propagate within a novel host species demonstrate that Figure 1 . The expected interaction between the ecological relationships of current and potential host species and the frequency of viral encounter. The darkest boxes represent interactions where the frequency of encounter is likely to be high, the lightest boxes represent interactions where encounter is expected to occur at very low frequency, and medium boxes represent interactions where the frequency of encounter will be highly dependent on the stability of the infectious virion in the environment, as described in the text. For all ecological relationships between species, the actual frequency of encounter via different transmission routes will depend on the exact nature of the relationship. substantial genetic change is not necessary for adaptation to propagation in all cases. SARS coronavirus, for example, appears to have adapted to transmission between humans through a series of point mutations in multiple genes (Holmes, 2005) . Several mutations in the receptor-binding domain of the SARS coronavirus glycoprotein that increased binding affinity to human ACE2 (the receptor for entry into the cell) are well documented and appear to have been especially important (The Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium, 2004; Li et al., 2005) . Table 1 groups mammalian virus families according to each of the molecular traits discussed above for which data are available. Mammalian viruses are used for the purposes of illustration because they are particularly well studied and because mammals represent many of the source and recipient host species of primary interest (e.g., humans, domestic livestock, and domestic carnivores). A rough assessment of expected emergence potential is made by assigning scores for encounter, infection, and propagation potential, which are given and described further in Table 2 . The score indicates how many traits a virus group possesses that are expected to increase success in that step, based on two standard reference texts (van Regenmortel et al., 2000; Tidona and Darai, 2001 ). Thus, virus families can be ranked based on molecular characteristics alone in order of the a priori expectation that they will be able to complete a particular emergence step.",12.807285389865314,8.693308417546458

One clear advantage is the ability to observe virus infected cells without discernable CPE. Since this method detects viral proteins in infected cells using antibodies that are virus-specific, it is possible to detect the presence of the virus as long as sufficient amount of viral proteins are expressed by the infected cells. In addition, the use of virus-specific antibodies also allows antigenic confirmation of PEDV. Previously, it was reported that the parental strain of PEDV CV777 infects only a small number of cells and fail to cause syncytium formation in Vero cells. CPE was observed only after several passages (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988) . However, using the FFA, virus infection can be confirmed 8 h after initial infection of the cells. This allows detection of PEDV as well as measuring the titer of the stock on every passage of the virus. Furthermore, adaptation of the virus to Vero cells may be monitored by observing the size of the foci and comparing the rate of infection and spread of the virus to adjacent cells. Another advantage of FFA is the short incubation period required to detect cells infected with the virus. Unlike plaque assay, the presence of the virus may be confirmed within a few replication cycle of the virus. In contrast, the plaque assay requires several replication cycles of the virus before discernable CPE is observed. Finally, the 96-well microtiter plate scale for cell culture used in FFA provides the advantage of using more replicates and a large number of dilutions for detection and titration of the virus (Ishimine et al., 1987) .",12.381074604031104,8.633346332930357

Two of the 3 key criteria that characterized the pandemic of 1918-1919 have already been fulfilled in the current epidemic: (1) the ability of the virus to infect humans resulting in high mortality and (2) a global immunologically naive human population. 3 The third criterion, efficient human-to-human transmission, has thus far not been observed. 4 The adaptation that would result in human-to-human transmission might involve changes in the receptor properties or improved viral replication efficiency. This adaptation might be achieved by mutation of an avian virus genome or by mixing segments of an avian virus with segments from a virus already adapted to humans (genetic reassortment), leading to the emergence of a new influenza subtype with pandemic potential. 5 Both events may occur easily. First, influenza viruses mutate frequently, potentially allowing them to change the host receptor specificity from avian to human. 6 Second, the segmented viral genome allows the exchange of genes between viruses if they infect the same host cell, which serves as the ""mixing vessel."" 7 In the current H5N1 outbreak in Asia, no genetic reassortment among avian and human influenza viruses has been found; all genes are of avian origin. 4, 8 However, the widespread epidemic of avian influenza in domestic birds increases the likelihood for mutational events and genetic reassortment. In view of the high mortality observed in the limited number of infections in humans, the prospect of a severe pandemic is of considerable importance. 9 We review current knowledge about avian influenza, including the virology, epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of this emerging disease.",13.158793497294631,7.032044564558721

Viruses have played a vital role in the discovery of cellular mRNA stability and decay components, like the mRNA cap structure and the SKI proteins, which highlights the importance of viruses as valuable tools for understanding the regulation of fundamental cellular processes [138] [139] [140] [141] [142] . The large repertoire of viral strategies that facilitate a successful and productive interaction with the cellular mRNA decay apparatus has also revealed some potential viral targets that can be exploited for the development of novel therapeutic antiviral drugs. The RNA capping machinery of viruses represents one such attractive target and designing specific inhibitors of viral methyltransferases (MTases), especially the 2'-O methyltransferase (2'-O MTAse) activity that promotes the escape of viruses from the host innate immune response, and cap-snatching endonucleases can be a promising antiviral strategy. Several studies have described the inhibitors of these enzymes, including the broad-spectrum antiviral Ribavirin, which, in addition to its other pleiotropic effects on viral replication, has also been shown to inhibit the dengue virus 2'-O MTase activity [143] .",13.116106138527158,6.900754518374718

This has important consequences, such as in the viral adaptation to adaptive immune defences or our acquisition of new diseases through zoonotic transmission. However, such adaptation is, somewhat paradoxically, highly constrained by the nature of RNA virus genomes, which, owing to their small size, must exhibit high levels of pleiotropy, fitness trade-offs, epistasis and convergent evolution [34] . Thus, rather than being infinitely flexible, it is better to view RNA viruses as restless beasts pacing a small cage -they are capable of rapid adaptive switching among a set of limited phenotypes.

No infectious virions were detected 184 h pi, which was also seen for equine influenza in MDCK cells at 150 h pi (Genzel et al. 2006a, b) . All other virus strains tested in this study showed better stabilities. In SF medium with lower moi A/Wisconsin/67/ 2005 va HGR produced in Vero cells was most stable ( (Wressnigg et al. 2009 ). Here, all virus strains had a stable titer for the time frame shown, once the maximum titer of about 10 7 -10 8 virions/ml was reached. For influenza A/Neth/18/94 produced in MDCK cells Rimmelzwaan et al. also showed a decrease of TCID 50 and a stable HA titer over a time period of 144 h (Rimmelzwaan et al. 1998) .

These conclusions were derived from a combination of genomic, phylogenetic, and vector transmission studies, from which it was conclusively demonstrated that the adaptation of CHIKV to high vector competence in A. albopictus resulted directly from the substitution of the amino acid alanine by valine at position 226 (A226V) in the envelope gene (E1) of the virus (Schuffenecker et al., 2006; Tsetsarkin et al., 2007) .

This mutation was deemed a ''key event'' for interspecies transmission. It is likely a result of positive selection caused by antibodies, allowing the original invasion by new species-specific variants. A mutation at amino acid position 160 in the RBD only induced a change in receptor preference. This mutation was deemed a ''maintaining adaptation'', which ensured that influenza virus variants would be able to infect new organisms of a different species successfully.

Although these intrinsic properties of host-pathogen systems might determine 'fundamental' sensitivity to direct effects of climate change, the 'realized' effects of climate change will be determined by behavioral adjustments (e.g. microclimate selection by vectors), extrinsic adaptation and evolution by hosts, vectors and pathogens, as well as disease control measures.

The process of host adaptation generates viruses that are primarily shaped by the constraints of the niche and less by the ancestry of the virus. If we take parvovirus B19V and HBV as examples of viruses showing evidence for long-term presence in their host populations, their genotypes typically show diversity in the 10−15% nucleotide sequence divergence range, which is represented figuratively as the blue area of potential sequence 'wobble' in the virus niche ( fig. 2 ). This pattern of within-species diversity typifies a wide range of other human, veterinary and plant viruses; examples of the former include individual serotypes of alphaviruses, flaviviruses, measles virus, mumps virus, most of the paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses, and so on. This pattern is also the norm for the vast range of virus species infecting arthropods and fungi, and represents the fraction of genome sites not under selection for fitness optimization. Variation at this level represents the majority of what is captured in temporal sampling and may underlie the generally rapid substitution rates reported for RNA and small DNA viruses over short observation periods. However, the sequence space is small and restrictive -changes at those few neutral sites may saturate at much lower divergence levels than evolutionary models typically expect. We might describe this constraint as a cage -not in the sense of the limited genome size of RNA viruses 70 but reflecting those host-imposed constraints on virus sequence change that create the appearance of much less sequence divergence and hence temporal depth than is actually present.",13.701542336767329,8.202303216515872

The model equates virus jumps with the occupancy of a new niche and hence a rapid adaptation of trait values to fit this niche ( fig. 4 ). Host jumps are associated with periods of accelerated sequence change as the virus remodels and regains fitness in an altered environment, very much as conceptualized in bacterial evolution 71 . Host adaptation after cross-species transmission is associated with rapid amino acid sequence changes of viral genes, typically those associated with receptor interactions and the evasion of innate immunity 72-76 but often pervasive throughout the entire virus genome 77 . Larger-scale gene modifications, such as the repurposing of the HIV-1 accessory protein Vpu to antagonize the cellular antiviral protein tetherin was a key adaptive change that enhanced the replication ability of HIV-1 in humans following its zoonotic transfer from chimpanzees 22 . The diversification of HIV-1 populations in the 100 or more years since its zoonotic introduction might indeed be interpreted as an ongoing process of fitness optimization. The gradual attenuation of disease severity in HIV-1 infections 78 perhaps anticipates a time when HIV-1 diversity is substantially lessened following niche adaptation and the evolution of fitness-optimized, less pathogenic and fully host-adapted HIV-1 strains. HIV-1 population structures and diversity may ultimately match the endemic and tolerated SIV strains that have infected and adapted to many Old World monkey species over much longer periods. In vertebrates, further adaptive change is driven by their highly polymorphic adaptive immune system. The heterogeneity of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules between individual hosts defines virus epitope recognition and hence the adaptive changes required to avoid antibody or T cell recognition 17, 18 . Immediately after infection, immune escape of viruses in different individuals may drive rapid antigenic diversification. However, the sequential transit of a virus through dozens or many hundreds of individuals may lead to a static cycle of adaptation on infection and reversion on transmission through different MHC repertoires. At the population level, there may be no net sequence change, an interesting variant of the Red Queen hypothesis 79, 80 . This larger adaptive space (but still a cage) feeds into a complex dynamic of population susceptibility, transmission rates, neutralization escape and changes in receptor use that perpetuates infections in hosts with adaptive immunity. The elaborate serotype and antigenic shift and/or drift population structures of mammalian viruses in particular may be its direct consequence.",14.494086857921758,7.543188165327317

Although it is known that viruses evolve under constraints and adapt to hosts on transmission, the perspective we offer casts viruses and their genetic relationships to each other as being primarily conditioned by hosts they infect. Their own genetic history that is emphasized so much in virus-centric accounts of their evolution over short periods is quite subservient to the shaping forces of host-driven evolution. Similarly, although existing accounts of virus sequence change are so much focused on their seemingly unlimited evolutionary potential and adaptability, the range of viruses that are able to successfully infect and maintain transmission in their hosts appears limited and is more a function of the host niches a virus can exploit 65 . For example, the wide range of viruses that infect humans possess specific tissue tropisms, pathologies and transmission routes. However, homologues of these viruses in other mammalian species typically reproduce very closely, and appear restricted by, these same virushost interactions. As further evidence of host-induced constraints, virus replication ability, transmissibility and successful establishment of zoonoses are predicated, Viruses remain associated and highly adapted to their host, even as the hosts themselves evolve and speciate over long periods (tens of millions or potentially hundreds of millions of years). Viruses continue to infect cells in each host lineage, but they themselves must evolve in concert with their host to retain fitness and host adaptation as the niche they occupy gradually changes. After a prolonged period of co-evolution, viruses acquire very different virus 'shapes' and a phylogeny that resembles in part that of their host. Viruses involved in this co-evolutionary process display long-term substitution rates that approach those of their hosts.",13.630886391609359,5.974187646342621

It is notable that five of these six factors are social factors that are consequences of changes in society. Even microbial adaptation and change, such as the development of antimicrobial resistance as a response to selective pressure, has a large behavioral dimension. This is partly a response to a technical innovation -the development of antimicrobials -and partly a response to a behaviorthe prescribing of those antimicrobials. Of course, one dimension of this factor is the nonselective and improper prescribing of antimicrobials. This has several dimensions: The prescription of antibiotics when none are needed, the prescription of broad-spectrum antibiotics when narrowspectrum antibiotics are sufficient, the free availability of antibiotics in many developing countries on the street and in pharmacies where no prescription is needed, and the free use of late-generation antibiotics in the food industry to promote the growth of cattle, chickens, and other animals intended for human consumption.

Even if viral adaptation is responsible for the host jump, genomic information can be used to predict future risk only if genetic markers of adaptation to new hosts can be identified and their influence on viral spread can be characterized. As G. C. Williams first pointed out nearly 50 years ago 12 , analyses of adaptation are extremely difficult because of the risk of 'adaptive storytelling' (Refs 13, 14) : it is extremely easy to infer adaptation when it does not exist. In this Review, we discuss what is required to show that particular viral genetic changes are responsible for host jumps.

The most recent pandemics were caused by viruses that were transmitted from animal reservoirs to humans, such as influenza A viruses and severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus. Adaptation of the virus to the new host is often cited as the cause of such emergence. • Distinguishing the genetic changes that are due to adaptation from those that are due to random events is hard in any biological context; virus host jumps are no exception. We present four different mechanisms by which viruses may emerge in a new host. Although all four mechanisms could produce the same genetic pattern in new hosts, only two are due to adaptation. We illustrate which data need to be collected to distinguish between the four mechanisms. • Future risk of viral host jumps to humans could be assessed by genetic surveillance of viruses in reservoir hosts, but only when genetic adaptation is required for a host jump and when precursors of this adaptation can be detected. • bioinformatic analyses of surveillance data are key stepping stones for identifying putative genetic markers of viral adaptation from enormous pools of genetic data. Confirmation of which of these putative markers are due to adaptation requires experimental validation by using reverse genetics and host models from reservoir and new host species, and corroborating results with epidemiological and ecological data. • our review of the current literature on four well-studied viral host jumps shows that research on host-jump processes unfolds in four broad stages: virus sample collection and genetic analysis; experiments in vitro or in cell culture; in vivo experiments in model hosts; and in vivo experiments in natural hosts. We evaluate the issues in using these types of data for validating adaptive hypotheses, and identify opportunities to collect further data that would enable better discrimination among emergence mechanisms. • A detailed understanding of viral host jumps and the assessment of future risk requires multidisciplinary research efforts with input from field ecologists, microbiologists, immunologists, epidemiologists, bioinformaticians and evolutionary biologists, and the use of use of diverse approaches (field sampling, laboratory experiments, data analysis and mathematical modelling).

In existing studies, strains were most often sampled from many individuals of the host species and/or from individuals of multiple host species (fIG. 2) , although many of these studies were limited to bioinformatic analyses of viral genetic data (Supplementary information S1 (table) ). by contrast, a remarkably high number of experimental studies focused on detailed analyses of a single strain (and recombinants of that strain), which in practice is often a necessary trade-off to obtain the data needed to validate adaptation. Studies of strains that had previously not been investigated should be prioritized because it is crucial to examine many strains and to develop high-throughput methods for screening putative genetic markers for fitness effects. Multiple samples from a single host individual were almost never studied by any approach (fIG. 2) , indicating a data gap. Cross-sectional and longitudinal sampling across both reservoir and new host species is essential for mapping where and when genetic changes take place. not only do these samples provide the material for phenotypic assays, they are important for decreasing errors that are associated with estimates of evolutionary rates and for linking experimental results to disease characteristics and viral fitness.

However, full analysis of the resulting hypotheses must also involve biological measurements. Accessible databases have become available to support the growing pool of genetic data that have resulted from increased surveillance. Alongside the genetic data, these databases should include ecological, epidemiological and phenotypic data (an effort that has been piloted for influenza A 113 ). This would also help to establish research design standards for studying pathogen emergence so that key public health gaps can be addressed. one approach that would provide balance in data collection and integrative analyses is to develop disease-emergence funding programmes that require interdisciplinary teams (including field ecologists, microbiologists, immunologists, epidemiologists, bioinformaticians and evolutionary biologists) using multiple approaches (field sampling, laboratory experiments, data analysis and theoretical modelling). Such programmes would encourage greater balance in the types of data collected, would help to ensure that data collection is structured in a way that is conducive to analytical goals and would promote the broad collaborations needed to address overarching questions about disease emergence.

In the case of MYXV, this trade-off is thought to lead to 'intermediate' virulence grades being selectively advantageous: higher virulence may mean that the rabbit host dies before interhost transmission, whereas lower virulence is selected against because it does not increase virus transmission rates. A similar trade-off model has been proposed to explain the evolution of HIV virulence 40 . However, many doubts have been raised about the general applicability of the trade-off model 35, [41] [42] [43] , virus fitness will be affected by traits other than virulence and transmissibility 39, 41, 44 , contrary results have been observed in experimental studies 45 and relatively little is known about evolutionary trade-offs in nature. For example, in the case of the second virus released as a biocontrol against European rabbits in Australia -rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) -there is evidence that virulence has increased through time, probably because virus transmission often occurs through blow flies that feed on animal carcasses, making host death selectively favourable 46 .

These viruses continue to evolve and accumulate changes, increasing the potential risk of avian-to-human transmission. Regarding the origin of human H6N1 TW02/13 virus, Yuan and colleagues 27 analysed our submitted sequences and speculated that the virus was derived from the reassortment of H5N2 and H6N1 viruses. However, the six internal genes of Taiwan chicken H5N2 virus have been shown to originate from the Taiwan chicken H6N1 viruses. 28 Therefore, we propose that the human H6N1 virus was probably generated through interclade reassortment among H6N1 viruses.

Biological systems are also enriched with ecological memory [19] . Memory relates to historic events and requires an entire long-term record for analysis. For example, seasonal succession of phytoplankton in lakes responds to small changes in trophic structure and natural fluctuations of gradients [19] . Aquatic and phytoplankton systems possess a remarkable memory of climatic events [20] . Apart from such climatic phenomena, aquatic zooplankton exhibit memory-based phenomenological responses: small changes in the environment induce morphological defense organs such as helmet formation and the development of spines through cyclomorphosis [21] . These changes are due to a mixed seasonal and genetically inherited reaction [22] induced over long time scales, suggesting a phenotypic change through memory-based actions. Prey refuge, group hunting and prey swarming are all well-coordinated actions based on memories of past events that lead to cultural learning [14] . Experience accrued through learning may direct anti-predator responses [23] [24] [25] . In aquatic systems, learning of chemical cues and the production of counter responses are well documented among zooplankton [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] .

The most salient phenotypic change was that after more than 100 transfers, FMDV became noncytolytic, was unable to form visible plaques, and it could readily establish a persistent, noncytocidal infection that normally would be established only from the few cells that survived a cytolytic infection (see Section 6.4). Thus, strikingly, a fundamental property of the virus-host interaction, such as the capacity to kill cells [a marker of virus virulence (see Section 5.6 in Chapter 5)!], was altered as a result of repeated bottleneck passages. In fact, if infectivity is judged by the capacity to produce plaques, these multiply transferred clones underwent decreases of specific infectivity (the ratio between the amount of infectivity and that of viral RNA) of at least 140-fold relative to their corresponding parental biological clone. Such a reduction is enormous, and it should serve to compare the decrease of specific infectivity that accompanies virus extinction by lethal mutagenesis. (Decreases of specific infectivity are mentioned in Section 4.3 of Chapter 4 as one of the consequences of suboptimal codon usage, and are revisited in Chapter 9 as a diagnostic parameter of lethal mutagenesis). A proof that pursuing molecular analysis of clones subjected to many bottleneck transfers may provide new information was documented by the discovery of an amino acid substitution in capsid protein VP1 that produced virus thermosensitivity, and exerted an effect at a distance in the processing of the FMDV polyprotein (Escarmís et al., 2009) , unveiling a new feature of picornavirus protein processing (Martínez-Salas and Ryan, 2010).

The idea that NDV is restricted in the upper respiratory tract due to its lower temperature is supported by the significant reduction in NDV-BC plaque size observed in cell culture during incubation performed at lower temperatures characteristic of the upper respiratory tract in primates; in contrast, no reduction was observed for HPIV3, a human respiratory pathogen (Fig. 7) . Moreover, the production of virus during single-and multi-cycle growth experiments was strongly reduced at 32 • C for NDV-BC and NDV-BC/S but not for HPIV3 (Fig. 8) . This was associated with reduced and delayed production of intracellular NDV antigen at 32 • C (Fig. 9 ). The observation that the replication of HPIV3 was not reduced at 32 • C suggests that the reduced expression and replication of NDV at this reduced temperature is an intrinsic property of the virus rather than an artifact due to a reduced cellular metabolism. Thus, the ability of human viruses such as human influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza viruses to efficiently replicate in the upper respiratory tract provides for spread to the lower respiratory tract, in which dendritic cells and other antigen-presenting cells are abundantly present. In contrast, we suggest that the inefficient antigen expression and reduced virus production of NDV in the upper respiratory tract of primates results in reduced spread the lower respiratory tract and reduced immune stimulation.",12.456936417642726,6.137550833342694

Another arbovirus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), can also adapt simultaneously to sandfly and vertebrate host cells, and the mutation rate of the virus in specialized compared to alternating-host passages is the same. This contradicts the hypothesis that arboviruses are constrained in their evolutionary potential 87 . Surprisingly, VSV populations that are specialized for replication in vertebrate cells showed fitnessincreases for replication in sandfly cells, indicating a lack of specificity in some adaptation events. Further study of these model systems is needed to determine if alternating passages generate mutations that increase fitness in both cell types, or if they generate a polymorphic population with host-cell-specific adaptive mutations. Recent in vivo experiments have produced results that contradict the cell-culture experimental models of arbovirus evolution. When VEEV was placed into a laboratory transmission cycle -consisting of ten cycles in hamsters alternating with ten cycles in A. aegypti mosquitoes -genetic stability of the virus isolates was observed, and virus fitness was either reduced or unchanged. However, specialization for replication in the hamster host resulted in rapid increases in virus fitness with many mutations, consistent with virus adaptation and evolutionary constraints imposed by the alternating-host cycle of arboviruses 88 . Cell-culture models probably do not fully reflect in vivo conditions, as artefacts (such as selection for virus binding to heparin sulphate) might distort results 89, 90 .",15.421965125062352,8.510460175077517

It could serve as a cofactor for S, assisting attachment of virus to host cells. Additionally, it could prevent aggregation of progeny virions and travel of virus through the extracellular mucosa (Cornelissen et al., 1997) . The role of HE protein in coronavirus infection has been systematically documented in a recent pair of elegant studies Lissenberg et al., 2005) . To evaluate the cost and benefit of the HE gene, three isogenic MHV mutants were engineered: HE þ , with an expressed and functional HE gene; HE 0 , with an expressed HE gene that was inactive, owing to active site point mutations; and HE À , which lacked HE expression because of an introduced frameshift. It was demonstrated that, following multiple passages, there was rapid loss of HE expression in the HE þ virus. Moreover, competition experiments showed a growth advantage for the HE À virus, but not the HE 0 virus. Consistent with this, examination of esterase-negative mutants arising from the HE þ virus showed that it was not loss of activity, but, rather, loss of the ability of HE to be incorporated into virions that correlated with the growth advantage of HE À viruses . By contrast, in infections of mice, it was found that the presence of HE (whether or not it was enzymatically active) dramatically enhanced neurovirulence, as measured by viral spread and lethality . These results imply that sialic acid-bearing coreceptors can function to influence the course of MHV infection. Thus, the HE protein is a burden in vitro but provides an advantage to the virus in vivo. The selection against HE in vitro provides a cautionary example that tissue culture adaptation of a virus can rapidly lead to selection of a variant that differs from the natural isolate.",14.692568033295583,7.16732939906438

Gene editing may result in a loss of function through knock-out, a change of function through gene replacement, or a gain of function through knock-in techniques (Zhang et al., 2017) . Genome editing has important therapeutic benefits and holds enormous potential for improving public health (Naldini, 2015) . For example, gain-of-function research (i.e., research intended to increase the transmissibility and/or virulence of pathogens) can actually improve our understanding of how pathogens interact with their hosts, help us assess the potential of pathogens to cause pandemics, and aid in the development of medical countermeasures and public health preparedness (Selgelid, 2016). The CPISPR Cas9 gene editing tool has been successfully used to create a gene driverda genetic system use to hijack a population through the propagation of a gene through multiple generationsdto control the spread of malaria that, in time, could be used to edit the DNA of any living organism (Selgelid, 2016) . Nevertheless, the publication of the results of a successful attempt by researchers to genetically modify influenza A/H5N1 virus so that it was transmissible by the airborne route in ferrets raised serious biosecurity concerns. By demonstrating that avian A/H5N1 influenza virus could be transmitted by the airborne route between mammals, the researchers highlighted its pandemic potential for humans (Herfst et al., 2012) . Critics questioned the potential benefits of the results when compared with the biosafety and potential dual-use risks. Concerns have been raised not only over the potential misuse of the results of gain-of-function research but also on research in human germline editing and gene drives and the potential for misuse of emerging gene editing technologies. The risk of intentional or unintentional release of a gene driveemodified organism during research and development, transfer between labs, or due to inadequate containment procedures is small but not zero. Newly developed gene editing tools such as zinc-finger nucleases, transcription activator-like effector nucleases, and Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR-Cas) systems are publicly available (DiEuliis and Giordano, 2018; Maeder and Gersbach, 2016) . The most popular and widely used of these tools are the CPISPR systems (CRISPR-Cas9, CRISPR-Cpf1, and CRISPR-C2c1) (Zhang et al., 2017) . CRISPR tools for editing prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes are readily available online at an affordable cost, including user friendly instructions (Sneed, 2017) . In the United States, biohacker boot camps teach basic gene editing skills, and interest in gene editing is growing. Just recently, it was demonstrated that mail-order DNA could be used to create horse pox virus de novo (Kupferschmidt, 2017; Noyce et al., 2018) .

Synthesizing our data and previous studies, we offer the following conceptual framework to explain our observations, acknowledging that expanded studies are necessary to confirm its broader application. We propose that the stringency of transmission bottlenecks and the main evolutionary forces driving them may change throughout the host adaptation process. We speculate that at earlier stages of host adaptation, there may not be one ''most fit'' virus that is able to outcompete the rest of the population after transmission to localized regions of the respiratory tract (Karlsson et al., 2015; Lakdawala et al., 2015; Matrosovich et al., 2004) . A non-mutually exclusive hypothesis is that a larger inoculum may be required to found infection in the absence of a single highly fit variant. These hypotheses could explain the surprising finding that the first transmission bottleneck was loose, even though relatively few ''avian-like'' viruses would be expected to be fit for transmission in mammals. Indeed, we speculate that viruses that are well adapted for transmission in a particular host species would again exhibit loose transmission bottlenecks, as most variants would be of similar transmission fitness; the recent observation of loose genetic bottlenecks in transmission of seasonal influenza viruses among human household contacts supports this hypothesis (Poon et al., 2016) .",13.318901632400312,5.677104699572111

However, the phenotypic and genotypic assays used to discriminate between these fidelity changes may not be sensitive enough to detect subtle differences among natural isolates. Furthermore, given the quasispecies nature of RNA virus populations, it is not known whether fidelity variants exist at low frequencies within the mutant spectrum and whether they would modulate overall population fidelity. For instance, Coxsackie virus B3 mutator strains that presented mutation frequencies nearer to wild-type values did not display attenuated phenotypes ). This raises the possibility that slightly elevated mutation rates could be advantageous in conditions that require more rapid adaptation. Interestingly, the A372V and S299T Coxsackie virus variants, respectively, presenting moderately higher and lower fidelities, exist as natural isolates. Threonine at position 299 is found in 5 % of the isolates, while valine at position 372 is found in 86 % (Harrison et al. 2008) . It is thus possible that at any given time, a RNA virus quasispecies contains a subpopulation of mutators and antimutators, whose frequencies may fluctuate when environmental pressures require more rapid evolution or better maintenance of genetic integrity. Importantly, the study of fidelity variants in tissue culture has been nearly exclusively performed in highly permissible, immortalized cell lines during only a few replication cycles. Recent studies show that the mutation rates and frequencies of viruses can dramatically change depending on cell type (Rozen-Gagnon et al. 2014; Combe and Sanjuan 2014) . Therefore, under more stringent selective pressures, the fidelity of RNA viruses may be adjusted. Indeed, evolution of mutation rates has been observed in bacteria during colonization in vivo or in conditions of starvation (Sniegowski et al. 1997) . A similar phenomenon may occur for RNA viruses, but this remains to be demonstrated.",12.876059447845702,8.301112562708367

The idea that NDV is restricted in the upper respiratory tract due to its lower temperature is supported by the significant reduction in NDV-BC plaque size observed in cell culture during incubation performed at lower temperatures characteristic of the upper respiratory tract in primates; in contrast, no reduction was observed for HPIV3, a human respiratory pathogen (Fig. 7) . Moreover, the production of virus during single-and multi-cycle growth experiments was strongly reduced at 32°C for NDV-BC and NDV-BC/S but not for HPIV3 (Fig. 8) . This was associated with reduced and delayed production of intracellular NDV antigen at 32°C (Fig. 9 ). The observation that the replication of HPIV3 was not reduced at 32°C suggests that the reduced expression and replication of NDV at this reduced temperature is an intrinsic property of the virus rather than an artifact due to a reduced cellular metabolism. Thus, the ability of human viruses such as human influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza viruses to efficiently replicate in the upper respiratory tract provides for spread to the lower respiratory tract, in which dendritic cells and other antigen-presenting cells are abundantly present. In contrast, we suggest that the inefficient antigen expression and reduced virus production of NDV in the upper respiratory tract of primates results in reduced spread the lower respiratory tract and reduced immune stimulation.",11.963208355502644,6.33200658688816

In contrast, the genome of the AH65-R-TC isolate changed at only 8 nucleotide positions from the AH65-R strain after a similar number of cell culture passages (14 tissue culture passages and 1 plaque purification). These findings suggest that enteric BCoV strains are more prone to change than respiratory BCoV strains during cell culture adaptation and passage. Unexpectedly, of the 104 mutations observed in the AH65-E-TC, 86 mutated to be the same as the corresponding nucleotides of the AH65-R isolate ( Table 1) . As a result, the AH65-E-TC genetically resembled the AH65-R strain more than the parent AH65-E strain. Particularly noteworthy, whereas the spike gene of the AH65-E differed from that of the AH65-R at 31 nucleotide positions, there was only one nucleotide difference in spike genes between the AH65-E-TC isolate and the AH65-R strain (Table 1) . This is surprising because the HRT-18 cells used for in vitro viral adaptation and passage are human rectum epithelial cells and therefore are of intestinal and not respiratory origin. However, the AH65-E-TC isolate still differed from the AH65-R strain at 48 nucleotides with 37 of these divergences located in ORF1a and 1b genes. The latter substantial genomic differences argue against the AH65-E-TC isolate being an AH65-R variant that arose from contamination during the process of tissue culture adaptation and passage. The data from these isolates suggest that similar evolutionary processes may have occurred in vitro during BCoV adaptation to cell culture as those happening in vivo during adaptation from enteric to respiratory tropism.

While the implications of economic crisis at the international and national levels are undoubtedly of legitimate priority and concern, placing climate issues on the back-burner is misguided for two reasons. First, while the financial crisis may be acute and possibly prolonged in the short term –years, but not decades – the climate change crisis will last well into the next century and beyond. Investments in health system capacity and surveillance need to be implemented in advance of emerging impacts to avoid and/or mitigate morbidity and mortality. Additionally, observed climate impacts will begin to rapidly accelerate over the next decade. In the absence of genuine and dramatic intervention, climate change impacts have the potential to be severe and acute on a scale greatly exceeding the current financial crisis (3, 4, 6, 7). The lack of action on climate change – including both mitigation of emissions and adaptation to current and future impacts – is generally rationalized based on the costs of interventions. The costs of a no-action approach, however, will be significant. The Stern Review, an independent assessment commissioned in the United Kingdom, estimated that a 5–6 °C warming over the next century could result in losses of up to 20% of global GDP (101); the report estimates the cost of mitigating climate emissions and severe impacts at approximately 1% of global GDP. The health sector, which makes up 10% of Canada’s Gross National Product (GNP) can make a significant contribution to climate change mitigation and adaptation in Canada (102, 103).",15.579504138726273,12.423101922148861

Modification of such genes by mutation or their acquisition by recombination or reassortment opens the way to a change in host range and to disease emergence. In the present article I have emphasized a major issue of RNA virus genetics that has been considered only marginally in several studies on the mechanisms of viral disease emergence. The issue is that RNA viruses replicate as complex mutant distributions, termed viral quasispecies, and that the complexity and composition of mutant distributions are key factors in virus adaptation and persistence [13, 14, 16, 23, 70, 73, 84] (Tab. I). Contrary to designed experiments of adaptation of a virus to new host in which the role of mutant spectra in the adaptation process has been observed [64], no such observations have been made in the process of a natural emergence. Therefore, there is no definitive proof that a number of related mutants from a donor host reached a potential new host, or that genetic variation of the colonizing virus was essential for the establishment of the virus in the new host. However, what the molecular studies on viral genomes tell us is that when more than one virus particle reaches a recipient host there is a high probability that the genomes will not be identical, and that they may display fitness differences. It is worth noting that fitness changes can occur in viral quasispecies without being reflected in any modification of the genomic consensus nucleotide sequence [30–32]. Thus, relevant biological information can be lost if surveys of viral genomic sequences (for the purpose of the control of disease emergence or other), are restricted to the determination of consensus sequences. A new era to penetrate into the mutant spectrum composition has started with the use of the new ultra deep sequencing or microarray-based methodologies by which the characterization of mutant spectra can be based on thousands of sequences [20, 47, 82, 86, 88].",19.8657360554642,9.872106127770472

Mutation is a universal mechanism of genetic variation that affects all viruses, while recombination appears to vary greatly in frequency among different viruses. Segment reassortment is obviously restricted to viruses with segmented genomes. It must be emphasized that fitness values, as well as the fitness effects of genetic variation, are dependent on the sequence context of a viral genome and on the physical and biological environments in which the virus replication capacity is tested.

The main ones are: (1) the virus is competent to replicate equally well in the donor host species and in the recipient new host species. No genetic variation for the change of host range is needed. The reason why the emergence did not occur before is that either the encounter between the two hosts had not occurred until then, or that a threshold dose of virus needed for the successful introduction had not been attained in past encounters. Such a threshold amount of virus can be imposed by limited virus particle stability, the immune response of the recipient host, and other factors. (2) The virus is not efficient in replicating in the new host, and genetic variation of the virus must intervene to achieve a successful introduction. In this case, again, several factors come into play. They are briefly described here solely to emphasize the complex and unpredictable nature of a successful introduction step. Mutagenesis is a highly stochastic event subject to the quantum-mechanic uncertainties associated with formation of infrequent tautomeric forms, or other alterations of nucleotides that contribute to misincorporation events [5, 26]. Although in RNA virus genetics it is often considered that mutation rates are high enough not to be the limiting factor for adaptability, there is a caveat in this argument when applied to a disease emergence that requires modification of the host range of a virus. In general, the generation of a specific mutant type will not be a limiting factor provided that: (i) the standard mutation rates that have been measured for RNA viruses operate [4, 14, 17] (discussed in the previous section), (ii) the population size of the replicating virus is sufficiently large, and (iii) that once the required mutation has occurred, the mutant virus maintains a sufficient fitness level, in the context of the surrounding mutant spectrum. However, a natural chance contact between an infected donor host and a potential recipient of another host species is unlikely to involve a large viral population size. Under such conditions, the occurrence of the mutations required for a change in host range may become a limiting factor for the introduction phase of disease emergence. In some designed experiments of adaptation of a virus in a new host species it has been shown than an initial inefficient replication in a recipient host is followed by fitness increase mediated by point mutations that occurred gradually in the mutant spectrum of the viral quasispecies evolving in vivo [64]. The barriers imposed by the host to a new viral pathogen may render establishment unlikely. The required viral genetic change must lie within the range achievable by mutation, recombination or reassortment (or their combinations) in the given environmental context.",15.042988155744084,7.799101284207467

Similarly, a Canadian outbreak of imported malaria in 1995–97 may have been brought to Canada via travelers arriving from the Punjab in India, where a large epidemic had occurred (63, 98–100). More recently, concern regarding the potential spread or proliferation of avian influenza has highlighted the interconnected nature of national health to health conditions around the world. As such, the health impacts of climate change in Canada will be influenced by the health and response capacity of other nations from or to which Canadians, visitors or trade products travel. In this context, adaptation, preparedness and response resources may in some cases be most effectively and efficiently allocated through supporting health capacity in other countries. Increased interest and prioritization of health collaborations in Asia following the SARS outbreak provides a germane example of a developing awareness of such risk priorities.",13.923031542755737,7.505655541936706

Viral quasispecies constitute reservoirs of genetic and phenotypic variants, with several biological implications for viral evolution and pathogenesis, some of which have become apparent over the last few years (reviews in [13, 14, 16, 25]) (Tab. I). The main conceptual extension that quasispecies has represented for RNA virus genetics is that the “wild type” can no longer be assigned to a specific genomic nucleotide sequence but to a distribution of sequences. Mutation is not an occasional event but a continuously occurring event. When the consensus sequence is seen as invariant it is not because mutations did not occur but because they occurred in components of mutant spectrum without a change in the average or consensus sequence (Fig. 1). This is a key departure from classic genetics, and one of the fuels for viral disease emergences, since viral quasispecies may provide viral subpopulations ready to be selected in response to an environmental change, for example, an alternative host. As discussed below, the multi-phenotypic potential inherent to viral quasispecies represents a major driving force for viral disease emergence. In some cases, however a mutation reflected in the consensus (epidemic VEEV amplification in horses, expansion of influenza host range, etc.) may also serve as determinant of an emergence.

Much of the debate involving the H5N1 experiments which demonstrated the “gain” of ferret transmissibility focused on the publication of the specific mutations that conferred this property. However, the major scientific finding was the observation that this virus had the biological capacity to be transmitted between mammals after alterations in a few amino acids. In fact, this finding is of great value to humanity, because it suggested that a human H5N1 pandemic might be able to occur if and when similar mutations occurred spontaneously, as is characteristic of influenza viruses, along with conditions favorable for bird-to-mammal transmission. In another set of GOF experiments, the HPAIV H7N1 was shown to be capable of mammalian transmission due to mutations that did not change receptor specificity (5). As a result of these experiments humanity has much more knowledge and stands warned of the potential perils these viruses pose. This information emerged from GOF experiments. In fact, it is difficult to imagine another mechanism for obtaining the information that has been gained from GOF-type experiments, particularly because it is only through experiments that can control the expression of given determinants that proof can be obtained. Since proof of the germ theory, modern scientific proof generally requires the use of approaches that attribute a given property to a given determinant. Hence, GOF-type experiments are of particular epistemological value because they directly imply causality. Apart from informing on the potential for virulence and transmissibility, GOF experiments are powerful tools for dissecting questions concerning viral pathogenesis. For example, H5N1 mutational analysis showed that the efficiency of viral replication in avian and mammalian cells is dependent on hemagglutinin polymorphisms that facilitate activation at lower pH (7, 8). This finding could be exploited to increase the yield of virus during preparation of vaccine stocks. Furthermore, the identification of sequence changes associated with GOF could in theory lead to the identification of new antiviral targets, thus providing a potential societal benefit. The power of GOF experiments is that they are a highly efficient, reliable, and effective tool that can identify certain phenotypes that often cannot be identified by using other scientific approaches. Hence, we feel that there is ample evidence that GOF experiments can provide important information and are useful tools for investigation of influenza virus-related questions. In fact, we believe that the crux of the debate surrounding GOF experiments is not their value but their potential risk.",12.415211294815615,6.804999759946254

Besides being used to create vaccine viruses for the development of live, attenuated (12) and inactivated prepandemic H5N1 influenza vaccines (13), reverse-genetics methodologies also have been used for many years to study the phenotypic consequences of particular mutations, including genetic changes that confer a gain of function (GOF). Influenza virus GOF studies have focused on several research areas: in vitro and/or in vivo replication in mammalian cell culture or animal hosts, adaptive mutations conferring changes in host susceptibility, alteration of receptor binding profiles and/or tropism for mammalian airway tissues, enhanced polymerase activity, changes in host antiviral response (e.g., cell signaling pathways), susceptibility to antiviral drugs, and pathogenesis and/or transmissibility in mammalian animal models. Such GOF experiments have elucidated key biological principles and provided the scientific basis for genomic sequence-based risk assessment of zoonotic viruses with pandemic potential. For example, the molecular basis for avian versus mammalian influenza virus receptor binding (α2,3 versus α2,6 sialylated glycans) has been elucidated largely through GOF experiments, and some recent studies that identified specific HA mutations conferring a switch from avian to mammalian host receptor specificity also demonstrated the impact of these mutations on the ability of H5N1 virus to more efficiently infect the human upper respiratory tract (14–19). Mutations conferring enhanced virulence in mammalian models or inhibition of the host antiviral response with the potential to cause more serious human illness have been described in other studies (20–22). Still other GOF work characterized mutations that confer resistance to neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors (23–26). These data are critical to make effective drug treatment decisions and to inform stockpiling of antiviral medications. Finally, many publications have described mutations that confer adaptation of H5N1 viruses to mammalian hosts and transmissibility in guinea pigs or ferrets (19, 24, 27). It should be noted that in many cases, this research can demonstrate loss of function, which is also valuable for risk assessment. These types of studies provide vital data with which to monitor circulating viruses for features that may suggest increased capability for human-to-human transmission or more long-term adaptation of H5N1 viruses in humans or other mammalian hosts, such as pigs.",14.908675374505698,9.297064927887144

RNA viruses carry RNA as their genetic material and can quickly adapt to and exploit different hosts because of the high error rates of the viral enzymes (RNA-dependent RNA polymerases) during their replication.18 The segmented nature and faulty replication mechanisms of Orthomyxoviruses promote genetic variability and frequent re-assortment events, resulting in genetically diverse and novel genomic constellations in infected hosts.19 As an example, hemagglutinin surface proteins of the influenza A virus undergo antigenic drift and shift, acquiring new infectivity and evading recognition by the immune system.20 Another important consequence of the unstable genomic make-up of RNA viruses is the potential for interspecies transmission between animal hosts and humans.

This is especially true for studies that offer insight into the virologic and molecular changes associated with increased capacity for mammalian transmission, a hallmark of pandemic influenza viruses. As outlined above, GOF studies have provided critical information for molecularly based surveillance, as well as for research groups sequencing, characterizing, or experimentally testing these viruses.

That rationale was to predict pandemic potential of natural isolates, which Fouchier earlier argued was associated with “airborne transmission” best studied in mammalian nonhuman hosts (24). Likewise, Yoshihiro Kawaoka described the purpose of his ferret gain-of-transmission studies as “[t]o determine whether H5N1 viruses could be transmitted between humans” (25), and the original reports of ferret transmission experiments say that pandemic potential is associated with the changes observed. For example: “Whether this virus may acquire the ability to be transmitted via aerosols or respiratory droplets among mammals, including humans, to trigger a future pandemic is a key question for pandemic preparedness … Identification of the minimal requirements for virus transmission between mammals may have prognostic and diagnostic value for improving pandemic preparedness” (17). Similarly, in another ferret transmission study on synthetic 1918-like viruses from the Kawaoka lab, mutations conferring ferret transmissibility are specifically called “human-adaptive mutations” (26). The CDC considers ferret transmissibility and human alpha-2,6 receptor binding to be 2 of the top 3 predictors of the threat of emergence of influenza viruses (27). A recent publication by CDC influenza virologists suggests that they interpret specific mutations found in the ferret gain-of-transmission studies as signaling human adaptation, not specifically ferret adaptation (28).",14.977220355085226,9.116830059403272

Fouchier initiated public discussion of these studies by claiming he had created “probably one of the most dangerous viruses you can make” (29). Current denials that this is possible seem to be designed to reduce perceived risk from the experiments rather than to describe new scientific data or understanding. Paul Keim, the Chair of the National Science Advisory Board on Biosecurity who reviewed the original submission of the H5N1 paper, stated, “I can’t think of another pathogenic organism that is as scary as this one” (29). The reaction of another member of the NSABB, Michael Imperiale, was as follows: “[Imperiale] also says it was news to him that the mutated virus did not spread between ferrets via the aerosol route as readily as seasonal strains, as Fouchier showed at the ASM meeting. ‘That really didn’t come across to me in the paper,’ he says. ‘I didn’t see that kind of comparison.’” (30). Without understanding why this change in interpretation has occurred, it is difficult to incorporate into a risk analysis a speculation that ferret adaptation reduces human adaptation, as Fouchier argues in his paper.

Certain biological traits may allow a virus to infect one cell type over another, known as cell tropism (Koyanagi et al., 1987). Whether or not a virus is able to infect a susceptible cell depends firstly on recognition of a cellular receptor on the cell surface and secondly on intracellular host factors that dictate whether the host cell is permissive to virus replication. Therefore, amino acid substitutions caused by nucleotide mutations in the structural or nonstructural region of the virus genome can affect both the host range and cell tropism of a virus. When categorising viruses based on a phylogenetic relationship it is important to note that a single amino acid change can have a substantial effect on the phenotypic traits of a virus. Therefore, when a virus exists as a collection of variants or quasispecies, although the phylogeny and ancestry of the viruses may be similar, the host range, tropism, pathogenicity and epidemiology of the variants may differ greatly (Domingo et al., 2012).

We develop a statistical framework for the unbiased assessment of the mutual pairwise distances between all viruses and all recognized hosts. To test the hypothesis of general molecular adaptation of a virus toward its hosts, we focus on codon usage and amino acid preferences within groups of viruses that are unified at varying taxonomical granularities. We observe that all bacteriophages are strongly tuned to match their unique hosts and this correspondence is also evident in their GC contents. However, somewhat surprisingly, viruses that infect humans resemble all mammalian hosts equally, and this similarity even extends to aves and several insects. This observation does not hold for viruses of other mammals, despite a strong similarity among the codon usages of most mammals. Finally, we show that viral selection of codon usage toward that of the host has not occurred uniformly for all proteins of the virus, but it is mainly dominated by the set of proteins expressed in high abundance.

This demonstrates that there is great need to understand the role that minority variants play in phenotypic changes in vaccine development, as changes in the mutant spectrum may significantly alter the phenotype of vaccines.

In particular, an important conclusion of the original study was that despite encouraging results in in vitro studies, the drug did not work as expected in vivo (31).

In many cases, the fitness impact of recoding is cell-line dependent (62, 66, (68) (69) (70) (77) (78) (79) , is inconsistent between in vivo and in vitro experiments (63, 69, 79, 79) , or is temporally variable (73) . Another obstacle is the nature of the genetic code itself: it is generally challenging to manipulate one compositional feature of the genome and hold all the others fixed. For example, when codons are shuffled to change codon pair frequency, mRNA stability may be affected. Or when codons are deoptimized, codon pair frequencies also change. This makes it difficult to attribute the cause of fitness decreases to one factor ( e.g. codon usage adaptation), especially when the features are correlated. As we do here, most studies have focused on manipulating a single compositional feature of the genome and measuring its impact on fitness. Standardizing recoding methodologies and features measured across studies would greatly improve our understanding of the factors that drive fitness decreases and other phenotypic effects caused by synonymous deoptimization.",15.361525681993417,9.318920246346163

While numerous predictive studies 29 were published during the 2016-2017 Zika Virus (ZIKV) pandemic, it remains unknown how 30 timely, reproducible and actionable the information produced by these studies was. METHODS: 31 To improve the functional use of mathematical modeling in support of future infectious disease 32 outbreaks, we conducted a systematic review of all ZIKV prediction studies published during the 33 recent ZIKV pandemic using the PRISMA guidelines. Using MEDLINE, EMBASE and grey 34 literature review, we identified studies that forecasted, predicted or simulated ecological or 35 epidemiological phenomenon related to the Zika pandemic that were published as of March 01, 36 2017. Eligible studies underwent evaluation of objectives, data sources, methods, timeliness, 37 reproducibility, accessibility and clarity by independent reviewers. RESULTS: 2034 studies were 38 identified, of which n = 73 met eligibility criteria. Spatial spread, R 0 (basic reproductive number) 39 and epidemic dynamics were most commonly predicted, with few studies predicting Guillain-40 Barré Syndrome burden (4%), sexual transmission risk (4%) and intervention impact (4%). Most 41 studies specifically examined populations in the Americas (52%), with few African-specific 42 studies (4%). Case count (67%), vector (41%) and demographic data (37%) were the most 43 common data sources. Real-time internet data and pathogen genomic information were used in 44 7% and 0% of studies, respectively, and social science and behavioral data were typically absent 45 in modeling efforts. Deterministic models were favored over stochastic approaches. Forty 46 percent of studies made model data entirely available, 29% provided all relevant model code, 47 43% presented uncertainty in all predictions and 54% provided sufficient methodological detail 48 allowing complete reproducibility. Fifty-one percent of predictions were published after the 49 epidemic peak in the Americas. While the use of preprints improved the accessibility of ZIKV 50 predictions by a median 119 days sooner than journal publication dates, they were used in only 51 30% of studies. CONCLUSIONS: Many ZIKV predictions were published during the 2016-2017 52 pandemic. The accessibility, reproducibility, timeliness, and incorporation of uncertainty in 53 these published predictions varied and indicates that there is substantial room for 54 improvement. To enhance the utility of analytical tools for outbreak response, it is essential to 55 improve the sharing of model data, code, and preprints for future outbreaks, epidemics and 56 pandemics.",10.714369248555647,8.134501392565461

Yet, the molecular basis that underlies their phenotypic convergence remains unknown. Here, we used a recently developed molecular phyloecological approach to examine the molecular basis leading to their phenotypic convergence. Our genome-level analyses show that the spike protein, which is responsible for receptor binding, has undergone significant Darwinian selection along the branches related to 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV. Further examination shows an unusually high proportion of evolutionary convergent amino acid sites in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein between COVID-19 and SARS-related CoV clades, leading to the phylogenetic uniting of their RBD protein sequences. In addition to the spike protein, we also find the evolutionary convergence of its partner protein, ORF3a, suggesting their possible co-evolutionary convergence. Our results demonstrate a strong adaptive evolutionary convergence between COVID-19 and SARS-related CoV, possibly facilitating their adaptation to similar or identical receptors. Finally, it should be noted that many observed bat SARS-like CoVs that have an evolutionary convergent RBD sequence with 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV may be preadapted to human host receptor ACE2, and hence would be potential new coronavirus sources to infect humans in the future.",10.565900714123053,5.776976912044814

When zoonotic IAVs enter the human population, the viral 26 hemagglutinin (HA) requires adaptation to achieve sustained virus transmission. In 27 contrast, IBV has been circulating in humans, its only host, for a long period of time. 28 Whether this entailed adaptation of IBV HA to the human airways is unknown. To address 29 this question, we compared seasonal IAV (A/H1N1 and A/H3N2) and IBV viruses 30 (B/Victoria and B/Yamagata lineage) with regard to host-dependent activity of HA as the 31 mediator of membrane fusion during viral entry. We first investigated proteolytic activation 32 of HA, by covering all type II transmembrane serine protease (TTSP) and kallikrein 33 enzymes, many of which proved present in human respiratory epithelium. Compared to 34 IAV, the IBV HA0 precursor is cleaved by a broader panel of TTSPs and activated with 35 much higher efficiency. Accordingly, knockdown of a single protease, TMPRSS2, was 36 sufficient to abrogate spread of IAV but not IBV in human respiratory epithelial cells. 37 Second, the HA fusion pH proved similar for IBV and human-adapted IAVs (one exception 38 being HA of 1918 IAV). Third, IBV HA exhibited higher expression at 33°C, a temperature 39 required for membrane fusion by B/Victoria HA. This indicates pronounced adaptation of 40 IBV HA to the mildly acidic pH and cooler temperature of human upper airways. These 41 distinct and intrinsic features of IBV HA are compatible with extensive host-adaptation 42 during prolonged circulation of this respiratory virus in the human population. 43 2 All rights reserved.

This variation may have arisen for two reasons. First, the empirical data that previous studies used were collected before 25 th Jan, 2020. Testing protocols and diagnostic tools changed during the early period of the study 23 , and the number of diagnosed cases collected before 15 th January were considered underestimated and less reliable. This would flatten the epidemic curve in early studies, and the estimation of R0 based on these data may be underestimated and have larger confidence intervals. Second, previous studies only estimated the R0 based on a single method, and these estimates may have been affected by the implicit assumptions in these models. For example, a previous paper using the assumption of exponential growth found a value of "" of 2.68 (95% Credible interval 2.47 -2.86) 5 using an SEIR model with Metropolis-Hastings MCMC estimates of uncertainty, but our modeling has shown that this method likely underestimated the basic reproduction number during the pre-closure period. Our model avoids the limitations of specific modeling choices by combining several methods with a Poisson Loss weight, using the most current and accurate case diagnosis. Through this approach we calculate a more robust estimate than previous studies, and find a higher value of "" . Ours is also the first study to compare the pre-and post-closure periods in the data, and thus the first study to make a judgment about the effectiveness of this strategy. Given the high risk of epidemic from COVID-19, it is important to assess the value of this strategy before the disease takes hold in another global city.",7.627322441110762,6.176883604148441

For example, both phenotypic resistance (i.e., non-inherited resistance) and tolerance are acquired under specific conditions that affect growth rate, such as 10 in biofilms 6, 52 . By contrast, inherited resistance arises from genetic mutations that alter key bacterial processes including metabolism, enzymatic activity, and drug efflux pumps 53 . In our studies, we demonstrated that environmental conditions (i.e., temperature, nutrient levels) affect the defiance phenotype; however, it is also likely that the onset of defiance could also arise from genetic mutations that affect E. coli growth rates or cleavage activity or proteases [54] [55] [56] .

Most patients presenting to British ambulance services are discharged at scene. Ambulance records are therefore an ideal data source for syndromic early event detection systems to monitor infectious disease in the prehospital population. It has been previously found that tympanic temperature records can be used to detect influenza outbreaks in emergency departments. This study investigated whether routine tympanic temperature readings collected by ambulance crews can be used to detect seasonal influenza. Here we show that these temperature readings do allow the detection of seasonal influenza before methods applied to conventional data sources. The counts of pyretic patients were used to calculate a sliding case ratio (CR) as a measurement to detect seasonal influenza outbreaks. This method does not rely on conventional thresholds and can be adapted to the data. The data collected correlated with seasonal influenza. The 2016/17 outbreak was detected with high specificity and sensitivity, up to 9 weeks before other surveillance programs. An unanticipated outbreak of E. coli was detected in the same dataset. Our results show that ambulance records can be a useful data source for biosurveillance systems. Two outbreaks caused by different infectious agents have been successfully detected. The routine ambulance records allowed to use tympanic temperature readings that can be used as surveillance tool for febrile diseases. Therefore, this method is a valuable addition to the current surveillance tools.",7.818703152678179,5.139113227804122
