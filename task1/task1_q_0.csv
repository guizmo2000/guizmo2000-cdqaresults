However, this initially requires understanding both bat populations and the dynamics of infections within them. • We propose that a combination of field and laboratory studies are needed to create data-driven mathematical models to elucidate aspects of bat ecology that are most critical to the dynamics of emerging bat viruses.",17.671199052568713,9.198261655532075

Among them, VACV is the prototypic poxvirus, a complex and enveloped DNA virus that is closely related to VARV and MPXV (26, 27) . Thus, the possibility of zoonotic poxviruses crossing the species barrier to infect other animals or humans may turn out to be a menace to global health status (28) (29) (30) . VACV serve as a model virus that can provide much information about other poxviruses. Additionally, several attenuated strains, such as modified vaccinia virus Ankara and the VACV Tian Tan (VTT) strain are currently used as vectors for vaccines or gene therapies against various diseases caused by pathogens or cancers, including HIV-1, malaria, and melanoma (31) . Due to its biological safety profile and importance in gene therapy, we chose the VTT strain for our study. The membrane of VACV-VTT can fuse with different cellular membranes and is amenable to labeling. Following macropinocytosis or dynaminmediated fluid phase uptake, VACV particles enter the cells via fusion with the plasma membrane at neutral pH or acidified endosomal membrane triggered at low pH (32) (33) (34) . However, there is no explicit report whether IFITM3 inhibits poxviruses entry by similar mechanisms of exerting its antiviral role in other viruses.",20.470454883111817,8.953605950908518

A term infant has an 80-90 ml/kg blood volume until age of 3 months, after which the total blood volume drops to 70 ml/kg [2] . The difference in total blood volume in an infant compared to that in an adult is an important consideration in determining how much blood to transfuse in a child. As such, formulas have been developed to guide clinicians during massive blood loss (blood loss greater than 1 blood volume) in a child without preexisting anemia. The blood loss at which transfusion should be considered in a child (or an adult) without preexisting anemia (maximal allowable blood loss (MABL)) can be estimated from the following formula [30] :",20.226930396228017,11.258816271786038

Fatal septicaemia caused by Streptococcus suis, one of the most important swine pathogens worldwide [49] , in combination with septicaemia from Streptococcus pneumoniae and infection by chicken infectious bronchitis virus were found in a single embryo. This concentration of livestock pathogens has not been reported before and, to our knowledge, this is the first report of the three pathogens causing disease in a wild bird. Other pathogens recorded in embryos and nestlings, including Salmonella serotypes and phages typical of livestock [50] , and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli O86 causing septicaemia, were potentially transmitted by consumption of carcasses of infected poultry and other livestock [22, 27, 28] . In addition, we found that the IBD virus infected most individuals alone or together with other pathogens also potentially acquired from livestock carrion. This virus causes a highly contagious immunosuppressive bursal disease in poultry [51] and may be transmitted to wildlife in contact with poultry waste or by ingestion of carcasses [22, 52] . Nestlings are especially susceptible to IBD because of the primary role of bursa of Fabricius in immune function development at this age. In fact, immunosuppression due to IBD was indicated by the inflammation, necrosis and loss of lymphocytes in the bursa of Fabricius together with the presence of viral antigens recorded by means of immunocytochemical procedures. The potential impact of highly pathogenic and contagious poultry viruses has been previously recognized as a threat to wildlife health due to the increasing contact of wildlife with livestock operations in general, and poultry farms and their residues in particular, in natural areas worldwide [52] [53] [54] [55] . However, damage from IBD virus on the bursa of Fabricius represents, to our knowledge, the first evidence of clinical disease compatible with death caused by this poultry virus in wildlife. The presence of IBD has been not previously recorded in embryos of wild birds, probably because vertical transmission has been ruled out in poultry and, as consequence, it has probably not been evaluated in other species until now. This striking and concerning result could be related to the longer egg development and incubation periods of bearded vultures compared with poultry, and/or due to contrasting environmental conditions during incubation between bearded vultures and poultry. Thus, embryo infection with IBD may occurs via the female or during incubation as a consequence of egg contact between the egg and poultry remains in the nests of bearded vultures, which requires more research.",25.31306541619537,14.023669739864697

Studies in humans and animal models have shown that symptoms are not immediate and appear days or even weeks after infection. Since the initial symptoms are a manifestation of virus recognition by elements of the innate immune response, early virus replication must go largely undetected. The interval between infection and the emergence of symptoms is called the incubation period and is widely used as a clinical score. While incubation periods have been described for many virus infections the underlying mechanism for this asymptomatic phase has not been comprehensively documented. Here we review studies of the interaction between human pathogenic respiratory RNA viruses and the host with a particular emphasis on the mechanisms used by viruses to inhibit immunity. We discuss the concept of the ""stealth phase"", defined as the time between infection and the earliest detectable inflammatory response. We propose that the ""stealth phase"" phenomenon is primarily responsible for the suppression of symptoms during the incubation period and results from viral antagonism that inhibits major pathways of the innate immune system allowing an extended time of unhindered virus replication.",28.39563562978447,15.85697198786536

It is of course possible to also study more complicated models allowing for individual heterogeneity in susceptibility and/ or various types of contacts having different transmission probabilities, both at distinct times and also during extended periods, e.g. household contacts, but here we consider the simplest model still taking multiple exposures into account, compatible with limited data, only number and times of contacts and time of symptoms. Were data to be different, e.g. containing genetic information from whole genome sequencing of the pathogens, different models would be possible (e.g. [26] ). One can imagine several ways to try to avoid the multiple exposures problem. One approach could be to simply assume that the earliest potential infector is the infector, the likelihood contribution related to the incubation time distribution simplifying to g(s 2 e 1 ) (this would approximately be the same as equation (5.1) if p % 1). This would however certainly lead to the duration of incubation periods being overestimated. The opposite approach, to pretend that the most recent contact was the infector, would similarly lead to underestimation. A type of compromise could be to treat all potential contacts as being potential infection times (to different cases). As a consequence, one observation with k multiple potential infectors would then result in k independent incubation periods s 2 e 1 , . . ., s 2 e k , and the likelihood contribution would become Q k i¼1 g(s À e i ). Compared to the likelihood in equation (5.1), where the shorter incubation periods are given relatively lower weight due to the factor (1 2 p) i21 , such an analysis would lead to the incubation periods (and serial intervals) being underestimated and the precision of the biased estimate overestimated because of the apparent higher number of data points. A related assumption, leading to the same conclusion, would be to treat all potential exposures as equally likely (which would approximately hold true if p % 0).",28.442623210504046,13.63822159905636

This is similar to the model recently proposed by López-García and Kypraios (2018), as a unified framework for modeling the spread of nosocomial infections. We note that this epidemic model structure would be especially relevant for pathogens with no or short (i.e., negligible compared to the average patient's LOS) noninfectious or latent periods, and where the infectious period is long enough so that recovery of patients does not occur before discharge (or detection). Depending on the hospital ward under analysis and the average LOS of patients in this ward, this could be the case for influenza or norovirus. Pathogens with nonnegligible incubation periods (e.g., 7-21 days for measles) might require more complex stochastic epidemic model structures such as the SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infective-recovered). On the other hand, when analyzing hospital wards with longer average patient LOS, so that individuals may become infected and recover during their stay, SIRS-type epidemic models would be required to represent the recovery of patients (I → R) before discharge (R → S) occurs. We note here that in principle, the methodology outlined in Section 3 can be extended to any of these compartmental-based epidemic models for the disease spread dynamics, where the link between the deterministic zonal ventilation model for the airflow dynamics and the stochastic epidemic model for disease spread dynamics would still be as in Section 2. In a similar way, more complex epidemic model structures could allow one to study the infection spread dynamics after outbreak detection and declaration occurs. In this article, we have focused instead on the impact of ventilation on disease spread until the end or declaration of the outbreak.

Eckland (Medical Microbiology and Immunology, Creighton University in Omaha, NE, USA) introduced prion disease, and how prion strain interactions during incubation periods affect strain dynamics. Prion diseases are a group of inevitably fatal neurodegenerative diseases affecting mammals, including humans. Prion diseases are caused by a misfolded isoform of the prion protein, PrP Sc . Prion strains are operationally defined a heritable phenotype of disease under controlled transmission conditions that are hypothesized to be encoded by strain-specific conformations of PrP Sc . Prion strains can interfere with each other when a long incubation period strain (i.e., blocking strain) inhibits the replication of a short incubation period strain (i.e., non-blocking). Prion strain interference influences prion strain dynamics and the emergence of a strain from a mixture. However, it is unknown if two long incubation period strains can interfere with each other. To investigate this, they used a combination of protein misfolding cyclic amplification strain interference (PMCAsi) and animal bioassay. Using PMCAsi, they found a PrP Sc migration pattern consistent of a mixture of both strains, suggesting that strain interference is not occurring. Animal bioassay experiments are consistent with these in vitro findings. This is the first example of prion strain combinations that do not interfere with each other both in vitro and in vivo. This observation changes the paradigm of the interactions of prion strains in a mixture and has implication for interspecies transmission and emergence of prion strains from a mixture.",27.464111477137653,11.221051184833414

The ability of C/OK virus to readily transmit to contact ferrets suggests that a level of transmission potential to humans is possible. Second, C/OK virus displays a broader cellular tropism compared to human influenza C virus, and this virus seems quite plastic in terms of propagation because high temperatures such as 37uC do not restrict its replication at least in cell culture. Human influenza C virus causes a mild respiratory disease in humans and the infection is normally confined to the upper respiratory tract, although occasionally it can also cause lower respiratory infection [5] . Considering that C/ OK virus varies significantly from currently circulating human influenza C viruses in the amino acid sequences of predicted proteins, assessment of clinical disease in humans, particularly in children, caused potentially by C/OK is justified.

This approach allows for a direct comparison between analytical predictions and individual-based computer simulations, and for a detailed analysis of finite-size effects and convergence times, whose exponential growth will signal possible bistable disease scenarios. In such a framework, we were able to show that adaptive networks in which individuals may be informed about the health status of others lead to a disease whose effective infectiousness depends on the overall number of infected in the population. In other words, disease propagation on adaptive networks can be seen as mathematically equivalent to disease spreading on a well-mixed population, but with a rescaled effective infectiousness. In accord with the intuition advanced in the introduction, as long as individuals react promptly and consistently to accurate available information on whether their acquaintances are infected or not, network dynamics effectively weakens the disease burden the population suffers from. Last but not least, if disease recovery is possible, the time for disease eradication drastically reduces whenever individuals have access to accurate information about the health state of their acquaintances and use it to avoid contact with those infected. If recovery or immunity is impossible, the average time needed for a disease to spread increases significantly when such information is being used. In both cases, our model clearly shows how availability of information hinders disease progression (by means of quick action on infected, e.g., their containment via link removal), which constitutes a crucial factor to control the development of global pandemics.",28.551047248511843,15.233765682582325

Similarly, epidemic spreading may be affected by local information that makes individuals aware of the health status of their social contacts, allowing them to avoid contact with those infected and to remain in touch with the healthy. Here we study disease dynamics in finite populations in which infection occurs along the links of a dynamical contact network whose reshaping may be biased based on each individual's health status. We adopt some of the most widely used epidemiological models, investigating the impact of the reshaping of the contact network on the disease dynamics. We derive analytical results in the limit where network reshaping occurs much faster than disease spreading and demonstrate numerically that this limit extends to a much wider range of time scales than one might anticipate. Specifically, we show that from a population-level description, disease propagation in a quickly adapting network can be formulated equivalently as disease spreading on a well-mixed population but with a rescaled infectiousness. We find that for all models studied here -SI, SIS and SIR -the effective infectiousness of a disease depends on the population size, the number of infected in the population, and the capacity of healthy individuals to sever contacts with the infected. Importantly, we indicate how the use of available information hinders disease progression, either by reducing the average time required to eradicate a disease (in case recovery is possible), or by increasing the average time needed for a disease to spread to the entire population (in case recovery or immunity is impossible).",32.48910584437992,14.58800636168173

At par with these models, our model studies disease dynamics in a finite and constant population of individuals. Contrary to current models though (see Discussion Section for more details), our dynamical contact structure allows for a variable number of overall links between individuals, which in turn depends on the overall incidence of disease in the population. This increased complexity of the model, however, will allow us to describe analytically disease dynamics in finite populations. Infection occurs along the links of a contact network whose structure may change based on each individual's health status and the availability of information regarding the health status of others. We assume the existence of some form of (unsupervised) local information about the health status of social contacts, depending on which individuals may be more or less effective in avoiding contact with those infected while remaining in touch with the healthy. We investigate some of the most widely used models of disease spreading, such as the popular Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model [1, 3] , the Susceptible-Infected (SI) model [1] used to study, e.g., AIDS [1, 34] , and the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model [1, 35] , more appropriate to model, for instance, single season flu outbreaks [1] or computer virus spreading [5] . We provide analytical results which show that, on finite adaptive networks, the effective infectiousness of a disease depends on i) the size of the population, ii) the number of infected and ultimately iii) on the efficiency of local information spreading. These results, obtained under the assumption that network reshaping occurs much faster than disease spreading, are shown (numerically) to remain valid for a much wider range of time scales. When combined with the analytical results already known for static networks [3] , which describe well the opposite limit in which the network dynamics is slow compared to disease dynamics, we demonstrate that one can describe analytically most of the time scale spectra. We further show how availability of information may either drastically reduce the time required to eradicate a disease (when recovery from the disease is possible), or drastically increase the time after which the entire population becomes infected (when the disease cannot be cured). Finally, we discuss the implications of assuming that individuals exhibit diverse response profiles to available information [36] [37] [38] .",28.1237970169061,13.430558112411275

Factors that can limit the rate of detection include a high rate of subclinical cases, long incubation periods, and poor detection tools. The detection period can also be lengthened by the absence of active surveillance activities or lack of declaration in cases of clinical suspicion. For cow-calf systems or for dry dairy cows, farmers may easily miss some moderate clinical signs on some animals and not identify cases until clinical signs have become severe.

For example, the evaluation of Yunnan Province's emergency health response capability and core competence assessment index system at district-level control institutions was performed to guide and advance the progress of assessment targets as well as to provide a formative evaluation of management decisions. On the other hand, in Fujian Province, the study is concerned with the state of performance appraisals regarding public health emergencies and other issues, including formulating (such as plan completion rate, emergency material reserve rate, simulation exercises) overall judgments on the purposes of evaluation institutions, including accountability and summative assessment. Second, health emergency management assessment is divided into several stages, including the preparation stage (i.e., pre-emergency evaluation), the disposal stage, the in-process evaluation, and the recovery stage (i.e., post-emergency evaluation). Thus, a preliminary discussion on the early warning index system for influenza outbreaks, the construction of an evaluation index system for hospital nurses' public health emergency response capacity, a weighted analysis of emergency public health emergency response evaluation factors, and the evaluation of emergency drill activities in county-level disease control institutions in Nanchang City are all examples of pre-assessment. In contrast, social vulnerability assessments and analyses of significant factors associated with major infectious diseases are concerned with the assessment of the nature, the type, the extent, and the determining factors of public health emergencies, while epidemiological characteristics studies and normative disposal third-party assessments are all considered post-event assessments that focus on recovery, summarizing, and long-term impact. Third, emergency management work assessment can be divided according to health status, i.e., normal and abnormal assessment. For example, the analysis and the evaluation of the present state of affairs of health emergency work in Qinghai Province was a normal assessment of the state of daily management construction, whereas the comprehensive evaluation of public health emergency implementation in the Fujian Province in 2014 was an assessment of the process and the impact of the emergency response. Fourth, assessment is divided according to the evaluation implementation body, i.e., internal and external evaluation. For example, the evaluation of the public health emergency response capacity of F hospital in Qiqihar City was an internal investigation conducted by an investigation team composed of health emergency management agencies and workers. On the other hand, investigating the epidemiological characteristics of public health emergencies and standard treatment third-party assessments are surveys that involve external evaluation from experts outside the health emergency management and work organization.",19.673104889508103,10.538230976025865

This can be explained as follows. If the detection time is variable and the latent and infectious periods are large, many infecteds will be detected before becoming infectious. If many infecteds are not infectious before being detected, the few that are should be very infectious (''superspreaders'') to attain a given R 0 pre (the average number of secondary infections before detection). Because many of the infectees of these superspreaders will be detected early (variable detection time), the superspreaders will be quarantined after backwards tracing, which adds to the effect of forwards tracing preventing infectees to reach their infectious period. Effectiveness may be very sensitive to the latent period, especially if there is little variation in the detection time. This is most apparent in the sharp transition in panel 2B, where tracing is only effective if all infectors are detected (at t = 12t lat ) before the infectious period (at t = t lat ), so t lat .0.5. The high sensitivity can be a problem for assessing the tracing effectiveness for a specific infection: the conclusion may largely depend on how correct the available estimates for the latent and incubation periods are, the incubation period determining the time to detection.

When the source epidemic is still growing and many travellers are recently exposed, our model suggests half or more of case detection for filoviruses will be driven by exposure risk screening; when the epidemic has stabilized, the shift in the age structure of infections means fever is likely to become the dominant mechanism of case detection (Figure 4 ).",28.99024357508855,14.104841424414841

Thus, despite a short, influenza-like median incubation time, screening outcomes for SARS-CoV are filovirus-like and less favorable. Second, epidemiological knowledge is required to implement risk factor screening. Our results show that for pathogens with long incubation periods, early characterization of exposure risk factors is a powerful screening tool at the beginning of an outbreak; for these pathogens, robust characterization of and screening for specific exposure risk factors can contribute more to case detection than rapid implementation of fever screening (Figures 3-4) . However, risk factor screening cannot improve screening effectiveness if factors that increase risk of exposure are not well characterized. For MERS-CoV, recent findings have strengthened the evidence that dromedary camels play a role in primary exposure of some cases, but it remains unclear whether the majority of transmission is driven by contact with infected humans or repeated zoonotic spillovers (Azhar et al., 2014; Cauchemez et al., 2014) .",23.43049179324768,13.770293547543304

For all six emerging pathogens considered here, the majority of identified cases exhibited a fever ( Figure 2A) . However, the proportion of confirmed cases who were aware of their exposure risk varied greatly. Influenza A/H1N1p, which can have generic symptoms and can be transmitted via the airborne route, had the lowest reported proportion; Ebola virus, which requires close contact with infected individuals who have conspicuous symptoms, had the highest. Influenza A/H7N9, Marburg virus and SARS-CoV had similar proportions of cases that present with fever, and that had knowledge of exposure risk. We excluded MERS-CoV from the natural history space in Figure 2A because there are no established risk factors for exposure. Moreover, there was limited information available for the fever parameter for MERS-CoV: in a hospital outbreak of MERS-CoV, 20 out of 23 cases presented with fever at onset (Assiri et al., 2013) ; the small size of this sample means there is greater uncertainty surrounding the estimate for proportion of cases that exhibit fever. The mean and variance of the incubation period have been recognized as key drivers of the effectiveness of fever screening at arrival, since shorter incubation periods mean a greater likelihood that travellers will progress to symptoms during travel (Pitman et al., 2005; Al-Tawfiq et al., 2014; Mabey et al., 2014) . There was considerable variability in incubation period among different pathogens ( Figure 2B ). Influenza A/H7N9 and A/H1N1p have the shortest incubation periods, while Ebola virus and Marburg virus have the longest. For some pathogens, the estimated variance in incubation period could increase with the addition of more data, which would improve characterization of the tails of the distribution. For instance, the incubation period distribution for Marburg virus was estimated from just five cases with a single exposure opportunity (Martini, 1973) ; observing more cases might give rise to a right-skewed distribution as seen for Ebola virus. Similarly, the incubation period distribution for MERS-CoV is determined using data from only 23 confirmed cases, and its variance might also expand with the addition of more data.

Among the studied viruses, the most frequently detected in both healthy as well as in enteric turkeys was AstV, accounting for 28.9% and 47.2%, respectively. Our previous studies on Polish turkey flocks also revealed the presence of turkey astroviruses, independently of detected types (TAstV-1, TAstV-2 or ANV), in both turkeys experiencing enteritis as well as in clinically healthy birds [13] . Previously applied statistical methods indicated a weak correlation between astrovirus incidence and the health status, with calculated coefficients between combined TAstV-1 and TAstV-2 presence or TAstV-2 presence and the health status equal to 0.14 and 0.1, respectively [13] . However, rank Spearman correlation used at that time seems to be not fully appropriate for qualitative variables. Thus in this study we have applied other methods, more useful for such kind of analysis. None of them indicated any correlation between AstVs prevalence and turkey health status. There are many reports of astrovirus presence in turkeys, with the prevalence varying from about 24 to 100% depending on the methods used for virus detection and the country; however, according to our knowledge, none of them specifically explored the impact of astroviruses on the health of turkeys. The surveys of commercial turkeys conducted in the USA revealed that 47.2 and 100% of the analyzed samples were astrovirus-positive [14] . The majority of detected astroviruses belonged to TAstV-2 and their level ranged from 69.6 to 71.8%. The occurrence of TAstV-1 and ANV was less frequent, accounting for 9.8-28.1% and 2.7 -12.5%, respectively, but all of these turkey astrovirus types were detected irrespectively of the turkey health status [14] . Brazilian studies also revealed a high prevalence of astroviruses in turkey flocks ranging from 44% to 81.6% [15, 16] . The share of individual astrovirus types was different than in the USA, but no clear influence on the health status was suggested. Cattoli et al. reported TAstV in Italian and Spanish turkey farms with enteritis [17] . On the other hand, Jindal et al. reported TAstV-2 in apparently healthy breeder turkey poults by RT-PCR; 47.2% of pooled fecal samples were positive [18] . Recently, TAstV-2, TAstV-1 and ANV were detected in 50%, 20% and 13.8% of market-age turkeys with lower weight but also in 33%, 20% and 12.5% of turkeys with standard breed character, respectively [3, 19] . Moreover, the same author found TAstV-2 in fecal swabs of both experimentally infected and PBS-inoculated turkeys [3] . In several reports the existence of two turkey astrovirus pathotypes were suspected: pathogenic and non-pathogenic [19, 20] . Presented results of applied statistical methods do not exclude the existence of such pathotypes, but it seems that the frequency of pathogenic astrovirus strains occurrence is rather low.",21.675243210353603,11.539297760571392

Therefore, it appears unlikely that differences in 1 year survival between the Köhnlein study [52] and others [58, 59] are due only to ""high inspiratory pressures"" or simply reductions in PaCO 2 [52] . As a matter of fact, the control group of the Köhnlein study suffered from a high mortality rate, which may indicate that severity of disease rather than the correction of hypercapnia or the beneficial effect of ""high inspiratory pressures"" primarily drives survival in patients treated with NPPV. Furthermore, claim that chronic hypercapnia is associated to worse survival is questionable -at least in those patients receiving long-term oxygen therapy [43] . Furthermore there is growing evidence that mortality in COPD is influenced by several other factors, such as exercise capacity, comorbidities and inflammatory status [60] .",21.204970473288558,9.719005898618372

To assess the normal distribution, categorized graphs of normality and the Shapiro-Wilk test were used. To compare the quantitative correlation between age, health status as well as the number of identified viruses in all groups of birds, the Kruskal-Wallis test was used. In turn, the Mann-Whitney test was used to correlate the age of infected and uninfected birds. The interactions between qualitative variables, i.e. the age (categorized in groups) or health condition of the tested flocks and the prevalence of the studied viruses, as well as correlations between the incidences of the investigated pathogens, were also examined. These variables were summarized in the contingency tables which were examined by the independence chi-square (χ 2 ) statistical test. The statistical methods which inform about the strength of the relationship between qualitative variables were then applied. Consequently, we calculated the Yule coefficients. However, these tests do not describe the nature of the relationships, and thus we applied the correspondence analysis (CA) to this end. The CA is the method of displaying the relationships between categorical variables as scatterplot diagrams; they are, however, not shown here, and only the conclusions from the obtained diagrams are discussed. We also implemented logistic regression (LR) model, which is also helpful in description of the strength and nature of the relationship between the variables.

Depending on the combination of age and risk group, a fraction of the clinically ill cases needs to be hospitalized, and an agedependent fraction of hospitalized cases may die from the disease ( Table 5 ). This partitioning of the cases into four categories allows combining the realistic description of the transmission dynamics with an easy calculation of the resources consumed during an outbreak. The degree and duration of contagiousness of a patient depend on the course of the disease; the latter furthermore depends on the age of the patient (Table 5) . Passing through the incubation and contagious period is modelled in several stages which allows for realistic distributions of the sojourn times ( Table 4 ). The last two stages of the incubation period are used as early infectious period during which the patient can already spread the disease. Infectiousness is highest after onset of symptoms and thereafter declines geometrically (Table 6 ). Clinically ill patients seek medical help on average one day after onset of symptoms. Very sick patients are advised to withdraw to their home until their disease is over, whereas extremely sick patients need to be hospitalized and may die from the disease (Table 4) .

The distribution is also useful in statistical approaches of epidemic curve reconstruction and short-term predictions of slowly progressing diseases; the backcalculation method uses the incubation period to estimate HIV prevalence and project the future incidence of AIDS [14, 15] . During the last decade, this method has also been extended to prion diseases such as Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) [16, 17] , vCJD [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] and Kuru [23] . Although backcalculation is not discussed in this paper, several rigorous reviews have been published with regard to diseases with a long incubation period [15, 17, 22, 28] .

Well-defined short periods of exposure are needed to decipher the incubation period distribution using appropriate statistical methods. Taking this point into account will be critically important in estimating the incubation period of newly emerging diseases in the future. (II) The epidemiologic usefulness of the lognormal assumption was highlighted with respect to the basic characteristics of lognormal distribution, but this assumption is likely to remain unwarrantable until details of disease mechanisms are fully clarified; thus, this assumption may be merely an approximation of the rightskewed distribution. For example, considering the mechanisms of disease development, the lognormal assumption does not hold for HIV/AIDS and prion diseases. However, this limitation of the lognormal assumption does not imply that such approximation of the incubation period distribution is meaningless. Rather, it suggests that when parametric models are assumed, it is at least necessary to compare the goodness-of-fit for several distributions in order to overcome some of the uncertainty. Various datasets on the same disease would also help assess the uncertainty. Further, it would be informative if the determinants could be clarified even by simple stratifications (e.g., with respect to sex, age and genetic factors). Ideally, assumptions in the future should be supported by a detailed understanding of the underlying disease mechanisms provided by observations of within-host dynamics. Since the incubation period of infectious diseases is directly relevant to prevention and control, and because such knowledge can enhance our theoretical understanding of the spread of disease, further clarifications of the above points are deemed necessary.

Additionally, the California condor experienced a severe population bottleneck prior to extirpation in the wild and the subsequent decline in genetic variability [33, 34] can be associated with decreased resistance to disease [35] [36] [37] . Viability of small populations are highly susceptible to epidemic mortality events, and a baseline understanding of pathogen exposure in the California condor population is critical to informing management and recovery efforts, especially as condors expand their range and encounter new risks [17] .",32.084865182219275,16.5746760918224

First, only a small percentage of outbreaks are likely reported in the literature. We used a broad database search criteria to minimize this limitation and identify all possible articles describing mass gathering-related respiratory disease outbreaks. Second, some outbreaks may not be identified as outbreaks. Active or passive surveillance likely influences the number of infectious respiratory disease outbreaks identified and reported. For example, active surveillance for variants of influenza viruses at fairs following the initial H3N2v outbreak in 2011 could have increased the number of outbreaks detected from this setting. In addition, while multiday residential-based mass gatherings can facilitate transmission, these settings may also help identify cases and an emerging outbreak through close monitoring of known participants. In non-residential settings, other non-disease related factors including crowd mood, age, weather, and alcohol and drug use could influence the use of illness-related medical services. These factors could further increase the variability of health event reporting [14] . Third, some respiratory diseases with longer incubation periods and many subclinical infections are unlikely to be identified during the mass gathering. Symptoms could appear once the participants have returned home and are then rarely linked or reported to the appropriate surveillance system [9, 49] .",21.683620697741922,12.588107290138627

The estimated median incubation period of HFMD was 5.7 (95% CI 4.6-7.0) for secondary school students aged about 12-18 years and appears to be longer, though the difference did not reach statistical significance with the small sample size in the study. The estimated incubation periods can be longer than 10 days for 8.8% and 23.2% of the kindergarten and secondary school students respectively, based on the fitted distribution. The estimated incubation period for primary school children (n = 9) had a relatively low variability when comparing to other groups, probably because the data were obtained from a single school and hence likely to be caused by a single causative pathogen. In contrast, the relatively high variability of the estimated incubation period in the secondary school students (n = 73) may be explained by higher heterogeneity in host immune responses due to more previous exposure to different pathogens. To our knowledge, this is the first study to estimate the incubation period distributions of HFMD for different age groups based on empirical data. While the infection times were usually unobservable, the relatively short period between illness onset and sick absence in the school setting has helped reducing the uncertainty in the exposure period. The estimated incubation period was not sensitive to uncertainty due to unobserved transmission chain in outbreaks which may involve multiple generations. Our finding may have implications on the intervention or management of outbreaks in school settings, such as defining evidence-based observation period of HFMD outbreaks and maintaining a longer period of enhanced personal hygiene practice and disinfection of the environment 11 .",21.70216884275444,12.578259350071932

The long incubation periods and the characteristic asymptomatic nature of acute HCV infections make identification of cases a rather challenging task [117] . HCV transmissions are difficult to link to their corresponding source of infection because intrahost viral populations are often genetically related but seldom identical [95, 119] . Importantly, branching in phylogenetic analyses, derived from genetic relatedness studies, do not always correspond to transmission events, particularly in those cases where not all individuals belonging to the transmission network are sampled ( Figure 5 ). Thus, local epidemic sequences can cluster together in the absence of direct transmission [119, 120] . HCV evolution is also affected by preexisting liver conditions, infection with other viruses and also pregnancy as a direct consequence of the alterations of the immune response in the mother [17] . During pregnancy, increased viral loads and a reduction in CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity are commonly observed, favoring the emergence of more fit strains [121] as a result of the impairment of the antiviral response in the mother. Therefore, children infected perinatally might potentially bear infections with the more fit viruses, thereby facilitating persistence [122] .",21.33059016645216,10.26888502362462

The incubation period and duration of infectiousness were estimated for rabies in domestic dogs from records of when individual dogs were bitten, developed clinical signs, and were killed or died. Gamma distributions were fitted to these data using maximum likelihood with interval censoring to account for cases where the relevant data were only approximately known ( Figure  2 and Table 1 ). To estimate the probability distribution of the generation interval, G(t), an incubation and an infectious period were drawn from their respective distributions, a ''time-to-bite'' deviate was drawn from a uniform distribution over the interval of the infectious period, and the two intervals were summed. There was a significant correlation between the length of the infectious and incubation periods, but significance was entirely due to a single data point; we therefore treated the distributions as independent. The spatial infection kernel K(d) was estimated by fitting a gamma distribution to the distances between known source cases and animals that they contacted. Many contacts occurred within the same, or neighbouring, homesteads. In these cases, the precise distance was not always recorded, but we assumed it was less than 100 m. We therefore replaced the probability of a contact within 100 m by the probability distribution averaged over the range 0-100 m.",21.151587537393638,9.946605199588323

This was illustrated by an experiment that showed an average six intermediate acquaintances separate any two people on the planet. Thus a highly infectious disease could theoretically spread to all 7 billion on the globe in about six incubation periods! Another improvement of this simulation is to incorporate the highly connected super-spreaders who are disproportionately relevant to rapid spread of the disease, called scale-free networks [41] . In this model, new members of the network connect preferentially to those who already have a large number of contacts (i.e. analogous to individuals befriending the most popular members of a network). The resulting number of contacts per individual takes a power-law distribution. The recent epidemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was such an example where a significant proportion of the infections were due to 'super-spreaders' [42] .

In the present study, the median FIV load at the time of enrolment from Group 2 was 67-fold higher than that from Group 1 (P < 0.0001) and there was a marked difference in health status and mortality rate between groups over the following 22 months. It is not possible to discern whether an increased viral load was a cause or a consequence of poor health status, since that would have required knowledge of viral load kinetics and changes in health status from the time of initial infection in the FIV-infected 'healthy' and 'not healthy' cats; in this prospective study the data were collected from the time of enrolment. However, statistically significant differences in FIV load between cats from Group 2 classified as 'healthy' and 'not healthy' and cats that remained alive or died during the study were not apparent. Observation of these parameters over longer periods of time, preferably with larger group sizes, would be required to fully validate their utility in predicting disease progression.",27.307718066329183,13.765897700969425

However, for the lyssaviruses, this interaction is poorly understood. Indeed, lyssaviruses and bats do not typically exhibit the classical symbiotic relationship expected of co-evolution, as the lyssavirus infection of bats is most commonly detected following the observation of clinical disease. This contrasts with other viral pathogens, for which bats are considered natural reservoirs, including filo-and henipa-viruses. Both the natural and experimental infection of bats with these other pathogens results in the shedding of the virus, often in the complete absence of clinical disease. Furthermore, evidence has shown that bats, and other mammals, are able to mount a sufficient immunological response following viral exposure, and successfully manage to clear the virus before the onset of clinical disease. For lyssaviruses, the repeated detection of healthy seropositive bats in different roost populations strongly suggests that exposure events can result in viral clearance, following the development of a localised and/or systemic immune response. Alongside this, recent studies have described serologically positivity in unvaccinated humans within Amazonian populations [141] . Again, this suggests that lyssavirus exposure can result in clearance, most likely where detected, through the development of a humoral response. What drives this human exposure to RABV, however, is less clear with hunting of bats, as well as the feeding of vampire bats on humans being plausible exposure opportunities. Certainly, the structure of Amazonian populations, and the overlap in bat and human habitations, may facilitate the exposure to a lyssavirus, whether it be via bite or non-bite transmission. Also, the mechanisms involved in clinical disease manifestation following natural infection remain ill-defined, so the outcome of lyssavirus infection/exposure in bats versus another mammal cannot yet be accurately compared. It may be so that bats exhibit much longer incubation periods than other mammals, facilitating in the maintenance of the virus in bat populations. However, the lack of knowledge surrounding, specifically, the innate signalling mechanisms in bats following exposure, prohibits any understanding surrounding their status as the lyssavirus reservoir host. Related to this is the observation of clinical disease in a U.K. Daubenton's bat nine months following captive care [142] . This, again, demonstrates that these viruses can exist within bat species for long periods of time, before the development of clinical disease.

As per previous frameworks, the PMF was developed along time and space dimensions. Along the temporal dimension, mobility pattern and migration status were categorized into three categories: local, mobile and migrant. The ""local"" population were defined as individuals residing in the area for more than 1 year and were included due to their circular mobility, usually into nearby forested areas for livelihood activities; the ""mobile"" population were defined as individuals residing in the area for <6 months; and migrants were defined as individuals residing in the area for more than 6 months and <1 year. Mobility was further broken down into ""circulation"" and ""migration"" movements. For ""circulation"", the following criteria are considered: daily circulation (no overnight); periodic circulation (overnight to 1 week); seasonal circulation (1 week to Hunting, logging, fishing 6 months). For ""migration"": irregular migration (people residing for more than 6 months but moving out of the area) and long-term migration (new settlement over 6 months of stay). For the spatial dimension, population movement was only considered in relation to movement into forested areas, as the type of movement related to malaria risk. The forested areas were further characterized into type of forest i.e. foothills or upland forest. For distance travelled, the following criteria were used: short: <10 kms; medium: 10-100 kms; long: >100 kms and for the place of origin either, rural villages or urban area). The MMP activity profiles component of the framework ( Table 2 ) was built upon an analysis of the range of activities conducted by individuals and groups working in and around forested areas. This includes agricultural activities, which can happen on a daily basis for local population and occur on short space range or can be seasonal and attract population from a longer space range, especially in plantation settings; construction activities, where a seasonal pattern can be observed (e.g. work halting in the wet season due to the difficulty in working or accessing remote area during the months of heavy rainfall); security activities including military forces which may travel over long distances from one area to another at various intervals of time depending on the political or military situation and the assignment of their unit; and hunting and fishing activities which can occur at almost all time periods and across all ranges of space. The latter includes local population going to the forest for hunting or fishing for their own livelihoods for short period of time, as well as people travelling hundreds of kilometres from other provinces to illegally hunt for rare animals or to collect precious woods, such as rosewood, for local or international markets.",20.792769047199247,9.444392880203818

Incubation periods for AIVs in poultry can be up to 2 days when birds are inoculated with doses less than or equal to 10 3 , and around 1 day when doses are higher [6] . Making the worst-case assumption that susceptible and infectious hosts are in constant contact, this means that the minimum time infectious individuals can create other infectious individuals is 1 day, and higher on average. Thus, if the average staytime of birds in rLBMs is ≤ 2 days, there is not time for exponential growth of prevalence due to direct transmission within rLBMs (e.g., ""outbreaks""). In addition, direct transmission alone may not cause significant amplification of prevalence within rLBMs because birds that entered the market uninfected have a high probability of being slaughtered before they begin shedding AIV. A similar principle has been identified in other animal-disease systems. For example, epizootics of plague in prairie dog populations have been shown not to occur by blocked-flea or pneumonic transmission alone, because both blocked vectors and hosts capable of direct transmission are removed from the population by death before they reliably create large chains of transmission required for outbreaks [7] .

HSV-1 infection establishes life-long latency with reactivation triggered by stimuli like UV light, tissue damage, or compromised immunity [2] . The severity of HSV-1 infection varies from mild symptoms, such as cold sores and watery blisters on the skin or mucous membranes, to life-threatening encephalitis in humans [3] . As a double-stranded DNA virus, HSV-1 has a linear genome of 152 kbp surrounded by a protein layer called a tegument and a bilayer envelope with viral glycoproteins [4] . During infection, the virus first binds the receptors present on host cell surfaces through glycoproteins of the viral envelope and then transitions from attachment to penetration, leading to the release of the viral capsid and tegument proteins into the cytoplasm. Later, viral capsids with tegument proteins use the microtubule network to transfer to the nuclear envelope, where they interact with nuclear pores and release their uncoated genomes into the nucleoplasm to perform viral transcription and replication.

The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum anti-JHM virus IgG concentrations present in rats prior to onset of clinical symptoms or during the acute and paralytic phases of disease were compared. High CSF/serum ratios, indicative of local antibody production in the CNS, were noted only where disease was demonstrable suggesting that local antibody production accompanied the infection but did not prevent the neurological disease. Among animals in which neurologic symptoms had not become manifest, only those with elevated CSF/serum ratios were found to have histological CNS lesions. Immunofluorescent microscopy indicated that viral antigens were present in both glia and neurons. Antigen-positive cells were frequently present in histologically normal CNS tissue, while regions of necrosis were antigen negative. Testing for the presence of viral RNA with JHM cDNA probes revealed that the virus was rapidly disseminated throughout the CNS, presumably establishing centers of infection prior to the development of recognizable tissue damage. Viral RNA was also detected in the CNS following recovery from paralysis and as late as 5 months postinfection, where no disease occurred. These findings indicate that, although infection by JHM virus can spread rapidly throughout the CNS, formation of lesions during chronic disease is a slower process. The current data and previous observations suggest that JHM virus can remain in a latent state for periods of at least several months in rats without apparent neurologic disease despite the absence of any known provirus phase in the replicative strategy of coronaviruses.",18.53607193349339,12.316428096110503

Imagine a time line beginning with a susceptible host within the population ( Fig. 1 ). At some time point ( T ) the susceptible individual becomes infected by a pathogen. For the time course of infectiousness, after initial infection, the host may undergo a latent period (τ) where the pathogen can be resident in the host but not be transmitted to other hosts. The latent period is followed by an infectious period (γ) where pathogen can be transmitted. At some final time, the infectious individual loses its infectiousness and moves into a noninfectious class either through recovery or death. The time course for disease differs from infectiousness in that upon the onset of infection ( T ) the host moves into an incubation period (δ) where disease symptoms are absent. When symptoms appear, the host moves into the symptomatic period (σ) that lasts until the symptoms disappear and the host recovers or dies. The initiation and duration of these periods may not correspond. For example, in some diseases the latent period can be shorter than the incubation period in which case hosts are infectious before symptoms appear, e.g., ungulates infected with rinderpest virus become infectious approximately 24-48 h before the onset of symptoms (Plowright 1968 ). In other diseases, the latent period can be longer than the incubation period. For example, Plasmodium falciparum malaria has an incubation period of approximately 14 days in humans. However, the infective stages of the parasite that are infective to mosquitoes only begin to appear approximately 10 days after the onset of symptoms (Halloran 1998) .",20.488667511572487,11.795582171549912

As livestock are also a major source of infectious and long-lived oocysts that can infect other animals, wildlife, and people [22] , measures to reduce oocyst shedding and methods of storing and treating farm manure [10] to prevent oocyst contamination of the wider environment are important mitigation strategies.",19.39155610252032,9.763422993292542

The types of interactions necessary for transmission of measles (transmitted via the airborne route) are vastly different from those necessary to transmit genital herpes. In addition, there are complex patterns that dictate how people within populations interact with each other. For example, while typical school-aged children spend the majority of their time mixing with other children of their same age, the parent of that child likely mixes with a much broader age range of individuals in the same community because of activities related to work, hobbies, etc. Despite the obvious complex pattern of mixing among individuals, basic transmission dynamics models assume that individuals within a population mix homogeneously. 7 That is, the probability of a given individual coming into sufficient contact to transmit infection is equal in every other individual in that population, regardless of age, gender or social status.",19.314324109332553,8.867047883075353

Sartwell is perhaps best known for his seminal 1950 paper entitled, ""The distribution of incuba-tion periods of infectious disease,"" published in the American Journal of Hygiene (10) . He demonstrated that the incubation periods of many infectious diseases show a consistent pattern, using 3 types of observations: known single simultaneousexposure epidemics; known but not simultaneous-exposure epidemics; and unknown outbreaks in which the epidemiologic curve might suggest simultaneous exposure. He originated the use of logarithmic plots of the incubation period and defined the ""estimated median,"" and he showed that the frequency curve of incubation times took the form of a lognormal curve (11) . These observations underlie contemporary knowledge of epidemic theory. We now understand that epidemic curves and incubation periods are quite systematic, whether for infectious diseases or chronic diseases. Sartwell's insights demonstrated a continuing fascination with disease dynamics that have their origins in Frost's and Maxcy's work some 30 years before, and which remain in vogue in contemporary infectious disease modeling efforts. Expanding Sartwell's work on the incubation period, with his student Haroutune Armenian, Lilienfeld showed (12) that the distribution of nontransmissible diseases after common exposures to environmental risk factors also followed a lognormal distribution, with examples including exposure to the atomic bomb and bladder cancer, exposure to dye and the risk of leukemia, etc. After he resigned from the chairmanship due to health problems, he remained actively engaged in research, teaching, and academic administration, serving as Acting Chair of the Department of Behavioral Sciences from 1983 until his death in 1984.",29.376410334351277,12.215354467595533

Because this disorder is most prevalent in aged dogs, it is often termed geriatric canine peripheral vestibular disease. The cause of the disorder is unknown. Microscopic study of euthanized patients are uncommon because most dogs will spontaneously recover, the procedure is not routine in most necropsy laboratories, and the process of decalcification that is required makes recognition of subtle abnormalities difficult. The rapid recovery suggests that this disease may be a functional disorder, possibly an alteration in the production and absorption of endolymph that causes increased pressure within the membranous labyrinth. This theory has been proposed for the pathogenesis of Meniere disease in humans, which is an episodic disorder of the inner-ear components. Vestibular neuronitis is described in humans with an acute onset of clinical signs of a peripheral vestibular system dysfunction. Spontaneous recovery occurs. A herpesvirus-induced vestibular ganglionitis and an autoimmune inner-ear inflammation have also been proposed in humans. Paroxysmal positional vertigo (dizziness) in humans has been related to one or more statoconia that detach from the statoconiorum membrane and lodge in one of the semicircular ducts. Recovery is associated with specific head position adjustments to dislodge the statoconia. Many of the acute peripheral vestibular diseases of humans are not well understood. 11, 17 The idiopathic canine disorder is rarely observed before 5 years of age. The clinical signs are usually peracute in onset and rapidly improve to near complete resolution by 1 to 3 weeks from the onset. Residual clinical signs are uncommon.

Although the description pertains to humans, the models can be suitably extended to other living beings as well. We state the problem in an abstract manner and do not concentrate on any specific disease, however we restrict our study to two-phase contagious diseases. These diseases are such that when a person contracts the disease, he or she does not show any symptoms in the initial phase but can spread the disease. This initial phase is called the latent stage. In the latter phase of the disease, symptoms may appear and the individual may need to be treated, typically using expensive treatments. The latter phase is usually referred to as the symptomatic stage. If an individual is healthy, shots (usually vaccines) can be administered so that he or she does not contract the contagious disease at least for a period of time. If an individual is in the initial phase of the disease, he or she can be treated inexpensively (as opposed to when the symptoms appear) and can be cautious about not spreading the disease. Notice that individuals that are healthy cannot be distinguished from those that are in the initial stages of the disease, unless tested. The spread of such contagious diseases can be contained by testing individuals, giving shots to healthy individuals and treatment to individuals known to have the disease. The objective of this paper is to devise an algorithm to optimally allocate financial resources for testing, vaccination, and treatment by evaluating their trade-offs across a finite planning horizon.",23.371221821614476,11.471644493329457

The following paragraphs briefly review the association data between FOXO3A and human longevity from different populations. Willcox et al. (2008) first identified that the FOXO3A gene was strongly associated with longevity in long-lived American men of Japanese ancestry from the island of Oahu (Hawaii). When comparing the characteristics of 213 long-lived Japanese men (minimum age 95 years) with 402 average-lived subjects enrolled in this study, the case (long-lived) men exhibited several phenotypes, e.g., lower prevalence of cancer and cardiovascular disease, better self-reported health, and high physical and cognitive function, in additional to significantly older ages than controls. The authors selected five candidate genes from the IIS pathway for SNP analysis, including ADIPOQ, FOXO1A, FOXO3A, SIRT1, and COQ7. Only genetic variation within the FOXO3A gene was found to have a significant association with human longevity. The natural genetic variation within the FOXO3A gene (rs2802292; variable name: FOXO3A3) showed that the long-lived Japanese had one or more copies of the ""G"" allele of the FOXO3A gene. In contrast to the ""G"" allele in long-lived people, a higher ""T"" allele frequency of the FOXO3A gene was found in average-lived (about 77 years of age) Japanese men. The overall risk (OR) for TT homozygous minor genotype versus GG homozygous major genotype between the cases and controls was 2.75 (p = 0.0007) (Willcox et al., 2008) . In addition, the authors tested the relationship between lifetime prevalence of several chronic diseases and FOXO3A genotype among 3741 men aged 71-93 years. The authors found that the GG homozygous carriers were healthier at baseline than GT heterozygous and TT homozygous carriers when comparing the health status of subjects with the definition of high physical function (can walk one half mile), high cognitive function (cognitive abilities screening instrument [CASI] score >74), and the absence of six major chronic diseases including coronary heart disease, stroke, cancer, pulmonary disease (PD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and treated type 2 diabetes (Carter et al., 2007) . These data suggested that the age-related processes were significantly lower in these long-lived men and were associated with the presence of the ""G"" allele (Willcox et al., 2008) . , Flachsbart et al. (2009 further replicated the same association of FOXO3A SNPs with longevity using an extensive collection of 1762 German subjects, including 1031 unrelated centenarians/nonagenarians (age range 95-110 years; mean age 98.4 years) and 731 younger controls (age range 60-75 years, mean age 67.2 years). They performed genotyping on 16 known polymorphisms of the FOXO3A gene and identified four SNPs (rs6911407, rs9400239, rs3800231, and rs479744) showing a nominal association with the entire long-lived German individual sample, and 11 SNPs (rs6911407, rs768023, rs2802288, rs2802290, rs13220810, rs7762395, rs9400239, rs3800231, rs1268170, rs473268, and rs479744) having a significant association with attaining exceptional old age of the 388 centenarians (mean age 101.6 years) (Flachsbart et al., 2009 ). In particular, obtained from an allelebased case-control comparison, the top-ranking SNP, rs3800231, of FOXO3A had a highly significant (p < 0.0005) OR of 1.42 (CI: 1.18-1.70). They reported that the genetic association of longevity with FOXO3A was stronger in centenarians than in nonagenarians and affected both genders. These data confirmed the association between genetic variation in the FOXO3A gene and human longevity. However, the three top-ranking SNPs (rs3800231, rs7762395, and rs768023) did not present a statistically robust replication result, and only showed a trend for the association with longevity in the French sample consisting of 535 centenarians (mean age 103.8 years) (Flachsbart et al., 2009) . Li et al. (2009a) examined six tagging SNPs from FOXO3A and FOXO1A in 1817 centenarians and younger individuals in Han Chinese. Three (rs2253310, rs2802292, and rs4946936) of the six selected SNPs were found to have strong associations with longevity in sex-combined centenarians with an average age of 102 years in this Han Chinese population. In addition, the GTC haplotype of the three SNPs of FOXO3A presented with a lower frequency in centenarians than in controls (age around 47 years), which further demonstrated the FOXO3A haplotype association with longevity (Li et al., 2009a) . These data suggested that FOXO1A was more closely associated with female longevity.",19.495010486951315,9.92900364706794

Moreover, according to the research of Lessler et al., the latent period is essential to the investigation and control of infectious disease [14] . In this period, the infectious individuals have obtained the ability to spread diseases, yet without obvious symptom to arise attention, e.g., the latent period of influenza remains only one to three days, yet the epidemic can sweep through a city in less than six weeks. Furthermore, according to the health experts Sartwell's research, the period of latent period varies between individuals in the same regular fashion as do other biological characteristics [15] .

Depending on herd size, 41% to 66% of US dairy operations introduce cattle to their operations each year, with little use of isolation or quarantine before introduction and little testing for exposure to certain pathogens before introduction. Isolation of incoming cattle before introduction to the herd is not an effective control measure for diseases of long incubation like Johne's disease, but it can be effective for diseases with shorter incubation periods, including salmonellosis.

As the coronavirus outbreak hinders tourism consumption and health status, welfare also declines, as presented in Fig. 4 . One possible policy to facilitate post-crisis tourism recovery is to subsidize tourism consumption. Such practices, like providing tourism consumption vouchers for residents, have been proved useful in China after the global financial crisis (Yan & Zhang, 2012) . From a general equilibrium perspective, tourism sector subsidies must be financed by resources redistributed from other sectors; therefore, higher tourism sector consumption would have a crowd-out effect. Our simulation result in Fig. 5 compares the baseline case to those involving a sectoral policy and comprehensive policy. A sectoral policy refers to one in which the tourism sector is subsidized two periods (quarters) after the outbreak, whereas a comprehensive policy includes simultaneous subsidies to the health sector as well. As indicated, the sectoral policy overcomes the tourism sector decline; however, such mitigation comes at the cost of a deeper recession in the generic sector. The rebuilding of health status is also weaker because resources are extracted from the health sector. Overall welfare declines accordingly. By contrast, the comprehensive policy improves tourism consumption and health rebuilding, albeit at the cost of regular consumption.

As health disaster risk increases, we see a gradual deterioration in health status. As health status influences labor productivity, a declining health status leads to lower tourism and generic outputs. Apart from the supply side, tourism demand (C r ) also declines given its relationship with health risk, whether spontaneously or due to government-instituted bans on human mobility. To rebuild health, households begin to increase their health spending and leisure time while reducing their working time in the tourism and other sectors. More resources spent in the health sector cause health status to improve over time and eventually revert to the pre-shock level. These trends represent a typical path during the outbreak of a social-wide pestilence (World Health Organization, 2018). Fig. 1 also indicates how the economy evolves under different conditions relative to the persistence of health disaster risk. This figure plots the IRFs to a shock in ω t under three persistence scenarios: ρ = 0.6 (baseline), ρ = 0.4 (optimistic), and ρ = 0.8 (pessimistic). Higher persistence means that the increase in health disaster risk endures, as the time path of ω t conveys. Fig. 1 also reveals that a longer and greater risk of health disasters pushes the tourism sector and the overall economy into an abyss. The peak points of decline in tourism sector output and labor are thus much lower, and the downturn lasts much longer, as risk persistence increases. More resources are hence needed to pull the economy out of trouble due to prolonged risk of a health disaster. Fig. 2 displays how the size of a disaster matters when the risk persistence is flat. This figure presents the IRFs to a shock in ω t with different disaster sizes: Δ = 10% (baseline), Δ = 5% (optimistic), and Δ = 15% (pessimistic). A larger disaster size corresponds to a larger share of post-outbreak health deterioration potentially. As indicated in Fig. 2 , all variables, including tourism sector output and labor, decline more as the disaster size increases. The persistence of this effect also changes, as it peaks at impact or at later points after the outbreak.

Thus the only way to control the spread of these diseases is to prevent exposure and further transmission. Isolation and quarantine are two control measures that help block transmission by isolating the individuals who have, or may have, the contagious disease. ""Isolation"" describes separating sick individuals (symptomatic) from people who are not sick (naïve) while quarantine pertains to the practice of separating and restricting the movement of asymptomatic individuals who may have been exposed to the disease to see whether they become sick. These control measures aim to progressively reduce the number of new secondary infections until the disease is eradicated from the population. Formally, we can measure the effect of isolation and quarantine by taking a survey of new infected cases and deriving the basic reproduction number R of the infectious disease for each step of the outbreak. Without any intervention, R is expected to eventually decrease as the number of susceptible individuals decreases in a finite population without migration. However, by the time the rate decreases to R < 1, a large proportion of the population has already been infected with the disease. By ""removing"" potentially infected individuals from the population, isolation and quarantine can more rapidly decrease R below 1 by reducing the incidence of the disease, leading to fewer new infected cases capable of transmitting the infection.",21.729196154357734,10.287338744748244

We assume that individuals have access to global information about the disease spreading [53] and, to this aim, we contemplate two modeling strategies for risk perception: the former is informed by the epidemic prevalence, that is the number of infected individuals in the population; and the latter is informed by the growth of the epidemic. When no risk is perceived, all the susceptible individuals have the same activity parameter N Á S . When the epidemic starts to spread, the activity parameter of susceptible individuals is modulated in time as a function of their perceived risk of infection. We denote such a time-varying activity parameter with Á t S . To simplify the analysis, we assume that individuals act egoistically, by not reducing their activity when infected, only seeking to minimize their chance to contract the infection. As a consequence, the activity parameter for infected individuals is held fixed at the same value of the disease-free parameter of susceptible individuals, that is Á I D N Á S .

In contrast, measures to control short-range diseases such as limiting person-to-person contact and imposing quarantine procedures do little to help alleviate the spread of water-borne or vector-borne illnesses.

The EIP is the time period it takes for a vector to become capable of transmitting the disease following infection. Similarly, the IIP is the time needed by a host to become infectious and capable of transmitting the infection. This results in a time delay being introduced into the dynamics of the infection process as neither vectors nor hosts become infectious (i.e. capable of transmitting the infection) instantaneously upon infection, but some time has to pass before a host can infect a vector and vice versa. For the case of the host IIP, in which the individual is infected but not yet able to infect a biting vector, we say the individual host is exposed and is in the epidemiological class E.

The unusual findings which have emerged match the peculiarity of the agent itself. Since scrapie is a classic example of a slow virus, and since the incubation period may exceed an animal's life span, determination of which animals are truly resistant is sometimes difficult. For example, there were striking differences in the incubation periods in individual animals within groups of sheep following both subcutaneous and intracerebral inoculation (Dickinson and Miekle, 1971) . These seemed to fall into short (197 f 7 days) and long (917 2 90 days) classes. Evidence for a single dominant gene for susceptibility was obtained by studying the progeny of sheep with known short incubation periods which were mated with sheep lacking the expressed factor for short incubation. Stocks of sheep selected for susceptibility and resistance now have a difference of 90% incidence following subcutaneous inoculation. Among the animals apparently homozygous for the recessive resistant allele, there were some which developed scrapie after a very long interval; this has left the problem of the genetics of long-incubation scrapie in sheep unsettled.",31.27614289419669,15.717546900748076

INTRODUCTION AND STUDIES IN MICE,"The most striking finding in the continuing genetic analysis of incubation periods in mice came later. Results almost opposite those above were obtained when another strain of scrapie, 22A, which had been passed in the ""long-incubation"" mice before it was used, was employed in a genetic test of the effect of the short-incubation (""sinc"") gene. I n this new system the ""short-incubation"" mice (C57BL) had a longer incubation period, and the long-incubation mice (VM) had a short incubation period. Furthermore, the F1 hybrid showed the phenomenon of overdominance; that is, the incubation period of these F1 mice was longer than in either of their parents. Segregation ratios in the F2 and F3 generations followed the expected pattern for one gene. These workers argue that the sinc gene is responsible for these reversed effects. Three reasons are given. First, detailed comparison of the expected and observed ratios of short to long incubation periods in different crosses following a test of the F2 generation with the first agent (ME7) and a test of the F3 generation with the second agent (22A) showed close agreement with the hypothesis that one gene or closely linked genes were responsible. In other words, there was no segregation of the two agents into two factors between the F2 and F3 generations. Second, the response of several other strains of mice to one agent can be predicted on the basis of the response of the other. Finally, as new agents were found, they fell into the same pattern of behavior.",30.101573375122985,13.90818643921617

However, for individuals who choose to travel to rabies endemic areas the risk is increased and in recent years there have been several tragic cases of individuals being exposed to rabies virus abroad. Where PEP was not administered, human deaths have occurred upon return to the UK. Incubation periods following exposure are variable and whilst often clinical disease ensues soon after infection, in some instances the incubation period can be considerably longer. The recent case of a 37-year-old woman from Northern Ireland dying from rabies virus infection following an incubation period of what may be up to 2 years illustrates this point. In this instance, the individual in question did not seek medical attention following an incident with aggressive dogs in South Africa (Hunter et al., 2010) . Human rabies cases in the UK where exposure occurred abroad over the last 10 years are detailed in Table 2 . A similar situation exists across Europe. The recent death of a Dutch traveler from infection with Duvenhage virus, a virus closely related to rabies virus, further illustrates the potential danger of these viruses to travelers.

This observation has important implications for the identification of new viral infections or epidemics. Virus may be detected and isolated for infections with short incubations; however, antibodies may not yet have developed, see Figure  4 .2.

Geli, L. Hö gberg, H. Ringberg, E. Melander, M. Lipsitch, K. Ekdahl (Solna, Malmö, Lund, Stockholm, SE; Boston, US) Background and objectives: Knowledge of how the duration of pneumococcal carriage varies with age and serogroup is essential to understanding how immunity to carriage arises throughout the course of life, and designing appropriate models for the effects of vaccination or other public health initiatives aiming to reduce the pneumococcal transmission in the community. Using data from an ongoing Swedish intervention project, the duration of nasopharyngeal carriage of penicillinresistant pneumococci (MIC PcG >0.5 mg/L) stratified by both serogroup and age of the carrier were estimated. Methods: The mean duration and corresponding 95% confidence interval was estimated by fitting a gamma distribution to the observed duration of carriage for each serogroup and age stratum. Results: The mean duration of carriage for all cases was 37 days (95% CI 35-38). Children below the age of 5 years carried PRP for significantly longer periods (43 days, 95% CI 41-45) compared with older individuals (25 days, 95% CI 24-27). There were also differences within the group of cases below the age of 5 years, as the duration of carriage became significantly shorter for each year older the cases were. Serogroup 9 and 14 were carried for significantly shorter periods compared with serogroup 6. Serogroup 9 also had significantly shorter carriage duration compared with serogroups 19 and 23 for cases 0-4 years. For cases 5 years or older, no significant difference in carriage duration for different ages or serogroups could be noted. Conclusions: Even though the estimate does not cover any correction for the censored carriage duration and therefore not yield an estimate of the total length of carriage, the results highlight the importance to take both serogroup and age of the P1823 Exploring the molecular basis for differences in phenotype of Salmonella enteritidis typing phage N.

These microorganisms include known pathogens as well as hitherto unknown existing microorganisms capable of infecting humans or capable of evolving into human-infective forms under favourable circumstances. For the purpose of this chapter, emerging diseases are defined as a previously undefined (unknown) condition, which may result from the evolution or change in an existing infectious agent causing a change of strain, host range, vector or increase in virulence, or may be the occurrence of any other previously undefined condition (Hoinville et al. 2011) . Given the alarming number and serious consequences of human pathogen emergence from animal reservoirs over the past decades (bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE; Nipah virus; severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS; highly pathogenic avian influenza, HPAI H5N1; and influenza A H1N1), the rationale behind the concept of One Health, namely promotion of a more harmonised and integrated approach to investigate, plan for, and react to mitigate zoonotic disease risks, is appealing. During the last five years there has been a growing momentum, particularly from the international community, requesting that health research, systems and services implement a One Health approach. The reaction from people working in the health professions has been polarised, the majority of those working in the human health sector have not engaged with One Health, 1 whereas the majority of professionals working in animal and environmental health are interested in the approach, and some recognise its value. One Health advocates assume, a priori, that a more holistic management of microbial health hazards would result in a more efficient use of the scarce resources available for mitigation of disease risk. This paper aims to contribute to the One Health debate by using an economics assessment framework, in order to find ways of moving forward the agenda and engagement. In this exploration, we will limit ourselves largely to the mitigation 2 of zoonotic disease risks, recognising that a similar approach should be extended to noncommunicable diseases of humans and to production diseases in animals.",18.94808417706339,6.7679165636701075

This is likely attributable to an improvement in symptoms with time of recovery. In studies among survivors of ARDS, it is known that nearly all of the patients are symptomatic at hospital discharge, but there is significant improvement over the first year after ARDS in most patients. 11 In addition, survivors of ARDS are also much less symptomatic than other patients with chronic lung disease. 11 Nonetheless, the mean activity score of our patients measuring disturbances to their daily physical activity and their mean impacts score covering a wide range of disturbances of psychosocial function remain significantly worse compared with those in healthy subjects. Physical morbidity in SARS survivors may also stem from extrapulmonary causes. In an earlier study 9 evaluating pulmonary function and exercise capacity among patients from the same cohort, we found no evidence of exercise limitation solely because of ventilatory constraints, and there were very few patients with significant oxygen desaturation during exercise. Hence, the disability represented by an increased (ie, worse) score on the SGRQ activity domain in the present study is not likely to be specific to intrinsic pulmonary dysfunction, especially given that pulmonary dysfunction in our patients is modest, but may instead reflect any cause of impaired physical functioning, such as muscle loss/weakness or neuromus- There are several limitations of this study that we would like to acknowledge. First, the heterogeneity of acute lung disease encompassed by the case definition of SARS may account for the observed variation in pulmonary and extrapulmonary sequelae among our patients. Second, the proportion of patients who declined evaluation may have led to a bias toward the selection of sicker patients with abnormal pulmonary function. This is likely, because most of the patients who declined participation in the study offered a lack of symptoms and inconvenience as the main reasons for doing so. Third, evaluations of arterial blood gas levels and exercise testing were not performed in this study. However, we did not anticipate that there was significant hypoxemia in these patients, because none of them was found to have hypoxemia or was assessed as requiring oxygen supplementation during routine follow-up. Cardiopulmonary responses to exercise in SARS survivors had been evaluated in an earlier study 9 at 3 months after hospital discharge, but we do not have any longer term data on this. Fourth, only a respiratory-specific measure of health status was used in this study. A generic health status measure, such as the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item short-form health survey, would have provided a more global assessment of the patients, especially with regard to their role limitations as a result of emotional problems, mental health, bodily pain, and general health perceptions. The interaction of the data obtained from generic and disease-specific measures of health status may also have helped to determine the contributions of pulmonary and nonpulmonary factors to the longterm health status of SARS survivors.",21.894516232982568,11.325033189039779

In infectious disease dynamics, there is a broad range of relevant quantitative tools, and we refer to the entire collection. It comprises statistical methods for inference directly from data, including methods to analyze sequencing and other genetic data. This leads to estimates of important epidemiological information such as length of latency, incubation and infectious periods and their statistical distributions, inferred transmission chains and trees early in outbreaks, the risks related to various transmission routes, or estimates of rates of evolution. Mathematical models in the strict sense refer to mathematical descriptions of processes thought to be associated with the dynamics of infection-for example, in a population or within an individual. Such models take many forms, depending on the level of biological knowledge of processes involved and data available, and depending on the purpose. Several classes of model are used, spanning the spectrum of information available. At one end of the range are detailed individual-based simulation models, where large numbers of distinct individual entities (with their own characteristic traits such as age, spatial location, sex, immune status, risk profile, or behavior pattern) are described in interaction with each other, possibly in a contact network, and with the infectious agent. At the other end are compartmental models where no individuals are recognized, but only states for individuals (for example: susceptible, infectious, immune) aggregated into compartments where everyone has the same average characteristics and where interaction is typically uniform (everybody interacts with everybody else). Such models do not describe the disease history of single individuals, but rather the time evolution of aggregated variables, such as the number of individuals that are currently susceptible.",22.32349914032187,11.241814829918624

Likewise, the timing of the onset of symptoms, and any predispositions to infection should be noted [32] [33] [34] . Incubation period will aid the physician in the differential diagnoses (Table 2) [31, 33] . The age of the traveler is also relevant for Others 0.8 differential diagnosis, as younger travelers are more likely to have an exotic infection, whereas older travelers are more likely to have severe infection due to underlying disease including pneumonia [18, 19] . Besides, migrants' overall health status, availability and access to health-care systems, overall socio-economic conditions, consumption of contaminated water and food, contact with animals and occurrence of insect bites, and any disease epidemics determine their infectious etiology [35] . On the other hand, migrants are considered at increased risk for HIV and hepatitis, possibly due to sexual violence and improper medical instrumentation [35, 36] .",21.57250892085861,11.859768011540778

If a particular risk affects all individuals regardless of their age so that their hazard rate is ageindependent, VSL is rather constant for people at different age; if hazard rate varies with age, VSL estimates are sensitive to age.

The causal pathway of income and health linkage suggests that health is strongly associated with level of household income, with lower income relating to worse health status (Case et al., 2002) . On the other hand, there is evidence that health status is improved in higher income groups (Costello et al., 2003) . Income certainly allows individuals to pay for necessary goods and services, allowing them to maintain their health status, and provides a psychological sense of control and mastery over their environment. Thus higher income is also related with healthier behaviour (Case and Paxson, 2002) . Occupational status is the standard component of SES, which includes different levels of prestige, authority, power and resources. Illness is a crucial cause of downward occupational mobility. This means an association between occupational status and health can partly reflect reverse causation (Hernandez and Blazer, 2006) .

Nature's gift that keeps on giving, these viruses continue to emerge, in more species, more places, and now perhaps in North American bats, which could become involved in future emergence in humans or other animals (8) .",16.657819356593897,7.572988045340471

The latter mechanism is intended to model situations in which subjects avoid contacting all of their neighbors and therefore their contagion capabilities are reduced. The former, on the contrary, accounts for a common attitude of sick subjects, who quite often refrain from taking a treatment from the very initial stages of the disease, thus delaying their recovery. Through a mean-field analysis and numerical simulations, we have shown that the delayed recovery reduces the epidemic threshold whereas the nonuniform spreading has the opposite effect. It is worth stressing that in our model, the delayed recovery is introduced as an independent parameter, and not through smaller values of γ , as the latter is a parameter that characterizes the disease and we are accounting for a behavioral reaction, i.e., that of postponing the treatment. When both ingredients are simultaneously present, whether or not the new effective epidemic threshold is reduced with respect to the standard case depends on their interplay: if contacts between spreaders and susceptible individuals are significantly reduced as could be the case in a real epidemic, then the disease-free region will be larger. Otherwise, the longer permanence of infected subjects as such will not be compensated by their reduced contagion capabilities. Altogether, our results point out that in order for different countermeasures to be effective, which usually include isolation of sick individuals and therefore cutting down the number of potential susceptible-infectious contacts, other aspects such as the presence of ''free-riders'' that delay their recovery should also be taken into account.",16.53180273216374,7.384569982136215

Outbreaks of viral diseases in humans, originating in or spreading through farm animals (avian flu-H5N1 and swine flu-H1N1) have caused major global alerts in the last decade. These influenza outbreaks spread very quickly, either in the animal population (H5N1) or directly in the human population (H1N1), and formed a global threat for human health. H1N1 was therefore characterized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a pandemic. Although in total the human disease burden related to the endemic bacterial zoonoses is probably many fold higher than these influenza outbreaks, it is basically these relatively few but fast spreading outbreaks that have put One Health on the global agenda. In addition, the failure to predict, monitor and control the spread of these diseases in animals presented regulators and politicians with a wake-up call, and made them demand (better) cross-sectoral collaboration between the animal and human health sectors. Prions, non-living infectious agents, have been a significant burden of disease in animal and man. The most well-known zoonotic prion disease is probably the one causing Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) in cows, and new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, as represented by the massive outbreak of 'Mad Cow Disease' in the UK in the 1980s and 1990s. This agent, a mutant protein, which mainly sits in the brain, got into the (beef) food chain by the feeding of ruminant derived meat and bone meal to ruminants. Prions (Prusiner 1997) , Scrapie (the disease in goats), spongiform encephalopathy of Rocky Mountain elk, transmissible mink encephalopathy, kuru and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease were known before the large outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the UK. It, however, took some time and great efforts, and an early One Health approach, to establish the links between the different animal diseases and the human disease (Hill et al. 1997; Prusiner 1998; Ghani et al. 1998 ). This insight created a background to efficiently stop the spread of this prion disease, by banning the use of animals in animal feed, and seeing a subsequent decrease of the disease in humans (Hoinville 1994) .",18.614415790788485,9.532375255379332

In this context, it is important to consider characteristics of both host and parasite with regard to the outcome of their interactions. For example, one extreme is represented by severely immune-compromised patients that are more susceptible to a wider range of microbial infections compared with immunocompetent hosts [59] . When studying the outcome of human-microbe interactions, a complex interplay among viruses, bacteria and archaea, microbial eukaryotes, and animal parasites influence the health status of the human host, with mucosal microbiota playing a key role influencing health and disease status [60, 61] . Based on these considerations and examples, trichomonads may be more prevalent and have a wider pathological spectrum in humans than currently recognized, influencing human health through direct pathologies but also indirectly through dysbiosis of the mucosal microbiota and local inflammation, facilitating transmission of pathogens -a prime example being T. vaginalis infection and bacterial vaginosis contributing to HIV transmission [61, 62] . The potential influence of gut trichomonads to human health will also have to consider their potential impact on the gut microbiota, which might explain observations of the association between D. fragilis and IBS through inducing gut dysbiosis [35] . Indeed, the ability of trichomonads to live on a variety of mucosal tissues may be the key to their wide host range and ability to develop infections at different body sites, as well as contribute directly or indirectly to pathologies. Once the capacity to thrive on vertebrate mucosal surfaces has developed, there may be less of a barrier to cross both species and mucosal sites. For example, in the case of Review Trends in Parasitology July 2014, Vol. 30, No. 7 T. foetus, this sexually transmitted species may represent a recent transfer from the digestive to the urogenital tract, with a capacity of the parasite to thrive in the gut in different species (e.g., pigs, cats, and dogs).",19.221665599143307,8.19780723290496

Many available antiviral drugs do not provide cures for infections but merely alter the clinical course of disease. Therefore, the prevention of these infections is all the more crucial. The answer lies in the immunization and education of the public, especially those individuals at highest risk for each respective virus ( Table 1 ). The significant impact of immunization against viral agents, such as smallpox, cannot be overstated. Other viral vaccines have led to notable decreases in infections and complications. Since the introduction of poliovirus vaccine, the poliovirus has been eradicated from the Western Hemisphere and is estimated for global eradication by the year 2005. 1 The measles vaccine is another example. After years of widespread measles vaccination, a record low 37 measles cases were reported in the United States (U.S.) in 2002. 2 Available viral vaccines also serve to provide a basic framework of knowledge and experience with which other viral vaccines can be developed. New vaccines are needed and the progress with finding new vaccines cannot be rapid enough. The incidence of many viral infections is increasing despite available antiviral agents. With threats of bioterrorism and many viruses as potential agents, the development of viral vaccines will be extremely important in the protection of certain members of the population such as public health and healthcare response teams, laboratory workers working with viruses and military personnel. The risks of vaccination must also be considered with the administration of a vaccine. Safety concerns exist for some of the viral vaccines and these vaccines should be given with consideration to host factors such as age, health status (immunocompetent vs. immunocompromised or other illnesses), viral exposures, pregnant women, and allergies.

Isolation for at least 4 weeks, and longer if disease problems are suspected b. Thorough physical examination, including laboratory testing for FeLV, FIV, endoparasites, and ectoparasites. Other health screening such as hematology and clinical chemistry tests can be informative. Serologies should be repeated before termination of the quarantine c.

Perform physical examinations of kittens at this time. Perform annual formal physical examinations, and administer FVRCP booster vaccines to adults once every three years. Breeding queens should be immunized after delivering kittens or before rebreeding to avoid infection of kittens in utero with modified live virus vaccines. Only killed panleukopenia vaccines should be used, because they confer highly protective immunization and live products may result in cerebellar hypoplasia if inadvertently given to pregnant queens 4.

The health status of the animals sampled in our study was unknown but previous studies suggest that bats might not develop disease during coronavirus infections. RNA viruses seem to have little pathogenic effect on bat's life cycle (Li et al., 2005) which may explain that bats are excellent reservoirs for zoonotic viruses including CoVs (Omatsu et al., 2007; Brook and Dobson, 2015; Han et al., 2015) .

In this case, it is a study of how social factors (e.g., class, race, gender, religion, ethnicity, kinship network, marriage, educational status, age, place, and cultural practices) influence human health. The idea of social patterning indicates that these social factors could be the determinants of human health status (see Chap. 4). It is in this sense that some diseases may be referred to as diseases of poverty (e.g., malaria and TB) because they are much more prevalent in poor regions or among the poor. For example, a person residing in a slum is at a higher risk of being exposed to certain diseases which a person in affluent area may have lower risk of being exposed to. Medical sociology is distinct in its approach because it considers the ""import that social and structural factors have on the disease and illness processes as well as on the organisation and delivery of health care"" (Hafferty and Castellani 2006, p. 334 ). Hafferty and Castellani further observed that these factors also include culture (e.g., values, beliefs, normative expectations), organisational processes (e.g., hospital setting), politics (e.g., health care policy, health budget, political ideology), economic system (e.g., capitalism, the costs of health care), and microlevel processes such as socialisation and identity formation.",21.132964695410486,8.457072873136196

Although the PrP isolated from normal individuals (PrPc) and the PrP isolated from TSE-infected individuals (PrP-res) have the same amino acid sequence and secondary structure, PrPc is totally degraded by proteinase K, whereas PrP-res resists digestion. Once present, PrP-res is believed to induce additional copies of itself by interacting with normal PrPc. In doing this, PrP-res acts as an infectious agent [156] . Once the host-coded PrPc has been transformed to PrP-res, it accumulates in fibrils (scrapie-associated fibrils [SAFs]), and this eventually leads to disease [135] . Because the process is slow, however, all TSEs have prolonged incubation periods. More detailed information on TSE pathogenesis is reviewed elsewhere [157] [158] [159] .

This intervention, like quarantine, involves both transmission and contact reduction. Identifying the index patient results in a reduced infectious period. Subsequent identification and protection of his or her contacts through vaccination further limits the potential spread of the pathogen. Figure 5 considers the effect of ring vaccination on the population as a function of the effectiveness of patient isolation and the fraction of contacts that are successfully immunized. Partial protection of contacts may stem from inadequate contact tracing or an ineffective vaccine. For example, vaccinating 80% of close contacts with a 50% efficacious vaccine is equivalent to vaccinating 40% of close contacts with a 100% efficacious vaccine. Ring vaccination can be a successful strategy for a mildly contagious disease with even a moderate surveillance infrastructure or a partially efficacious vaccine. However, ring vaccination requires more successful case identification, contact tracing, and vaccination when implemented against a highly contagious disease. Ring vaccination is only applicable to diseases with relatively long incubation periods that allow contacts to be identified, vaccinated, and develop a protective immune response. Thus, this strategy is more appropriate for diseases like smallpox (incubation period 12 days) than SARS (incubation period 2-7 days).",29.162456570295728,14.29704974530129

The virus-bat interface is impacted by the extrinsic factors mentioned above, as well as viral and host factors (intrinsic factors). There are multiple intrinsic factors of the reservoir host such as age, body condition, reproductive status, sex and social status that are impacted by stress. For instance, stresses due to starvation and the breeding season for males may play an important role in the epidemiology of disease as stress caused by these factors may dampen the immune response making individuals more susceptible to infection [62] . In the case of EBOV, it is thought that starvation leads to fruit bats and primates coming into close proximity during their quest for food, facilitating spillover [63] . Transmission of viruses could also occur following changes in the hierarchy of the colony that lead to fighting for dominance, and during courtship and mating via grooming and biting [7] . Seasonal periods when juveniles have waning maternal antibody and are therefore susceptible to virus infection have been associated with increased transmission of Marburg virus to humans [64 ] and have been thought to have a role in increasing the incidence of transmission within bat colonies for HeV as well as Marburg virus [46, 62, 64] . Bats live on average 3.5 times longer than a mammal of similar size [65] , hence longevity in bats promotes persistence of viruses in the reservoir host, while the ability to fly allows long-distance dispersal of the infectious agent.

Successful efforts to alter the epidemiology of viral infections can be traced to the practice of variolation, the deliberate inoculation of infectious material from persons with smallpox (see chapter on the history of viral pathogenesis). Documented use of variolation dates to the fifteenth century in China. Edward Jenner greatly improved the practice of variolation in 1796 using the less-virulent cowpox virus, establishing the field of vaccinology. An early example of rigorous epidemiological study prior to the discovery of viruses was the work of the Danish physician Peter Panum who investigated an outbreak of measles on the Faroe Islands in 1846. Through careful documentation of clinical cases and contact histories, Panum provided evidence of the contagious nature of measles, accurate measurement of the incubation period, and demonstration of the long-term protective immunity conferred by measles. The discovery of viruses as ""filterable agents"" in the late-nineteenth and early twentieth centuries greatly enhanced the study of viral epidemiology, allowing the characterization of infected individuals, risk factors for infection and disease, and transmission pathways.",24.578080548269135,9.229636715549134

Periods of higher risk are relevant to EU incursion as they will affect factors such as the probability of EU tourists contacting an infected bat and thus impact on routes such as human travel to and from NiV and MARV areas. Indeed, seasonal pulses of MARV circulation in juvenile R. aegyptiacus bats coincide with periods of increased risk of human infection [74] . The influx of susceptible young is a crucial driver of infection dynamics and bat reproduction and survival are thought to be major drivers of bat disease dynamics [97] . Many bat species exhibit highly synchronised parturition which can dramatically alter population contact rates and susceptibilities. Sex differences in behaviour and distribution of bats during times of the year when the potential for disease transmission is greatest may also have important implications for disease dynamics [97, 98] . The role of bat torpor in infection dynamics is largely unstudied [97] . Torpor typically reduces pathogen replication rates and hence lengthens the incubation periods. A study found a clear indication for torpor being a key factor in allowing perpetuation of rabies virus through the hibernation period, through prolonged incubation period and reduced mortality [99] . This enabled the virus to persist in the population until susceptible individuals from the annual birth pulse could become infected and continue the cycle. Migration and coloniality may also be important drivers of disease dynamics [97] , altered migration behaviour may result in declining immunity within specific colonies which could lead to more explosive HeV epidemics [100] .",22.527916593358192,13.215969702652938

Terms that are less useful without detailed backup information include specific pathogen-fi'ee (SPF) , and conventional. In general use, SPF refers to animals that are 1) considered to be free of major pathogens and some or all opportunists, 2) maintained under housing and use conditions designed to protect this high-quality status by excluding infectious agents, and 3) monitored closely to assure that there is no undetected introduction of excluded agents. Conventional animals are usually considered to be those that originate from uncontrolled colonies that are not subjected to routine health monitoring, or those in which some degree of monitoring occurs but there is no action taken if infectious agents are found. However, these terms are not really descriptive or representative enough to use when assigning risk to animals proposed for introduction to monitored, disease-free animal facilities. For example, animals from an institution that experienced an outbreak of rat coronavirus and decided not to undertake the steps needed to eliminate the agent from the facility can still be considered to be ""'SPF"", since by definition this status is only defined by the particular list of agents of which the animals are specifically free. The term conventional also suffers from some ambiguity, since it can be used to refer to not only to animal health status but also to facility design. For example, a facility that allows direct staff entry into rat rooms without changing out of street clothes would be termed a conventional facility rather than a ""'barrier"" in the purest sense, but if micro-isolators and high efficiency particulate air (HEPA)-filtered changing hoods have been used to successfully institute pathogen exclusion at the cage level, the animals themselves might possess a high-quality health status that is far from ""conventional."" In practice, it may be more effective to evaluate a specific panel of agents that animals have been tested for than to assign quality descriptions.",21.682289400292003,9.90693203360577

Since these other positive cases imposed additional work load to medical officers, the Other Positive Alarm Rate (OPAR) was also of interest to the system designer. If a traveler who was sick with another illness with fever, and his or her trip was interrupted at a screening station (in airports in the United States, the traveler was sent to the CDC's quarantine station within the airport terminal), the subsequent medical response is required but it is beyond the scope of this research. The OPARs were computed by dividing the number of interrupted travelers who were sick with other illnesses with fever (outcome I SEF |¯), by the total number of travelers who were sick with other illnesses (health status S). The computations of OPARs were presented in Table 4 . As in FAR, in Strategy 0, OPAR = 0.00% because there was no screening. As Strategies 1, 2 and 3 were implemented, the number of interrupted travelers who were sick with other illnesses with fever (outcome I SEF |¯) increased. However, when P SE (¯) remained constant, the total number of travelers who were sick with other illnesses (health status S) stayed the same. The ratio of the two caused the OPAR to increase with Strategies 1, 2 and 3. It was observed that for the same screening strategy, when P SE (¯) was varied between 0.005 and 0.015, both the number of positive alarms as well as the number of travelers who were sick with other illnesses increased. Overall, with the same screening strategy, when the P SE (¯) was tripled from 0.005 to 0.015, the increase in OPAR was at most 0.12%. Comparing the magnitude of 0.12% with OPAR in the range of 14.56%-20.01%, it was concluded that, although the P SE (¯) estimate was not certain, the OPAR was insensitive to the change in P SE (¯) values. Brown et al. (2014) reported that, between August and October 2014, 80,000 travelers left the Ebola affected countries, of which 18,000 arrived in the United States. The exit screening at the airports of the disease affected countries in West Africa did not identify any traveler who was sick with Ebola (carrier or spreader, with health status SE). There was no entry screening at airports in the United States during that period. This screening scenario was similar to Strategy 1 but most likely without proper execution, and the results were similar to what was obtained with Strategy 0. In this situation, the correct detection rate was zero, even when the number of travelers with health status of SE between August and October 2014 was unlikely to be zero. There were two travelers with health status SE who entered the United States uninterrupted. In fact, their health status was SEF at the time of arrival, but they developed a fever not long after. The missed detection rate could not be estimated because the number of travelers with a health status of SE was not known. The discussion here highlights the difficulty in determining the effectiveness of a health screening strategy due to insufficient data or good estimates of the number of travelers in each of the health categories.",27.81514421148576,12.077056400629054

Because of aggressive immunization programs, rabies in domesticated dogs and cats in the United States is uncommon. The virus is found in the saliva and nervous tissue of infected animals. Transmission occurs by bites, licking, or simply contact of oral secretions with mucous membranes or nonintact skin. Many cases of rabies in humans now lack a history of some obvious contact with a rabid animal. This may be a result of the long incubation period (generally 4 to 6 weeks, but can be up to 1 year, with reports of incubation periods of several years), a lack of symptoms early in an infectious animal, or airborne transmission from bats in enclosed environments (caves, laboratories, houses).

Assuming that a population of individuals is mixed homogeneously, this model organizes the persons into different compartments (states), according to their health status, e.g., susceptible (denoted by S, those healthy ones who may acquire the infection), infectious (I, those infected ones who are contagious), and recovered (R, those who are recovered from the disease).",32.952947149587196,13.717995653022708

For instance, influenza typically has an incubation period of 1-4 days where individuals may not be aware of their infection, and is typically shed from before the onset of symptoms through 5-7 days (United Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2015). Laboratory confirmed diagnosis for influenza is often unnecessary (even for pandemic influenza), as it typically resolves with no intervention after 3-7 days. An understanding of these factors is pivotal for setting parameters for public health measures like quarantine, isolation, and contact tracing. These factors also have a range of relatively predictable implications for health services utilization and health care resource allocation. MDR-and XDR-TB, on the other hand, can take several weeks for laboratory diagnosis, clinical disease can emerge years after infection, and treatment may require over 6 months of antitubercular medication that carry serious adverse side effects (United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2012; World Health Organization 2012). As such, considerations regarding the ethically appropriate treatment of individuals suspected of being infected and how to address treatment non-adherence will differ markedly in the contexts of influenza and TB. Moreover, pandemic plans are ill-equipped to address ethical questions arising in instances where infectious diseases have no effective treatment and where individuals may remain infectious for extended periods of time (e.g., TDR-TB), such as questions regarding the permissibility of implementing long-term isolation measures (e.g., multiple months or years) (Lange et al. 2014) .",23.276360557435545,13.357468084579217

However, the pressure to improve genetics in high performing pig herds forces many pig producers to purchase their breeding stock. In these cases, it is important to evaluate the health status of the origin herd.

Old mice with no evident pathologies but underweight (5/20 g) were also discarded because of the presence of malnutrition (Mocchegiani et al., 1998) and the subsequent risk of cancer (Temple, 2002) . Fig. 4 shows that the survival rate in old pHx mice is shorter (24 months) than in old sham controls (30 months) (P B/0.01). The majority of deaths occurs at 21 months of age (i.e. after 1 month after partial hepatectomy).

The histological analysis performed other groups of old pHx and sham old mice at 1 month from partial hepatectomy shows the presence of carcinoma alone or associated with hyperplasia of BALT complex (60%) in old pHx mice with respect to 30% in old sham controls ( Table 2) . Hyperplasia of BALT complex, on the whole, does not seem to constitute a factor in causing death (75% in both groups) ( Table 2) . Therefore, the differences in survival are due to cancer. Also, chronic glomerulonephritis does not seem to affect survival (5% in both groups) ( Table 2 ). It is worthy to note that old sham mice (20%) show good health, which is not present in old pHx mice (0%), thus explaining the shorter survival time in old pHx mice with respect to old sham controls as well as the maximum life span of 30 months (Fig. 4) . In view of this, the 20% of old sham mice showing good health could represent possible candidates for successful ageing, as has been reported for old humans (15 Á/18%) (OCTO Study) (Wikby et al., 1998) .

Measles is typically a disease of children, and it can cause severe pneumonia, diarrhea, encephalitis, and death (Yanagi et al. 2006 ) . Despite the availability of effective live vaccines, measles is still responsible for 4 % of deaths in children younger than 5 years of age worldwide (WHO 2007 ). Synonyms : Rubeola 8.2 Classifi cation Family -Paramyxoviridae Genus -Morbillivirus 8.3 Epidemiology MV outbreaks usually occur in late winter/early spring, and transmission is via aerosolized droplets (Hayward 1826 ; Rall 2003 ). MV is one of the most highly contagious infectious agents, and outbreaks can occur in populations in which less than 10 % of individuals are susceptible. Before the introduction of measles vaccine, over 90 % of persons would become immune by age 15 as a result of naturally acquired infection. The 1933 studies of Hedrich in Baltimore showed that measles epidemics were related to small fl uctuations in the susceptible population under the age of 15 years of age. Epidemics occurred when the susceptible population reached 45-50 % and ceased when the levels were reduced to 30-35 %. A level of herd immunity protected the population from epidemics when it reached 65 % of the children under age 15, but it guaranteed a reservoir of susceptible individuals for endemic measles (Schaffner et al. 1968 ). It is estimated that 90 % of nonimmune people exposed to an infected individual will become infected. Moreover, infected individuals are contagious for 3-4 days before and after the appearance of the characteristic rash, increasing the risk of transmission. The contagiousness of MV is best expressed by the basic reproductive number (Ro), which is the mean number of secondary cases that would arise if an infectious agent were introduced into a completely susceptible population. The estimated Ro for MV is generally assumed to be 12-18,",20.116422249145167,14.218102218353152

A case of foodborne illness is only identified when a patient falls ill, seeks medical help and undergoes diagnostic testing which leads to identification of the aetiological agent. For some pathogens with long incubation periods (e.g. hepatitis A and E), even when diagnosed, identification of a food source may be extremely difficult due to the long delay between exposure and symptom onset. A third factor compromising the ability to detect foodborne disease is the high rate of asymptomatic infections associated with some pathogens. Therefore, linked cases are difficult to detect. These challenges in diagnosis of foodborne diseases are illustrated by the fact that ""unrecognized agents"" account for up to 81 % of all U.S. foodborne illnesses and hospitalizations and 64 % of deaths [8, 27, 29] . Rapid population growth and urbanization, deforestation, invasion of previously pristine habitats for agriculture, and increasing demand for animal protein all likely contribute to increased emergence of novel infectious disease threats, while climate change and the increasing global connectedness and mobility facilitate their global spread [30] . Consequently, the pattern of disease outbreaks has changed, from localized clusters of disease in confined populations to dispersed outbreaks with excellent opportunity for further transmission. Similarly, a transition is observed from localized foodborne epidemics to diffuse international foodborne outbreaks due to globalization of the food market [31] . The foodborne nature is often disguised by person-to-person transmission after the initial infection(s) because of the highly infectious nature of most foodborne viral pathogens. Some of these viruses are of major public health concern amongst others because of their food-or waterborne nature, low infectious dose required for infection and serious health-related implications and associated costs.",20.19945967559096,11.420122702195513

Careful attention to the exposure history, immunization status, and use of malarial chemoprophylaxis can be very helpful in establishing a diagnosis.

Whereas most infections in travelers have incubation periods of less than 21 days, several can manifest more than 30 days after return (eg, malaria, tuberculosis, hepatitis, filariasis). Furthermore, patients might spend several weeks to months overseas and then present within a short time after returning home with infections that were acquired months earlier.

However, the more complex models that will be discussed later are often built around multiple components that are parameterised as probability distributions. For example, the curves in Fig. 5 and the solid line in Fig. 6 illustrate the types of skewed distribution that are often used to better describe the observed lengths of, for example, the incubation or symptomatic periods of infectious diseases, particularly when these have been sampled from a large enough number of infected individuals in a population to arrive at a sufficiently robust result. Thus, the length of any one individual's incubation period will differ from those of others with some durations (those closer to the average) more frequently observed than others. Clearly, incubation periods of less than zero would be meaningless and use of the lognormal avoids these. Further, the lognormal, and other potentially skewed distributions such as the Gamma, capture well the distribution of the duration of the positive values, probably because incubation periods depend on a wealth of multi-factorial influences (not always well understood) acting multiplicatively, such as the differing pre-existing genetic backgrounds and immunological susceptibilities of individuals to particular viruses, their age and underlying fitness in terms of any pre-existing co-morbidities, and their nutritional and socio-economic conditions; and any variations in the pathogenicity of the particular virus or microorganism, the dose of virus received by an individual and the route of infection. Incubation periods can vary enormously between different infectious agents both in terms of average incubation period and the degree to which this varies between individuals; for example, the mean (and variances) for influenza, SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV), and smallpox have been estimated to be about 1.3 days (0.5 days 2 ), 4.6 days (15.9 days 2 ), and 11.6 days (3.34 days 2 ), respectively. Appropriately parameterising such aspects can be hugely important to modelling the dynamics (e.g. the rate and extent of spread) of particular infections and the potential impact that different public health control options might have.

When such age-related vulnerabilities manifest themselves as disease or disability, biogerontologists call the process senescence. Alternatively, senescence may be defined as the progressive deterioration of bodily functions over time. This loss of function is associated with decreased fecundity (i.e., physiological ability to parent a child) and increased risk of morbidity and mortality as an individual gets older. The rate and progression of the process of somatic deterioration varies greatly from person to person and from bodily organ to bodily organ for any given person, but generally over time every organ of the body is affected.

The model suggests that the importance of survival attributes may increase with a person's life expectancy. For persons who at age 30 can expect to live into their 90s, more than 80% of the variation in life-span may be due to factors that are fixed by this age. These calculations were made by I.A.

Their view is that, with advancing age, the lifestyle factor is of paramount importance in causing these conditions. They maintain further that, inasmuch as lifestyle determines the ultimate impact of genes, lifestyle changes can prevent the presentation of a potential genetic trait. This view of the role of the lifestyle factor goes beyond any of those previously cited. It is arguably too expansive, since genetics, certain environmental influences, and chance are still primary players in this ""dance of power."" Even if such a broad role for lifestyle has limited demonstrable validity, however, the championing of it may have considerable practical merit in serving to induce people to be responsible for their own health and try to be proactive in maintaining it.

The incubation periods of different infectious diseases is also useful for diagnosis 140,142-145.159-161 . The incubation period for malaria is at least 7 days, and the maximum period, depending on the species responsible, can be months or years. Tropical viruses (dengue, Chikungunya, Zika and agents responsible for VHFs) have a maximum incubation period of 21 days (the ""21-day rule""), except those produced by hantaviruses. Figure 1 shows the typical incubation periods for other infections associated with imported fever of unknown origin. It is also very important to discover specific risks associated with the individual traveler. Hence, mosquito bites are associated with malaria, the main imported viruses and, exceptionally, visceral leishmaniasis; other insect bites (bedbugs, fleas, ticks) are vectors for spreading diseases such as endemic African trypanosomosiasis, rickettsial infections and borreliosis. Drinking unpasteurized milk may be the means of transmission of brucellosis and Q fever.",23.247776309589778,15.140407301961464

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) offers a dramatic example: by rapidly determining the maximum incubation period of SARS, public-health officials were able to set quarantine periods and halt a potential pandemic without the aid of a vaccine or treatment. [6] [7] [8] [9] The incubation period thus plays an essential part in surveillance for healthcare-associated infections, 10, 11 and may aid in diagnosis if laboratory facilities are unavailable. The incubation period is clinically relevant in the administration of antiviral medications, many of which are most effective when given before or immediately after symptom onset. 12 Epidemiological studies depend on the incubation period to identify potential sources of infection. 13 Predictive models designed to inform policy decisions use the incubation period to evaluate the potential of surveillance programmes and interventions to confront emerging epidemics. 14, 15 The length of the incubation period by comparison with the latent period (the time between infection and becoming infectious) determines the potential effectiveness of control measures that target symptomatic individuals. 16 Statements of the incubation period are often imprecise, unsourced, or based on limited evidence-for example, ""4-5 days"" may refer to the most common range, the highest and lowest incubation periods in a study, or some other interval.

This is highlighted by the recent cluster of seven cases of H5N1 AI with definite human-to-human transmission within a single family in North Sumatra, Indonesia, where nonfamily members were also similarly exposed but never infected (Normile, 2006; WHO, 2006a, b) . This suggests the hypothesis that the family had either a shared genetic, behavioral, and/or environmental circumstance that predisposed them to human-to-human infection. Although this stochastic emergence event did not lead to ongoing transmission on a larger scale, it suggests the importance of human genetic, behavioral, or environmental heterogeneity and, thus, could be a harbinger of future case clusters in which lengthened chains of transmission among uniquely susceptible persons may allow the virus to undergo evolutionary change necessary to drive R 0 > 1 in the general population.",21.5567207583403,13.078453525604347

Having more negative life events at 6-months after the earthquake significantly increased the probability of developing chronicity and recovery patterns. Prior studies have reported that individuals' mental health after a disaster may be more susceptible to postdisaster negative life events rather than the disaster per se (Freedy, Saladin, Kilpatrick, Resnick, & Saunders, 1994) . Negative life events could by themselves aggravate adolescents' post-earthquake stress reactions and increase the ongoing daily hassles, which could in turn have strong adverse impact on their mental health status. As for social support, chronic depression was associated with fewer social support at 6-months. The recovery pattern could be accounted for by fewer social support at 6-months and greater social support at 24-months. Conversely, greater social support at 6-months and fewer social support at 24-months could increase the risk for delayed depression. As the literature (Armenian et al., 2002; Xu, Mo, & Wu, 2013) , these findings suggest that social support may be a protective factor against depression after traumatic experiences.

Knowledge of typical incubation periods (Table  324 -2) of possible infectious causes is a key tool in narrowing the differential diagnosis. Many agents are simply not biologically possible outside their usual incubation period. Arboviral diseases such as dengue uniformly have short incubation periods. Onset of illness more than 2 weeks after the last possible exposure effectively rules out this class of viral illness. None of the known hemorrhagic fever viruses has a possible incubation longer than 21 days. Long-incubation infections like schistosomiasis cannot present less than several weeks after first possible exposure. Some diseases such as malaria or enteric fever have more variable incubation periods but nevertheless have a typical incubation period during which time the majority of the patients present. A number of diseases, especially those that are arthropod borne, have a strict seasonality whereby transmission stops during either cold or dry weather. Examples would include malaria in nontropical countries such as Korea, Tajikistan, or northern China, as well as Lyme borreliosis or tick-borne encephalitis, all of which completely cease transmission during winter months. GeoSentinel surveillance data indicate that dengue cases in travelers show marked regionspecific peaks for Southeast Asia (June, September), South-Central malarious areas have the highest risk for infection.

Rabies virus varies worldwide from continent to continent, and even within countries (urban vs. sylvatic rabies) (Krauss et al. 2003) . Host range is wide in mammals, with bats being a particularly important vector. Clinical disease in humans is acute and almost inevitably fatal without proper prophylaxis or postexposure vaccination. Transmission occurs predominantly via saliva from the bite of an infected animal, but infective virus is secreted in all body fluids including saliva, blood, milk, and urine. While it appears canine species and bats are the most important vectors of zoonotic transmission to humans, cattle are likely the most significant among domesticated livestock (Odontsetseg et al. 2009 , World Health Organization 2004 . Human cases resulting from bovine exposure were difficult to ascertain from the literature; however, rare events have been documented (Delpietro et al. 2001 .

This is the case for West Nile virus (WNV) where RC is maintained by a passerine bird and Culex mosquitoes host-vector system but where Aedes mosquitoes are an intermediary host/vector component (Kilpatrick 2011; Petersen et al. 2013) . Thus, when humans get bitten by WNV-infected Culex individuals, transmission can be regarded as direct (i.e., occurring across SB1); but when humans get bitten by WNV-infected Aedes individuals, transmission can be regarded as indirect with the pathogen needing to cross both SB2 and SB3 to be transferred from RC to FHC.

Gastrointestinal and respiratory disorders often start localized within the stables. Usually, when >10% of the calves have clinical signs of illness, metaphylactic treatments are applied to the complete batch of calves. This procedure is reflected in the substantially greater use of group antimicrobial treatment than individual antimicrobial treatment in veal systems (Pardon et al., 2012) . Calves within close vicinity to an infected calf will be exposed to the pathogen and possibly subsequent disease, whereas clinical disease will likely be prevented in calves housed farther away. Therefore, calves within a pen affect each other more than calves between pens. This is also reflected in the large percentage (i.e., 30%) of variation in feed efficiency that was associated with the random pen effect in our study, although factors other than health status also contribute to this pen effect. This emphasizes the importance of health status in explaining variation in feed efficiency in veal calves. Inflammatory status could contribute to variation in feed efficiency. For instance, hepatic expression of genes associated with inflammatory processes differed in beef cattle divergent for residual feed intake (Alexandre et al., 2015; Paradis et al., 2015) . Mitochondrial function might also explain variation in feed efficiency. A higher mitochondrial respiration rate was found, for instance, in muscle tissue of beef steers with a low residual feed intake compared with beef steers with a high residual feed intake (Kolath et al., 2006) . Electron leakage and H 2 O 2 production was reduced in muscle mitochondria of pigs genetically selected for low residual feed intake (Grubbs et al., 2013) .

The answer may be in part that rotavirus, influenza virus, and RSV are all superficial mucosal infections with short incubation periods (i.e., 2-5 days); virus is rarely detected in the blood, and replication at sites distant to the mucosal surface is not an important part of viral pathogenesis. In contrast, viremia (and replication distant from the site of primary replication) occurs in measles, mumps, rubella, and poliovirus infections; consequently, incubation periods are long (i.e., 8-14 days), Because of these differences in incubation periods, activation and differentiation of virus-specific memory T and B cells are probably more important in protection against ""systematic"" infections than against ""superficial"" mucosal infections.

Most obvious are chronic health conditions (CHC), but the majority of children only experience temporary health problems (e.g., infection, injury). How do these variations in health status affect quality of life (QL) in children? QL reflects the child's overall well-being across multiple domains. There has been no study examining the relationship between compromised health and QL in children in the general population who do not have a CHC, nor do we know how such variation interacts with race/ethnic status. Our hypotheses are that (1) variation in health status is positively associated with QL regardless of the presence of CHC and (2) Whites report higher QL than African Americans and Hispanics, regardless of health status. A multi-site study enrolled 4,824 5th grade children from one of the three major race/ethnic groups in the U.S. (Hispanic=38%, African American=36%, White=26%). Children reported their QL with the PedsQL providing scores for their physical and psychosocial domains, as well as on instruments to measure selfworth and social well-being. Parents rated their 5th graders' overall health status on the commonly used single item ""In general, would you say your child's health is . . . (Excellent/Very Good/Good/Fair/Poor)?""and completed a screener, from which chronic health condition was classified. Results showed there was a reduction in each QL domain associated with each decrement in overall health status, even in the absence of a CHC. Moreover, African Americans and Hispanics report a lower QL than Whites, when in excellent health as well as at each decrement in health status. This demonstrates for the first time that even minor decrements in health status are associated with concomitant reduction in QL, not only in the physical domain, but also in the emotional and social domains. Several researchers have found that teenage pregnancy is associated with worst educational outcomes among adolescents and that girls who have a child early in life, are less likely to graduate from high school (Molina et al., 2004) . Other researchers have proposed that educational expectations do actually predict educational outcomes among youth. They have found that having higher educational expectations is associated with higher educational outcomes later in life (Mello, 2008) . However, researchers have not examined how educational expectations may be associated with adolescents' self-reported sexual behaviors. Some researchers suggest that there might be a self-selection process in which adolescents who do worst in school and do not have plans to continue further in their education may also engage in unprotected sexual behavior, putting them at higher risk of becoming pregnant. In the present study we examined the relationship between educational expectations and goals and different sexual behavior outcomes in a sample of 829 Mexican youth. Participants included 829 adolescents between the ages of 14 and 17 (mean 15.18, S.D.=0.68, 55,4% females) part of an HIV and STDs intervention program. We examine this relationship using time 1 data. Participants completed a self-reported questionnaire that asked about their sexual behavior and explore different psychosocial predictors of sexual behavior. Using a regression analyses we examined whether having plans to complete high school and continue their education predicted ever had sex, age in which girls and boys should have sex for the first time, plans to use condoms when having sex, and perceive that condoms may be effective to protect them of STDs and HIV. Our findings suggest that plans to finish high school predicts only perceptions that condoms may be effective to protect against HIV (t=2,06, p< 0.05), and not any of the other outcomes. Because we had very few participants who reported ever having sex (9,5%), we probably did not have enough power to find further differences. We explored how these variables may predict their sexual behavior at the 12 months follow-up, when 16% of participants reported ever having sex, and we found that having plans to attend college predicted not having sex among adolescents (Exp (B) = 0.358, p<0.01). Implications of these findings for intervention and practice are discussed. Purposes: Although many reports have suggested a role for the social skill in the treatment of depression, there has been little evidence that the social skill training is effective therapeutic strategies for treating it. The activation level are thought to be an important mediator of the social skill and the depression. Obata et al. (2010) found that the difficulty in the control of social anxiety lead to the inhibition of social activity and the increase of depressive mood in Japanese high school students. We hypothesized that the mechanism for exacerbation of depression may be explained by the behavioral activation and social skill, and these relationships differed with the level of social anxiety. Method: Questionnaires were conducted with 347 Japanese adolescents (16.0±0.6 years). Questionnaires were composed of Depression Self-Rating Scale for Children (DSRS; Birleson, 1981) , Assertiveness Skill Scale for High school students (ASS; Takaki et al., 2002) , and Behavioral Activation for Depression Scale (BADS; Martell et al., 2001) . Higher score group (n=50) and lower score group (n=50) were extracted in subjects on ""social anxiety(reverse coded)"" in ASS. Data analyses were tested using correlation analysis to examine relationship of between depression , social skill, and behavioral activation, using SPSS 16.0. Main Results: ""Activation (reverse coded)"" in BADS was significantly associated with ""positive interpersonal entry"" in ASS(higher score group: r=−.37, p<.01; lower score group: r=−.26, .n.s.). Conclusion: These results suggest that the control of social anxiety is an important procedure for behavioral activation on depression. Many people think that the children are not stress, in fact they can stress as the adult but their parent cannot notice or skip it. The objective is to study the association between state anxiety with emotional quotient and strength and difficulty of the secondary school student who also study in Sunday Buddhism and do not study by controlling some potential confounding. The self-report questionnaire was distribution to both type of schools to student age 11-16 years old. The tools of this study are Thai version of state-trait anxiety of Spielberger's; the Strength and Difficulty Questionnaire (SDQ); emotional quotient (EQ). The regression model used for analyzing and the data are centered to reduce the scaling problem. The 303 completed answer questionnaire was returned, the incomplete questionnaire was excluded from the study to reduce the effect of imputation. Mean age of sample is 13.5 years old, 42.24% is male, and 48.51% reported that they are also study in the Sunday Buddhism School. The model by stepwise selection presents that trait anxiety, pro-social, selfcontrol, ability to deal with problem, self-esteem, life-satisfaction and interaction between age and emotional problem, the adjusted R2 is 60.55% (p-value<0.0001). The increasing one unit of trait anxiety, self-control, self-esteem and life-satisfaction increases 0.52, 0.10, 0.11 and 0.13 standardize unit of state anxiety, the higher standardize score of ability to deal with problem decrease 0.07 standardize unit of state anxiety. The interaction of emotional and age reduce the standardize score of state anxiety. The higher emotional problem score increased 0.27 standardize unit of state anxiety while age reduce 0.01 unit of state anxiety (p-value<0.05). The gender and Sunday Buddhism school included into the model to control potential confounding factor, female has higher state anxiety score than male, the student in Sunday Buddhism School have lower state anxiety than non-student (p-value>0.05). The student with high score of self-control, self-esteem and lifesatisfaction have higher level of state anxiety which may cause from they are try to be the best which make them stress. The ability to deal with the problem can reduce state anxiety, the higher age (more maturity) reduce emotional problem and finally reduce state anxiety. The student who is good in some dimension of EQ may cause state anxiety. The mobilization of significant resources for global health coincides with the emergence of Global Health Initiatives (GHIs) and the rising importance of multilateral and private actors in global health; traditional actors in global health, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), have been joined by a variety of civil society and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), private firms, and private philanthropists. These new actors, which exist alongside traditional arrangements between sovereign states and UN bodies, signal a sea change in the institutional arrangements in global health as well as a change in the norms, expectations and rules relating to the relationships between these new philanthropists. It has become clear, however, that the new institutions in global health have often failed to adequately evaluate their investments and program implementation. With such enormous investments, it is critical to better understand these new institutions, evaluate their strategies to promote global health and document the successes and failures of these efforts. We propose that rigorous qualitative research methodologies can explore and describe how global health actors and their associated mechanisms interact with complex health systems to yield optimal Results: Qualitative methods, particularly case research, can overcome the three main weaknesses of quantitatively-oriented public health research models: underestimating complexity, failing to incorporate context and an inability to engage in the ""why"" questions. Qualitative methods can better evaluate if the activities funded by new global health actors are best aligned to meet the objective of delivering high value care to patients. Global health institutions can use this insight to bridge the knowledge-action gap in global health care delivery by translating the current understanding of medical interventions and health systems into evidence-based strategies for care delivery.",19.068966117659784,9.892014444376878

There is clear evidence to suggest that health indicators are inferior in lower SEP groups as compared with higher SEP groups, and this classification could be used to target resources.",20.964999614783952,9.828144934296697

The assumption has been that all mothers and children in lowincome and middle-income countries were equally poor and that there was no need to account for subnational inequalities when strategies were designed for the scaling-up of health interventions. Practical difficulties in the stratification of health status by socioeconomic position contributed to this lack of visibility. The most inequitable indicators are skilled birth attendant, followed by four or more antenatal care visits, whereas the most equitable was early initiation of breastfeeding.

Analyses of variance were carried out separately for industries and occupations. Multiple comparisons with Bonferroni method indicated that in the manufacturing industry and professionals, the ""66 h or more"" group had a higher level of fatigue than the ""less than 60 h"" group (P<0.05). In the human health and social work activities industry, the ""61-65 h"" and ""66 h or more"" groups had a higher level of fatigue than the ""less than 60 h"" group (P<0.05). No significant association was found between working hours and depressive symptoms in any industry or occupation. Although reducing the number of working hours is essential to ameliorate workers' fatigue, special attention should be paid to workers in manufacturing or human health and social work activities industries and professionals who work long hours. Especially, workers employed in the human health and social work activities industry who worked at least 61 hours per week, showed higher scores of fatigue. This suggests that the association between working hours and fatigue is varied among different industrial sectors. Psychosocial work conditions including high demands, lack of control and support have been linked to poor health. Yet, the influence of individual factors such as general mental ability (GMA) remains to be examined. The present study set out to investigate how childhood mental ability and psychosocial work characteristics relate to different health indicators in a cohort of working women(n=271) and men (n=291). Specifically, childhood GMA and self-reports of job demands, job control and social support were linked to two positive health indicators (sense of coherence and self-rated health) and two negative health indicators (musculoskeletal problems and anxiety in midlife). Considering the gendered labor market and variations in health patterns between women and men, gender specific analyses were performed. Results revealed no linkages between childhood GMA and the health indicators included. Further, there were no significant interactions between GMA and the psychosocial factors. The overall impact of occupational level was low and controlling for occupational level did not change the results much. These findings are likely to result from the study cohort being fairly homogeneous and the women and men being in good health. Objectives: Few studies have been devoted to exploring hospital physicians' work stresses to their quality of work lives. This study was aimed to explore the relationship between work stress and the quality of work lives, especially under the circumstances of given work stress, the moderating effects of labor activities on the work stress and quality of work lives. Methods: Developed, structured and validated questionnaire was released by mails to hospital physician executives in the period of Aug-Nov 2009 and 737 respondents returned in this study with a response rate of 32.83%. Measures included work stressors as financial-oriented and norm-oriented, and work lives as work and career satisfaction, health status and illness, and substance uses. Labor activities were measured as body labors and leisure activities. Personal characteristics and work status of hospital physician executives were also collected. Descriptive analyses, factor analyses, and multiple regressions were performed. Results: Controlling the personal characteristics and work status of hospital physician executives, it was found that perceived financial-oriented and norm-oriented stresses by hospital physician executives had lower work satisfaction and career satisfaction, more illness symptoms, and worse perceived health status; however, more labor activities had positive effects on quality of work lives. Especially, body labors could moderate financialoriented stress to better career and work satisfaction, better perceived health status, less muscular illness, and reduced sleeping disorders. Also, leisure activities moderated norm-oriented stress to reduced nose and throat illness and moderated financialoriented stress to higher alcohol assumptions. Conclusions and implications: We verified the negative relationships of work stress to quality of work lives for hospital physician executives. Moreover, labor activities played important roles in moderating the work stress to work lives. Under the given work stresses in the health care work environments, hospital administrators could recognize the values of body labors and leisure activities into health promotion programs for their health care professionals to create healthy work environments. Cardiovascular reactivity has been intensively studied for some decades as a potential risk factor or risk marker of cardiovascular disorders and diseases. Among other end-points hypertension, coronary heart disease, and stroke have been possible to predict in research using reactivity measures. However, these predictions have not always been successful. Progress needs to be made. One of the possibilities is using cardiovascular recovery in addition to reactivity in the prediction of pathological processes of hemodynamics and neuroendocrinology as well as direct disorders and diseases. New steps towards applying the research results in clinical practice are necessary to realize the promises of cardiovascular behavioral research. This symposium is one step in this direction. In this symposium researchers will present papers regarding different aspects of cardiovascular regulation, reactivity, and recovery. The symposium starts with Dr Gellman who has comprehensively studied the relationship among hostility, metabolic syndrome, and cardiac structure & function. Dr. Gellman's research is relevant for many of the most common life style factors. The second paper will be Dr. Hamer's presentation regarding psychophysiological responses and their relationship with sub-clinical coronary heart disease. This topic will help particularly in the planning of coronary heart disease prevention. Third, Dr. Tuomisto will illuminate different patterns of cardiovascular reactivity and recovery in intra-arterial blood pressure of normotensive and hypertensive individuals. The results may promote research in the prediction of cardiovascular risks. The last presentation will be Dr. Zanstra's study of challenge appraisals' role in the prediction of a myocardial reaction pattern in anticipation of and reactivity to a naturalistic stressor. The study has interest especially for those who do research in real world circumstances. All these presentations will have both indirect and direct relevance for clinical research in the prediction and prevention of cardiovascular diseases in addition to more basic theoretical issues. Acute psychophysiological stress testing, involving measurement of cardiovascular and biological responses to laboratory-induced mental stress, is an important tool to investigate mechanisms that might account for the association between psychosocial stress and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The present study was designed to examine associations of disturbed psychophysiological responses with sub-clinical atherosclerosis. Participants were 543 healthy men and women (mean age=62.9±5.7 yrs), without history or objective signs of CVD, drawn from the Whitehall II epidemiological cohort. Various cardiovascular (beat-to-beat blood pressure, heart rate variability) and biological measures (inflammatory and haemostatic markers, salivary cortisol) were assessed during and following mental stressors, consisting of a 5-min Stroop task and a 5-min mirror tracing task. Coronary artery calcium (CAC), a measure of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis, was measured using electron beam computed tomography. The tasks induced significant increases in blood pressure, cortisol, interleukin-6, and fibrinogen. Cortisol responders were at higher risk of having clinically relevant levels of CAC (odds ratio=2.17, 95% CI, 1.37 -3.41) after adjustments for age, gender, baseline cortisol, social status, depressive symptoms, and conventional risk factors. Cardiovascular responses were not associated with CAC. Basal levels of inflammatory markers were associated with CAC although the stress responses were not. These data support the notion that cortisol stress reactivity, an index of hypothalamic pituitary adrenal function, is one of the possible mechanisms through which psychosocial stress may influence the risk of CHD. Cardiovascular reactivity to behavioral stress tasks has been shown to be associated with pathological hemodynamic and neuroendocrinological processes. Later, recovery from such stress has been studied for similar reasons. Our purpose was to study cardiovascular reactivity from a baseline condition, a relaxation to behavioral stress tasks and recovery from the tasks to a relaxation condition after the tasks. As data, we used the Tampere Ambulatory Hypertension Study data bank of intraarterial blood pressure (BP) from the 1990's. The participants were 95 newly detected, WHO-classified, age-matched normotensive (NT; n=33), borderline hypertensive (BHT; n=30) and hypertensive (HT; n=32) men recruited through routine health examinations. They underwent a 5-minute cue-controlled relaxation (R1) followed by 8 standardized behavioral challenges: a video game, arithmetic, social problem solving, imagery, a habituation test, a comic film, and the cold pressor test. After the tasks, a 10-minute relaxation period (R2) was started. Systolic and diastolic BP (SBP, DBP) and heart rate (HR) and were analyzed. First, in a mixed-design ANOVA, Time factor, R1 (the reactivity baseline) and R2 (the recovery baseline) was studied together with the groups. The Time x Group interactions did not differ for SBP, DBP and HR: Fs(2, 92) < 1.04. However, the direction of recovery was different for BPs and HR. During the recovery baseline, HR was lower than during the reactivity baseline. The reverse was true for both SBP and DBP. Second, R2 variables were compared in ANCOVA using R1 variables as covariates. Following main effects were obtained: SBP, F(2, 91) = 3.14, p<.05 and DBP, F(2, 91) = 5.98, p<.005. In Bonferroni controlled group contrasts, the recovery baseline measures showed differences between the hypertensive groups in DBP (p<.05, 95% confidence interval=0.8 -6.59) while reactivity measures had shown DBP differences between these groups only in the cold pressor test.

This study suggests that investments in formal international legal processes can be effective and appropriate, even when the outcomes are unclear from the start. The FCTC negotiation process coincided with a rise in domestic policy adoption in the direction advocated by WHO. However, there remains the need to improve outreach and diffusion to lower-income countries in the area of tobacco control, and likely other areas of chronic disease control. Aims: The number of the unemployed has been increasing in Japan, as well as in other countries, due to the economic turn-down in 2008. The unemployed might have lower socioeconomic status (SES), thus have poor mental health, and difficulty in seeking help for mental health problems. This study aimed to clarify subjective social class, mental health, and help seeking behaviors among the employed who looked for a job, comparing with those currently employed. Methods: A community-based epidemiologic study of common mental disorders, the World Mental Health Japan 2002-2006 Survey, were conducted of random samples of residents in 11 municipalities (N=4,130), with using the WHO-CIDI 3.0. A subsample of the respondents (the part 2 sample, N=1,682) was asked to determine their social class, self-rated health, psychological distress (K6), 12-month DSM-IV mental disorders, and help-seeking behaviors for mental health problems. Analyses were conducted, comparing these variables between the currently unemployed who look for a job (N= 35) and the currently employed (N=997), adjusting for sex, age, and education, with considering the sampling weight. Results: The unemployed had significantly lower education and household income than the employed (p<0.05). The unemployed reported poorer physical and mental health status than the employed (p=0.08 and p=0.06, respectively), while there was no significant difference in prevalence of psychological distress or mental disorders. The proportion of those who sought help for mental health problems was not significantly different between the two groups; however, as a reason of the delay in seeking help, the unemployed more tended to concern ""how much money the treatment would be cost""(p=0.07). Conclusions: The unemployed were at lower SES, had poor physical and mental health status, and delayed their help seeking because of their concern on treatment fee.

Influenza infections will tend to create other cases before the index case is symptomatic; the influenza pandemic that we fear will have higher transmission rates than were seen in the 2003 SARS epidemic. What they share is direct transmission and a short incubation period. Some of the most frightening emerging infections are those with long incubation periods, because for those, by the time the first cases are recognized, many infections have been generated and the logistics of control are correspondingly difficult (table 1). By the time AIDS was recognized as a novel disease, it was already spreading out of control in urban regions of the rich and poor world. By the time BSE was identified as more than just a few extra sick cows, it had spread across the UK and abroad. Thus there are several dimensions to the classification of emergent infections: more or less transmissible, early versus late infectiousness, short or long periods between infection and disease.

Because infectious diseases are, for the most part, acquired from the people around us, our own future health status depends on that of our neighbors (e.g., the more people we know who are infected, the more likely we are to become infected ourselves). For acute infectious diseases, the health status of the population often changes quickly over time, with the number of people infectious, susceptible to being infected, and immune to the disease changing substantially over the course of an epidemic. Further, the membership in each of these groups does not vary arbitrarily over time but is driven by often well-understood biological processes (Box 1). For instance, in the simple example of a permanently immunizing infection spread through person-to-person transmission such as measles, new susceptible individuals only enter the population through birth and immigration; these individuals can then only become infected by contact with existing infectious individuals, who, in turn, will eventually become immune or die and be removed forever removed from participation in the epidemic process.",26.56623331973593,12.551427397076031

O'Neill (2004) pointed out that it was easier to manage the SARS epidemic in a more controlled society with a strong sense of community, as in China, that in more individualistic, liberal democracies in the West. All the same, the early phases of the SARS epidemic in Guangzhong province were poorly controlled in public health terms. The reasons were partly as discussed by Zhong (2004) , that SARS was not initially distinguished from a concurrent, more widespread influenza epidemic in Guangzhong; and partly the slowness of public health staff to realize that something new was afoot, and their initial reluctance to alert national authorities to the situation, thus abetting the spread of SARS to Beijing. As Chen Zhu told us, an important lesson learnt in China, at the price of the resignations of the health minister and the mayor of Beijing, was the need for transparency and communication. Once it became aware of SARS, the World Health Organization swung into gear to manage what rapidly became an international outbreak as described by Heymann (2004) . The WHO officer in Hanoi, Dr Carlo Urbani, sadly succumbed to SARS but not before he had alerted the world to the gravity of the situation. Even before the causative agent of SARS was identified, as Roy Anderson pointed out (Anderson et al. 2004) , the pattern of transmission was being analysed, and models of best containment began to evolve. Harper (2004) described the UK Department of Health's proposed organization for SARS and other unexpected outbreaks.

The heyday of the ""familiar essay"" was the 18th and 19th centuries, and perhaps its most famous practitioners were William Hazlitt and Charles Lamb. Their writings were neither strictly critical nor purely personal, but, as Fadiman puts it, equal measures of brain and heart, in a style at once invigorating and intimate. ""The familiar essayist"", she writes, ""didn't speak to the millions; he spoke to one reader, as if the two of them were sitting side by side in front of a crackling fi re with their cravats loosened, their favorite stimulants at hand, and a long evening of conversation stretching before them. His viewpoint was subjective, his frame of reference concrete, his style digressive, his eccentricities conspicuous, and his laughter usually at his own expense."" 1 The crux of the familiar essay is a subject about which the writer is well-acquainted and passionate. This year's Wakley Prize will be awarded, we daresay, to a contemporary Hazlitt, Lamb, or Fadiman. The prize is given annually to the best essay on a clinical topic of international health importance. Previous winners, from places as far-fl ung as Malawi, Kenya, the Netherlands, London, and Philadelphia, have described their own and their patients' stories of illness; the hard realities of medicine's collision with economics, politics, and geography; and the ravages, mysteries, and lessons of age, health, and disease.

It is difficult to measure the actual rate of transmission of travel-related respiratory illnesses as accurate epidemiological studies would require collecting data from millions of passengers worldwide. Additionally, the low infectious rate and long incubation periods of certain illnesses also further reduce the reliability of study results and the ability to attribute the transmission of a disease to a specific destination and exposure.

It may also be necessary to monitor the effects of chronic disease, for example, to ascertain repeat hospitalizations of patients with congestive heart failure to assess the long-term effects of treatment, and the effects of strengthening ambulatory and outreach services to sustain chronic patients at a safe and functional level in their own homes.

Therefore, the influence of these factors on calf mortality could not be assessed. Previous studies of dairy calf mortality on New Zealand farms have identified disease status and failure of passive transfer of immunity (FPT) as risk factors for mortality. For example, a prospective study of calf and replacement heifer mortality on 32 New Zealand dairy farms in 2015 found that risk of mortality on-farm in the first week of life was higher in herds with disease problems, such as scours, and among calves that were removed from the dam within 12 h of birth and handfed colostrum (Cuttance et al., 2017a) . A related study investigating passive transfer of immunity and colostrum quality found that calves that remained with the dam for ∼24 h had lower prevalence of FPT (Cuttance et al., 2017b) . The authors postulated that feeding poor quality, pooled, stored colostrum (with low antibody and high bacterial concentrations) to calves less that 24 h old was responsible for the observed effects (Denholm et al., 2017) .

A DALY estimate therefore includes the translation from infection to actual disease.

The WHO use DALY to measure the global burden of disease (Lopez et al., 2006 ) , and also base their targets for public health protection on DALYs rather than on infection or illness risks.

Subclinical infection is common, and disease severity varies with age (worse under 6 months), species of Eimeria, parasite burden, and condition of the rabbit (stress, poor husbandry, and poor diet). Significant disease is marked by diarrhea with possible mucus or blood, dehydration, and weight loss. Intussusception is a complication of severe disease. Diagnosis depends on histopathology and/or fecal identification. Molecular assays have been developed to identify intestinal Eimeria spp. 57 In addition to supportive care, sulfa drugs are most effective at limiting multiplication. Sulfadimethoxine (15 mg/kg by mouth every 12 hours) or trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole (30 mg/kg by mouth every 12 hours) can be used for 10 days of therapy. Recovering rabbits develop lifelong immunity. 12 Cryptosporidiosis Cryptosporidium parvum infects the small intestine and causes a self-limited diarrheal illness (4-5 days duration) in young rabbits (peak, 30-40 days old). Illness is accompanied by anorexia, depression, and dehydration. The organism can be identified on histopathology. Other than supportive care, there is no effective treatment. Recently, reports of rabbit Cryptosporidium spp causing zoonotic disease in humans have been reported in several countries. 58 Nematodes Passalurus ambiguous, the rabbit pinworm, is found in most rabbits, and even large parasite burdens are not pathogenic. Adult worms reside in the cecum and colon, and transmission is direct by ingestion of eggs during cecotrophy. Diagnosis is often routine by identification of worms or eggs in the feces, although identification should not prompt treatment in most cases. When treatment is necessary, benzimidazoles, such as fenbendazole (10-20 mg/kg by mouth, repeated in 10-14 days), are effective. 12 ",20.078356496060024,13.179328355240271

China's experience,"2 For example, Indonesia and China both dramatically decreased under-five mortality rates from similarly high levels in the mid-1960s, but with divergent paths. Indonesia achieved steady falls in under-five mortality rates along with increases in per capita income. By contrast, China's under-five mortality rate fell rapidly during a period of meager economic growth to a level that was by 1980 comparable to that of Indonesia in 1995. However, China's under-five mortality rate has virtually stagnated since then, while per capita income has grown dramatically (Wagstaff, 2004 The data show that China began the reform era as an international outlier, achieving high population health status for its relatively low per capita income. Indeed, China's dramatic improvement in population health between the 1950s and 1970s is well known (Hsiao, 1995; Jamison, 1984) . Over the reform era, economic growth outstripped improvement in health status indicators. Currently, health status indicators are about average for China's level of per capita GDP. This ''regression to the mean'' is evident in the infant mortality rate (Fig. 1) , the under-five mortality rate (Fig. 2 ) and life expectancy ( Fig. 3 ; also see working paper appendix Fig. 1 ). What factors explain China's experience? We explore several alternative explanations. (2000) . 4 Thus, an upward-sloping line suggests that the indicator (e.g., life expectancy or health expenditure) is higher in countries with higher per capita income. A downward-sloping line, such as for the infant mortality rate, shows the opposite: higher levels of income per capita are correlated with lower infant mortality. The appendix to the working paper (Eggleston, Wang, & Rao, 2005) presents seven additional figures that compare China to other transitional economies and OECD countries, using data from WHO (2002) and the Ministry of Health (1998, 2001).",19.518896911737674,8.574107432334694

Moreover, different (social) networks through which awareness of the health status of others proceeds may lead to different rates of information spread. One may take these features into account by modeling explicitly the spread of information through a coupled dynamics between disease expansion and individuals' awareness of the disease [31, 33] .",29.494820133741865,16.945745473666648

This approach allows for a direct comparison between analytical predictions and individual-based computer simulations, and for a detailed analysis of finite-size effects and convergence times, whose exponential growth will signal possible bistable disease scenarios. In such a framework, we were able to show that temporal adaptive networks in which individuals may be informed about the health status of others lead to a disease whose effective infectiousness depends on the overall number of infected in the population. In other words, disease propagation on temporal adaptive networks can be seen as mathematically equivalent to disease spreading on a well-mixed population, but with a rescaled effective infectiousness. In accord with the intuition advanced in the introduction, as long as individuals react promptly and consistently to accurate available information on whether their acquaintances are infected or not, network dynamics effectively weakens the disease burden the population suffers. Last but not least, if recovery from the disease is possible, the time for disease eradication drastically reduces whenever individuals have access to accurate information about the health state of their acquaintances and use it to avoid contact with those infected. If recovery or immunity is impossible, the average time needed for a disease to spread increases significantly when such information is being used. In both cases, our model clearly shows how availability of information hinders disease progression (by means of quick action on infected, e.g., their containment via link removal), which constitutes a crucial factor to control the development of global pandemics.",26.83302927412528,14.694809926939788

For instance, disease spreading may be affected by local information that makes individuals aware of the health status of their social contacts, allowing them to reconsider maintaining or not their social contacts. Here we investigate the impact of such a dynamical network structure on disease dynamics, where infection occurs along the edges of the network. To this end, we define an endogenous network dynamics coupled with disease spreading. We show that the effective infectiousness of a disease taking place along the edges of this temporal network depends on the population size, the number of infected individuals in the population and the capacity of healthy individuals to sever contacts with the infected, ultimately dictated by availability of information regarding each individual's health status.

Its temporal contact structure allows, however, for a variable number of overall links between individuals, which in turn will depend on the incidence of disease in the population. This way, infection proceeds along the links of a contact network whose structure may change based on each individual's health status and the availability of information regarding the health status of others. We shall assume the existence of some form of local information about the health status of social contacts. Information is local, in the sense that individual behavior will rely on the nature of their links in the contact network. Moreover, this will influence the way in which individuals may be more or less effective in avoiding contact with those infected while remaining in touch with the healthy. Suppose all individuals seek to establish links at the same rate c. For simplicity, we assume that new links are established and removed randomly, a feature which usually does not always apply in real cases, where the limited social horizon of individuals or the nature of their social ties may constrain part of their neighborhood structure (see below). Let us further assume that links may be broken off at different rates, based on the nature of the links and the information available about the individuals they connect: Let us denote these rates by b pq for links of type pq (p , q 2 fS, I, Rg.

Epidemic reporting of a disease is a fundamental event in understanding two key parameters in epidemiology, namely, epidemic diffusion within a population and growth at a population level. Normally, for a real-time epidemic, the reporting of cases is rarely complete, especially if the epidemic is new or symptoms are unknown or are yet to be discovered. For viruses with shorter incubation periods without virus shedding during the incubation period, any delay in reporting or lack of reporting could lead to a severe epidemic due to the absence of control measures. For example, for the Ebola virus, the average incubation period is between 2 and 21 days, and an individual diagnosed with the Ebola virus does not spread the virus to others during this period. If some of these individuals with Ebola are not diagnosed (and hence not reported to health care facilities) then after 21 days, these individuals will (unknowingly) spread the virus to others. There are other viruses whose incubation period is short but they are contagious during this period, for example, influenza.

Because pneumonia often has an atypical presentation in the elderly in which respiratory symptoms may be subtle or absent, diagnosis can be delayed and lead to increased morbidity and mortality for elderly individuals, a group that is already more likely to be hospitalized, have a longer length of stay when hospitalized, and have a prolonged recovery that is often accompanied by subsequent debilitation or decline in performance status despite successful therapy. Elderly individuals who dwell in chronic care facilities are especially likely to develop pneumonia due to debilitation and colonization of the upper airway with pathogenic bacteria.",21.483573047929106,12.67381058436094

Different epidemic models are then formulated by varying the rules that permit hosts to transition from one state to another. For example, a very common model is the SI, where nodes can pass only from S to I. In the SIS models, infected nodes are allowed to roll back to the susceptible state without gaining immunity (I → S) according to a certain probability, which enables a disease to cycle in a host population by re-infecting individuals that have recovered from a previous infection. Simulating individuals gaining permanent or temporary immunity requires the addition of a third compartment that sees nodes removed from the network (I → R), which creates more complex models, such as the SIR and the SIRS (note that, besides immunization, the R status may indicate the death of a node) (Pastor-Satorras et al., 2015).",20.974632200091108,8.572713534803349

Firstly, an increase in the viral loads as disease progresses could be an important factor. Despite limited evidence about the viral shedding kinetics of MERS-CoV over the disease course, it is expected that viral load increases with disease progression up to a point [21]. Therefore, it seems plausible that close contacts in Hospital B were exposed to a higher infective dose than those in Hospital A. In addition, worsening respiratory symptoms and the consequent need for respiratory procedures during the later stage of disease could facilitate viral transmission [2223]. Since the index case received nebulizer therapy in a six-bed room, aerosols generated by the nebulizer might amplify viral transmission to those who shared the room in Hospital B. The shorter incubation period and rapid disease progression among secondary cases in Hospital B are consistent with these explanations. In contrast, individuals in Hospital A might have been exposed to different levels of viral loads depending on when and for how long they were exposed during the disease progression in the first week of illness of the index case. These differences in exposure can partly explain the wide range of incubation periods and diverse clinical features among secondary cases in Hospital A. Secondly, underlying comorbidities in secondary cases can affect the explosive nature of transmission and the clinical consequences. Given that the index patient was hospitalized in the pulmonary ward in Hospital B, a large proportion of affected patients had underlying pulmonary diseases. This comorbidity combined with a high infective dose could exacerbate the disease progression, resulting in the high mortality among secondary cases in Hospital B.",22.02741089137409,10.902585783950535

Some studies have shown the potential for AGP alternatives to mitigate a health challenge (Bhandari et al., 2008; Gebru et al., 2010; Heo et al., 2010); benefits of AGP alternatives to animal health during a disease challenge would be of great interest to the swine industry. Thus far, the impact of specific AGP alternatives in the presence of particular pathogens is not well understood, and information about health status is mostly absent in published AGP alternative studies (Schweer et al., 2017a). Documentation of the pathogens present in a group of pigs that may influence the outcome of a study will help to build an understanding of how AGP alternatives may perform under varying health conditions. In this study, the collection of oral fluid and serum samples as well as necropsies of pigs that died allowed for the identification or exclusion of critical pathogens, including PRRSV, as influential factors in this group of pigs. Collection and testing of diagnostic samples, especially at the beginning and end of a study, can be used to assess and document pathogen exposure. If clinical signs of illness are observed, additional samples should be collected, based on the symptoms, to characterize the illness.

The underlying assay premise is that these activities are directly proportional to viable cell number after a treatment period. During relatively short incubation periods (8 hr or less), a reduction or complete cessation of these biomarker activities is strongly indicative of overt cytotoxicity by catastrophic membrane damage (i.e. primary necrosis) [11]. A reduction in biomarker activity compared to control in longer incubations indicates either a reduction in normal cellular division rate (cell-cycle arrest) or cell death by programmed elimination mechanisms such as apoptosis [12, 13].

Instead, the participants could choose themselves when to run the app which might have biased some to choose a particularly 'interesting' day when they are going to meet a lot of people, or travel somewhere unusual. In addition, the participants themselves were not sampled at random from the population but instead chose to take part. How they heard about the study might might have varied from whether they were reached through social media in the drive to recruit participants before broadcast, or consequent to watching the BBC4 programme, or through hearing about it from friends -all of which could lead to selection bias. Given the big social media exposure around the citizen science project, our participants were recruited largely in two time periods: in October 2017 after the launch of the app, and in March 2018 after the airing of the documentary 'Contagion! The BBC4 Pandemic', but the uneven recruitment of participants over time should not have much impact. There is evidence, at least among school-aged children, that social contact structure during term-time is relatively consistent over a period of several months [19] . Contacts can also change between term-time and school-holidays [8] and with the health status of participants; individuals typically make fewer social contacts when they have ILI compared to a normal day [28] ].

Within each compartment, all individuals are identical. The transitions between different compartments depend on the specific transition rates. For example, the transmission rate β represents the infection probability for a susceptible individual that encounters an infectious person, and the recovery rate µ represents the probability with which an infectious individual is recovered. If the disease could not endow recovered persons with a long lasting immunity but infect them again, e.g., seasonal flu, asthma, gonorrhoea, the related epidemic reactions are well described by the so called SIS model; otherwise, if recovered people become immune permanently to the disease, e.g., pandemic influenza, pertussis, smallpox, the epidemic dynamics can be characterized by the SIR model properly.

This window size was chosen because the incubation period of influenza can be up to 3.6 days [18] followed by an onset of symptoms and transmission period of the virus, which can last up to 10 days in hospital [19] [20] [21] . This means a patient could be contagious for up to 14 days following infection. Accounting for the incubation period, a secondary patient could show symptoms ∼ 18 days after the infection of the index case. Therefore, the averaging window size was chosen to be 21 days as this allows for some leeway.",14.87507178955277,11.723756906395653

Our estimate of point prevalence varies proportionally to the error in deaths. Deaths due to infection not reported will cause an underestimate in prevalence. Estimating true mortality rates is difficult, and our estimate varies with the reciprocal of the error in the mortality rate. Underestimating mortality will lead to increase in predicted cases. As shown in Figure 3 due to this our model is relatively robust for an error in case fatality ratio 4-10%, which is comparable to reported case fatality ratio estimates. This is an evolving pandemic and due to the long incubation and time to death periods only a short period of point prevalence's can be estimated. Especially during the incubation period it's possible for those infected with SARS-CoV2 to travel into Italy, meaning cases predicted may not have acquired the infection in Italy. 5 All rights reserved.

This finding has significant implications for cities like Singapore, Japan and London which are beginning to experience the first signs of spread of the disease without importation.

Compared to classical ODE models of epidemic spread, microsimulations have the advantage of a better representation of epidemiologically relevant heterogeneity in the population. In addition, the description of the individual disease progression can be used to study the impact of complex countermeasures such as extensive backtracking, testing and quarantine. The model is a non-Markov stochastic process in continuous time based on the infection probability of susceptibles in contact with infected individuals. The contact structure outside of households is represented as an inhomogeneous directed random graph where each node corresponds to an infected individual and the degree of that node corresponds to the number of secondary infections created by that individual. The degree itself depends on how long the individual stays infectious (infectivity time). Population structure: Our sample population is based on the census data on the census data (2011) as well as more recent official statistics (2019) from Poland 17-19 and a synthetic reproduction of the microcensus in Germany (2014) 9 (see Appendix A) and involves age and household composition.

Since we focus on a conceptual question, more detailed structures like spatial assignment, gender, profession or comorbidity relevant health status are omitted.

We use a previous framework for the study of epidemics in structured metapopulations, with heterogeneous agents, subjected to recurrent mobility patterns [7, 17, 10, 18] .To understand the geographical diffusion of the disease, as a result of human-human interactions in small geographical patches, one has to combine the contagion process with the long-range disease propagation due to human mobility across different spatial scales. For the case of epidemic modeling, the metapopulation scenario is as follows. A population is distributed in a set of patches, being the size (number of individuals) of each patch in principle different. The individuals within each patch are well-mixed, i.e., pathogens can be transmitted from an infected host to any of the healthy agents placed in the same patch with the same probability. The second aspect of our metapopulation model concerns the mobility of agents. Each host is allowed to change its current location and occupy another patch, thus fostering the spread of pathogens at the system level. Mobility of agents between different patches is usually represented in terms of a network where nodes are locations while a link between two patches represents the possibility of moving between them.",11.815948808486155,7.958410948021424

This relationship is thought to arise in part through changes in gene regulation, which mediate the genomic response to physiological signals of social stress (e.g., glucocorticoids, adrenaline, noradrenaline; (6, 7) ). Gene expression signatures of social status and social adversity have now been reported in multiple studies, encompassing clinical and population-based samples in humans, and studies of both experimental and natural populations in other social animals (6, (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (see also (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) for evidence in social insects and other social vertebrates).

This quantity, defined for SIR metapopulation models, gives us the expected time that it would take for the disease to reach each subpopulation of the system, also known as the hitting time. In Figure 3 , we compare the hitting time obtained from stochastic simulations of the SEIR metapopulation model with the theoretical distances derived for the simplified SIR model. We can see that the correlation is nearly perfect, implying that the spreading itself is quite similar in both models. However, we find that the hitting times in the SEIR implementation are at least two times larger than the theoretical ones for the SIR scenario (on its turn, stochastic simulations of the SIR model agree very well with the theoretical expectations for the model, see appendix C). Thus, the addition of the latent state produces a substantial delay on the spreading of the epidemic. This is in line with the fact that the epidemic is thought to have started in mid-November or early December, however, a noticeable number of cases was only reported by early January. Figure 4 shows the expected hitting time for each province when the disease starts from 5 different locations, as well as one case with seeds in multiple places, as obtained from the SEIR metapopulation model. As before, the hitting times might seem long, but this is due to the long latent periods of the disease, in agreement with the evolution of reported cases in mainland China. We also note that Spanish major cities are expected to be affected by the outbreak in no more than 40 days −but often within 20 days− from the initial time in all the situations considered. Indeed, to mimic the situation in the country as of February 28th, 2020, and to make projections about the evolution of the disease into the future, we considered the scenario in which the model is initialized with infected individuals in the capital of each region where there are cases of COVID19: Madrid, Tenerife, Barcelona, Balearic Islands, Zaragoza, Seville and Valencia [15] . The results show that the spreading is much faster (note that the outer circle in the 5 individual provinces represents 60 days while in this case it represents only 40 days) in such a situation.",12.569023937745943,7.37948108491045

If temporally separate exposures independently tap into the same gene regulatory mechanisms, then the genome can be viewed as a mosaic, in which some loci retain more of a long-term signature of social history than others. This perspective is consistent with studies of organism-level traits. For example, in nonhuman primate models of social stress, behavioral signatures of status are highly plastic with changes in dominance rank, whereas the development of coronary artery plaques are explained by the combination of present and past social status (59, 60) . A key contribution of genomic approaches rests in their ability to compare levels of plasticity across thousands of traits simultaneously. Such studies promise to reveal which pathways are more important for encoding memory versus sensing the current environment-an important step towards understanding the molecular mechanisms that affect resilience and recovery.",13.064049106177228,6.913403135009396

Chronic social stress is thought to generate a proinflammatory state characterized by elevated antibacterial defenses and reduced investment in antiviral defense. Here, we manipulated long-term social status in female rhesus macaques to show that social subordination alters the gene expression response to ex vivo bacterial and viral challenge. As predicted by current models, bacterial lipopolysaccharide polarizes the immune response such that low status corresponds to higher expression of genes in NF-κBdependent pro-inflammatory pathways and lower expression of genes involved in the antiviral response and type I interferon (IFN) signaling. Counter to predictions, however, low status drives more exaggerated expression of both NF-κB and IFN-associated genes after cells are exposed to the viral mimic Gardiquimod. Status-driven gene expression patterns are not only linked to social status at the time of sampling, but also to social history (i.e., past social status), especially in unstimulated cells. However, for a subset of genes, we observed interaction effects in which females who fell in rank were more strongly affected by current social status than those who climbed the social hierarchy. Together, our results indicate that the effects of social status on immune cell gene expression depend on pathogen exposure, pathogen type, and social history -in support of social experience-mediated biological embedding in adulthood, even in the conventionally memory-less innate immune system.",11.967265514556498,5.322335920540866
