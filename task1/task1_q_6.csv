For many young patients, hip replacement cannot be expected to last the patient's lifetime. Therefore, attempts should be made to save the femoral head prior to collapse. Conservative treatment is only recommended for patients in preliminary stages of ONFH when symptoms are not significant. The outcome is usually poor with this option, due to the natural history of ONFH [13] . Core decompression is a less invasive surgery and theoretically interrupts the process of ONFH to heal the femoral head [14] . However, conflicting clinical results and the variable natural history of ONFH make interpretation of these studies difficult. The osteotomy was reported to have favourable results in treating ONFH [15] . However, the success of the osteotomy is related to the extent and location of the necrotic lesions. The complication of the osteotomy, such as shortening of the leg and gait abnormalities, remains a concern [16] . Free vascularised fibular grafting is an appealing alternative to core decompression for treatment of ONFH, especially for patients with subchondral bone collapse. During the procedure, the necrotic bone is excised, which may interrupt the cycle of ischaemia and intraosseous hypertension and promote local revascularisation. Then the defect is filled with osteoinductive graft to support the subchondral surface. After the surgery, a period of limited weightbearing benefits the healing construct. Yoo et al. reviewed 81 hips that received FVFG, with a mean follow-up period of 5.2 years and found that 71% had radiological improvement [17] . Judet and Gilbert assessed 68 hips with an average follow-up of 18 years, and found that good results were achieved in 80% of the patients [18] .

By contrast, we found a significant association between AdV presence and faecal microbiota composition in M. natalensis (PERMANOVA: p = 0.001), but this coincided with the effect of sampling session, as bats were found shedding AdVs only in November. Therefore, it is difficult to conclude if there was an interaction between AdV shedding in faeces and the faecal microbiota composition. Finally, as noted with the urinary microbiota diversity, we also found a strong correlation between Leptospira shedding (measured by RT-PCR) and urinary microbiota composition in M. natalensis (PERMANOVA: p = 0.001). LEfSe analysis confirmed that Leptospira RT-PCR positive samples were enriched in Leptospira but also in Illumatobacter, while 31 other phylotypes, including Clostridium sensu stricto and unclassified Bacillales, were predominantly associated with negative samples. Altogether, our results suggested no interaction between DNA virus shedding dynamics and shift of bacterial microbiota in bats. To our knowledge, interactions between virus dynamics and microbiota have never been demonstrated in wild animals, but recent field studies have reported an association between microbiota composition and other types of parasites, such as in frogs naturally infected by the chytrid fungus [54] , rodents parasitized by multiple helminths [55] or even bats for which invasion by the fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans leads to a shift in the skin microbiota [56] . Moreover, experimental studies performed in mice, using RNA viruses, have shown interactions with the microbiota, through diverse effects such as pathogen inhibition, co-aggregation and regulation of the immune system and metabolism [2] . Our lack of interaction for herpes-and adenoviruses may be due to the fact that other aspects of the microbiome (other than bacteria) could interact with viral infection. These viruses are also both DNA viruses capable of latency and reactivation at the individual level, and thus may be more involved in long-lasting changes of the microbiota and the modulation of immune functions [57] . Further investigations, targeting virus pool dynamics in bats and specifically RNA viruses, will assist in determining how transient and chronic infections may interact with the dynamics of microbiota composition.

Rabbits developed both upper and lower respiratory tract infection upon MERS-CoV inoculation [15] , either via intranasal or combined intranasal and intratracheal routes, in line with the localization of DPP4 in their respiratory tract epithelium. The amount of viral RNA being shed by the inoculated rabbits during the first three days post inoculation is almost as high as that of the MERS-CoV-inoculated dromedary camels [31, 32] . However, none of the direct contact and airborne-exposed rabbits developed any clinical signs, shed significant levels of viral RNA, shed infectious virus, nor did they seroconvert. One possible reason for this lack of transmission is the limited amount of infectious virus being shed by the inoculated rabbits [21] . Previous studies have shown that in the nasal and lung tissues of experimentally infected rabbits, infectious virus was generally detected in a limited amount despite the abundant presence of viral RNA and virus nucleoprotein [15, 21] . Alternatively, low levels of infectious virus transmitted to recipient animals may be unable to initiate a productive infection due to the presence of host proteins that restrict replication. Comparable to rabbits, MERS-CoV-infected pigs and goats develop minimal clinical signs, hardly shed infectious virus, and barely spread the virus to naïve animals [28, 33] . In contrast, MERS-CoV-infected dromedary camels develop nasal discharge and shed a high amount infectious virus (10 4 -10 5 TCID 50 /mL), almost equal to the amount of viral RNA being shed (10 5 -10 6 GE/mL), during the first 4 days post inoculation [31, 32] . These interspecies differences may indicate presence of nasal discharge and infectious virus shedding as critical factors in MERS-CoV transmission. In humans, levels of infectious virus shed by MERS-CoV patients have rarely been reported. However, MERS-CoV patients that transmit the virus have been shown to shed a higher amount of viral RNA in their swabs compared to those that do not, supporting the quantity of virus shed as an important factor in the transmission of MERS-CoV between humans [34] . For influenza A viruses, infectious virus shedding has been documented as one of the main determinants of airborne virus transmission. Using ferrets as an animal model, it has been reported that a reduction in infectious virus shedding in the nasal swabs can subsequently limit virus transmission [35] [36] [37] .",17.634632817647343,7.776044818867763

A remarkable feature of the isolated iVDRV is their changes in cytocidal characteristics in tissue culture of cells derived from fibroblasts, presumably an initial target of RA27/3 replication after subcutaneous vaccination. Notably, RA27/3 was cytopathic in fibroblasts whereas wt RV strains were not cytopathic in most cell types tested, including fibroblasts, and establish long-term persistent infections [21, 50] . Unfortunately, no easily available animal model for rubella virus pathology exists and thus extending these tissue culture results will likely require natural history studies in both PID patients and normal individuals Infectious vaccine-derived rubella viruses in immunodeficiencies vaccinated with RA27/3. Changes in tissue tropism of iVDRVs would be a significant observation, especially if evidence of transmission to normal individuals is found. Whole genome sequencing revealed that each of the recovered viruses contained multiple predominantly virus-specific nucleotide and amino acid substitutions with respect to RA27/3, which gives a molecular basis for the differences in their biological properties from each other and vaccine virus. Our estimate of the overall evolutionary rate of iVDRV (1.8 x 10 −3 subs/site/ year) based on the whole genome sequences is consistent with evolutionary rates reported for other small RNA viruses [51] and somewhat higher that those reported for wtRV (genotype 1E: 9.16 × 10 −4 -1.04 × 10 −3 subs/site/year) in populations with person-to-person transmission [52] . Higher iVDRV evolution rates may be due to continuous viral replication and selection during chronic infection in a single individual as opposed to intermittent replication and selection during disease outbreaks.",17.38472068020607,8.521690421284404

In addition, patients with mild and unspecific symptoms are also difficult to identify and quarantine. Notably, the absence of fever in SARS-CoV-2 infection (12.1%) is more frequent than in SARS-CoV (1%) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV; 2%) infection [6] . In light of this, the effectiveness of using fever detection as the surveillance method should be reviewed. However, based on previous studies of influenza viruses and community-acquired human coronaviruses, the viral loads in asymptomatic carriers are relatively low [9] . If this is also the case for SARS-CoV-2, the risk should remain low. Studies on the natural history of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans are urgently needed. Identifying a cohort of asymptomatic carriers in Wuhan and following their viral loads, clinical presentations and antibody titers over a time course will provide clues as to how many of the subjects have symptoms in a later phase, whether virus shedding from the subjects is indeed less robust, and how often they might transmit SARS-CoV-2 to others.",33.81525892576679,14.469626568718619

In the present study we demonstrated that Bactrian camels are also susceptible to infection with MERS-CoV and, like dromedary camels [10, 13] , shed large quantities of infectious virus in nasal secretions. Moreover, the virus shedding kinetics of MERS-CoV in Bactrian camels was virtually identical to previous experimental studies in dromedary camels. Similar to infections reported in both naturally and experimentally infected dromedaries, infected Bactrian camels displayed only minor clinical disease characterized by mild to moderate quantities of nasal discharge. The limitation of this study was use of only two animals and of those, only one was monitored for seroconversion. Nonetheless, the susceptibility and the magnitude and pattern of nasal virus shedding was nearly identical in both animals and clearly demonstrated that Bactrian camels are susceptible to MERS-CoV. The susceptibility of the Bactrian camel to MERS-CoV suggests a general pattern of susceptibility in new and old-world camelids. Experimental infections in camelids have resulted in productive infection and shedding of MERS-CoV [10, [14] [15] [16] , in contrast to other livestock species such as goat, sheep, pigs and horses where either no or very limited infection was observed [16, 25, 26] .

In addition, upon experimental MERS-CoV transmission studies with alpaca, although transmission between infected animal and contact animal occurred, the contact animal had 2 log lower virus shedding than the inoculated animals.

The other three (HIV-1, HIV-2, and HCV) have fast rates of within-host evolution, but may bypass short-sighted evolution through the maintenance and preferential transmission of a subpopulation of viruses that retain the transmissibility of the TF virus that initiated the infection (a 'germline' lineage).",19.460740893274625,7.995584551708427

Other delays between events in the natural history of infection (e.g. exposure, onset of symptoms, hospitalization and recovery or death) also affect disease transmission or have implications for control [43, 67] . Delays from symptom onset to recovery (or death) will determine the required duration of health-care and case isolation. The incubation period (the delay between infection and symptom onset of a case) and the extent to which infectiousness precedes symptom onset will determine the feasibility and effectiveness of contact tracing or prophylaxis [43] .

There is still no vaccine against HIV while the results for Ebola vaccine trials are encouraging (204, 205 ). An Ebola vaccine should help to prevent the spread of disease in countries where the epidemic is rife (206) . Due to inadequate hygiene conditions (lack of drinkable water, lack of sewerage), bacterial, viral and parasitic intestinal infections are common, but they are rarely serious and most of them can be treated fairly easily. However, this can become a serious medical problem if the infected individual is sick in a rural area far away from any hospital. Regarding NHP caged in zoos, primate centers, and laboratories, the pathogens can be transmitted by scratches, bites, percutaneous inoculation, or contact with body fluids. In these working environments, (i) professionals have a good knowledge of the risks; (ii) the risk is limited because animals are subject to preimport surveillance and post-import quarantine (e.g., in Europe Council Directive 92/65/EEC of 13 July 1992 laying down animal health requirements governing trade in and imports) (207); (iii) the workers adopt preventives measures (e.g., vaccine), and laboratory biosafety equipment with protective masks, glasses, gloves (208) ; and, (iv) prophylaxis actions are rapidly set up after an incident. In these workplaces, the pathogen is easy to identify because: (i) NHP are caged; (ii) the natural history of the animal involved in the incident is known; (iii) all NHP have regular veterinary and serological monitoring; (iv) the animal can be placed in quarantine and be subject to enhanced biological and veterinary surveillance. However, cases of accidental transmission of Marburg virus and Cercopithecine herpesvirus to laboratory staff should not be forgotten (179, 192) . These accidents should serve as examples to strictly apply the precautionary principle in laboratories. Another source of worry comes from in situ NHP recovery centers, such as the Pan African sanctuary Alliance (209) in Africa or Wildlife Alliance in Asia (210) , where there exist primate nurseries attended daily by workers and volunteers who come into very close contact with the animals to save them but also share microorganisms. It could become a potential public health problem and a conservation problem when trying to reintroduce these animals in a wild ecosystem. What remains the most difficult biohazard threat to assess is associated with the illegal detention of NHP as pets and tourists contact with NHP during trips (211) . When an incident involves a wild NHP, it is frequently difficult to know the species and natural history of the NHP and the pathogens borne by this wild animal.",18.037877984553162,9.201010453401361

In the present study, we evaluated nine different biologically-or recombinantly-derived APMV strains for the ability to replicate and cause disease in rhesus macaque model. Five of the viruses were: biologically-derived wild type (wt) APMV-2, -3, -5, -7 and -9. Another virus was a recombinant (r) version of wt APMV-4. The remaining three viruses were versions of wt rAPMV-2, -4 and -7 in which the F cleavage site had been modified to be multi-basic. Rhesus macaques were inoculated intranasally and intratracheally and monitored for clinical disease, virus shedding from the upper and lower respiratory tract, and seroconversion.

Thereby, especially in the case of HPAI infection, the vaccination may make the infection less visible and the eradication of virus more difficult, and consequently it may provide a good opportunity for HPAI virus to survive and persist in poultry flocks for a long time. For this reason, we plan to design new nanoparticle constructs that also contain fragments of hemagglutinin in addition to the M2e domain.

This would be analogous to choosing to sequence a virus from a randomly selected infected person at regular temporal intervals, perhaps set by laboratory capacity.

Eight of the nine Group 3 cats controlled virus shedding within three months from the start of the study. The cat with uncontrolled virus shedding remained fecal virus positive throughout the study period, and its colon biopsy was also virus positive. The serological status and RT-PCR results for each group are shown in Table 1 . These groups were anticipated to represent different immunological states that might identify correlates of protection against FECV. Group 1 cats represented an immune naïve or immune quiescent state, while Group 2 cats represented the convalescent phase of the immune response. It was fortuitous to collect colon biopsies on eight cats in Group 3 very near the time that virus replication was controlled, as this presumably provided a snapshot of a successful mucosal immune response to the virus. The average time of observed virus shedding in cats that ultimately controlled virus replication was 2.6 months, and the average time of seropositivity after virus replication was controlled was 2.5 months. These data reveal less about the virus infection kinetics, since this was a study of naturally infected cats, and the actual time of infection was not known. More can be concluded about the systemic immune response, which waned rapidly after virus was cleared.

Indeed, a pro-survival autophagic response that removes toxic protein aggregates and dampens virus replication might be critical for promoting viral persistence at the cellular level in natural hosts, maintaining the potential to shed virus with minimal disease presentation.

The matrix with the target virus may contain inhibitors that could prevent the assay from working.

Close contact is defined as encountering a patient without appropriate protective gear within six feet or being in a care room for prolonged periods or having direct exposure to infected secretions. Healthcare facilities have reported spread from person-to-person much more so than in communities, possibly when suboptimal infection control was practiced for patients with higher viral loads than those not hospitalized. 7 Reported cases have been linked to countries in and near the Arabian Peninsula either for persons who live in, have traveled to, or have had contact with an infected person who had been in the region. MERS is a zoonotic virus that is transmitted from animals to humans. It is believed to have originated in bats and then to have been transmitted to camels sometime in the distant past. According to epidemiologic and surveillance data, there is a strong likelihood that dromedary (one-hump) camels ( Figure 2 ) serve as a reservoir for zoonotic transmission of the virus to humans. 8 This has resulted in warnings to avoid close contact with camels and not drink raw camel milk or urine, or ingest raw camel meat.",28.0430692612235,12.152189839153138

To induce MDA in a subset of piglets, two sows received a cell culture-adapted PEDV strain, and another two sows were inoculated with field material from German PED outbreaks. Four sows stayed naïve. Subsequently, all piglets were inoculated with the corresponding PEDV strains at an age of 3 to 6 days, and virus shedding, clinical signs and occurrence of specific antibodies were assessed. Piglets without MDA showed a morbidity of 100% and low lethality, while almost all MDA-positive piglets stayed clinically healthy and showed considerably lower virus shedding.

The approach taken here to modelling household transmission is to study a three-level hierarchical model of transmission. The three levels are within-host, within-household, and between households. The natural history of infection is described by the individual infectiousness function b (t, t). I assume in this section that individuals are homogenous in infectiousness and susceptibility.

We can make two hypotheses in this regard: the first is that viral shedding is truly intermittent, and the second is that viral shedding in semen is continuous but that the quantity of PEDV RNA is sometimes too low to be detected by RT-qPCR. Intermittent shedding of porcine viruses has already been shown for PCV2, CSF and PRRSV [29, [37] [38] [39] [40] . We also observed that shedding of PEDV in semen appeared before shedding in feces and prior to the onset of the clinical signs. This is consistent with the data reported for other porcine viruses, such as CSFV and Aujeszky's disease virus, which showed viral excretion occurring in semen before the development of clinical signs [21] . Therefore, boars infected by PEDV may be detected after delivery of potentially infected semen. Consequently, specific control measures should be implemented for breeding pigs before semen or boars are imported. This may include the control of seroconversion and control of the absence of previous virus shedding in feces and reporting clinical signs. Implementing these types of measures is particularly important because we have demonstrated that PEDV RNA can be detected in semen even when the boars no longer shed virus in feces and do not show any clinical signs.

Depending on the type of the infectious disease and the timing of the outbreak, the prioritization and the specific details of the preventive measures will vary. In instances of single exposures, as in cases of food poisoning, the mode of transmission should be identified by preserving suspected foods or ensuring that the site of transmission remains intact. However, if the disease spreads through personto-person transmission, prompt and active preventive measures need to be taken. For infectious diseases spread by person-toperson transmission, each patient is a source of infection, and it is therefore important to identify suspected cases as soon as possible and to treat them in isolation. Some diseases are transmitted during the incubation period, while other diseases are transmitted only after the onset of symptoms. The period of infectiousness as well as the natural history of a disease should be taken into consideration when implementing preventive measures. Infectious diseases such as the common cold and influenza are transmitted before the onset of symptoms, making it dif-ficult and inefficient to identify and quarantine people who have been exposed. However, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and MERS are known to be infectious only after the onset of symptoms, not during the incubation period; therefore, actively identifying contacts to be monitored and close contacts to be quarantined can be an effective measure for preventing the spread of this disease [6, 7] . In order to carry out such measures, it is necessary to obtain information about the contact history of confirmed cases. It is also important to properly disinfect areas where confirmed cases have been present in order to eliminate the possibility of further infection [6] .",20.249000917393545,9.295848075232408

The virus spreads through fecal-oral routes, such as via contaminated water, food, and people's contaminated hands. 12, 13 Published studies indicate that infections associated with environmental contaminants are mainly caused by contaminated water or foods (especially oysters), 11 accounting for seasonal outbreaks that are frequently observed in winter. 14 Given these features, workers who are directly engaged in cooking and handling of foods, such as cooks, food servers, and food factory workers, are considered as one of the key subjects for prevention of secondary transmissions. [15] [16] [17] One of the notable virological features of noroviruses is genotype variation, which is divided into five genogroups and many genotypes in each genogroup. 18 As of 2017, the most prevalent genotype in humans is GII. 4, 19, 20 which accounts for as many as 80% of all reported norovirus infections with virus isolation. 21 Some pieces of evidence indicate that this genotype evolves rapidly, escaping from selection pressure. 22, 23 In Japan, the majority of outbreaks are caused by genogroup II, and a large proportion is caused by GII.4. 24 GII.4-associated epidemics in Japan were first observed in 2006, and the genotype has been continuously observed every year since then. 25 To decipher the most effective preventive measures against this virus, it is vital to quantitatively clarify the natural history characteristics, including asymptomatic ratio, the risk of infection per exposure, and the probability of virus shedding. Nevertheless, explicit estimates are very scarce, except for rigorous challenge studies that helped quantify the natural history 5, 26 ; moreover, it is unclear if the natural history of experimentally infected individuals are similar to those based on natural infection. A small number of mathematical modelling studies estimated a part of the abovementioned values, 27-30 but explicit model-based estimates of the asymptomatic ratio have yet to be offered. The present study aims to estimate the asymptomatic ratio of norovirus infection, reanalyzing foodborne outbreak data with laboratory testing in Japan, along with other parameters, including virus shedding frequency and the risk of infection. In addition to estimating the asymptomatic ratio for all noroviruses, the present study also compares the estimate across different genogroups and genotypes.",31.23723989291183,11.713082461030455

Real-time monitoring of parameters describing disease natural history and fraction of asymptomatic cases is generally not necessary since they are mostly dependent on the intrinsic genomic features of the virus.

The effectiveness of screening depends on several factors, including pathogen natural history and epidemiology, human behavior, and characteristics of the source epidemic. We developed a mathematical model to understand how these factors combine to influence screening outcomes. We analyzed screening programs for six emerging pathogens in the early and late stages of an epidemic. We show that the effectiveness of different screening tools depends strongly on pathogen natural history and epidemiological features, as well as human factors in implementation and compliance. For pathogens with longer incubation periods, exposure risk detection dominates in growing epidemics, while fever becomes a better target in stable or declining epidemics. For pathogens with short incubation, fever screening drives detection in any epidemic stage.

Firstly, we did not use the detailed data of the SARS-CoV-2 to perform the estimation instead of using the data from literatures [3] . We simulated the natural history of the infection that the proportion of asymptomatic infection was 50%, and the transmissibility of asymptomatic infection was half of that of symptomatic infection, which were different to those of MERS and SARS. It is known that the proportion of asymptomatic infection of MERS and SARS was lower than 10%. Secondly, the parameters of population mobility were not from an accurate dataset. Thirdly, since there was no data of the initial prevalence of the virus in the seafood market, we assumed the initial value of 1/100 000. This assumption might lead to the simulation been under-or over-estimated. In addition, since we did not consider the changing rate of the individual's activity (such as wearing masks, increasing social distance, and not to travel to Wuhan City), the estimation of importation of the virus might not be correct.

[50] reported a similar design strategy as that of Shirvani et al. [48] but modified the IBV S protein and rescued three recombinant LaSota strains. Immune-protection experiments show that candidate vaccines can alleviate the severity of clinical symptoms but does not reduce virus shedding. However, prime-boost immunization with rNDV expressing wild-type IBV S protein can significantly reduce tracheal virus shedding after IBV attack. In contrast, our study found that rNDV-IBV-T/B vaccination strongly protected the chickens, as well as significantly inhibited IBV virus shedding, while also maintaining trachea ciliary activity. This is probably due to the high level of neutralizing antibodies elicited by the IBV multi-epitope vaccine effectively neutralizing the virus. Toro et al. employed the prime-boost immunization strategy to evaluate the efficacy of the recombinant NDV vaccine, rLS/IBV.S2. The results demonstrated that overexposing IBV S2 to the chicken immune system by means of a vectored vaccine, followed by boosting with the whole virus, protects chickens against heterologous IBV [56] . This strategy is a practical immunization procedure applied to protect against various pathogens [57] . This study shows that rNDV-IBV-T/B vaccine could cross-protect against the heterologous IBV M41 strain and indicates that the potency of the rNDV-IBV-T/B could perhaps facilitate the simplified immunization procedures and reduce the production cost.

Our results showed that the S protein, which contains both S1 and S2 proteins, is the best protective antigen of IBV. The S2 protein lacks major neutralizing epitopes which are present in the S1 protein, hence it is not an effective antigen. The S1 protein contains major neutralizing epitopes, but it losses some conformational epitopes when expressed separately. Although in the first study we showed that rNDV expressing S protein provided enhanced protection, it could not reduce virus shedding, indicating that we needed to determine whether the elimination of virus shedding would probably require a much higher level of immune response than that is induced by rNDV expressing S protein or would require the optimization of the IBV protection study.

Indeed, assessing the ability of an MVA-vectored MERS-CoV vaccine to protect camels against contained MERS-CoV challenge required administering multiple doses by both intramuscular and intranasal routes to significantly reduce virus shedding 36 . Therefore, protective effects of vaccine administered by either the intranasal or intramuscular route should be assessed. Of note, we show here that in older seronegative camels, nAbs in nasal secretions were induced after a single intramuscular vaccination of ChAdOx1 MERS, but cannot rule out the possibility that these camels had previously been exposed to MERS-CoV despite proving seronegative on entry to the study, and the effects of intramuscular boosting after initial mucosal priming may be different from intramuscular priming of truly MERS-naive camels.

However, considering the possibility of indirect transmission via virus shedding into the environment [19, 20] , some researchers have suggested that people who share space and time with a patient should also be included in the quarantine group despite the lack of direct contact. During the early phase of the MERS outbreak in South Korea, quarantine was mainly confined to people who had come into close contact (within 2 m) with an infected person, but this has limited effects in protecting against MERS outbreaks in some hospitals [11, 12, 16] . During an outbreak, most hospitals try to isolate all people who have shared space and time with MERS patients based on this belief. However, this strategy does not include the possibility of indirect transmission via medical employees' body or hands, which may mean that some infected people are excluded from the initial isolation process because there was no discernible contact with patients or spatial or time overlap. In contrast to the community setting, more frequent contact may occur between HCPs, patients and others in the hospital setting. Nosocomial infection may involve the transmission of a pathogen via direct contact between medical staff and other patients.

Infectious camels were not removed from the pen after co-housing to mimic natural conditions. Even under these stringent conditions one camel in group +V demonstrated complete absence of virus shedding, with two others (out of a total of 5) in the same group shedding extremely low levels of virus, indicating that high levels of protective immunity can be achieved. Importantly, this group had high level of nAbs that plateaued for a year, unlike the +C group that had decreasing nAb titres overtime. These results suggest that vaccinating seropositive camels with S-based vaccine could boost their pre-existing MERS-specific immunity and minimise viral shedding.

Thus, it is expected that most nAbs detected by MERSpp neutralization assay bind to RBD or close to the binding site in a manner that blocks binding to the DPP4 cellular receptor, although the binding sites of nAbs detected in the pseudotyped virus neutralization assay have not been determined per se. Nonetheless, non-neutralising S-specific Abs could also interfere with MERS-CoV entry and fusion in a similar manner to stem-specific anti-influenza hemagglutinin Abs 38 , but this has not yet been assessed for MERS-CoV. Similarly, S1-based ELISA have shown excellent correlation with live virus neutralization assay although both nAbs as well as non-neutralising binding Abs could be detected by ELISA 39, 40 . In the current study, we found that induction of S1-binding non-neutralising Abs alone is insufficient to reduce viral shedding and only the presence of nAbs can minimise virus excretion. Nonetheless, previous studies suggest that only presence of high levels on nAb titres may provide sterilising immunity in dromedaries as even seropositive camels could be re-infected as nAbs wane over time [25] [26] [27] [28] .

Thus, although an association with AGE was not achieved for HBoV2 in the most rigorous univariant analysis so further conclusions require caution until additional data are available, it is persuasive that an association with AGE was achieved for HBoV2 in the same data analysis (pooled case samples) in which significance was achieved for adenovirus and NoV GII, the role of which as pathogens causing AGE is not disputed [37] . HBoV2, at 17.2%, was the third most prevalent virus after rotavirus (39.2%) and astrovirus (21.5%), and was greater than that for NoV GII (13.4%) and adenovirus (4.8%). Two further factors may be influencing the prevalence rates for HBoV2 we have detected in both cases and controls. Firstly, S phase synchronized replication observed for other parvoviruses may also be applicable for HBoV2, in which case delayed and perhaps cyclical or pulsed shedding of HBoV2 during infection may result, consistent with our finding that 10 cases (31.2% of positive cases) had detectable virus only in their second sample. Therefore, the statistical association in the pooled sample data may better reflect the true disease association. Secondly, long term virus shedding post-infection, which is increasingly being recognized for other enteric viruses such as NoV GII [38] , may also account for asymptomatic carriage among the controls. However, until the natural history of HBoV2 infection is elucidated, the influence of S phase replication and asymptomatic shedding can only be speculative.",21.8439065798705,8.51073225906539

The SARS-CoV Puzzles. One of the difficulties that epidemiologists experienced during the SARS outbreak of 2003-4 was the way the virus spreads. From the way the virus passed between the hosts, it was known that the virus has some ""respiratory"" components already at the beginning of the outbreak. When it was then shown to be a coronavirus, a special attention was paid to possible oral-fecal routes, given the nature of coronaviruses. In fact, there were instances where the spread involved fecal routes, such as in the case of the outbreak at Amoy Gardens in Hong Kong, which involved a spread via the sewerage system [11, 43] . Despite of what was known from the outbreak at Amoy Gardens, the exact modes of SARS-CoV spread remain unclear as of yet [6] . For example, there were many cases where patients were infected without any known contact with an infected person [14] . Therefore, the precise spread mechanisms remain somewhat a mystery, and there are no appropriate animal models for the SARS-CoV transmission modes.",19.63265788849359,8.16881150408246

Using a mathematical model of screening effectiveness, with preliminary estimates of COVID-19 epidemiology and natural history, we estimate that screening will detect less than half of infected travellers in a growing epidemic, and that screening effectiveness will increase marginally as growth of the source epidemic decelerates. We found that two main factors influenced the effectiveness of screening. First, symptom screening depends on the natural history of an infection: individuals are increasingly likely to show detectable symptoms with increasing time since exposure. A fundamental shortcoming of screening is the difficulty of detecting infected individuals during their incubation period, or early after the onset of symptoms, at which point they still feel healthy enough to undertake normal activities or travel. This difficulty is amplified when the incubation period is longer; infected individuals have a longer window in which they may mix socially or travel with low probability of detection. Second, screening depends on whether exposure risk factors exist that would facilitate specific and reasonably sensitive case detection by questionnaire. For COVID-19, there is so far limited evidence for specific risk factors; we therefore assumed that at most 40% of travellers would be aware of a potential exposure. It is plausible that many individuals aware of a potential exposure would voluntarily avoid travel and practice social distancing-if so, the population of infected travellers will be skewed toward those unaware they have been exposed. Furthermore, based on screening outcomes during the 2009 influenza pandemic, we assumed that a minority of infected travellers would selfreport their exposure honestly, which led to limited effectiveness in questionnaire-based screening. The confluence of these two factors led to many infected people being fundamentally undetectable in our model. Even under our most generous assumptions about the natural history of COVID-19, the presence of undetectable cases made the greatest contribution to screening failure. Correctable failures, such as missing an infected person with fever or awareness of their exposure risk, played a more minor role.",31.026101760021806,12.588602486434763

Disease transmission during air travel has 2 Scientifica been a concern for many years. Historically, the spread of nonendemic infectious disease has been linked to air travel contingent on the weather [1] . Specifically, the risk of viremic transmission has been directly related to the magnitude of viremic person-days the arriving traveler spends in the country during the season the ""capable-vector"" is active. For example, the months the Aedes mosquito is active and able to bite viremic air travelers arriving from endemic areas would contribute to disease spread. The Aedes mosquito is found throughout the world except Antarctica. Several species are especially important to note including Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. The Aedes aegypti transmit several flaviviruses including dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya, and Zika. This species cohabitates with humans so it is difficult to eradicate. The Aedes aegypti is a tropical mosquito but the range is slowing expanding to more moderate climes. The Aedes albopictus, known as the Asian Tiger mosquito, has adapted from a northern forest environment to live in suburban areas. After a blood meal females lay eggs in water. Mosquitoes transmit disease mainly by biting an infected person and having their salivary glands infected with the virus, bite a second uninfected person. Aedes albopictus can transmit chikungunya and dengue. The Ohio Department of Health reports that the Aedes aegypti is not established in Ohio but the Asian Tiger mosquito was introduced in the United States in 1985 and has spread through much of the country. With expansion of air travel networks the risk of importing diseases increases from both people and vectors readily connected to endemic malaria regions of the world [2, 3] . However, the actual public health burden of the impact of air travel on infectious disease is not known.",18.544131661199998,11.557042553683335

If some individuals die before they can be admitted to a hospital, they will by definition not become hospitalized. Therefore, even in the absence of any effect of hospitalization on the risk of death, there will be fewer deaths among those hospitalized than among those not hospitalized. We will refer to this bias as ""survivorship bias."" In an ongoing epidemic, there will typically be a delay between the reporting of a case and the reporting of the death of that case, if the infected person dies. Thus, at any moment, there will be some cases reported who will die of the infection but who have not yet died, or whose deaths have not yet been reported. Simple division of the number of deaths reported by week w (green), by the number of cases reported by week w (blue) will underestimate the CFR because the numerator does not include all those cases in the denominator who will eventually die. With a reporting delay of 3 weeks for deaths compared to cases, the reported deaths curve will be shifted 3 weeks to the right, relative to the curve of the total number of cases reported by week w who will die (red). If the epidemic doubling time is 2 weeks, as shown here, the underestimate of CFR will be by a factor of about 2 3/2 2.8, with the exponent being the number of epidemic doubling times that pass between case reporting and death reporting. In reality, there will be a distribution of reporting delays rather than a fixed delay, making this a heuristic rather than exact approach. The problem is ameliorated in an epidemic that grows more slowly or less than exponentially. For more details, see references in Table 1 . This bias can be eliminated using data on the time d since the person became a case. The analysis would then compare the risk of death between those individuals who became Table 2 .

A recent study of the enteric virome in monkeys infected with simian immunodeficiency virus 77 could shed light on the interactions between the GI virome and the immune system. In the study, infection with simian immunodeficiency virus led to expansion of enteric eukaryotic viruses in Rhesus macaques, including picornaviruses, adenoviruses, parvoviruses, circoviruses, and caliciviruses. This virome expansion corresponded with increased gut permeability and ileal epithelial pathology. Interestingly, virome expansion and disease was not observed in simian immunodeficiency virus-infected African green monkeys, which do not develop acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, suggesting that increased virus shedding, and potentially damage to the intestinal wall, is secondary to immunodeficiency.",17.18877880653651,8.283607267422667

This division is similar to the basic structure used in several recent papers on the role of international travel in the spread of infectious diseases (8, 9, 12) . This model structure can be adapted to many airborne infections because it allows for an asymptomatic period, which may or may not be infectious, followed by a potentially symptomatic period during which transmission can also occur. In our stochastic model, events (such as infection or a person leaving the source area) occur by chance. For example, the time after symptom onset at which a person recovers from infection with SARS is not a fi xed quantity; rather, it is a randomly chosen time from an exponential probability distribution with a mean of 10 days. Table 1 shows the average latent and infectious periods used. The probability of leaving the country is constant for all persons ( Table 1) . The probability of a susceptible person becoming infected increases as a larger proportion of the population becomes infected and is chosen so that the average number of new infections caused by each infected person in the early stages of the epidemic is equal to the basic reproductive number R 0 (2.5 for SARS, 1.8 for infl uenza; Table 1 ). The epidemic is simulated by evaluating the probability that any person is infected, becomes symptomatic, or recovers in any short time interval (we divide time into sequential short intervals of one fi ftieth of a day), and then testing whether that event occurs. The simulation can be thought of as generating a random number between 0 and 1 for each person in each time step. If this random number is less than the probability of a particular event occurring to that person, then the event occurs. Otherwise, the person is left in his or her current state. The model does not store the details of every person separately but keeps track of the number of persons who are susceptible (S), latently infected (E), infectious (I), and recovered (R) at any point in time. As events occur, these variables change. For example, when a person becomes infected, S decreases by 1 and E increases by 1. Because the events occur by chance, the total number of persons who are in each state, including the number of infected persons taking fl ights, varies stochastically.",17.839587545579935,7.461428967034014

Three of the farms selected for the investigation were PEDV-free and the piglets from those farms did not shed PEDV before challenge. Therefore, the virus shed after challenge exposure was possibly the same as inoculum with no RFLP marker. Earlier studies report that complete protection from PEDV infection prevents virus shedding after challenge exposure (De Arriba et al., 2002) . High titers of serum antibodies in piglets are related to reduced severity and duration of diarrhea, and shorter period of virus shedding . Accordingly, virus shedding in piglets was assessed after challenge, using RT-PCR. No significant differences in duration of virus shedding were observed between O and IM groups. PEDV shedding may be variable, depending on the sensitivity of the detection tool. Moreover, shedding may be influenced by the viral strain employed. In the case of cell attenuated DR13, virus shedding lasted for 8 days, and that in sows for 3 days . A comparison of the duration of virus shedding between vaccinated and control groups was not performed due to the death of control piglets after 3-6 days post-challenge. These results indicate that passive immunity by PEDV DR13 does not prevent virus shedding after challenge. Additionally, a study on reversion to virulence was conducted through serial pig passage. Cell-adapted DR13 PEDV remained safe, even after three passages in colostrumdeprived pigs. Accordingly, we propose that cell-adapted DR13 may be applied as a vaccine candidate under commercial farm conditions, although there is rising concern over the possibility of confounding factors introduced by genetic variation or housing variables (Hoblet et al., 1986) . In conclusion, cell-adapted PEDV DR13 prevents mortality after challenge, and induces higher IgA concentrations in colostrum.

As described in previous studies in which calves were fed sterilized milk supplemented with 1% immune bovine colostrum daily through 5-7 days of age (Fernandez et al., 1998; Saif et al., 1987) , the presence of local IgG1 plays a major role in protection against BRV infection and diarrhea.

Higher titers of passive colostral IgG1 failed to prevent BRV infection, but significantly reduced BRV diarrhea in IC calves.

Joint pains may persist for many months. The reservoir for both viruses seems to be, primarily, marsupials. Hepatitis C virus is the only member of Class Hepacivirus known to cause human disease. Hepatitis C is a common cause of hepatitis and chronic liver disease. It is spread from person to person by sexual transmission, by contact with infected blood, or blood products, and can be spread by contaminated needles. It can be transmitted to the infants born to infected mothers. People who develop hepatitis from this virus often develop chronic infection of the liver, which varies from person to person in intensity and in the likelihood of progressing to cirrhosis.

The pathogen-laden droplets from the infected person could reach the co-occupant directly when there is no covering, while the coughed air will be redirect to the region behind the infected person by using mouth covering. Fig. 2 clearly shows that mouth covering can reduce the co-occupant's inhalation by avoiding the direct exposure. The normalized inhaled concentration of the co-occupant under three ventilation systems is shown in Fig. 3 when the infected person coughs directly and in Fig. 4 when coughs with mouth covering. Since the coughed air can approach the co-occupant immediately when there is no blocking, the exposed contaminant concentration is quite higher. Due to the mainly upward air movement under DV which hampers the horizontal transportation of the coughing air, the inhaled concentration reaches its peak at the first stage about 1 s later compared with MV and UFAD. With the time elapsing, this higher momentum coughing jet dissipates, and ventilation system distributes the dispersed droplet residuals gradually, leading to the decreasing inhaled concentrations. In the situations with mouth covering, the expelled air is thwarted and cannot reach the co-occupant directly, as shown in Fig. 2 . Ventilation system then is the primary force to deliver these pathogen-laden droplets to the breathing zone of the co-occupant and result in a relatively lower inhaled concentration.",23.824537182217533,11.531277325280499

Meanwhile, the effects of mouth covering and desk partition are also studied under MV. There are two people working there, sitting face to face with a roughly 1.5 m distance between their nose-tips. The one on the right is assumed to be the infected person who emits pathogen-laden droplets and the other is called the co-occupant. In front of the infected person, a rectangular slab (0.20 m (length)× 0.12 m (height)) is set to represent mouth covering and located at about 0.03 m ahead of the mouth. There are desk partitions in the middle of the two people to build a private environment for each and the upper level of the partitions is 1.5 m above the floor. Boundary conditions for the computer, desk, window, human body, and walls are listed in Table 1 . Three ventilation methods, including MV, UFAD and DV, are investigated. The temperature of inlet airflow is set to be 16 °C, 20 °C and 20 °C, respectively, with the same air change rate of 6.4 times per hour. The swirling diffuser under UFAD is simulated by eight small square cells [13] Although a normal respiration process follows a sinusoidal cycle, steady inhalation for the co-occupant is assumed in this simulation. The breathing rate for the steady respiratory process is 8.4 L/min through nostrils, and the direction of inhaled jet is 45° upward. As to the infected person, a horizontal pulsating jet from the mouth at a velocity of 22 m/s [14] lasting 0.5 s, is assumed to simulate several consecutive coughs.

The efficiency of using this physical blocking may vary for different ventilation systems. As shown in Fig. 5 , this covering functions more effectively under UFAD and DV, especially under DV. Unlike the cases without mouth covering under DV, in which the coughed air is released at a higher velocity and the extraction of the exhaled droplets relies on the upward-driven air flow, using mouth covering can confine most of the expelled air in the microenvironment of the infected person, which can facilitate moving those pathogen-laden droplets upward by thermal plume.

This disease is contagious and is characterized by encephalomyelitis and inflammation of the upper respiratory tract. Mortality can reach 100% in piglets under 2 weeks of age. The respiratory form of the disease is common in growing and adult pigs. In pregnant sows, abortion, mummification of fetuses, or stillbirths can occur depending on the stage of pregnancy. Recovered or subclinically infected pigs continue to shed virus leading to persistent herd infection. The annual cost of pseudorabies for swine producers was more than $21 million in the mid-1980s (Miller et al., 1996) . Most vaccines do provide clinical protection against disease but do not prevent shedding or multiplication of the virus. Thus, some animals remain carriers for variable periods and become a source of infection for susceptible animals. Therefore, it is important for vaccination to prevent or reduce virus shedding to the extent that transmission to other susceptible animals is reduced. To attenuate the virus further, several genetically engineered deletion mutants have been developed and evaluated for their ability to reduce virus shedding. The impact of such vaccines is not yet fully known. Several countries are attempting to eradicate pseudorabies virus infection in their swine populations with or without the use of vaccines. However, in certain regions feral swine harboring latent virus can still be a potential source of infection for the domestic swine.

These insects could potentially play a significant role in the natural history and ecology of this disease, helping to explain at least some of its ubiquitous and persistent presence in many canine facilities. The animal odors and abundant food supply found in these environments make them especially attractive to these insects. Dissemination of CPV by flies would certainly increase opportunities for both dispersal and survival of the virus, since flies have been shown to fly 8 km/h (Murvosh and Thaggard, 1966) and up to 20 km in 24 h (Hogsette and Farkas, 2000) . In the canine shelter environment, mere physical separation of infected and healthy canines would not prevent this disease from spreading if flies can move between infected and non-infected animal quarters. Thus, if flies can be shown to actually transmit CPV, young susceptible dogs housed outside in the presence of flies would have an increased risk of contracting this disease.",18.535275546113787,6.059704328169474

The form of this curve is based on epidemic curves experienced during the 1918 influenza pandemic and presented by (though not necessarily endorsed by) M. Cetron (DGMQ, CDC) which originated with S. Barrett and MIDAS. The baseline prevalence (y 0 ) of an individual being infected with pandemic influenza, no decision measures yet implemented, can be approximated from the gross attack rate (GAR). The percent gross attack rate (GAR) is the percentage of the entire U.S. population that will have a clinical case of influenza. GAR is closely related to the mean number of secondary cases a typical single infected case will cause in a population with no immunity to the disease in the absence of interventions to control the infection [37] , called the basic reproduction number (R 0 ). In the initial setup and default values for the model, we did assume a GAR of % 30% and R 0 % 2:0 as indicated. This leads us to an analytic expression for a prevalence curve (or the baseline probability mentioned above) that is used to drive the model and compute the daily number of new infected individuals as provided in Table 1 . The specific parameter values for this expression are defined by Brigantic et al. [7] . A rough way to calculate R 0 for a simple single population is to take the product of the attack rate and the duration of infection (in this case the sum of the incubation and shedding periods). The incubation period is the time elapsed between exposure to a pathogenic organism and when symptoms and signs are first apparent [37] and the shedding period is the time that infected person can expel virus particles from the body, important routes include respiratory tract. These parameter values are based on a literature review that was further vetted by subject matter experts to arrive at appropriate values representative of pandemic influenza. These values are not necessarily specific to only air travel/airports, but are completely appropriate for cities or small towns. Moreover, these parameter values can be modified by the user of the PanViz tool, either to mimic alternate assumptions for pandemic influenza as desired and/or to model other potential infectious disease (e.g., smallpox) as well.",17.680280637173034,9.636036772529147

Habitat loss directly affects bat movement and pathogen spillover. For example, as humans have destroyed bat feeding habitats in subtropical Australia, pteropodid bats have sought alternative food sources in urban ar-eas, leading to spillover of Hendra virus from bats to horses, and subsequently humans (Plowright et al. 2015 ; Figure 6 ). A number of hypotheses link these urban bats to spillover: one hypothesis is that decreased movement of urban bats, and therefore decreased connectivity, leads to decreased population immunity and larger outbreaks of virus shedding; another hypothesis is that urban bats experience food shortages that lead to increased virus shedding (Plowright et al. 2011 (Plowright et al. , 2016 . Similarly, Nipah virus spillover has been linked to urban pteropodid bats drinking date palm sap from collection pots in Bangladesh, although the mechanisms linking bats and virus shedding are unknown (Luby et al. 2006) . Therefore, we conclude that linking bat movement ecology to disease ecology is critical to understand the role of bats as reservoir hosts, spillover risk, and the impact of disease on populations (De Castro and Bolker 2004; Wibbelt et al. 2010; Plowright et al. 2015) .",21.24873785091539,8.616702284113416

It is likely that suppressor factors produced by the suppressor cells will be able to stop HIV replication by inhibiting DNA replication in the host cell or by blocking the entry of the HIV-infected cell into the S phase of the cell cycle. However, it is also possible that such suppressor factors would not be able to distinguish between ceils that are latently infected, cells that actively express the virus and cells that are expanding in numbers due to the growth advantage conferred by a replicationdetective quasispecies of the virus in question. The net result would be downregulation and inhibition of the whole range of the target cell population independently of infection status.

Transgenic mice expressing the human poliovirus receptor generated in different laboratories were susceptible to poliovirus infection by various inoculation routes and the resulting disease was clinically and histopathologically similar to human poliomyelitis.

Several earlier studies have indicated that subclinical infections account for about one-third of infections (Nafta et al., 1970; Oker-Blom et al., 1970; Monto et al., 1979; Pettersson et al., 1980; Quarles et al., 1981) . Nonetheless, skepticism regarding asymptomatic spread of flu remains; some studies have suggested that virus shedding may sometimes occur before clinically significant symptoms or during subclinical symptoms, but virus shedding detected by nasal swabs cannot be equated to transmission of infection (Eccles, 2005) . By its nature, asymptomatic or subclinical flu cases are difficult to diagnose. Hence, it is impossible to precisely define the number of asymptomatic cases, not to mention the demanding task of tracing the number of infections by those asymptomatic cases. Consequently, clinical evidence of asymptomatic infection is extremely scarce and the magnitude of its contribution to spread of flu is hard to ascertain. In Longini et al. (2004) , it was assumed that the probability that a person will be symptomatic given that person has been infected is 0.67, based on population-level influenza cohort studies in the US. Moreover, they assumed that an asymptomatic infection is only 50% as infectious as a symptomatic infection. Intuitively, there might be a substantial (but poorly understood and inadequately quantified) difference in the respective transmission probabilities from asymptomatic person and symptomatic person to susceptible persons. Clearly, an infected person with clinical illness sheds more virus than does one with subclinical symptoms and also has illness manifestations (e.g., coughing) that contribute to the generation of infectious aerosols. On the other hand, infected persons with clinical symptoms may show reduced contacts if they are sufficiently ill to be confined to bed.

With rapid international transport, several infected travelers died after transit from West Africa to other parts of the word, which demonstrates the potential of a worldwide epidemic.

Chronic or repeated virus shedding in infected reservoirs increases the likelihood of transmission due to the greater number of virus particles in the inoculum for each exposed individual. In addition, immunological effector mechanisms that substantially restrict virus replication will affect viral genetic diversity and evolution in ways that may impact the spillover probability and the strain structure present in the reservoir host population (Box 1). A greater viral diversity may increase the chances that at least a few viral variants are able to successfully establish an infection in the novel host. Thus, we speculate that viruses that have either chronically high virus levels or repeated transient high pathogen burdens in their natural hosts may be overrepresented among emerging viral pathogens in humans ( Figure 1) .",21.018979800376655,9.82445167146293

The disproportionality between the number of zoonotic infections and the high seroprevalence of BV in breeding age animals is a function of the BV life cycle. The biology of BV infection in macaques is characterized by a lifelong persistence with infrequent, and usually subclinical, shedding at mucosal surfaces. Although the natural history of BV has not been described in detail, the replication cycle of HSV serves as a precedent (Roizman and Sears, 1993) . Virus is transmitted across a mucosal surface, such as the oral or genital mucosa. Following localized replication in mucosal epithelial cells, the virus is transmitted directly to sensory nerve endings. The prevailing thought is that there is no associated bloodborne stage of infection, except in rare systemic infections (Simon et al., 1993) .

Perhaps most surprising was the demonstration that unrelated cheetahs would accept reciprocal skin grafts indicating immunological identity at the cheetah's MHC.

Interestingly, the clinical signs were significantly less severe in the TGEV(91-95sg) group than in the TGEV group (Fig. 7 , A-C). To further assess the attenuation of TGEV(91-95sg), we performed post-mortem examinations and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. In the TGEV group, the stomach was obviously inflated and had undigested flocculate. Moreover, the gastric fundus mucosa was congested, flushed, and bleeding. The stomach wall and small intestinal wall became thin, which was especially true for the jejunum, and animals presented with intestinal dilation with an abundance of yellow liquid. In the TGEV(91-95sg) group, the stomach was slightly inflated, and the gastric fundus mucosa was not bleeding. The small intestinal wall was slightly thinner than that in the mock group. Overall, the damage to the small intestine and stomach in the TGEV group was significantly worse than that in the TGEV(91-95sg) group (Fig. 7D) . Moreover, H&E staining revealed extensive fine damage to different segments of the intestine, characterized by the fragmentation and shedding of intestinal villi. The results showed that the TGEV(91-95sg) group had only mild lesions in both the intestine and stomach compared with the TGEV group (Fig. 7E ). Next, we investigated how nsp1 contributed to the virulence of TGEV by analyzing the viral infection efficiency as reflected by virus shedding (Fig. 8A ) and viral tissue distribution (Fig.  8B ). Fecal samples were obtained with fecal swabs, and virus shedding was tested by regular PCR. The shedding of these groups was measured on days 1-7 and was terminated because of the quick deaths of the infected piglets. At 7 days postinoculation, all surviving piglets were euthanized to reduce the stress of the other piglets. The results showed that the challenged piglets had viruses in their feces. In contrast, no detectable virus shedding was found in the mock-infected pigs. Furthermore, we performed sequencing of the corresponding replaced regions to confirm the stability of the infective virus. Immunohistochemistry showed that the virus was present in susceptible intestinal tissues, consistent with the clinical results. Collectively, these data demonstrate that TGEV(91-95sg) is strongly attenuated in vivo, and we conclude that the nsp1 gene is necessary for virulence.",21.502782597650995,7.710183584147163

First, it was demonstrated by P.E. Sartwell [54] that the latent periods of many known diseases are typically 'right-skewed' or 'log-normal' distributed with a long right-hand tail. There are many known 'right-skewed' distributions. However, the gamma distributions are more commonly used and more important, they are more appropriate for our present purpose because their Laplace transforms can be calculated explicitly. Note that in (P1) we have dropped the restriction (4.15b) (saying W 0 ð0Þ ¼ 0) so that the exponential distribution can be adopted. Second, in epidemiology, very often an infected person will show a rash after the latent period. As commonly accepted in the natural sciences, such a rapid change can be modeled by the exponential growth law. Our assumption (P2) follows this basic principle. The assumption (P3) emphasizes the observable fact that the recovery process must, as successor of the latent process, change for large times more quickly than its former. In order to make the empirical study of the property (P3) more transparent, we rewrite (4.16c) as z að1 À bÞ ¼ 1 þ z að1 À gÞ with some g 2 ½0; 1Þ:",17.892280213537347,7.4375148493805385

However, if well evaluated and validated highly sensitive assays are being used, and the screening is being performed within a formal and well designed quality management system with well trained and competent staff, then this scenario should rarely, if ever, occur.

Chicks hatched from congenitally infected eggs are tolerant and unable to produce VN antibodies to the virus; they are viraemic, antibody-negative (V 1 A 2 ) and likely to develop tumors or, in the case of REV, tumors and/or runting and stunting. Horizontal transmission during, or shortly after, hatching can also result in tolerance [140, 141] . This risk is enhanced in chicks when subgroup E or glycoprotein (gp) 85 of subgroup E is expressed during embryonal development [142] or after IBDV infection at 1 day or 6 weeks of age. IBDV infection decreased the frequency of VN antibodypositive chickens and increased virus shedding and viraemia levels significantly, although these effects were dependent on the genetic background of the birds. In contrast, infection with REV at 1 day of age, or MDV at 2 weeks of age, had no significant impact on ALV shedding, viraemia, and antibody development [143] . However, exposure to IBDV at 2 weeks of age did not influence the incidence of ALV-J [144] . The induction of tolerance after congenital infection is virus-specific and is not a general inability to produce antibodies against pathogens other than ALV or REV. For example, chickens congenitally infected with a specific strain of ALV-A were able to produce antibodies to other subgroup A strains [145] and influenza virus, but were partly tolerant to ALV-B [146] .",18.187001492423455,6.7785055011957125

The one pertaining to the natural history of the disease, which covers the knowledge of disease evolution in the individual, stands out. Normally, one ascertains a period of anatomical or functional changes which highlight the subclinical or unapparent phase, which culminates with the beginning of the symptoms (incubation period). However, although diseases are unapparent during the incubation period, a number of pathological changes can be detected during this phase by means of laboratory methods, although most of the time diagnosis may only come up through symptoms. This fact is exacerbated by the instance that a considerable portion of the cases remains below the clinical horizon and, therefore, are not identified by their symptoms. Waldman 17 points out still that ""the higher the proportion of unapparent cases, the greater will be the difficulties to learn the infections processes, and to identify the main responsible agents for disease transmission within the community, as known cases represent only the tip of the iceberg"". This shows that the possibility of a disease whose etiological agent is unknown and with a long period of incubation, transmitted by airborne agents is quite high. Thus, there is need for immediate implementation of control and prophylaxis methods in the region affected, such as isolating cases during the transmissibility period (when known); measures aiming at preventing or mitigating the disease, its complications and consequences; quarantine or isolation of the healthy population (human or animal) follow-up of the reported cases following the date of the last contact with an infected person. Compliance with the Biosafety principles is of paramount importance at all stages of epidemiological investigation, in the sense of preventing the spreading of pathogens; the capture, handling and safe transport of biological samples; assistance to the population affected and protection to the professional himself, so that the latter does not become a spreading source of the pathogenic agent.

According to the WHO, approximately 1.5 million people are infected each year, although the true infection rate is probably much higher due to the asymptomatic nature of many infections (Hepatitis A fact sheet. In: World Health Organisation: media centre). Due to the prolonged infection times, the economic consequences of an outbreak through absenteeism from work can be significant. In developing countries where sanitation is poor, most children are infected while young and are asymptomatic. This gives them immunity and, as such, they cannot become reinfected as adults. In such areas, epidemics of the virus are uncommon but unvaccinated adult visitors from areas where HAV is not commonplace are vulnerable. In economically developed countries, epidemics are rare, because good hygiene practices will prevent person-to-person spread. However, in transitional economies, the introduction of improved sanitation may mean that the population is not exposed as children. As such, the introduction of the virus to these susceptible populations of adults can result in significant outbreaks (Lemon et al., 2018) .",21.51585306860403,10.870682503264035

This may result from transmission, or specific patterns of clustering (i.e. species or age groups) within roosting sites. Species clustering could explain variation among sheets because Hendra virus prevalence was positively associated with P. alecto density, but negatively related to the density of P. scapulatus. It is important to note that while the protocol of collecting pooled urine excreted on sheets is logistically feasible and cost-effective, prevalence in pooled urine samples may be both clustered and overestimated if infected bats contribute to pooled urine multiple times. Nevertheless, increased P. alecto density was also associated with increased pulse amplitudes, suggesting that pulse characteristics are influenced by disease dynamics occurring in P. alecto populations. Field et al. [6] suggested that the negative association between P. scapulatus and Hendra virus prevalence was due to the dilution of positive samples by P. scapulatus urine, because Hendra virus has not been detected in the urine of this species. An additional hypothesis is that P. scapulatus density at a site indicates an increase in food availability because the presence of this species is also associated with flower blooms and nectar production [39] . Increased food availability may then reduce Hendra virus shedding by improving bat condition and immunocompetence. A third possibility is that prevalence in P. alecto may be reduced by high P. scapulatus abundance through a 'dilution effect' where higher bat species diversity lowers infection risk. [40] .

The natural history of a viral infection indicates the most appropriate clinical specimens for diagnosis, ie, where the virus will be secreted and detected and when in the course of disease different specimen types would be expected to be positive for virus, and SARS-CoV is no exception. The evolution of diagnostics for SARS has been different from that of most viruses. The need for a BSL-3 facility for virus isolation and difficulty in culturing the virus from infected individuals late in the outbreak (possibly as a result of genetic drift of the virus) precluded the use of culture for diagnosis in most outbreak settings. Furthermore, the late seroconversion, 2 to 4 weeks after infection for most patients, all but eliminates a serological diagnosis for detecting recent infections. The first serological tests used SARS-CoV-infected cells on microscope slides and immunofluorescent staining or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests of crude cell lysates containing SARS-CoV antigens to detect serum antibodies. When used together with multiple specimens, virus isolation and serology proved useful for identifying patients at the beginning of the outbreak; however, they proved less satisfactory for diagnosing new cases in the first few days after onset of symptoms. Initial culturing of a CoV from patients in Hong Kong enabled the early identification of SARS-CoV by electron microscopy and led to the development of the first nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for detecting SARS-CoV RNA. Identification of a CoV by electron microscopy led to the search for conserved regions of the CoV genome and the development of RT-PCR assays for SARS-CoV RNA.

In the models discussed so far observational data that are related to these intervals are often used as a surrogate for the period of time spent in the I class, whilst at the same time 7. Introducing Better Descriptions of Disease Natural History: Non-uniform Infectiousness naively assuming people are equally infectious throughout this period. This relatively unrealistic assumption of uniform infectiousness over time can, however, be solved reasonably well by introducing more infectious compartments into the model schema, each of which can be attributed different infectiousness, I 1 , I 2 , I 3 , and so forth. Thus for influenza it might be appropriate to have an I 1 class to cover the first 24 h following symptom onset that is more infectious with individuals then passing into subsequent I 2 , I 3 , etc. classes of defined duration that are progressively less infectious. Influenza infectiousness is thought to peak very abruptly and then decline somewhat more slowly (19, 38) . The simple SIR model structure (Fig. 2a) , whether deterministic or stochastic, can be made more realistic in other ways. For example, as discussed previously, individuals do not necessarily progress from being susceptible to being infectious (and symptomatic) without some intervening latent period. Accepting this potentially alters the observed dynamics of epidemic models in ways that may or may not be important to the specific questions being asked (5, 36, 39) . For diseases such as smallpox, for example ( Fig. 2b) , it might be important to consider five separate disease classes and extend the differential equation set accordingly (34); though there are many ways in which the following aspects of the disease natural history might be reasonably represented with fewer or even greater numbers of classes; for example, to better capture the time varying infectiousness discussed above (5) . Thus, there could be a period between infection and the first nonspecific symptoms (often referred to as the (E)xposed class), then the period with non-specific symptoms (the (P)rodromal period), followed by the (I)nfectious and (R)ecovered classes. It can be important to capture the natural history in this way for diseases such as smallpox, which have both prodromal and infectious periods, since in the case of smallpox both are infectious (signified by the two dotted lines in the Fig. 2b ) but with the latter much more so than the former, according to our knowledge and analysis of previous smallpox outbreaks (30, 40) .",17.093766666076146,9.760640982605564

However, the natural history of nontraumatic FHON cannot represent that of GI-FHON because subtypes of nontraumatic FHON may have different pathogenic mechanisms and underlying conditions necessitating glucocorticoids can affect the course of FHON. The results of studies using MRI to diagnose asymptomatic GI-FHON are summarized in Table 11 .3 [ 7 , 11 , 78 -83 ] . About one-third of patients with asymptomatic early GI-FHON have symptomatic or radiological progression over a period of several years. Thus, clinical progression or subchondral collapse rate seems to be lower than the other subtypes of nontraumatic FHON, especially FHON associated with sickle cell anemia. Sometimes small lesions of GI-FHON are reported to be spontaneously resolved [ 81 -83 ] . However, as with other subtypes, femoral head collapse develops most often in GI-FHON patients with larger osteonecrosis areas (>15-30 %), lesions occupying the weight-bearing surface, higher radiographic stages, or hip pain [ 84 ] . There is no established risk stratifi cation system to exactly estimate outcomes in GI-FHON patients.

There was a distinct primary stage of infection that lasted from 7 to 18 months; the highest level of virus shedding occurred during this stage. This primary stage was resolved in one of three manners: (1) recovery, (2) persistent shedding, and (3) recurrent or intermittent shedding. These findings corroborated earlier studies of naturally occurring FECV infection. In a comprehensive study of 275 purebred cats from six catteries, fecal samples were collected every 1e3 months for a year and virus shedding quantified by RT-PCR (Foley et al 1997b) . A large proportion of these cattery cats shed virus at any given time, but most manifested cycles of infection and shedding. Similarly, Harpold et al (1999) found that all adult cats in an Abyssinian cattery shed virus in their feces at least once during the year and 4/15 cats were shedding greater than 75% of the time. Rohner (1999) reported that FECV shedding dramatically decreased over 2 years in a group of naturally infected cats. Herrewegh et al (1997) studied the persistence and evolution of endemic FECV infection in a closed cat-breeding facility. Viral RNA was detected by RT-PCR in the feces and/or plasma of 36 of 42 cats (86%) tested. Four of five infected cats were still shedding when tested 111 days later. Two cats were then placed in strict isolation and virus shedding was found to last up to 7 months in one animal. Persistent and recovered infections might be explained by relative differences in the strength of local gut immunity. However, an immunologic explanation for the recurrent pattern of shedding was not so apparent. It would be tempting to blame periods of recurrent shedding on frequent reinfections. Reinfection is a common occurrence One-way analysis of levels of fecal FECV shedding in a group of four cats that were shedding very low or non-detectable levels of virus prior to infection. Virus levels following reinfection were higher at all time points than they were prior to infection, but because of the small group size, only weeks 3 and 4 were significantly different. for many gut pathogens, because local immunity often requires persistence of the organism and does not possess strong memory (Brandtzaeg 2007) . However, successful reinfection in four cats resembled a primary infection in magnitude and duration, which was not true for recurrent bouts of shedding. It is possible that recurrent shedding was an artifact of the assay procedure. If the assay failed to delineate low level shedding from non-shedding, recurrent and persistent shedders would be basically the same accept for amplitude. The alternative possibility was that these periods of reshedding were due to reactivation of a latent or sub-detectable infection. However, this was not supported by studies of natural or artificial stress (see below). FECV was shed at very high levels following primary infection and the levels were significantly higher in kittens than in adult cats. Rohner (1999) also found that the levels of FECV were many log 10 higher during early than late infection. Foley et al (1997b) were the first to show higher levels of FECV shedding in kittens than older cats in shelters. These findings have an important collective implication for FIP. FIP is much more common among younger cats (Pedersen 1976 , Foley et al 1997a . If kittens are infected before their immune systems are fully matured, levels of FECV replication would be higher, and greater levels of virus replication would favor FECV / FIPV mutations. Relative age-related immunodeficiency could also prevent kittens from containing the FIP mutant virus. This scenario is supported by research with FECV-RM infection in cats that were immunocompromised by long-standing FIV infection (Poland et al 1996) . Chronic FIV infected cats shed 10e100 times more FECV than age-matched non-FIV infected cats, just like FECV in kittens, and 2/19 of them developed FIP vs none of the 20 FIV free cohorts. It was concluded that immunosuppression caused by chronic FIV infection enhanced the creation and selection of FIPV mutants by increasing the rate of FECV replication in the bowel, as well as by inhibiting the host's ability to combat the mutant viruses once they occurred.",21.71301563486561,9.52331219083852

When the populations under investigation are large, this is a reasonable approach: the time evolution of the system is likely to be quite predictable and individual chance events (e.g. whether or not one animal gets infected, how long it takes another to recover) are unimportant. Just as casinos may lose on individual bets but are sure to win in the long run, in a large population when many are infectious there are so many individual unpredictable events that the eventual outcome becomes highly predictable. In small populations, such as hospital units, and at the beginning of epidemics in both large and small populations when only small numbers are infected, this deterministic approach fails badly. The details of the random events that make up an epidemic become important. For example, if the first infected person happens to die before he has a chance to infect anyone an epidemic will not occur, even if it had the potential to (i.e. even if R 0 was greater than 1).

Chronic or repeated virus shedding in infected reservoirs increases the likelihood of transmission due to the greater number of virus particles in the inoculum for each exposed individual. In addition, immunological effector mechanisms that substantially restrict virus replication will affect viral genetic diversity and evolution in ways that may impact the spillover probability and the strain structure present in the reservoir host population (Box 1). A greater viral diversity may increase the chances that at least a few viral variants are able to successfully establish an infection in the novel host.

These findings are important because most, if not all, dogs will be infected with a variety of pathogens commonly found in the canine respiratory tract (e.g., S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus), and concomitant infection with CIV could further complicate respiratory disease and may result in mortality.

With the exception of smallpox, which some experts speculate is responsible for more deaths throughout modern history than all other infectious diseases combined, the greatest human and economic consequences derived from virus infections via natural exposure have been realized from emerging diseases, all of which have been derived from infected animals via zoonoses. For example, influenza pandemics that occurred in 1918 (H1N1), 1957 (H2N2), and 1968 (H3N2) resulted in approximately 40 -50, 2, and 1 million deaths worldwide, respectively ( World Health Organization, 2008 ) .

Genetic studies of lion population structure and natural history suggest that the current distribution of lions is a result of several population contractions, expansions, and long-range migrations relating to the historical rise and fall of water levels in Africa. As a result, most lions throughout their range have a recent genetic history. In addition, small numbers of long-range migrations continue to occur, resulting in ""hybrid"" individuals of mixed ancestry in all populations sampled (Antunes, submitted). Therefore it is interesting that there are African lion populations completely devoid of FIV (Brown et al., 1994; O'Brien et al., 2006) . These sero-negative populations have been found in the Kalahari, Etosha and Namibia, suggesting that the Kalahari may present an ecological barrier to FIV transmission. One hypothesis is that there is a liondensity threshold necessary for effective transmission within a species that is not reached in these sparsely populated areas (C.

Animals could be experimentally infected with different virus strains/variants at varying doses via different challenge routes, in which virus shedding from the oral, nasal, and rectal cavities should be correlated with different parameters, including viremia or virus titers in the organs. However, these studies are currently challenging for SARS-CoV as there is currently not an appropriate animal model that replicates the severe disease seen in humans; infected nonhuman primates exhibit variable, but at most mild to moderate, respiratory disease (McAuliffe et al., 2004) (Lawler et al., 2006) . Nonetheless, these types of studies are feasible for MERS-CoV. A model of this infection was developed in the common marmoset that results in severe respiratory disease and partial lethality, in which live virus can be detected in nasal and throat swabs of infected animals (Falzarano et al., 2014) . Thus, the studies proposed above can be investigated with MERS-CoV in this animal model. For EBOV, the cynomolgus and rhesus macaque animal models are well characterized and have been used over the past 20+ years. EBOV shedding is known to occur from the oral, nasal, and/or rectal cavities of nonhuman primates during the advanced stages of disease, but factors that influence virus shedding from these animals have not yet been investigated. Interestingly, using a guinea pig model, it was shown that animals infected intranasally (i.n.) with guinea pig-adapted EBOV were more contagious to naive contact animals than those that were infected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with the same dose . I.n. infected animals shed virus from their nasal cavity earlier than their i.p. counterparts, and i.p. challenged animals died earlier (and thus were removed from contact with naive animals) compared to i.n. inoculated guinea pigs. It was therefore concluded that the route of infection in addition to the duration of contact time with an infectious host may be factors that influence the efficiency of virus transmission. It will take time to elucidate all possible host and viral factors that contribute to virus shedding, which remains an understudied topic to date. Therefore, it is not currently possible to predict with any level of confidence or statistical significance whether a person will become a super-spreader of a certain disease. Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of super-spreaders might provide some clues about the genetic backgrounds of super-spreaders, but the feasibility and robustness of these analyses will depend on the number of super-spreaders in a given outbreak.",25.078456283146426,11.591195947117606

Especially, stress factors, such as dietary changes, parturition, lactation, chilling due to low environmental temperature or cold drinking water, or wide fluctuations in temperatures might play an important role in initiating the disease. Also, the immune status of cows [23] and mixed infections of BCV with other microorganisms might be contributory factors to the disease. At first, we tried to inoculate the virus oronasally to 2 cows, as was done previously for gnotobiotic or colostrumdeprived calves [10] , but these cows did not show any clinical signs, virus shedding or increased serum antibody responses to BCV. These results indicate that unlike in calves [10] , it is difficult to reproduce diarrhea in seropositive adult cows challenged with BCV via the oronasal route. In contrast, 6 of 8 cows inoculated through a duodenal catheter developed diarrhea and shed BCV in diarrheal feces. Viral inoculation via the duodenum excluded the adverse effects of rumen microorganisms and gastric acids in the abomasum on BCV. Certain stress factors, such as mentioned previously, may change the number and composition of rumen microorganisms, or increase the pH of the abomasum and influence BCV infectivity in the field. Immune suppression induced by DM treatment influenced the occurrence of diarrhea and virus shedding in our BCV challenge exposure studies, although exceptions occurred. For example, cow 4 began to show diarrhea and virus shedding during DM treatment. The DM treatment causes deleterious effects on mucosal immune responses as reported previously [16, 18] and likely also compromises mucosal immune responses and host resistance to BCV. We gave a large volume of ice water to 2 cows as a stress inducer before inoculation and one of them was also treated with DM before inoculation. Both cows showed diarrhea and virus shedding, but there were no major differences between the 2 cows in the degree of diarrhea and the duration of virus shedding. However it was interesting that ice water treatment alone in cow 9 also resulted in BCV infection and diarrhea.",20.037370931620796,9.218640712927172

As a result, most lions throughout their range have a recent genetic history.

Current understanding about how SARS-CoV-2 spreads is based largely on what is known about other similar coronaviruses. Currently, two types of SARS-CoV-2 have been detected (L and S) [52] . The L form is suspected to be the derived variant of the ancestral S type, which is suggested to be more aggressive and is significantly more prevalent in Wuhan, China (where COVID-19 was first reported) than other places, although its frequency of isolation has decreased since January 2020 [52] . The virus spreads primarily via person-to-person contact through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes [53, 54] . However, it also could be spread if people touch an object or surface with virus present from an infected person, and then touch mucosal surfaces such as their mouth, nose or eyes [54] [55] [56] . Given that contact lens wearers must touch their eyes when applying and removing their contact lenses, it is understandable this has been raised as a potential concern for increasing their risk of exposure to the virus. The consistent, unambiguous advice to protect individuals from the virus is to employ frequent handwashing with soap and water. The lipid envelope of the virus can be emulsified by surfactants such as those found in simple soap, which kills the virus [54, 57] . Best practice advice for contact lens wearers includes the same instructions that should be imparted under all situations, regardless of the COVID-19 pandemic. When using contact lenses, careful and thorough hand washing with soap and water followed by hand drying with unused paper towels (generally known as 'kitchen roll' in the United Kingdom) is paramount. For contact lens wearers, this should occur before every contact lens application and removal, and such practice reduces the risks of infection and inflammatory responses and is highly effective [58] . It follows that as long as contact lens wearers are using correct hand hygiene techniques, they should be limiting any virus transmission to their ocular surface, and indeed, as already stated, there is currently no evidence that they are at any higher risk of developing COVID-19 infection than non-wearers.",18.526163206470756,9.537281681190393

The presence of a disease, in general, is difficult to be identified without the use of medical diagnostic tests, and therefore, the actual health state of a patient is often hidden. We define the terms observation and health state used for our model as follows. Our objective is to infer the hidden health states of each person at different time points. Observations and networks are necessary to achieve this goal. Observations provide the essential information for diagnoses of an infection, while networks give the information the set of individuals an infected person has contacted. On the other hand, they also impose practical challenges on the accurate identification of hidden health states of a person. Observations can be misleading since the same observation may appear in different health states. The networking effect complicates the problem in the sense that the health state of a person not only is dependent on his/her medical history but also can be affected by other ""connected"" patients. The challenges motivate us to consider the following overall problem, and the three sub-problems required to tackle in our framework. ",19.871617464895603,7.976377909915095

Although other cell types are more commonly associated with viral persistence, epithelial cells may play a role in the maintenance of a persistent infection and in some cases be involved in the process of virus shedding from the chronically infected host. Persistently infected cells often exhibit a reduced expression of viral proteins on the cell surface, which is thought to be important for the evasion of antibody-complement-]mediated cell lysis (Oldstone and Buchmeier, 1982; Roizman and Sears, 1987; Francis and Southern, 1988) . The polarized expression of viral proteins on the apical domain of epithelial cells, which may not be subject t o significant immune surveillance, should therefore fulfill a similar purpose and may be important for the maintenance of persistent infections involving epithelial tissues. In addition, several viral infections are typified by a prolonged period of virus shedding into the saliva and/or urine and are likely to involve the infection of polarized epithelial cells.

In the current study, the CIV (H3N8) vaccine significantly reduced the severity of clinical disease, viral shedding, bacterial shedding, and lung pathology in dogs infected with CIV and S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus. Hence, CIV vaccine could be used to aid in protecting dogs against CIV as well as against opportunistic bacterial pathogens, such as S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus. These findings are important because most, if not all, dogs will be infected with a variety of pathogens commonly found in the canine respiratory tract (e.g., S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus), and concomitant infection with CIV could further complicate respiratory disease and may result in mortality. Therefore, vaccination of dogs at risk for infection, such as those housed in shelters or kennels or those that are frequently boarded or go to dog day care and dog parks, is the best way to protect against CIV as well as against other secondary pathogens.",18.62912094451304,9.313896423082157

The evolution of diagnostics for SARS has been different from that of most viruses. The need for a BSL-3 facility for virus isolation and difficulty in culturing the virus from infected individuals late in the outbreak (possibly as a result of genetic drift of the virus) precluded the use of culture for diagnosis in most outbreak settings. Furthermore, the late seroconversion, 2 to 4 weeks after infection for most patients, all but eliminates a serological diagnosis for detecting recent infections. The first serological tests used SARS-CoV-infected cells on microscope slides and immunofluorescent staining or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests of crude cell lysates containing SARS-CoV antigens to detect serum antibodies. When used together with multiple specimens, virus isolation and serology proved useful for identifying patients at the beginning of the outbreak; however, they proved less satisfactory for diagnosing new cases in the first few days after onset of symptoms. Initial culturing of a CoV from patients in Hong Kong enabled the early identification of SARS-CoV by electron microscopy and led to the development of the first nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for detecting SARS-CoV RNA. Identification of a CoV by electron microscopy led to the search for conserved regions of the CoV genome and the development of RT-PCR assays for SARS-CoV RNA.

In this figure, data from 1949-1964 (before tourism became as popular as it is today) are plotted that show the duration of measles epidemics on various islands. In Fig. 4 .9A, we see that an island must have a population sufficient to produce about 16,000 surviving newborns a year (population about 500,000) in order to maintain the virus continuously in the population. If the population is smaller, the epidemic burns itself out when all susceptibles have been infected. The island is then free of measles until sufficient new susceptibles have been born and measles is once again introduced into the island from outside. The smaller the population, the longer this takes. Note that Guam and Bermuda, with their heavy tourist influx, had measles present more than expected from the curve because the virus is introduced more often, that is, the island population is not truly isolated. Figure 4 .9B illustrates that the more densely packed the population, the more readily the virus spreads and therefore the sooner the epidemic burns itself out. The islands shown in this panel all have about the same population, but when the population is compressed into a smaller area, such as in Tonga, person-to-person spread is more efficient and epidemics do not last as long as when the population is dispersed over a larger area, such as in Iceland.",19.08669415902087,11.1571392608369

Because of successive selection in previous hosts, it is possible that some of the transmitted virus will already be ‘adapted’ to the immune system of the newly infected person. On the other hand, virions, which retain the consensus epitopes, are likely to be more easily recognised by the immune system. Therefore, samples of PBMCs were taken from 20 newly infected individuals (68 days after estimated infection) and stimulated with peptides corresponding to adapted (42) and non-adapted (61) epitopes in their founder virus.

However, this experience motivated me to learn about the life history of this virus, and it quickly became evident that it has a fascinating cellular existence. Rabies is transmitted via the saliva from the bite of an infected animal, usually a dog or bat. Once the skin is breached, the virus replicates in the neighboring muscle tissue. From there, it begins its journey to the brain by invading axons of the peripheral nervous system, where it becomes encapsulated in a host-derived vesicle and marches toward the nerve cell body by specifically associating with the minus-end motor protein dynein (Raux et al., 2000; Klein, 2003). Vesicle encapsulation enables it to cross synapses and eventual enter the CNS, where it ascends the spinal cord, homing directly in on the brain. Once in the brain, the virus undergoes massive replication, causing encephalitis, and spreads to the salivary glands and other organs. The rabies virus specifically accumulates in the midbrain, impairing serotonin transmission. This is the likely cause of the aggressive outbursts in infected animals that promote transmission of the virus (Klein, 2003). Incredibly, the virus accomplishes this with a diminutive 12-kb genome containing only five genes (Ming et al., 2009).",16.700757300488505,7.7803316359433765

Thus, the infection can be transmitted through sneezing and coughing, and is primarily acquired by large droplets (>5 microns).35,38 This mode of transmission facilitated the dissemination of influenza in the history and resulted in major outbreaks. Further, animal flu viruses transmitted to humans are usually dead-end infections, and the virus does not have the capacity to be acquired between humans easily. This limitation is an important barrier to global dissemination.

Animals either had come directly from within Qatar or KSA, or had been sold through the central animal market (CM). Swabs and lymph nodes were tested for MERS-CoV RNA by internally controlled RT-PCR targeting UpE and N genes, as described (3, 6). The first camel isolate of MERS-CoV as described by Raj et al. (7) was obtained from the first group of 53 samples and among others sequences generated from this group have been used to define a general MERS-CoV typing fragment (8). In total, 59% of the camels showed evidence for virus shedding in at least one type of swab at the time of slaughter (Table 1). The percentage positive samples was the highest for nasal samples, followed by oral swabs, fecal swabs, and bronchial swabs. All but one animals with virus shedding from any sample had a positive nasal swab. For saliva (oral), the percentage of positive samples was the highest for animals between 7 and 12 months of age. Lymph nodes from 53 animals were tested, yielding five positives. Approximation of the viral loads in the samples using the Ct values obtained with the UpE target showed no significant differences between types of samples and age groups (Fig. 1) It should be noted that viral loads with ΔCt>20 were observed only in the nasal swabs and the nasal swab sample with the highest viral load was found to contain infectious virus (7).",15.229115528390139,5.95951330501225

During the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa in 2014–2016, thousands of people were infected and many of them died due to the viral infection [1]. EVD is generally considered as an endemic disease in Africa. However, its spread can be broadened through travel to all parts of the world. It is known to be transmitted from humans, bats, rodents, and chimpanzees to humans. Ebola virus belongs to the Filoviridae family [2]. Ebola virus has a negative sense RNA genome that encodes 7 different proteins and is surrounded by an envelope that contains the virally expressed glycoprotein (GP). There are five species of Ebola virus including, Zaire ebolavirus, Sudan ebolavirus, Tai Forest ebolavirus, Bundibugyo ebolavirus and Reston ebolavirus, all of which were named after the places where they were first discovered [3]. Ebola virus GP is associated with viral attachment to the host cell receptor prior to viral entry into the cells [45]. To date, neutralizing antibodies targeting Ebola virus GP have been reported to be somewhat effective at reducing the severity of Ebola virus infection and disease progression in animal models and humans. For example, when Ebola virus-infected monkeys were treated within 24 hours following Ebola virus challenge with ZMAb (composed of three monoclonal antibodies [MAbs] against Ebola virus GP), all survived from Ebola virus infection, while all monkeys without ZMAb treatment died within five days of viral infection [67] Furthermore, ZMapp (Mapp Biopharmaceutical) treatment is known to be effective at reducing mortality rates in patients infected with Ebola virus [8]. Despite the severity of Ebola virus infection, there are currently neither preventive vaccines nor therapeutic drugs readily available for use.

The (possibility of) dual use is as old as engineering and designing. Literally dual use means nothing more and nothing less than that a certain activity or a certain object can be applied in at least two ways. This is the case with almost everything that has been designed or developed, but also with objects that are not human made, like natural herbs. To give some examples: a kitchen knife can be used to cut, but also sometimes as an alternative for a screw driver and indeed also to stab someone.1 Palliative pills are meant to alleviate pain, but if someone takes enough of these pills they can be used for committing suicide. This list can be continued endlessly. Almost every artefact and many natural products can be applied in a dual or even multiple use way. The dual or multiple ways an artefact can be used are not always intended by the designer. A screwdriver is not designed to stab a person. In pharmaceutical research unexpected or unintended effects of medicines also can lead to dual use. Sometimes the original function even is displaced by the unintended one.

In most studies reporting favourable post-LT outcomes in these severely ill patients, an “early” LT has been performed (time between placement on the waiting list and LT ranging from 3–9 days).[98], [116], [119] This very short timeframe is required because of the natural history of these patients. Indeed, around 50% of them will die in the first 10 days.116 A significant proportion of patients are not placed on the waiting list before acute deterioration of their condition. As an example, in our study, 45/73 patients transplanted with ACLF grade 3 were placed on waiting lists during the immediate pre-LT hospitalization (median time to LT: 8 days).98 Therefore, pretransplant evaluation must be performed in a timely fashion, precluding a number of clinical tests usually required in LT programmes. To our knowledge, the potential impact on post-LT outcomes of this “truncated” evaluation has yet to be studied extensively in patients with very high MELD scores.50 Such a “truncated” evaluation, involving the performance of only a few necessary screening tests, could lead to potential contraindications for LT (active neoplasia, severe alcohol dependence, or still significant coronary artery disease) being overlooked. In addition to the potential impact on outcomes, this raises some degree of unfairness with regard to less severe patients undergoing the recommended exhaustive evaluation (routinely responsible for not listing patients after the discovery of a contraindication).117 There is an urgent need to evaluate the various international LT centre practices in this setting.

Only one example of a −2 FS signal has been documented to date, involved in the expression of tail assembly chaperone genes in bacteriophage Mu (55,56). Here, tandem −2 slippage occurs on a GG GGG CGA with the anticodon of the A-site tRNAArg (3′GCI5′, where I in the wobble position is inosine) forming a more stable post-slippage contact with the mRNA in the −2 frame rather than the −1 frame. Another potential −2 FS signal in Trichomonas vaginalis virus 1 has been suggested (57). In this virus, frameshifting most likely occurs on a conserved CC CUU UUU sequence, compatible with tandem −2 shifting. Examination of known viral −1 FS sites possessing a U6A or A6C slippery sequence, however, reveals that in most cases the spacing distances seem inappropriately long for efficient −2 FS. In HIV-1, where the stimulatory RNA forms immediately 3′ of a U6A slippery sequence (58), a stop codon in the −2 reading frame is present directly downstream of the U6A heptamer and appears to be present in all isolates of HIV-1 (59,60). Any ribosomes entering the −2 reading frame would terminate immediately, generating a truncated Gag polyprotein lacking viral proteins p1 and p6. As yet, there is no evidence to suggest that such a species is expressed in HIV-1 infected cells. Frameshifting in the expression of mammalian ornithine decarboxylase antizyme has remarkably been shown to be +1 in mammals and fission yeast, yet −2 in budding yeast (61,62). Precise details of the mechanism of the −2 FS remain to be elucidated, but as observed by Matsufuji and colleagues, lengthening the spacing between the antizyme shift site and its pseudoknot by three bases increased +1 FS in yeast at the expense of −2 FS, supporting a link between spacer length and frameshift direction (61). Intriguingly, replacing the 3′-stimulatory element that forms a component of the antizyme frameshifting signal with an annealed AON has been shown also to stimulate −1 FS when placed with zero spacing (50). However, this −1 product is not seen with the natural antizyme frameshift signal. Conclusive evidence of a functional −2 FS signal in virus or cellular genes is therefore still awaited.",7.311218260856134,3.712078106101435

This will be done by introducing two translations of the word threat in Dutch: dreiging and bedreiging. They mark a difference that does not exist in the same way in English. Bedreiging is used if an actor is threatening to act in a certain way, e.g. with using violence. Threat as bedreiging looks at a situation from the perspective of the subject making a threat. Dreiging on the other hand focuses at the perspective of the person or group that is or feels threatened. The dreiging perspective of threat does not have to coincide with that of bedreiging. Someone can feel threatened while in fact there is no real threat, because no one has the intention to commit an action against this person. The reverse is also possible: someone does not feel threatened, while in fact a real threat exists, because an actor has the intention to commit a crime or a terrorist action. There are indications that the aspect of dreiging is most influential in the recent debates on biosecurity. Because of that the chance exists that in declaring an activity as dual use an emphasis is laid on the dual use potentiality and that there is an underestimation of the aspect of intentionality (bedreiging).",7.23027178295328,3.224008226660448

Many forms of human interventions that are altering the transmission rate over time include (i) individuallevel protective measures such as wearing masks and safety glasses, using hygiene, and taking inhome isolation, and (ii) community-level quarantines such as hospitalization for infected cases, city blockade, traffic control and restricted social activities, and so on. In addition, the virus itself may mutate to evolve, so to increase the potential rate of false negative in the disease diagnosis. As a result, some individual virus carriers are not contained. Thus, the transmission rate β indeed varies over time, which should be accounted in the modeling. One extension to the above basic epidemiological model is to allow a time-varying probability that a susceptible person meets an infected person or vice versa. Suppose at a time t, q S ptq P r0, 1s is the chance of an at-risk person being in-home isolation, and q I ptq P r0, 1s is the chance of an infected person being in-hospital quarantine.

The information has improved the public's awareness of the virus. Many people choose to continue to pay attention to the epidemic-related information, and respond faster when the outbreak later occurs, reducing the probability of infection. In the stage of the outbreak, information about it will also be spread on major social media. When individuals learn about the existence of the disease, they will change their behavior, such as wearing a mask and vaccinating to avoid being infected, which can have an impact on the spread of the disease.

Other emerging coronaviruses (e.g. SARS and MERS) have been suggested to have airborne transmission potential (5, 6) in addition to more direct contact and droplet transmission. At least one study suggests that MERS-CoV has the possibility of transmission from mildly ill or asymptomatic individuals (7). Surface samples taken in patient care areas for 10 MERS and SARS have shown positive PCR results (6); however, experts question the possibility of transmission through contact with surfaces that have been contaminated by an infected person, either by the direct contact of the infected person or the settling of virus-laden particles onto the surface(8). Nonetheless, coronaviruses have been implicated in nosocomial outbreaks with reports of transmission related to environmental contamination (9,10).

Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 in our model, peaked early in the course of infection, similar to what is seen in patients (14) . This earlier peak in virus shedding for SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to influenza virus shedding (16) than SARS-CoV, where shedding peaked around day 10 post onset of symptoms (15) , and may explain why case 40 detection and isolation may not be as effective for SARS-CoV-2 as it was for the control of SARS-CoV (17) .

SARS-CoV-2 was primarily detected in tissues of the respiratory tract, however SARS-CoV-2 RNA was also detectable in other tissues such as intestines, in line with a recent report (19). 5 Two out of four animals had foci of DAD on day 4 p.i. The colocalisation of SARS-CoV-2-antigen expression and DAD provides strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infection caused this lesion. The histological character of the DAD, including alveolar and bronchiolar epithelial necrosis, alveolar oedema, hyaline membrane formation, and accumulation of neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes, corresponds with the limited pathological analyses of human COVID-19 cases (6, 10 7). In particular, the presence of syncytia in the lung lesions is characteristic of respiratory coronavirus infections. Whereas MERS-CoV primarily infects type II pneumocytes in cynomolgus macaques, both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 also infect type I pneumocytes.

This implies that we assume that the average longevity of the period of time while the infected person is contagious is 21 days, in line with the current knowledge, see e.g. [8, 9, 10] . Standard deviation of the chosen Erlang distribution is approximately 12, which is rather large and reflects the uncertainty we currently have about the period of time a person needs to recover (or die) from COVID-19. An increase in 1/σ would prolong the epidemic and smaller values of 1/σ would make it to cause people to be contagious for less time. The use of Erlang distribution is standard for modelling similar events in reliability and queuing theories, which have much in common with epidemiology.

there is a fraction of asymptomatic but infectious individuals in the population,0.21793967103158365,1.1847959756851196,2.546229362487793,d513587b-4ca9-4ac6-9517-a872fc04ad08,biorxiv_medrxiv/Evaluation of the potential incidence of COVID-19 and effectiveness of contention measures in Spain: a data-driven approach,"In concluding, it is apparent from all the results obtained for the different scenarios that we have considered that the most cost-effective strategy would be the isolation or quarantine of detected infectious cases, as long as the efficacy of such measure is over 60%. Important for the current debate about the natural history of the disease, this policy would also work if there is a fraction of asymptomatic but infectious individuals in the population. Our results also show that from a practical point of view, a combination of all the analyzed contexts can have second order benefits. As already stressed, containment measures should not only be directed towards a full cutdown of the number of infected cases. Their efficacy is also given by other factors, such as delaying, even if only by a few days, the spreading of the disease. Such delays are always good for preparedness and to have more time for clinical research that can lead to new pharmacological treatments or vaccines. For instance, even if traffic restrictions are not effective on their own, they facilitate the control of the population and thus it would be easier to detect infected individuals and treat them. Similarly, self-protection measures and other social-distancing practices delay the spreading of the disease, freeing resources that would allow for a better management of the epidemic, in turn leading to an increase of the efficacy of individual isolation. Closing public places would, in practice, reduce the transmission, which again will lower the total number of infections and thus make them more manageable for the public health system. This also highlights the importance of having a coordinated response system, since simply adopting central measures like imposing mobility restrictions and closing public places is not effective in the middle-to-long term.",10.877052627369103,6.232134889391579

Unexpectedly, here we report a non-severe patient with the longest duration of viral shedding. According to the investigation on the clinical and epidemiological information of this case, we concluded that this type of virus might have a low toxicity and transmissibility, but have a prolonged infective ability and was hardly to be eliminated in the body with regular therapy. However, infusion of plasma from recovered patients showed high efficiency in elimination of this virus.

While China -where the outbreak started -seems to have been able to contain the growth of the epidemic, different outbreaks are nowadays being detected in multiple countries. Much is currently unknown about the natural history of the disease, such as a possible asymptomatic spreading or the role of age in both the susceptibility and mortality of the disease. Nonetheless, authorities have to take action and implement contention measures, even if not everything is known. To facilitate this task, we have studied the effect of different containment strategies that can be put into effect. Our work specifically refers to the situation in Spain as of February 28th, 2020, where a few dozens of cases have been detected. We implemented an SEIR-metapopulation model that allows tracing explicitly the spatial spread of the disease through data-driven stochastic simulations. Our results are in line with the most recent recommendations from the World Health Organization, namely, that the best strategy is the early detection and isolation of individuals with symptoms, followed by interventions and public recommendations aimed at reducing the transmissibility of the disease, which although not efficacious for disease eradication, would produce as a second order effect a delay of several days in the raise of the number of infected cases.",10.51062386237876,5.931015949956116

If so, then R 0 should be 2.1 (=0.6+161/110). Alternatively, one can infer that the primary cases of the unlinked patients were not identified by a public health center (PHC) and that their distribution of the secondary cases was the same as the figure in an early study. That would mean that 28 primary cases infected 66 secondary cases. Therefore, the average number of secondary cases conditional on those which infected more than one person was 2.44 (=66/27). Presumably, the 161 unlinked cases were infected by 66 hypothetical primary cases. Moreover, these hypothetical 66 cases represented infection by 27 other cases, and so on. Therefore, 112 cases infected 273 cases which were not identified by a PHC. In total, the average number of secondary cases is expected to be 1.5 (=(66+273)/(110+112)). Therefore, the true number of R 0 is expected to be in the range of 1.5-2.1. These numbers are slightly smaller than other estimates, but far greater than one.",10.205475965197213,4.563781036604806
