Influenza is generally a self-limiting infection with systemic and respiratory symptoms, usually resolving within 3 to 6 days in most patients. Viral clearance in the respiratory tract usually occurs after 3 to 5 days [15] . However, in immunocompromised patients respiratory viruses tend to persist longer due to a constrained immune response and therefore also spread more easily into the lower respiratory tract. Prolonged influenza and RSV viral shedding has been previously described in immunocompromised patients [16] [17] [18] and similar results have been observed for rhinovirus and coronavirus [19] . However, there is only limited information regarding the molecular epidemiology of respiratory viruses in immunocompromised adults combined with the prevalence, duration and clinical impact of viral shedding.",32.9142338747315,13.046885771561298

However, persistence of viral shedding has received little attention in immunocompromised patients. An important observation in this study was the prolonged viral shedding and hence the carrier status of the patients affected. Long-term viral shedding for more than 30 days was detected in 18% of patients in our patient cohort, mostly associated with RSV. Seventeen of 20 patients with prolonged viral shedding were transplant patients, 13 patients with allogeneic transplants. This finding is in line with a recent study from Heidelberg, where the majority of patients with respiratory viral shedding for more than four weeks were allogeneic transplant recipients [22] . According to Khanna et al. [43] , duration of viral shedding is not associated with immunosuppression, RSV subtype or treatment regimen. Since these patients shed for a long time, it seems prudent to assume that these patients remain positive for the duration of their hospital stay. This finding confirms previous reports of prolonged shedding among immunocompromised patients [17, 19] . Shedding in hematology patients was reported for 2-4 weeks [43] [44] [45] . However, this is the first time that for RSV a median shedding duration as long as 12 weeks has been reported. Recently, Milano et al. [19] reported prolonged viral shedding in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients. Median duration of viral shedding for rhinovirus and coronavirus was five weeks and four weeks, respectively, and prolonged shedding of more than three months was observed in some patients.",33.610777198303495,12.045015459915064

Laboratory viruses vary between strains and wild-type viruses. Studies, by necessity, use laboratory strains which may be grown to high titre and efficiently assayed. Any virus used in a validation study is, therefore, a model virus. Viral inactivation validation studies have successfully used surrogate model viruses with properties similar to wildtype viruses to provide evidence for the safety of human blood plasma products for over a decade. [17] Studies using model viruses are also used for pharmaceuticals, derived from human and/or animal sources, including recombinant proteins produced in eukaryotic cell lines, vaccines, and some Class III medical devices. [18] Viral inactivation validation studies must inactivate a range of enveloped viruses, using at least 3 viruses to represent different properties that IVDMDs are expected to be challenged against. A suitable model virus for HIV, HBV, and HCV must be included. If an enveloped virus has been shown to have a higher resistance to the manufacturer's disinfectant class, then a model for that virus should also be included. Once dried on inanimate surfaces, viruses are less susceptible to decontamination than when hydrated in suspension. [19] [20] Validation studies should therefore include a quantitative suspension test for the assessment of internal decontamination procedures [15] and quantitative carrier tests [21] or appropriate alternative methods. An effective and reliable decontamination method will show a reduction of 4 log 10 . [22] Despite some pathogens causing a very high titre viraemia, the design of IVDMDs reduces their contamination as far as reasonably practicable. The design of IVDMDs means they only require a small volume of blood to perform an analysis. Consequently, when an effective and reliable decontamination method is in place that provides a reduction of 4 log 10 , this will inactivate any residual enveloped virus within the IVDMD. Decontamination therefore renders the IVDMD safe to use and service after challenge with any enveloped virus. Once assessed by appropriately designed viral inactivation validation studies on relevant surrogate model enveloped viruses, the decontamination process has been shown to be effective against all known and future emerging enveloped viruses, which includes Ebola, CCHF, Lassa fever, and Marburg virus.",21.88267833078552,8.9328969541155

Thus, it is highly probable that these proteins would also target the TCR TM interactions using the SCHOOL mechanism. Exploratory sequence investigation of FPs from SARS-CoV, Lassa virus (LASV), lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), Mopeia virus (MOPV), and Tacaribe virus (TACV) reveals a close similarity in the positioning of the electropositive residues ( Figure 2E) . Intriguingly, analysis of other unrelated viruses has yielded similar correlations in primary structure and function. Earlier studies have reported an inhibitory effect on lymphocyte proliferation by CKS-17 peptide, a synthetic 17mer peptide with sequence corresponding to a highly conserved region of TM proteins of human and animal retroviruses, including the TM protein gp21 of human T lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) [34] [35] [36] . Interestingly, peptides corresponding to regions of HIV TM protein gp41 homologous to the highly conserved and immunosuppressive sequence contained within the TM proteins p15E and gp21 of animal and human retroviruses, respectively, also have been reported to inhibit lymphoproliferation , shown as a simplified axial view) and prevents formation of signaling oligomers upon antigen but not antibody stimulation, thus inhibiting antigen-mediated but not anti-CD3-mediated TCR triggering and cell activation (D). Primary sequence analysis of proven and predicted immunomodulatory sequences of viral fusion protein regions and other domains shows a similarity in the charge distribution pattern with two essential positively charged residues (shown in blue) spaced apart by three to four or seven to eight amino acids (E), suggesting a similarity of mechanisms used by diverse viruses in their pathogenesis to modulate the host immune response. Note: Although the three-dimensional structures of the analyzed sequences within the cell membrane are not known, it might be assumed that these sequences may adopt a helical conformation upon membrane binding. Thus, helical wheel projections are used for illustrative purposes only; the suggested mode of action does not depend on a particular secondary structure of the sequences. [35, 36] . Recently, filoviral 17-mer peptides corresponding to a 17-amino acid domain in filoviral glycoproteins that resembles an immunosuppressive motif in retroviral envelope proteins have been demonstrated to inhibit TCR-mediated cell activation [37] . In all peptides, a striking similarity is observed in the charge distribution patterns with the positioning of the essential positively charged residues almost identical to that for the HIV gp41 FP ( Figure 2E ), suggesting again a similarity in their mode of action. This clearly demonstrates that different viruses have adopted similar mechanisms of specifically targeting TCR, disrupting receptor architecture, and suppressing the immune system. Importantly, by virtue of the acquired insight into this conserved structural motif, expanded predictions, hypotheses, and conclusions can be derived to being answering the question of whether shared TCR-targeted strategies represent a conserved function or a convergent tactic of divergent viruses.",19.213119296512545,9.325616041718462

This study predicts that voluntary household-based quarantine and external isolation can be effective in limiting the morbidity and mortality of an influenza pandemic, even if such a pandemic cannot be entirely prevented, and even if compliance with these interventions is far from uniform. These simulations can therefore inform preparedness plans in the absence of data from actual intervention trials, which would be impossible outside (and impractical within) the context of an actual pandemic. Like all mathematical models, however, the one presented in this study relies on a number of assumptions regarding the characteristics and circumstances of the situation that it is intended to represent. For example, the authors found that the efficacy of policies to reduce the rate of infection vary according to the ease with which a given virus spreads from person to person. Because this parameter (known as the basic reproductive ratio, R 0 ) cannot be reliably predicted for a new viral strain based on past epidemics, the authors note that in an actual influenza pandemic rapid determinations of R 0 in areas already involved would be necessary to finalize public health responses in threatened areas. Further, the implementation of the interventions that appear beneficial in this model would require devoting attention and resources to practical considerations, such as how to staff isolation centers and provide food and water to those in household quarantine. However accurate the scientific data and predictive models may be, their effectiveness can only be realized through well-coordinated local, as well as international, efforts.",17.777849902876547,8.22975039736322

In addition, buccal shedding of the virus was sustained for 1-2 more days from chickens infected with the virus containing full-length PB1-F2. The increase of both buccal and cloacal viral shedding in the WTinfected birds resulted in longer environmental contamination of the chicken's water source during these studies.

However, no standard has been endorsed or enforced to ensure that healthcare facilities can resist natural disasters. In addition, back-up systems (e.g. electricity, water, and communication) were not fully considered when many hospitals were being built. For example the health facilities in the earthquake-prone areas of western and rural China rarely comply with the standards of construction, nor are their back-up systems required to resist natural disasters (23) .

Histopathologic analysis of intestine revealed a significant difference for duodenal enteritis between genotypes on day 11 (Fig 5A and 5C ). Due to a general trend towards more severe ileal enteritis in Mmp7 -/mice on day 11 (Fig 5B and 5C ), we more closely examined the ileal crypts.

This is the second most deadly EVD outbreak in history, after the one that occurred in West Africa in 2014. The DRC Ministry of Health (MoH), supported by the World Health Organization (WHO) and a range of regional and international partners, are implementing EVD response plans in these affected areas such as screening of suspect cases at points of entry, case detection, contact tracing, laboratory testing, case management and infection prevention and control, safe and dignified burials, ring vaccination (this involves vaccination of infected individuals, direct contacts of infected individuals and contacts of their contacts), and therapeutics, community mobilization and free access to healthcare services. Despite these efforts, there has been a sharp rise in the number of confirmed cases within the identified affected areas, and due to a number of challenges unique to DRC, there has been an expansion in the geographical extent of transmission. The significance of the proximity of these regions to wildlife and the Virunga National Park is questionable in the EVD transmission dynamics. The close interaction between human, animal, and environmental factors, in combination with high population movement due to regular rebel attacks in these regions, suggest the need for the integration of the One Health approach in the holistic response plans for control and prevention of EVD.

We did not attempt to recover live viruses by cell culture. Although PCR methodology has limitations because it does not demonstrate the presence of infective virus, it is commonly used to detect the presence of a virus. Also limiting is that the total number of samples taken is relatively small (n = 94). Our sample collection took place within three hours of the daily traffic peaks, well within the reported survival times on surfaces associated with common respiratory viruses. However, whilst the Ct values in our study are similar to those for surface samples in other studies, e.g. [17] , these are relatively high, suggesting a low viral load on the surfaces that tested positive, and possibly not constituting the minimum infective dose. Likely due to the high Ct value, subtyping for the influenza A positive specimen was not successful and did not provide information on the origin of the viral strain and its epidemiological context. Alternatively sampling and recovery techniques may have been relatively inefficient, giving an illustration of the potential for transmission, but underestimating the true transmission potential of contaminated surfaces and air. Data concerning the infectious dose specifically for indirect contact are lacking [17] . Killingley and colleagues used a logical argument to conclude that their level of influenza A surface contamination on its own did not represent an infectious dose [17] . The reasoning was that as the copy count in their surface samples approximately only equated to that needed for aerosol transmission, and the likelihood that higher counts are required for indirect transmission, their surface contamination doses would not have been infective. In this study Ct values were similar to Killingley et al. [17] , so likewise it is reasonable to conclude that the environmental contamination we identified may not always (or ever) have constituted an infective dose. However, we are unable to determine precisely when each surface became contaminated, and therefore cannot exclude a higher viral load at an earlier time point. Likewise, we cannot establish the efficiency of our sampling technique and the readouts we have may be low due to sampling and recovery techniques. Notwithstanding, we establish the potential for virus transmission from several surfaces. On that basis we do not feel that the potential for transmission can be satisfactorily excluded based on our data.",23.14576838366603,10.457910983595703

Nevertheless, oncolytic viruses vary in size and some are small enough to fit even through tight ECM networks, and efforts have been made through genetic engineering of the viruses to minimize their non-specific binding properties.

Scientists and funders should identify and support the integration and translation of science from multiple sectors, fields, and disciplines to identify key information gaps for global health security and provide the scientific foundation for assessing infectious disease risks. Funding support for training and fellowships can promote explicit scientific input into decision-making and encourage open sharing of data with other researchers and health officials. Researchers and research institutions should aim to shift the culture of data sharing by promoting the open sharing of data with public health practitioners as an academic product on par with publications, decreasing the potential for politicization or biased use of data [70] . Data sharing has been raised with H5N1 influenza A virus, Ebola virus, and Zika virus [89] , and informed by efforts to promote equitable benefit of results from the sharing of data and samples from emerging outbreaks [90, 91] . In 2014, the U.S. government passed the DATA (Data Transparency and Accountability) Act, which requires that data from federally-funded efforts be made open and available. The U.S. government's DATA.gov website (https://www.data.gov/) is the platform that was developed to store and provide access to the datasets. In addition, agencies such as U.S. Geological Survey now have an 'eternal data' archive called Science Base (https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/).

In 2008, they were considered an important strategy to limit the impact of an influenza pandemic both individually, by reducing morbidity and mortality, and collectively, by slowing spread of the virus to allow time for vaccine production, the cornerstone of influenza control [2] [3] [4] 7] . It was hypothesized that the widespread use of a single antiviral might result in the emergence of resistant strains whose subsequent spread could dramatically reduce the effectiveness of antiviral therapy. The combination of two antiviral agents, if well tolerated, and if producing at least additive antiviral activity, theoretically offers several advantages: reducing disease severity, viral shedding, and viral excretion period, thereby also lowering the attack rate and risk of selection of resistant viruses, specifically in individuals with prolonged viral shedding, such as immunocompromised patients [8, 9] . Indeed, mathematical modelling showed a reduction in risk of emergence of resistant strains during early phases of a pandemic, associated with use of two antivirals as compared to single antiviral therapy [9] . Finally, another theoretical advantage of combining two drugs would be to ensure optimal treatment of all circulating influenza virus types, subtypes, or variants, as susceptibility of influenza viruses has been shown to vary, and seasonal H1N1 viruses naturally resistant to oseltamivir, which remain susceptible to zanamivir, emerged in 2008 [10] . Among antivirals active against influenza virus, the combination of neuraminidase inhibitors is attractive, because both compounds are licensed for seasonal influenza, they are delivered to the respiratory tract by distinct means (directly through a diskhaler for zanamivir, after gastrointestinal absorption and hepatic metabolism for oseltamivir), and key mutations associated with resistance are different for each drug. However, negative interactions cannot not be ruled out owing to the possible competition between these two drugs, which target the same binding pocket in the neuraminidase.",19.81713122110728,6.64646272056706

We can make two hypotheses in this regard: the first is that viral shedding is truly intermittent, and the second is that viral shedding in semen is continuous but that the quantity of PEDV RNA is sometimes too low to be detected by RT-qPCR. Intermittent shedding of porcine viruses has already been shown for PCV2, CSF and PRRSV [29, [37] [38] [39] [40] . We also observed that shedding of PEDV in semen appeared before shedding in feces and prior to the onset of the clinical signs. This is consistent with the data reported for other porcine viruses, such as CSFV and Aujeszky's disease virus, which showed viral excretion occurring in semen before the development of clinical signs [21] . Therefore, boars infected by PEDV may be detected after delivery of potentially infected semen. Consequently, specific control measures should be implemented for breeding pigs before semen or boars are imported. This may include the control of seroconversion and control of the absence of previous virus shedding in feces and reporting clinical signs. Implementing these types of measures is particularly important because we have demonstrated that PEDV RNA can be detected in semen even when the boars no longer shed virus in feces and do not show any clinical signs. It would also be beneficial to have more data regarding the prevalence of PEDV among boars used in boar studs.",21.58615769046515,9.334882373455061

Therefore, the adhesion ability to mucosal surfaces and epithelial cells is a crucial feature of probiotics.

The temporal dynamics of the host response to IAV in blood is strikingly different in symptomatic versus asymptomatic subjects [111] .

In contrast, a hallmark of the asymptomatic response was upregulation of pathways that restrain cytokine signaling (SOCS2, SOCS5) and oxidative stress (SOD1, STK25), together with suppression of inflammasome signaling pathways. Of note, myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) accumulate in the lung during IAV infections, and may contribute to the immunosuppressive environment via production of IL-10 [112, 113] .

For example, individual based interventions might focus on reducing fomite touching whereas centralized interventions change the surfaces available for contamination. In general, we found that R 0 for the fomite route was more sensitive to surface properties than to the rate of touching fomites. By extension, interventions that improve surface decontamination may be more effective than hand washing interventions when fomites are the primary transmission route. Specifically, when the proportion of accessible surfaces (λ) was low (such as in an office or subway scenario), touching rates were most important for determining fomite R 0 because surfaces were highly concentrated. However, at higher values of λ, touching rates did not contribute as much to fomite R 0 . Of the four venues considered, the highest values of R 0 for the fomite route occurred in settings like schools and daycares, where both the proportion of accessible surfaces and the touching rates were high leading to frequent exposure to surfaces with somewhat lower concentration of pathogen. Daycares may be an even greater source of risk for pathogens that have higher shedding rates among children. These venues are likely to be of particular interest for infection control efforts as non-pharmaceutical intervention and environmental microbiology studies have indicated that pathogen persistence on school and day care surfaces could be an important source of infections [31, 32] . Additionally, healthcare settings exhibit many features of high contact and high accessible surface venues.

For influenza, high-frequency surface decontamination could prevent outbreaks by reducing R 0 for the fomite route below 1 in venues with high proportions of accessible surfaces and moderate surface contact rates. This is because influenza demonstrated the lowest overall fomite R 0 in our analysis. However, even in venues that are not favorable for fomite transmission, influenza may still be able to maintain transmission by inhalation of aerosolized viral particles or direct droplet spray, necessitating additional control strategies. Notably, it may be important to tailor environmental interventions to specific venues, as the effect of a given influenza transmission mechanism may not be consistent between venues with different environmental properties [5] . For rhinovirus and norovirus, none of the interventions considered had an appreciable effect, suggesting that alternative strategies may be needed to control these pathogens. These results are consistent with recent work by Lei et al, who found that the fomite-mediated route was important for norovirus, but less so for influenza [28] . To be effective, surface decontamination interventions for norovirus and rhinovirus may need to be more frequent (> 1x /day), tailored to the specific context, and timed early in outbreaks to interrupt transmission. These differences were driven by the interaction between multiple properties of the pathogens. Because of its low transfer efficiency, high inactivation rates on hands, and relatively short duration of infectiousness, influenza had the lowest R 0 for the fomite route, making fomite-mediated transmission easier to control despite its high shedding rate. Both rhinovirus and norovirus were more efficiently transferred, had high persistence on both hands and fomites, and produce longer periods of shedding, making the transmission potential high for both pathways and consequently more difficult to control, even with frequent surface decontamination.",23.608154074167892,9.724411230817923

The most common pattern, where lesions were focused around central airways and blood vessels close to the lung hilus with the periphery less or not affected can likely be explained by the aerogenous route of infection and pathogen entry. The opposite pattern characteristic of K. pneumoniae infection where the periphery of the lobes was more strongly affected than their hilus areas despite a similar aerogenous route of infection may be due to the aerosolic intratracheal application [75] of these bacteria which is typical of and necessary in this model [41, [57] [58] [59] . These differences are therefore more likely attributable to the model-specific route of infection rather than pathogen-specific properties. Similarly, the very homogenous distribution of E. coli induced pneumonia likely followed the diffuse blood borne entry of the pathogen into the lungs after intraperitoneal infection. Again unique among the pathogens tested here, the IAV-associated pattern affected entire but only select lung lobes with almost complete sparing of others. This distribution probably followed a random spread of the virus along major airways but why some lobes remained virtually unaffected after transnasal infection remains hard to explain. Apart from helping to understand differences in pathogen spread, the uneven and often quite asymmetrical distributions have a tremendous impact in practical terms when acute mouse pneumonia is sampled for molecular studies. When quantitative data on mRNA or protein expression levels or other biochemical information are to be compared with one another or with tissue lesions, it is imperative that only identically affected areas are compared. Since this is impossible to predict or recognize on the macroscopical level for most models, the practice of sampling different regions of such lungs for different readout systems appears highly problematic.",22.698976577150145,8.469080364991786

The emergence and extinction of clades due to ecological and evolutionary processes, along with spillover events from nonswine hosts, have created a nomenclature quagmire. Consequently, we developed a unified system that accounts for the unique evolutionary history of swine IAV that can be periodically updated as viral diversity expands or contracts. The data to create a classification system and the accompanying automated tool rely exclusively on genetic divergence in the HA and do not infer information on viral phenotype. Future modeling and computational tools can build from and adapt this system. For example, the classification of nonswine H1 viruses could follow the process described here for swine H1, leading to a comprehensive, multihost H1 classification scheme. Incorporating data from functional HA studies could refine clade definitions. For example, including studies on antigenic evolution with genetic classification could provide advanced metrics for clade definition, which would facilitate the selection of vaccine strains and inform risk management policies for agricultural and public health.",21.272710497581986,9.914091242741952

Although this mechanism remains unknown, coexistence with cocci, which have a smaller surface area than bacilli and therefore retain water more effectively, may aid the survival of bacilli on dry surfaces. High-touch dry surfaces are invariably contaminated with S. aureus because this organism is a ubiquitous inhabitant of the human body, and it is therefore crucial to understand its dynamics on dry surfaces. Cardiolipin is a membrane component that enhances stress tolerance, thereby maintaining bacterial viability [43] [44] [45] , and several studies have shown that cardiolipin is involved in biofilm formation [46, 47] .

SDM are capable of extracting associations between the presence of disease cases (or outbreaks) and environmental factors to characterize environmental requirements for pathogen occurrence, which subsequently provide predictions on suitable geographical locations for virus circulation and spread over non-sampled areas 21 . SDMs have recently become popular for risk mapping of both animal and human diseases [22] [23] [24] [25] at local, regional and global scales. Such methods have been proven useful for modeling spatial distribution of diseases over large geographical areas, and thus, can provide a supportive platform for targeted sampling schemes of PRRSv within and between swine production regions in the U.S. Molecular characterization of PRRSv constitutes a substantial portion of the pathogen's surveillance efforts in the U.S., where a large number of sequences became available due to the growing accessibility to affordable molecular tests 26 . However, the increase in the size of PRRSv's genomic data led to new challenges regarding the interpretation of results, especially considering the rapid mutation and recombination events of the virus. One of those challenges relates to the need for differentiating endemic from emerging strains. Past PRRSv evolutionary epidemiology studies either focused on establishing associations between phylogenetics and outbreak characteristics in different geographical levels 7, [27] [28] [29] , or discriminating between endemic and emerging strains to infer about their spread and maintenance within affected swine populations 7, 10, [30] [31] [32] . Those studies relied on traditional phylogenetic methods to either genotype new viruses using the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns, or assess correlations between the similarities of nucleotide sequences and spatio-temporal outbreak dynamics 33 . Such methods ignore important evolutionary parameters, uncertainties associated with phylogenetic relationships, and spatio-temporal factors that shape the evolutionary history of rapidly evolving pathogens like PRRSv 34, 35 . Thus, tools provided by the field of phylodynamics have become a necessity to effectively characterize the joint evolutionary and epidemiological patterns of rapidly evolving pathogens 36 . These methods heavily rely on Bayesian statistical frameworks, which can provide methods that are able to account for uncertainties in the evolutionary parameters of the phylogeny, and subsequently can provide estimates on population dynamics, divergence times, and history of geographic spread 37 .",24.086946204178656,10.935126521394245

This could explain both the reduction in the duration of illness and transmission to household contacts in the intervention arm. However, though the difference between the baseline and end-point samples was larger in the intervention arm than the control arm, the difference was not significant (although this study was not powered to detect differences in these measures). In participants who stopped HSNIG before day four, 54% (7/13) had an increase in viral shedding. There was also an increase/stabilisation of symptoms in 50% (8/16) before symptoms resolved. In fact, four individuals felt the need to restart HSNIG for one or more days (Fig. 4) .

Molecular methods for SARS diagnosis are useful, although their value is affected by the observation that maximal viral shedding occurs after the first week of illness rather than at the initial clinical presentation. The SARS outbreak was characterized by high infection rates in healthcare workers; patient self-collected specimens such as throat washes or feces, or serum may pose less risk to healthcare workers, particularly in the context of concerns about nosocomial acquisition. Although NPAs and other lower respiratory tract samples are the sample of choice for suspected respiratory viral infections, patient self-collected specimens are suitable for RT-PCR. Thus they offer diagnostic value, especially in SARS where the peak of viral shedding is after the first week of illness, and this sampling approach may reduce the safety issues of healthcare workers collecting NPAs. Patient self-collected specimens may be less appropriate for common seasonal respiratory virus infections such as influenza, where viral shedding is maximal at clinical presentation and virus is rarely detected outside the respiratory tract.

In particular, by determining the number of chains that needed to be observed in order to detect various degrees of change in R eff , we provide perspective regarding the extent to which the 760 monkeypox cases observed between 2005 and 2007 [56] can provide enough information to detect increased transmissibility (Figure 7) . Based on our power analysis, it appears that a change in R eff due to declining population immunity should be detectable, since R eff is expected to approach R 0~0 :8 [43]. However, this result needs to be interpreted in context because our model assumes that the probability of case observation is high and that distinct infection clusters can be determined. Given the logistical challenges of recent surveillance efforts [56] , these assumptions are unlikely to have been met, so the realized power for detecting a change in R eff is probably lower. Nevertheless, this simulation analysis provides perspective concerning the trade-offs of thoroughness in detecting and characterizing cases versus observing cases within a greater catchment area for any future surveillance efforts for which measurement of R eff is of interest.",24.629435264853004,10.631393729970432

Coronavirus infection may in turn increase the severity of WNS pathology. This is the first study to examine the systemic effects of co-infection on either bat coronavirus or WNS, and our results raise important questions in regard to zoonotic spillover events. Although events of successful viral spillover to distantly related species are thought to be extremely rare, in recent years several coronaviruses have spilled over, including SARS-CoV 1 , MERS-CoV 2-5 , PEDV-CoV 6 and SADS-CoV 7 . These viruses are thought to have originated in bats. In addition, circumstantial evidence suggests that most alpha and beta coronaviruses that parasitize other mammals may have originated in bats as well 46 . If so, then understanding host-pathogen interactions between bats and coronaviruses could inform our ability to predict or manage the risk of spillover. In this study, we showed that a coronavirus exhibits low activity in its natural host, M. lucifugus, but that co-infection with a fungus increases the quantity of viral RNA",23.121789560074248,8.848402633641285

These adaptations sometimes comprise a stepwise process that includes 1) initial viral introduction/establishment in the recipient species, followed by 2) finite adjustment/optimization of the virus replication and transmission strategies for specific environments associated with a new host [1, 2] . This process has been well documented for several single-host viruses such as pandemic influenza A virus, the SARS coronavirus and canine parvovirus (reviewed in [3, 4] ) that do not rely on alternating infection of disparate hosts for their maintenance in nature. However, much less is known about the adaptive processes that mediate crossspecies jumps for double-host viruses such as arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses). Several recent studies documented that the acquisition of a single mutation in an arbovirus genome can mediate their cross-species transfer [step (1) ] [5] [6] [7] [8] . However, in none of these cases have subsequent, additional adaptive mutations been detected, posing the question of whether selection of second-step adaptive mutations is possible or necessary for these viruses to persist in nature. This information is critical for understanding and predicting the long-term consequences of pathogen emergence and maintenance in affected areas, which in turn could influence the development and success of targeted intervention strategies for managing outbreaks.",19.521409736983635,8.158045252332519

Hong Kong is one of the high-prevalence areas in Asia [17] . According to the Asian Network for Surveillance of Resistant Pathogens (ANSORP) study, 57% of all inpatient isolates of S. aureus from Hong Kong hospitals were shown to be methicillin resistant [18] . In Hong Kong, healthcare services are provided by the government-supported Hospital Authority. In public hospitals, general wards are typically arranged in the setting of six beds per cubicle. Unlike in many other countries, known cases of MRSA colonization or infection at admission would not be isolated or assigned to single rooms. Rather, such patients would occupy beds at the far end of a ward. Since the surfaces of bedside environments are not considered critical surfaces in terms of contact with mucosal membranes, such surfaces are cleaned with hypochlorite wipes once a day in accordance with the environmental infection control strategies of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [15] . Protective barrier precautions, such as the use of gloves and masks, are taken when handling MRSA patients. In view of the high MRSA infection rate in Hong Kong and the approach to dealing with MRSA-positive patients in local medical wards, the primary aim of this study was to evaluate the decontamination effectiveness of JUC polymer on bedside surfaces in a routine-operating medical ward in addition to the daily cleaning hypochlorite wipe and protective barrier precautions. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no epidemiological study thus far on surface MRSA-related contamination in the general wards of Hong Kong hospitals.

It is unquestionable that studies of spontaneously arising disease in relatively outbred and long-lived animals that so closely share our domestic environment must provide information of benefit to human medicine. The availability of the canine and feline genomes [29, 30] and the development of microarray genomic screening tools [31, 32] provide us with unprecedented ability to explore the basis of canine and feline diseases that so closely mimic those that occur in man. Promoting comparative clinical research will be the second major focus of the WSAVA One Health Committee.",24.960967483352864,10.037041146338915

When decontamination routines remove 100% of virus from the environment and there are no infected birds entering retail markets from wholesale markets, as would be expected, decontamination is > 99% effective even when it occurs infrequently (i.e., every 2 weeks) ( Figure 1B, left) . In contrast, when continual introduction of AIV from wLBMs contributes to prevalence levels in rLBMs, as is likely the case, rigorous decontamination (100% efficacy) is only 50% effective at decreasing environmental contamination when decontamination occurs as often as weekly ( Figure 1B, right) . The constant influx of infected birds leads to conditions where decontamination must occur more often than weekly in order to reduce environmental contamination by more than 50% Figure 1B , right). However, when decontamination practices are less than 100% effective, prevalence of the virus in the environment is much less affected by the influx of susceptible birds ( Figure 1B ) and stay-times (Additional file 3: Figure S2 ) showing that there is less opportunity for the management of stay-times to act synergistically with decontamination ( Figure 1B and Additional file 3: Figure S2 ). In order to design effective strategies to eliminate AIVs from rLBMs, there is a need for systematic empirical studies to accurately quantify the role of prevalence of infection in upstream components of the poultry production system (e.g., wLBMs, farms and intermediate holdings) in reducing the efficacy of decontamination practices at rLBMs.",21.779707865891766,9.042369213642944

Little information is available regarding the influenza subtypes circulating in swine in the country, and because the lack of cross-protection between different subtypes is one of the obstacles preventing the development of efficacious vaccines and prevention of influenza infection in swine, more studies are needed to improve the knowledge of viral circulation and to determine the best strategies for preventing economic losses related to influenza virus infection in Brazil.

The importance of an environmental factor in viral persistence has been shown in an experiment that monitored AIV isolation rates before and after days that the market was disinfected [8] . However, whether this environmental persistence adds to transmission has not been determined empirically. Theoretically, indirect transmission via an environmental reservoir could contribute to the overall force of infection within rLBMs by providing a sustained source of AIV (i.e., by providing a transmission link between birds even if they do not occupy the market at the same time) [9] . Indirect transmission can occur through a variety of routes, including viruses in drinking water, in feces on the ground or on surfaces in cages. All of these routes rely on three main processes: shedding rates into/on a particular environmental feature, decay rates of the virus in it, and contact of susceptible birds with it. Intuitively, one would predict that indirect transmission would be most significant when shedding rates are high, decay rates are low and contact rates are high.",21.978844152827236,8.82262322299551

All of the animal food-contact surfaces and most of the non-animal foodcontact surfaces were qPCR positive when swabbed after the contaminated animal food was manufactured and remained qPCR positive after multiple batches of animal food were mixed and conveyed. Therefore, it seems that the proposed mitigation technique (feed batch sequencing) did not mitigate environmental PEDV contamination. Additionally, detectible PEDV seemed to persist on some animal food-contact surfaces, such as plastic and rubber conveyors, more than others such as metal. Previous studies have investigated the survivability of virus on inanimate surfaces and determined viral persistence in the environment can be affected by several factors including surface type [19] [20] [21] . Additionally, different surface types can have different characteristics such electrostatic, hydrophobic or ionic strength which may impact virus detectability on these surfaces [22, 23] . For example, it has been reported that electrostatic forces impact virus attachment to lettuce [24] . Therefore, it is possible that physical properties contributed to the persistence of PEDV on animal food-contact surfaces sampled in the current study. This is interesting because most animal food manufacturing equipment have been designed for electrical efficiency and physical cleanout, but not sanitization. For example, plastic conveyer buckets are preferred not only because they are light and more energy efficient, but they are also safer for workers due to elimination of sparking that is a concern with sheeted metal buckets [25] .",21.997213176427802,8.138074640595399

The ability to evade the immune response and establish a chronic infection would prolong shedding of virus and enhance viral survival in nature,0.20183930960567495,0.5686081051826477,1.4855839014053345,0106346d-4af3-4fef-9f18-ef46f54f4107,custom_license/Origination and consequences of bovine viral diarrhea virus diversity,"The ability to evade the immune response and establish a chronic infection would prolong shedding of virus and enhance viral survival in nature. Viruses that exist as a quasispecies have the potential to create a series of mutants that stay one step ahead of the adaptive immune system, thereby prolonging infection and extending the time when the virus may be transmitted to a new host. Such viruses also have the potential to infect a host that has an existing immune response due to prior exposure with virus. The larger the dose of virus that is in the initial inoculum during transmission to a new host, the greater the chances are that a mutant virus is present that can evade an existing immune response. Interestingly, a swarm of mutant viruses may possess a molecular memory that retains genetic mutants that demonstrated a selective advantage during previous cycles of viral replication [8, 9] . Thus, when the viral swarm encounters an exigent circumstance, such as infection of a host with an existing immune response or with a physiologic disturbance like fever [10] , mutants already are present that were successful previously in a similar circumstance. Viral mutants that are of low virulence would seem best fit for adaptation to the host and persistence in nature. Those viruses would have few adverse effects on the host, allow host survival, and may have a prolonged period of viral shedding. In the case of BVDV, most viral isolates are of low virulence and noncytopathic in biotype. This is consistent with a virus that is well adapted to its host. However, low virulence and host survival may be selected against in a process that favors viral mutants that are more ''fit'' for replication in the host [11] . Viral mutants that replicate to a higher titer than the parent virus would have a competitive advantage and soon dominate the mutant swarm. This process could favor emergence of virulent viruses that exhibit enhanced viral replication, which in turn, could lead to extensive tissue damage and a burst of viral shedding in high numbers. The release of high numbers of virus improves the chance of viral transmission, making virulence a positive trait and giving virulent virus a competitive advantage over less virulent viruses [12] . In the case of BVDV, this might explain the periodic emergence of virulent BVDV that produce large outbreaks of disease [13] .",19.369383959999904,8.114509190282154

How members of the public and investors come to their estimates is a complex area, which is difficult to elucidate. For instance, there may be an element of herd behaviour, in which individuals partly base their decisions on the behaviour of others (Edmunds & Gay, 2006; McInnes, 2005) . This would tend to result in behaviour that is sensitive to random events and dependent on the choices of those that first react, but is also sensitive to new information and thus easily reversed (Bikchandani & Sharma, 2001) . Alternatively, the rapid and widespread reduction in travel and tourism, for instance, in SARS affected areas may simply have been the result of large numbers of people making similar decisions given roughly similar data sets. This behaviour is less sensitive to new information and less easily reversed. The reasons behind observed actions are therefore important as they can affect the likely impact of different risk communication strategies and the rapidity by which demand recovers following an outbreak.",19.73212616691414,7.507433388057333

In developing countries, this virus is responsible for approximately 200,000 deaths annually. 25 A typical disease course is self-limiting, but there have been incidences of necrotizing enterocolitis and seizures in infants. 26, 27 Symptoms of infection include diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, abdominal cramping, dehydration, and fever. Incubation normally is for 1-3 days, with symptoms enduring for 2-3 days. 28 Viral shedding is indicative of immunocompromised status within an individual with the elderly and young having a prolonged state of shedding. 29 Transmission occurs predominately through the oral-fecal route with contaminated food and water being the major vector. 30 A major hindrance to basic research into this pathogen is the lack of a cell culture system. Therefore, animal models are used not only to determine the efficacy of novel drugs and vaccines but also for understanding the pathogenesis of the virus. Therapeutic intervention consists of rehydration therapy and antiemetic medication. 31 No vaccine is available, and development of one is expected to be challenging given that immunity is short lived after infection. 32 NHPs including marmosets, cotton-top tamarins, and rhesus macaques infected with Norwalk virus can be monitored for the extent of viral shedding; however, no clinical disease is observed in these models. Disease progression and severity are measured exclusively by assay of viral shedding. 33 It was determined that more virus was needed to create an infection when challenging by the oral route than when challenging by the IV route. Chimpanzees were exposed to a clinical isolate of Norwalk virus by the IV route. Although none of the animals developed disease symptoms, viral shedding within the feces was observed within 2-5 days postinfection and lasted anywhere from 17 days to 6 weeks. Viremia never occurred, and no histopathological changes were detected. The amount and duration of viral shedding were in line with what is observed upon human infection. 34 A recently identified Calicivirus of rhesus origin, named Tulane virus, was used as a surrogate model of infection. Rhesus macaques exposed to Tulane virus intragastrically developed diarrhea and fever 2 days postinfection. Viral shedding was achieved for 8 days. The immune system produced antibodies that dropped in concentration within 38 days postinfection, mirroring the short-lived immunity documented in humans. The intestine developed moderate blunting of the villi as seen in human disease. 35 A murine norovirus has been identified and is closely related to human Norwalk virus. However, clinically, the viruses present a different disease. The murine norovirus does not induce diarrhea nor vomiting and can develop a persistent infection in contrast to human disease. [36] [37] [38] Porcine enteric caliciviruses can induce diarrheal disease in young pigs and an asymptomatic infection in adults. 39 Gnotobiotic pigs can successfully be infected with a passaged clinical noroviruses isolate orally. Diarrheal disease developed in 74% of the animals, and 44% were able to shed virus in their stool. No major histopathological changes or viral persistence was noted. 40 Calves are naturally infected with bovine noroviruses. Experimentally challenging calves with an oral inoculation of a bovine isolate resulted in diarrheal disease [14] [15] [16] The link between equine cases and the human disease was confirmed in 1938 by observing 30 cases of fatal encephalitis in children living in the same area as the equine cases. During this outbreak, EEEV was isolated from the CNSs of these children as well as from pigeons and pheasants. 44 EEEV primarily affects areas near salty marshes and can cause localized outbreaks of disease in the summer. The enzootic cycles are maintained in moist environments such as coastal areas, shaded marshy salt swamps in North America (NA), and moist forests in Central America and South America (SA). 45 Birds are the primary reservoir, and the virus is transmitted via mosquitoes. Furthermore, forest-dwelling rodents, bats, and marsupials frequently become infected and may provide an additional reservoir in Central America and SA. Despite known natural hosts, the transmission cycles in these animals are not well characterized. 44 Reptiles and amphibians have also been reported to become infected by EEEV.",19.700639008452203,7.444724358260033

For instance, stainless steel is a hydrophilic (contact angle of 58.2°in water, surface energy of 50.3 mJ/m 2 ) and negatively charged surface in which microorganisms have been shown to develop irreversible attachment within one minute potentially making surface recovery more difficult (Mafu et al., 1990; Mafu et al., 1991) . The orientation of a surface could interfere with adequate surface sampling and collection as seen in a study involving vertical and horizontal stainless steel surfaces. Taku et al. (2002) determined that greater recovery efficiency could be obtained by allowing the elution buffer to sit on the surface for 15 min-something that cannot be performed on a vertical surface. The mean recovery for horizontal surfaces and sinks using the cell scraper-aspiration method ranged from 32% to 71% while vertical stainless steel surfaces only obtained a mean recovery of 11% since the buffer was not in contact with the surface long enough to facilitate virus recovery (Taku et al., 2002) . Scherer et al. (2009) suggested physical properties of nonporous and porous could reduce virus recovery via trapping virus particles within the matrix/ crevices or facilitate enhanced virus recovery by smooth/porous surfaces. Mattison et al. (2007) suggested the low mean recovery of feline calicivirus (FCV) from strawberries might be due to its surface texture and how the crevices may shield viruses against environmental conditions. Furthermore, the authors observed a pH change in the elution buffer from 7.2 to 5.5 when strawberries were immersed, which could impact virus recovery by either partial viral inactivation or interference with FCV recovery (Mattison et al., 2007) . Overall, physical and chemical properties of nonporous and porous food and food contact surfaces could impact recovery efficiencies of enteric viruses. This review will focus on surface sampling techniques for enteric viruses from nonporous, inanimate surfaces. (Rönnqvist and Maunula 2016 ). There has not been an in vitro cell culture system for hNoVs available until recently (Ettayebi et al., 2016) , and until reproducible and readily available infectivity assays are developed, surrogates still provide much needed information on infectivity of hNoVs. Multiple surrogates are important for understanding infectivity due to variations in their genetic relatedness to hNoVs and the diversity among hNoV genotypes. Other cultivable viruses utilized in environmental persistence research include Aichi virus A (AiV) and HAV-both known human enteric pathogens (Cannon et al., 2006; Koopmans and Duizer, 2004 , Yeargin et al., 2015Cannon et al., 2006Cannon et al., 2006 Duizer, 2004, Yeargin et al., 2015) . Diversity among hNoV genotypes could impact the recovery efficiency from surfaces; however, studies focus mainly on hNoV GII.4 (Table 1 ). This focus is a result of GII.4 being the pandemic genotype of hNoV and accounting for over 80% of all hNoV outbreaks in the U.S. since 1996 (Glass et al., 2009 ). Surrogates provide essential information on hNoV infectivity in relation to viral persistence on food contact surfaces (FCS), and numerous studies have shown FCV, MNV, and TuV to remain infectious on multiple surfaces for at least 7 days or more (Arthur and Gibson 2015; Fallahi and Mattison 2011; Mattison et al., 2007) .",22.30622368045261,9.891881799158092

Others constructed new isolation wards and rooms or carried out extensive engineering modifications to existing structures. 22, [36] [37] [38] Those lacking such facilities and resources responded with innovative solutions. Three examples were: hospital staff attempting to create negative-pressure relative to hallways by using fans and windows opening to the exterior; the development of guidelines to enable the re-use of respirators; and the erection of glass walls in hallways to create anterooms to patients' rooms. 7, 22 Physical space separation There is evidence indicating that the risk of developing SARS was related to proximity to a case. 2, 5, 39, 40 In one study a 'Hierarchy of Risk' was developed which showed that the risk of infection increased with proximity of contact, and that in the absence of aerosol-generating procedures, exposures !1 m from a case of SARS (with or without contact) were those that posed the highest risk. 2 These results suggest that physical separation of SARS patients from HCWs, hospital visitors and other patients should reduce the transmission of SARS. Indeed, in many of the areas with a large number of SARS cases several different measures were implemented in order to do this. These included the rapid identification and isolation of possible SARS patients waiting in Emergency Departments; isolating potential SARS patients either individually or in cohorts; designating lifts for use by potential SARS cases only; and, using anterooms for the donning and removal of PPE. 3, 7, 22, 23 Handwashing Despite a number of studies demonstrating that handwashing is effective in reducing the transmission of pathogens, it is recognised that compliance among HCWs is poor. 41, 42 Although there have not been any formal evaluations of the impact of handwashing on SARS-CoV transmission, recent evidence indicates that HCWs who washed their hands while caring for SARS patients were less likely to develop SARS compared to those that did not. 30 Environmental decontamination SARS-CoV is present in all body fluids making precautions with waste disposal essential.

Indoor remediation can be very expensive, as demonstrated by the experience with the Hart Senate Office Building and the Brentwood Postal Facility after the 2001 US anthrax letter attacks, the latter of which took 1 year at a cost of approximately $130 million to clean up. Moreover, current decontamination chemicals (e.g., chlorine dioxide, methyl-formaldehyde, para-formaldehyde, methyl-bromide, hydrogen peroxide, and household bleach) are corrosive, carcinogenic, and/or toxic. Safer, more effective decontaminants are an important area for research and development, for example, gaseous germination agents that cause anthrax spores to germinate whereupon the vegetative bacillus becomes much more vulnerable to environmental degradation. Combining advanced decontamination agents with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) vacuuming could reduce the indoor decontamination problem to a manageable level, especially when combined with vaccination of the local population. Ultimately, a mixed decontamination strategy that takes advantage of environmental degradation, washing, chemical decontamination, and vacuuming where appropriate should be able to render public areas usable, but the cost may be quite high depending on the extent to which future decontamination technologies can avoid a repeat of the 2001 US anthrax decontamination experience.",23.087867647477893,7.768604348623868

The amount of viral shedding is the end result of the interaction between a replication-competent virus in susceptible host cells at the nasopharynx and the innate immune system of the host defense. Populations of virus often contain particles that are not capable of completing an infectious cycle. Though a single virus particle can theoretically initiate an infection, many perfectly competent virions fail because of nonproductive interactions with the extracellular matrix at the cell surface. Even virions that have successfully entered the cell may be delivered to a wrong compartment, thereby resulting in an abortive infection. Thus, viral RNA can be detected by RT-PCR with no viable viruses isolated on a cell culture. Only a sufficient amount of viral replication occurs and results in cytolysis with the induction of host proinflammatory damage will lead to symptomatic disease and subsequent seroconversion. 9 In these patients with more severe disease, a higher level of viral shedding is expected, and is manifested as a higher viral load on quantitative RT-PCR and even as a positive viral culture finding. Only 40.4% of those RT-PCR-positive respiratory secretions have a positive viral culture finding. 10 A lower amount of viral replication may result in low-level viral shedding with a negative cell culture and asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infection with or without seroconversion. 11 It is important to remember that some commercial sex workers employed in areas that are highly endemic for HIV do not seroconvert despite repeated sexual exposure to HIV-1; they did, however, have local HIV-specific immune responses in the genital tract. 12 It would be interesting if we can determine whether these RT-PCR-positive health-care workers have similar local or systemic cell-mediated immune responses to SARS-CoV.

Grouping of bats into persistently infectious bats and transiently infectious bats was supported by the CMR multistate model selection processes (Table 3) . By exploring various scenarios in epidemic models, we found that population-level viral persistence was marginally more probable when infectious periods were heterogeneous (bats were either transiently or persistently infectious; Table 4 ). In addition to a previous study that suggested persistent infection of coronavirus in bats in North America through the small number of bats sampled [23] , our study provides much validity by using larger number of bats sampled [21] , although the sample size is still not large enough to provide robust estimates. Further understanding of the potential and likelihood of within-host persistent infections is important to understand spillover of bat-borne viruses. Persistent infections contribute not only in maintaining viruses in a population but also in triggering pulses of virus shedding. Temporally synchronised stressors such as food shortage and reproduction may weaken the immune system of bats, facilitating persistent infections in infectious bats [38] . Thus, those temporally synchronised stressors can cause viral shedding from persistently infectious bats during a limited period, leading to pulses of viral shedding. Because spillover of bat-borne viruses has been associated with pulses of viral shedding from bats [38] , the finding of persistent infection in bats contributes in understanding spillover mechanisms of bat-borne viruses.",22.742321281744196,9.13563783734004

Furthermore, the advances in chemical synthesis of glycans coupled with the ability to probe finer nuances of glycan motif recognition by various lectins using glycan array platforms has substantially improved the knowledge on the diversity of glycan motifs recognized by various GBPs [65 ,66] . These GBPs can be directly used to stain host cell or tissue surfaces and multiplexing the staining of more than one GBP can expand the knowledge of the glycan motifs distributed on these surfaces [4, 67, 68] . As an example costaining of host tissues or cells with Sambucus nigra agglutinin I (SNA-I) which binds with high specificity to a2-6 sialylated glycans and Concanavalin A (ConA) which binds to trimannosyl core of N-linked glycans would give information on predominance of a2-6 sialylated glycans that are N-linked to the glycoproteins. These lectins can also be displayed in an array-like platform and samples such as whole viruses or virus-like particles comprising of the viral surface glycoprotein can be probed for their binding to such lectin-arrays [65 ,69,70,71] . This would again provide information on the prevalence of specific glycan motifs that are present as a part of the glycans on the viral surface glycoproteins. The advantages of using lectins is that it provides a read on the glycan motif in their physiological context either on the host tissue or cell or viral surface and do not require any additional processing that may change the structural diversity of the glycans before analysis. However, a limitation in this approach arises from the lack of a comprehensive panel of lectins that can completely decode the structural diversity of the glycans. As an example while lectins like SNA-I give an accurate picture of distribution of glycans capped by a2-6-linked sialic acid, the information on whether this motif is a part of highly branched N-linked glycans or a part of long oligosaccharide branch length cannot be deduced.",21.367984380029736,7.864987233277245

Intracellular infections, such as viruses and protozoans, which may have been acquired during postnatal development, may become exacerbated during pregnancy because of the suppressive effects on the Th1 cells. This suppression results in a decreased CMI response. The CMI effector cells, the T cytotoxic lymphocytes, function normally to control virtually all the viral infections such as canine herpesvirus. Intracellular bacterial infections, such as Brucella canis, become more pathogenic during pregnancy. In addition to the aforementioned effects on T cell function, macrophage function is also compromised, allowing opportunistic bacteria, which are usually confined to external mucosal surfaces of the body, to become systemic. Concurrent with the immunosuppression that accompanies pregnancy, there is an increased shedding of infectious microorganisms. This is considered to be an extension of impaired T cytotoxic lymphocyte function. Although the pregnant animal may appear clinically normal, her altered immune response results in an increased shedding of gastrointestinal viruses, such as canine coronavirus and canine rotavirus, and bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, usually during the periparturient period. This increase in shedding of infectious microorganisms is an important factor when addressing the issues of management of animals through this period of time ( Figure 14 -2).

Disaster planning and preparation at the ICU level continues to represent an area for improvement, especially in the area of vertical evacuation. Early initiation of patient evacuation efforts led to greater communication and coordination both within and between hospitals, but still left room for improvement in the areas of communication and leadership, especially in the area of patient distribution. Triage, prioritization, and documentation processes were highly variable, and emergency credentialing was frequently necessary to provide patients with the care that they needed during and after transport to new facilities. Phones, flashlights, and portable ventilators are important, high-yield resources that could be targeted for preparation in the event of future ICU evacuations. Many other areas for improvement above could be addressed by better efforts to incorporate ICU providers into hospital evacuation planning and training efforts. A possible solution to improve the ICU processes observed in this event includes the creation of standardized evacuation communication processes and documentation tools, managed by a critical care unit leader who coordinates care and plays a defined and integrated role in the Incident Command System. The development of a standard, uniform database utilized by all evacuating hospitals during a disaster could also better inform patient and system outcomes to further advance critical care evacuation practices in the future.

The majority of viruses remain viable longer on nonporous surfaces (Tables 2 and 3) ; however, there are exceptions (1, 27) . Astrovirus survives for 90 days on porous paper but only 60 days on nonporous aluminum (2) . Initial inoculation titer can prolong viral survival on environmental surfaces (66). Brady et al. (13) found that the viral survival decay rate increased with inoculum titer: a 10 4 virus inoculation could be detected up to 6 h longer than a 10 3 virus inoculation. Virus survival on fomites can also vary significantly within viral type and strain. Typically, nonenveloped enteric viruses remain viable longer on surfaces than enveloped respiratory viruses. The enteric viruses HAV, astrovirus, and rotavirus can all remain infective on surfaces for 2 months or longer (Table 3 ). In contrast, respiratory viruses usually remain viable for several hours to several days ( Table 2 ). Virus inactivation rates can be expressed as the log decay of virus titer divided by the total time of viral survival. For comparative purposes, we calculated inactivation coefficients (K i ) using the following calculation after all viral titers were normalized to the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) per ml of virus: [log 10 reduction (initial viral titer Ϫ final viral titer)/ml]/total hours of viral viability (64) . Inactivation coefficients are linear functions and were not used to calculate T 90 or T 99 values, which are the times required for the initial viral titer to decrease by 90% (T 90 ) and 99% (T 99 ), these values were calculated using the viral survival curve, which is typically not linear. Therefore, T 90 and T 99 values underestimate viral survival compared to inactivation coefficients (K i values). On nonporous surfaces, the enteric viruses reviewed typically exhibited inactivation rates at least 2 logs lower than respiratory viruses, with the exception of adenovirus and influenza virus ( Fig. 2  and 3 ; Tables 2 and 3 ). Four out of five enteric viruses examined in this review produced inactivation coefficients between 0.0021 and 0.0059 log 10 /h, whereas four out of five respiratory viruses produced inactivation rates between 0.167 and 0.625 log 10 /h. The higher inactivation coefficient found among respiratory viruses indicates a faster decay rate or decreased survival on surfaces ( Fig. 2 and 3 ). Variations in virus survival may also occur within a viral family or strain (66, 71) , as seen between the 12-h survival of coronavirus 229E and the 3-h survival of coronavirus OC43 ( (1) demonstrated that temperature and humidity variations had no effect on the survival (60 days) of HAV and rotavirus (Table 3) . However, temperature variations from 4°C to 20°C decreased the survival of astrovirus (T 90 change from 8 days to Ͻ24 h) and feline calicivirus (T 90 change from 10 days to Ͻ24 h) (2, 21) . Humidity influences the viral desiccation rate. Humidity in the United States can range from 14 to 94% in outdoor environments (76) . Indoor humidity varies depending on outdoor humidity, temperature, and varying indoor factors (76). Abad et al. (1) found that decreases in humidity could negatively impact HAV, rotavirus, and adenovirus survival (Table 3) . Humidity variations in the Abad et al. study (1) caused a significant decline in HAV survival (T 90 change from 35 days at 85% humidity to 11 days at 45% humidity). The majority of studies investigating the effects of humidity on respiratory viruses are aerosol studies. However, Sattar et al. (64) was one of the few studies that investigated respiratory virus survival on surfaces in which humidity was used as a variable. The study found that rhinovirus exhibits optimum survival at 50% humidity (Table 2 ) (64).",22.735016307379766,10.289272878965821

One factor was the statistical power of the study. A further possibility is that, despite having an antiviral effect, the solutions caused sensations in the nose that were confused with cold symptoms. Although the AE profile of citrate in the noses of normal volunteers was similar to that of normal saline, it is possible that this effect could be accentuated in the presence of a viral infection. An alternate explanation for the lack of clinical benefit is that a greater reduction in viral replication is needed to achieve efficacy. The 1-log reduction in viral shedding observed in the present trial is similar, however, to that reported in a clinical trial of tremacamra (soluble ICAM-1) [10] and is somewhat greater than that produced by interferon-a 2b or pleconaril [17, 18] . Each of these medications produced a small but significant clinical benefit in previous studies. Topical medications have an additional challenge of delivering medication to the site of infection. Infections with HRV can involve large lower airways in addition to the nasopharynx [19] , and delivery to these locations might be necessary to obtain optimal clinical benefits. Finally, it is possible that the spray enhanced either cellular or neural inflammation; both of these mechanisms have been linked to the pathogenesis of cold symptoms [1, 20] .

Finally, studies in children less than 3 months old showed a comparable level of viral shedding in the presence or absence of maternal antibodies. The young infants had minimal antibody responses, although there were detectable serum levels of IgG and IgA to the G protein. Mucosal antibodies were produced but at far lower levels than are seen in children older than 3 months of age. A second dose of vaccine, the response to which can be used as a surrogate for reinfection, resulted in rare shedding of the virus and no evidence of enhanced RSV illness once infected.

Scientific results then are regarded as something ""found by"" or ""disclosed to"" the scientist. Van Fraassen 26,27 sees scientific realism as a belief in a ""deep structure of reality"", to be revealed by scientific inquiry. We must, thus, in principle, be able to recognize the truth when we reach it, if not before. There is, however, also, the view that ""scientific results are to be construed as imprints made by the human mind upon Nature"", a view that accepts a level of relativism and subjectivism in the knowledge of scientific truth. Such a view is expressed in the writings of Polanyi 28 and Kuhn 29 and is apparent in the conjectures by Einstein and Bohr about aspects of scientific reality. 30 Truth is central to science: you can practice science only if you respect the truth. But who defines scientific truth? Scientific truth could be defined as that which scientists affirm and believe to be consistent with the accepted body of scientific knowledge. Scientific truth, then, is found, not given, and it is tested, ""subjected to verification"". But not all truth is verifiable or complete. Even Aristotle's argument that truth is the agreement with the facts of what is being asserted is not always possible to ascertain. And there are still those 31 who wonder if in a changing universe, the physical laws remain unchanging. Thus, ultimate, absolute, complete true knowledge is not in the court of science; even in science truth is elusive and the true nature of reality may not be amenable to knowing. Although it is in the nature of charge to be subject to the Coulomb force, writes Cartwright, 32 this nature does not in any way reveal the essence of charge.

For instance, in contrast to the NPA, the MPA suggests negatively charged hydrogen atoms and positive charges on the carbon atoms. Moreover, regardless the significant differences in the evaluation of the charge distribution by both methods, the MPA seems to overestimate the charge depletion and concentration between atoms in a bond. For example in 2-NPO-4-F, the MPA predicts charges of ?0.24 on N 1 and -0.78 on O 7 , while the NPA suggests ?0.04 and -0.52 eon these atoms, and thus different degree of bond polarity. By using different wave functions (B3LYP, HF, MP2) and the basis sets (6-311??G(df,pd) and aug-cc-pVDZ) to examine the dependency of both the NPA and Mulliken charge distribution on the level of theory, we found that the MPA provides inconsistent, and in some cases unreasonably fluctuating charge distribution. Most remarkably the MPA at the B3LYP/6-311??G(df,pd) level predicts for the NO 2 group negative charges on nitrogen and positive charges on the oxygen atoms (Table S7) leading to a bond polarity of the type: O ? -N --O ? . However, by using the HF/ 6-311??G(df,pd) method, it provides negative charges on nitrogen as well as on the oxygens (Table S8) . This example confirms the previously and repeatedly cited inconsistency of the Mulliken charge distribution and its basis set dependency [37] [38] [39] .",35.111786807679096,12.770580599989529

Another explanation, connected to the first one, was the handling of SARS from the main actors involved, primarily WHO and some of the countries affected. Early on it was indicated that there was probably no cure for the disease, leading many people to think that SARS was fatal in most cases. In fact, there were different reactions and symptoms of varying severity between different infected patients; there were successful treatments; and death rates were not dramatically high compared with some other diseases. Vivid accounts in the media of how the disease was spread -via hotel lift buttons, through being coughed on by a ""super-spreader"" and so on -also added to the sense of fear.

The important feature of both SW and SF networks is that they are highly connected: the average path length between random individuals is relatively short. Moreover, for SF networks, the node degree distribution follows a scale-free distribution. Hence, in many areas of natural and physical science, this new model structure has unveiled a rich range of behaviours. In this paper, we apply these methods to the modelling of the spread of SARS in Hong Kong; transmission is only allowed to occur along a limited number of direct links between individuals. By doing this, we will avoid making one of the assumptions underlying standard Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) models: a homogeneous fully connected population. The SIR model assumes that all individuals are susceptible to the disease and all suffer an equal, small, positive probability of contracting the virus. This homogeneous model leads to a continuous and smooth inter-day distribution of infections.

From Table 5 , it is apparent that the insertion of the nitro group in ortho position to the N-oxide moiety results in a withdrawal of charges from the ring atoms and the N-oxide oxygen. The substitution of hydrogens in different positions of 2-NPO by a fluorine atom does not show a clear systematic variation of the charge distribution in this diversity of fluoro 2-NPO compounds. The reason for that could be the alteration of the charge distribution within the ring represents a compromise between two competing effects of substituents: the strong negative inductive and resonance effects of the nitro group (increased electron density in meta position) and the negative inductive and positive resonance effects of the fluorine atom (higher electron density in ortho and para positions). The largest loss of charges, however, shows the C 6 atom of ?0.63 e -(?0.61 eas produced by MP2/augcc-pVDZ, Table S5 ) in 2-NPO-6-F. Also in this compound, the charge of the N 1 atom of ?0.007 e -(?0.03 e -) is close to neutrality and the N-oxide bond possesses a distinct polarity within this series of fluorinated 2-NPOs.

The core tables hold basic biological information about each viral strain and its genomic sequence (or sequences if the virus contains segmented genomes) as well as the genes coded for by each genome. The taxonomy tables provide the taxonomic classification of each virus. Taxonomic designations are taken directly from the Eighth Report of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV).

Gene properties may be generated from computational analyses such as calculations of molecular weight and isoelectric point (pI) that are derived from the amino acid sequence. Gene properties may also be derived from a manual curation process in which an investigator might identify, for example, functional attributes of a sequence based on evidence provided from a literature search. Assignment of 'gene ontology' terms (see below) is another example of information provided during manual curation.

Migrant workers often worked in labor-intensive industries, lived in overcrowded dormitories, and had little access to healthcare. Often living from check to check, they could not afford medical bills incurred by major diseases. Getting fired for illness only further exacerbated their economic difficulty and threatened their daily survival. Therefore, migrant workers suffering from major illnesses often had to travel back home for low-cost family care (Tang 2003) . To ensure the timely quarantine and treatment of farmers and migrant workers, China set aside a special fund of 2 billion yuan to provide free examinations, quarantines, and treatments to farmers who contracted SARS (""May 15"") . In addition, businesses were required to pay salaries to migrant workers who were quarantined or treated for SARS instead of firing them, thereby preventing mass exodus of migrant workers from SARS-affected areas. Official policies like these protected the economic interests of migrant workers affected by SARS or by quarantine orders, which in turn helped to humanize the anti-SARS policies and thus encouraged cooperation from affected citizens.",20.458866423227892,7.160603248129762

Although classic airborne spread of pathogens occurs via droplet nuclei, droplets can potentially contaminate environmental surfaces, depending on their size and prevailing environmental conditions, thereby creating secondary vehicles for pathogens. Therefore, targeting airborne pathogens could potentially provide an additional advantage by reducing environmental surface contamination. Our preliminary findings indicate that a reduction in the level of viable airborne bacteria using active air decontamination can also reduce bacterial contamination on environmental surfaces in the same setting. Therefore, targeting airborne pathogens could entail additional benefits, such as preventing or reducing the deposition of harmful microbes on secondary vehicles that include frequently touched environmental surfaces and also preventing or reducing their resuspension from these surfaces back into the air via a variety of indoor activities (Fig 1) . 8, 12, 17, 75, 76 Further studies should investigate the role air decontamination may play in reducing the contamination of environmental surfaces and its combined impact on interrupting the risk of pathogen spread in both domestic and institutional settings.",28.429028688763413,9.780227148055475

The distribution of more than 10 7 virus particles as an aerosol from projectile vomiting associated with norovirus infection suggests that the airborne inhalation route may be important in the transmission of infection. From the widespread environmental contamination resulting from norovirus infection, the virus environmental robustness and its low estimated infective dose of 10-100 particles, Caul (1994) also concludes that in addition to possible aerosol inhalation, hands and surfaces also play an important part in facilitating transfer of norovirus infection, either by direct fecal-oral transfer or by transfer to foods that are eaten without further cooking. Barker et al. (2004) investigated the transfer of norovirus from contaminated fecal material via fingers and clothes to other hand-contact surfaces using a PCR assay.

As expected, inoculation with aGM/prM + E had no adverse effects on the experimental ducks, confirming that the chimeric virus, as well as the NDV vector, were safe. In terms of the efficiency of the aGM/prM + E virus, its mean HI titer was two-fold higher than that of the LaSota vaccine at 14 dpi, suggesting that a stronger immune response could be elicited by the predominant NDV-matched vaccine, as has been reported in the literature (Hu et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2017; Xiao et al., 2012) . After virus challenge, there was no viral shedding for the immunized ducks, which indicates that a two-dose immunization can yield full protection. Although the mean HI titer of the LaSota vaccine was higher than 5.0 log 2 , viral shedding was not prevented even though the virus was not completely shed after NDV infection (Kang et al., 2016) . The sporadic reports of virulent NDV in waterfowl and outbreaks in intensive raising areas may be attributed to the lack of immunization or the efficiency of commercial vaccines. Therefore, our results provide an ideal choice for the control of ND in waterfowl. The mean VN titers of aGM/prM + E virus and HB vaccine were both less than 2.0 log 2 after primary immunization, indicating that one round of immunization was inadequate. The inactivated vaccines of most flavivirus cannot provide sufficient protection in one dose Wang et al., 2015a) , and many recombinant NDVvectored vaccines require a prime-boost strategy . As our results showed, boost immunization of aGM/prM + E elicited a strong antibody response, resulting in VN titers against DTMUV higher than the commercially available inactivated DTMUV vaccine, and the former afforded 80% protection for ovarian lesions in layer ducks compared to 60% for the latter. As to viral shedding, the former afforded 60% protection compared to 40% for the latter. In general, the magnitude of the immune response to live viral vaccines for primary immunization is substantially greater and broader compared to subunit protein or inactivated virus vaccines (Belshe et al., 2007) . Our results revealed that the prime-boost strategy has a better immune effect in terms of not only on shortening the time required to mount an effective antibody response but also strengthening its protective effects.",20.529124469220534,8.650175790718162

A number of studies indicate that clinical disease associated with BCoV in calves is more severe than rotavirus, with higher mortality rates. Affected calves tend to be slightly older than calves infected with pure ETEC or pure rotavirus. They average 7 to 10 days of age at onset, with some observed as late as 3 weeks of age. The virus causes a severe enterocolitis characterized by villous enterocyte destruction in the small intestine and destruction of both ridges and crypts in the large intestine. Maldigestion, malabsorption, and inflammation all contribute to the pathophysiology of coronavirus diarrhea in calves. The virus is cytolytic, and affected villous enterocytes in the small intestine are replaced by cuboidal cells from the crypts, but the colonic lesions leave denuded mucosa in affected areas of the colon. The severity of this damage helps explain why coronavirus enteritis, unlike rotavirus, may cause some flecks of blood to appear in the stool and can kill calves even in a germ-free isolation facility. Thus, in the natural setting, coronavirus enteritis creates a severe clinical diarrhea and can also be associated with > 50% mortality when combined with other viral, bacterial and C. parvum infections.",22.082259354287512,8.711957414997562

This, together with the prolonged viral shedding, could partly explain the propensity for this infection to be transmitted in healthcare settings. We observed that all those who shed virus for a prolonged period (arbitrarily defined as the shedding viruses >6 weeks after onset of symptoms) had their positive samples collected while still critically ill and had received intensive care. The infectiousness of these patients is difficult to discuss because the virus was detected by RT-PCR but not by virus isolation. Nevertheless, further investigations on whether the adverse outcome could be related to inadequate viral clearance are worth pursuing. Available data that compare the diagnostic yield of various specimen types are still limited. Wu et al. found that virus was detected in 73% (49/67) of liquid nasopharyngeal gargling samples by a fluorescent PCR (16) . However, our data showed that throat washing samples were the most inferior respiratory specimens. In addition to the difference in the sensitivity of detection assays used, the procedures of gargle sample collection could have affected the diagnostic yield. Yam et al. reported that nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens collected between days 1 and 5 after admission provided a similar diagnostic yield when compared to stool samples collected between days 5 and 10 (17). However, data comparing respiratory and stool specimens collected at the same period were not available in their study. In an investigation on a community outbreak in Hong Kong, Peiris et al. reported that respiratory viral shedding peaked during the second week (15) .

For more extensive environmental sampling and dispersal studies, A4 paper sheets have been suspended vertically or laid on horizontal surfaces as required. These are retrieved for later forensic testing and have been particularly successful in identifying sources of environmental contamination and personal exposure. This approach avoids extensive spraying of the work environment, the need for low-light conditions, and the inconvenience of spraying of clothing or skin surfaces. To obtain additional information regarding the potential for splash contamination, we have evaluated also the dual use of the luminol-based product with Glo-Germä oil as a simulant. Visible chemiluminescence from the luminol reaction does not interfere with the distinct blue fluorescence of the Glo-Germ product under ultraviolet illumination and the two products can be used simultaneously to provide further information about both actual and potential hazards of splash contamination. In low-light conditions, photographic recording is possible using a film speed of ISO 400 with an exposure time of up to 30 s at f/2.8, which is suitable also for the recording of the fluorescent Glo-Germ image after introduction of blacklight illumination. Used together, these products represent complementary tools for the investigation of splash contamination as well as the efficacy of environmental and other cleaning regimens. 3 Both viruses have been involved in nosocomial outbreaks, for example in a long-term care facility for elderly institutionalised persons. 4e7 To our knowledge, no investigations on the survival of HMPV and HCoV-NL63 have been published.

This Strategy had three primary objectives: (1) to ""integrate and enhance national biosurveillance efforts"" to provide decision-makers with timely information in a crisis; (2) to increase the network of national expertise and capabilities for rapid detection and understanding (i.e., situational awareness) of emerging crises; and (3) to implement new approaches for considering and addressing uncertainty in the decision-making process. Included as core functions are environmental scanning; integration of human, animal, and plant health information; and assessment and forecasting of potential consequences. One month prior to the Strategy's release, the U.S. government established an interagency working group on science and technology for biosurveillance, which was chaired by the White House Office and Science and Technology Policy and DoD. This working group was tasked with developing the research and development priorities for achieving the core functions of the National Strategy for Biosurveillance. The working group discussion culminated in the release of the National Biosurveillance Science and Technology Roadmap in 2013, which defined the key priorities for detecting unusual or above-baseline events, anticipating risk including assessment of the potential consequences of incidents, identification and characterization of threats to human health, and integration of, analysis of, and information-sharing with key decision-makers, responders, and healthcare providers. The roadmap highlights current national activities in each of these areas and identifies capability needs to achieve the described priorities. The priorities encompassed the production of baseline data of natural or man-made human, animal, plant, and environmental health events; assessment of emergence and disease dynamics; development of rapid detection and diagnosis technologies and systems; and improvements in sharing, integration, and communication of biosurveillance data. This strategy and roadmap provided a framework for enhancing U.S. capabilities for early warning of natural and/or man-made biological events, which could be leveraged for detection and early warning against chemical, radiological, nuclear, and environmental incidents.",23.696453589319955,10.092538863760153

Surface contamination with viruses is common in households, industrial settings and healthcare facilities, and the role of these contaminated surfaces in the transmission of certain viruses, such as norovirus, is recognized increasingly. 1 Many viruses have a low infectious dose and are shed at high titres from infected individuals, even when the infection is asymptomatic. 2 They can contaminate dry surfaces, survive for extended periods and be transmitted to susceptible hosts from surfaces. 2, 3 Once dried on inanimate surfaces, viruses are less susceptible to disinfection than when hydrated in suspension. 4 This susceptibility is further reduced by the presence of organic soil and viral clumping. 4 Disinfection of surfaces is an effective method for reducing the risk of exposure to viruses and interrupting their spread. 5 However, some viruses, such as norovirus, are resistant to some commonly used hospital disinfectants. 6, 7 In addition, conventional manual disinfection of surfaces is labour intensive, and it appears that a two-stage disinfection procedure, including surface rehydration followed by disinfection, is required for effective inactivation of viruses dried on surfaces. 4, 6 Reliance on an operator to ensure appropriate selection, formulation, distribution and contact time of the agent further limits the repeatability and efficacy of the manual disinfection process. Hence, viral contamination can persist after standard or even enhanced manual environmental cleaning and disinfection. 6,8e10 Hydrogen peroxide vapour (HPV) is a novel 'no-touch' automated decontamination technology that removes the reliance on the operator to ensure distribution, contact time and process repeatability, and has therefore been used for environmental decontamination in various settings to improve the efficacy of disinfection. 11 Two types of HPV are available: non-condensing vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) technology (Steris) and condensing HPV technology (Bioquell). Condensing systems inject hydrogen peroxide until the air in the enclosure becomes saturated and hydrogen peroxide begins to condense on surfaces. Non-condensing systems dry the vapour stream as it is returned to the generator. 12 Both condensing and noncondensing systems are registered with the Environmental Protection Agency, and have well-established efficacy against bacterial spores and other microbes. 12e14 A study published in the 1990s evaluated the efficacy of a non-condensing VHP system against a range of viruses. 14 However, limited evidence is available for the virucidal activity of condensing HPV systems. Recently, several studies have demonstrated the in-vitro activity of condensing HPV systems against individual viruses, including feline calicivirus (FCV), 11 adenovirus, 15 lactococcal bacteriophages 16 and MS2 coliphage. 17 However, to the authors' knowledge, no studies published to date have evaluated the efficacy of condensing HPV systems against a range of viruses exposed under the same conditions. As such, this study evaluated the in-vitro virucidal efficacy of a condensing HPV system against a number of structurally distinct viruses of importance in the healthcare, veterinary and public sectors. These included a small non-enveloped RNA virus (FCV, a norovirus surrogate), a larger non-enveloped DNA virus (human adenovirus) and three enveloped RNA viruses: transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV, a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [SARS-CoV] surrogate), avian influenza virus (AIV) and swine influenza virus (SwIV). supplemented with 150 IU/mL penicillin, 150 mg/mL streptomycin, 50 mg/mL neomycin, 1 mg/mL fungizone and 8% foetal bovine serum.

Table 2 lists the electric mobility values, which were determined based on the particle charge distribution measured at t = 3 min.The mobility changes very slowly with the time of ionization following the logarithmic function of the diffusion charging model. From Eq. (4), if the air is ionized by the most powerful VI-2500 emitter, the particle electric charges increase on average only by approximately 34% while the ionization time increases 100-fold (from t=3 min to t=300 min=6 h). Being proportional to the particle charge [see Eq. (5)], the mobility would also change by 34% in 6 h. Since in our experiments t=1 h, we concluded that the particle charge distribution measured at t=3 min is representative of the particle electric mobility during the entire 1-hour test. It is seen from Table 2 that the particle electric mobility was not dependent on the particle size. This can be attributed to the combination of the space field charging (effective for larger particles) and the diffusion charging (effective for smaller ones). The suppressed effect of the particle size on their electric mobility can help explain why the decay of the non-dimensional fractional concentration was not dependent on the particle size (see Fig. 3 ).",24.804925421054254,8.681723897368988

For example, based on alignment of influenza A virus segment 3 (PA) from >1000 strains, researchers recently identified a conserved region that leads to a pause and ribosomal frame shift during translation [27 ] . This results in a fusion protein called PA-X consisting of the N-terminus of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the newly discovered peptide. This protein appears to have nuclease activity that dampens the host antiviral response. What this study illustrates is that comparative genomics of well-studied viruses can reveal exciting, novel genomic features with implications for virus replication, pathogenicity, and interactions with the hosts. In addition to these kinds of discoveries, the characterizations 482 Host-microbe interactions: viruses [49, 50] of specific viral genotypes or viral variants that associate with virulence can lead to enhanced diagnostic assays that provide information that was not previously available to clinicians. In a new generation of diagnostic tests, rapid sequencing assays could be used not only to detect viruses in patient samples but to provide information about the viral subtype and the presence of virulence genes, which could be used to predict disease severity and outcome. Sequence-based diagnostic tests could also be used to identify the presence of antiviral drug resistance alleles, which would inform the management of some viral infections, including influenza A and cytomegalovirus. Furthermore, ultra deep sequencing (resulting in >100-1000 sequences at each base position of the viral gene or genome) could be used to assess viral variation and quasispecies, which could be important for monitoring emerging pathogens or to development effective vaccines. Sequencing assays aimed at the human transcriptome also have the potential to be developed into clinical tests to measure the host response to viral infection, which may help both with diagnosis and selection of treatment.

Because of that, once formed biofilms are an important factor of persistence of microorganisms on surfaces in nature as well as in industrial or medical areas [22, 29, 12] . The persistence on inanimate surfaces is prolonged and depends of the environmental conditions, especially the humidity. Also on hospital surfaces biofilms were demonstrated on a number of objects and surfaces, such as sterile supply buckets, opaque plastic doors, venetian blind cords, and sink rubbers, and it was possible to cultivate viable bacteria. Currently, there is not enough research to elucidate whether presence or absence of biofilm affect the risk of transmission or possibility for crosstransmission. However, multi-drug resistant bacteria may not only be protected within biofilms, which may be the mechanism why they persist within the hospital environment [114] , but may also exchange virulence factors among their own species or to other species present in biofilms as well [29, 43, 109 ].",24.62910765363125,9.840191228525557

Grouping of bats into persistently infectious bats and transiently infectious bats was supported by the CMR multistate model selection processes (Table 3) . By exploring various scenarios in epidemic models, we found that population-level viral persistence was marginally more probable when infectious periods were heterogeneous (bats were either transiently or persistently infectious; Table 4 ). In addition to a previous study that suggested persistent infection of coronavirus in bats in North America through the small number of bats sampled [23] , our study provides much validity by using larger number of bats sampled [21] , although the sample size is still not large enough to provide robust estimates. Further understanding of the potential and likelihood of within-host persistent infections is important to understand spillover of bat-borne viruses. Persistent infections contribute not only in maintaining viruses in a population but also in triggering pulses of virus shedding. Temporally synchronised stressors such as food shortage and reproduction may weaken the immune system of bats, facilitating persistent infections in infectious bats [38] . Thus, those temporally synchronised stressors can cause viral shedding from persistently infectious bats during a limited period, leading to pulses of viral shedding. Because spillover of bat-borne viruses has been associated with pulses of viral shedding from bats [38] , the finding of persistent infection in bats contributes in understanding spillover mechanisms of bat-borne viruses.",22.35136002491734,8.998801397450642

Based on the limited experimental data on survival time, the activation energy and frequency factor for the SARS coronavirus in a specific environment can be estimated and then applied to predict more information inaccessible through experiment. The currently available experimental data for the survival times of SARS coronavirus is very limited, and the measurements only reflect certain specific cases. It is very necessary to perform systematic tests on the survival times of SARS coronavirus subject to electric, magnetic, acoustic, optical, thermal or acid-alkali effects with different strengths. Only in this way, can the data bank for the activation and factor be established. The current data for the survival times of the SARS coro-navirus provided by different labs appears a little disperse from each other. Their accuracy is in need of re-evaluation. One possible way can be that, the same SARS coronavirus from the only source should be distributed to multiple labs over the world for independent tests on the survival time of the sample under the same experimental conditions strictly defined. In this way, deviation from each test can be tested and thus allows for a comprehensive understanding on the SARS coronavirus. Such strategy will also be helpful for testing the variability of SARS coronavirus. The causes to kill the SARS coronavirus can be attributed to the effects of changing the activation energy and frequency factor. Any drug or engineered way capable of inducing a death of SARS coronavirus will be beneficial for the treatment of SARS. Therefore, it is critical to perform experimental study on the survival or replication of SARS coronavirus either in vivo or vitro. Through a comprehensive analysis on the effects of various physical and chemical factors, one can establish the possible drug or engineering way.

For this purpose, uncertainties for the activation energy, temperature, frequency factor and degree of denature are all prescribed as 10%. Then the uncertainty of the predicted survival time at room temperature 25°C is Dt=t 0 ¼ 0:88: Presented in Fig. 5 are estimated survival times for more situations. From that, one can find that the temperature and activation energy affect most to accurately predict the survival time. From (17), we can draw a conclusion that at a high temperature, the accuracy for predicting the survival time is also high, while at low temperature, the prediction accuracy will become worse or even have several times of errors. What appear more reliable from the theoretical prediction is the average survival time which overall reflects the reality. However, the real value usually fluctuates around this average magnitude. This conclusion would be very useful in correctly interpreting the current or future measured results. When in the air or in human body, if certain disinfector, acid and alkali substance, drug, bacterin, or some chemical and physical factors may induce variations of the activation energy and frequency of the SARS coronavirus, it is possible a simple heating process would kill the virus. On the contrary, the survival and replication capability of the SARS coronavirus may be significantly enhanced, its ability of anti-drug, heat resistance and infection will increase. Theoretically speaking, all these situations are possible.

Revealing the denaturation and replication mechanisms of SARS coronavirus has great importance for successfully fighting SARS. However, experiments related to SARS coronavirus are extremely dangerous and therefore restricted only to certain specific labs with high safety standard. Clearly, predicting the behaviors of SARS coronavirus in a wide variety of environmental conditions, which are not easily accessible, are thus critically necessary. In this study, we proposed to quantify the survival time of SARS coronavirus either in vitro or in vivo, through introducing thermal rate process models established from the well-known Arrhenius law. The complex physical and chemical behaviors of the SARS coronavirus can then be attributed to its activation energy, frequency factor, damage function as well as the surrounding environmental conditions. Based on the first data on stability and resistance of SARS coronavirus measured by members of WHO laboratory network, the rate coefficients involved in the above equations were estimated for the first time. Predictions on the survival time of SARS coronavirus in different temperature scale were then performed. It was found theoretically that, such survival time falls in an extremely wide range, say from several seconds in high temperature to an almost infinitely long time in a low temperature environment, which has already or is being supported by the currently available tests data. Applications of the present theory to interpret several existing phenomena were presented and their implementations in developing new technical ways for SARS prevention and clinical therapy were discussed. Uncertainties involved in the theoretical models were also analyzed and predicted. Parametric studies were performed to test the effects of the rate coefficients to the survival time of SARS coronavirus. Some important factors, which can significantly vary the denaturation or replication process of SARS coronavirus were pointed out. Through regulating the parameters involved in the equation, certain potential therapies either through drug delivery or engineering approach to treat the SARS disease can possibly be established. Extension of the present model for further studies was also suggested. This study opens a new theoretical way for probing into the complex behaviors of SARS coronavirus. Named by the world health organization (WHO), severe acute respiratory syndrome-SARS is a newly emerging world-wide infectious disease [1] [2] [3] , which is also commonly called atypical pneumonia in China [1] [2] [3] [4] . Since its outbreak, SARS has brought about serious threatening on the human health. Up to now, investigating the pathogenesis and treatment therapy on SARS keeps receiving great attentions over the world. Some encouraging progresses have been achieved in the SARS research such as identification of cause of disease [5] [6] [7] , gene sequencing [8] [9] [10] , virus detection [11] , epidemiology analysis [12, 13] , drug and bacterin development [14] , pathology [15] , and clinical therapy [16, 17] etc. It now becomes clear that, the pathogeny to induce SARS is a brand new type of coronavirus, whose behavior turns out rather unique and had never been found before in nature. However, since little is known about the properties of SARS and no effective drugs are available, successful treatments on this disease at the present stage are extremely difficult, if not impossible. Clearly, revealing the physical and chemical behaviors of the SARS coronavirus either in or outside the human body will be very beneficial for fighting the SARS. One of the latest advancements made by the WHO multicentre collaborative network (MCN) on SARS is the successful test on the survival time of SARS coronavirus under several different environmental conditions [18] . Owing to this contribution, we now get to know that the survival time for the SARS coronavirus in the air spans from hours to days or even longer time. Such a huge difference in time scale is rather perplexing, whose interpretation is waiting for great efforts. In fact, the survival behavior of SARS coronavirus is a complex issue, which depends both on the surroundings and the virus itself [19] . To reveal the intrinsic mechanisms, a systematic theory concise in concept would be very desirable. In this study, we proposed to quantify the denaturation or replication process of the SARS coronavirus through a rate equation theory and new models capable of comprehensively characterizing the physical and chemical behaviors of SARS coronavirus will be established.",18.31868624203156,7.971238438581056

The present theory appears useful not only for better understanding the spreading and survival mechanisms of the SARS coronavirus, it also suggests an important clue to develop efficient drugs, bacterin and clinical therapy. For example, if certain strategy capable of varying the activation energy, frequency factor and temperature of the SARS coronavirus can be found, it is very possible to set up a useful way for fighting the SARS. In fact, such effort has been reflected in the current SARS research activities. Compared to the ways of developing bacterin and drug, physical therapy appears much direct in its output results. For example, by testing the killing effect of a group of various physical factors to the in vitro and in vivo SARS coronavirus, it is possible to quickly screen out useful engineering approaches for treating the SARS. The currently available approaches worthy of trying are as follows [31] : Based on the temperature sensitivity of the SARS coronavirus, one can develop various heating methods for the hyperthermia and disinfection purposes; While from the non-thermal effects produced by the electromagnetic wave (static or dynamic electric stimulation, radio frequency), the optical wave (laser or violet), acid and alkali environment (by varying the pH value), the mass diffusion (high concentration oxygen or human tolerable disinfector), or delivered target substance (drug or bacterin) etc., one can also find useful ways to intervene the rate process of the SARS coronavirus and then successfully prevent or cure it.

Depicted in Fig. 3 are the predicted survival times of the Fig. 3 as Fig. 4 and define the temperature above 20°C as thermally important temperature. In the following, we will make a few discussions on the survival behaviors of SARS coronavirus at several special temperatures. If the environmental temperature is at 37°C, Fig. 4 shows that the survival time for the SARS coronavirus is t 0 ¼ 3:97 h. Therefore, at a hot season such as summer, it is generally not easy for the SARS coronavirus to survive, and possibility for inducing the disease epidemic will be significantly decreased. On the other hand, if intentionally heating the virus by using the tumor hyperthermia temperature 42°C, which is bearable by human body, the predicted survival time for the SARS coronavirus is t 0 ¼ 2:24 h (see Fig. 4 ). Consequently, treatment of SARS through high temperature heating is possible, as long as the heating can be kept to a long enough time. Because hyperthermia therapy is a relatively safe and non-noxious way, it is worthy of trying to cure SARS, especially since no miracle drug and definite treatment strategy are available at the present time. Besides, if the temperature was further increased to a higher however still bearable level, the treatment time can be evidently shortened. For example, if choosing heating temperature 56°C to do calculation, the predicted survival time for the SARS coronavirus is only t 0 ¼ 0:49 h. In addition, if certain assistant drug was designed to decrease the activation energy or increase the frequency factor of the SARS coronavirus, the virus could possibly be killed by an ordinary heating under a relatively low temperature. In this sense, combining drug delivery and hyperthermia to cure SARS is worth of investigation. We have proposed an engineering approach to restrain the replication of SARS coronavirus through directly ventilating hot oxygen to the human alveolus [30] . Should be pointed out that, the above analysis is performed based on the data of SARS coronavirus in air. Factors in human body are rather complex such as that there exist both factors favorable for immune or drug to react and that for the virus to replicate. Therefore, when developing a 4 . Thermally important temperature scale to kill SARS coronavirus treatment therapy in clinics, such comprehensive factors should be fully considered. In certain extreme situation such as in a high temperature environment, the SARS coronavirus can only survive for a short period. From Fig. 4 , when the temperature approaches 80°C, the predicted result shows that the SARS coronavirus will denature within 3 min. This conclusion has great importance for practice. We have proposed to heat a polluted room to completely kill the virus inside [31] . It seems now clear that, 80°C is an appropriate temperature to efficiently kill the virus. Killing the SARS coronavirus to clean the room is a new way of disinfection and produces no pollution to the environment. Such method is worth of investigation. Overall, the above results predicted from (33) accord well with the currently available measurement and observed phenomena [18] . Although the theoretical equation is founded from limited data, its efficiency in prediction is satisfactory. Theoretically, the time for the SARS coronavirus to live falls in an extremely wide range, but not just the currently reported value. This time depends on the magnitudes of the P, E a and T and the physical and chemical factors capable of changing these parameters. However, we should point out that, the experimental tests are still far from being enough, since different environmental factors and substrates will have effects on the survival time of the virus. Therefore, to completely understand the survival behavior of the SARS coronavirus, strictly defining the test conditions and perform corresponding work are still very necessary.",17.668753248306746,7.765385299571774

Antiviral treatment of ABV has not been successful to date. 73 Some authors 100, 114 reported that amantadine hydrochloride reduced clinical symptoms in birds, but others 72 could not see an effect in reducing the viral shedding. It remains, therefore, unclear what the mode of action could have been in reducing the symptoms in the described studies. Ribavirin was reported to reduce ABV infection in cells in tissue cultures but also did not demonstrate an effect in reducing viral shedding in birds. 115 As long as no direct antiviral drug is available to reduce ABV infection, a treatment focus might be to interrupt the pathogenesis, thus not allowing the virus to trigger clinical disease. To achieve this, immunosuppressive drugs might be promising, as an increasing survival time of experimentally infected rats with BDV has been described. 91 This therapy focuses on selective T cell suppression, for example, accomplished with cyclosporine, and has been described as beneficial in single case reports in birds treated with cyclosporine-A. 116 Controlled studies in infected and clinically ill birds are necessary to prove the benefits. Additionally, it needs to be discussed how practical it is to immunosuppress a bird and reduce ABVrelated symptoms, which would potentially then make the bird more susceptible to other infections. Those birds must then definitely be monitored very closely and may also return to clinical states of disease with PDD when immunosuppressive treatment is stopped. However, studies into this direction will be necessary to evaluate the pros and cons of this type of treatment. Recently, a study suggesting an immunomodulating approach using robenacoxib (anti-COX-2 nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug) in combination with mycobacterial extracts was reported as being promising. The complete mixture applied remained proprietary, but it was reported that the T cell response was somehow redirected. 117 However, those studies had certain drawbacks, as proper case controls were lacking, and therefore the results should be considered carefully and need further confirmation.",16.403363311935138,6.406961442904705

Environmental health impacts of agricultural antibiotic use, including the observation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria of animal origin in areas surrounding livestock operations, could also be mitigated by such measures (Landers 2012) . Globalization and the documented epidemics during the study period, most notably severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Nipah-like virus, and H5N1, are evidence for the need to strengthen surveillance of emerging diseases, including resistant strains in even remote areas of the world (Xing et al., 2010 , Kerkhove, 2013 . In May 2005, the World Health Organization passed an amendment mandating the reporting of 7 diseases in member countries (Steiger, 2005) . Although none of these reportable diseases include antibiotic resistance, this important step can be a platform on which surveillance programs can be built to monitor the emergence of resistance in the environment in remote areas. Information gathering of agricultural antibiotic use is necessary to inform treatment recommendations for people in affected areas. Improvement of government animal health services to strengthen outreach to the remote populations is needed to assist them to protect their livelihood, monitor animal health, and prevent emergence of resistant bacteria in such populations.",24.128441741925727,10.882182556193854

Decontamination of victims after the release of a biologic agent is less important than during a chemical or radiologic attack because most patients would seek medical care after the incubation period, having decontaminated themselves during this period with showers and clothing changes. In contrast, an announced attack with aerosolized biologic agents would require decontamination. Decontamination with water can cause significant heat loss in children because of their larger surface to body area. Hypothermia can occur without precautions such as the use of warming lights or blankets [4] . Decontamination similar to that recommended after a chemical attack might be necessary [19] Health care professionals who help to decontaminate patients or handle contaminated clothing must wear a gown, gloves, head and shoe covers, and an N95 (disposable) respirator. N-95 respirators are often used in tuberculosis (TB) isolation rooms, in transport of TB cases, or in other areas of the health care facility. When high-risk procedures such as bronchoscopy or necroscopy are conducted, respiratory protection exceeding the CDC standard performance criteria may be needed, such as full face piece negative-pressure respirators, powered airpurifying respirators (PAPRs), or positive-pressure airline-type respirators equipped with a half-mask or full face piece.

Several vector-borne diseases might respond to temperature changes associated with urbanization, particularly as these areas can also provide irrigated regions necessary for vector reproduction [2] . Specifically, more moderate winters and the dampened seasonality of urban centers could increase the survival, breeding success and activity of arthropod vectors that are essential for the transmission of many pathogens. In Stockholm, Sweden, for example, such conditions have lengthened the period of activity in the tick Ixodes ricinus, coinciding with an elevated incidence of tick-borne encephalitis in rodents and humans [40] .

Evidence from experimental as well as epidemiological studies indicates that environmental surfaces may also play a role in the nosocomial spread of respiratory and enteric nosocomial viral pathogens. 8 The capacity of a given virus to spread from hostto-host is determined by, among other things, its ability to remain viable during transit to the susceptible host.

The most important contribution to survival is perhaps the protection afforded to the virus by the fluid in which it is discharged. Virus survival in the environment in general is inversely proportional to air temperature. Relative humidity (RH) also has a pronounced effect on virus survival and its effect is modulated by air temperature: Enveloped viruses usually survive better in dryer conditions and lower RH than can be tolerated by non-enveloped viruses. 8, 10 Virus transfer from contaminated to clean surfaces Apart from direct contamination, both animate and inanimate surfaces can become contaminated indirectly through transfer of virus from other vehicles ( Figure 1 ). Of these, deposition by settling of virus-containing aerosols or contact with contaminated fluids are obvious. Less obvious are the transfers, which may occur between different types of surfaces. Our laboratory-based studies on rotavirus transfer between animate-inanimate, animate-animate and inanimate-animate surfaces have shown that virus transfer: (a) readily occurs irrespective of the nature of donor and recipient surfaces, (b) was reduced with increase in the age of the inoculum, most likely due to greater loss of moisture, (c) was directly proportional to the amount of pressure applied during contact and (d) increased substantially when friction was applied during contact. 11 Interrupting the spread of viruses Figure 2 illustrates the many applications of microbicides in hospitals for controlling the environmental spread of pathogens including viruses. The use of such chemicals in infection control in general operates on the basic premise that the risk of acquiring a given infection is directly proportional to the amount of its causative agent in the vicinity and that proper use of microbicides lowers this risk by reducing the pathogen load. Microbicides can also interrupt pathogen transfer from contaminated to clean surfaces. In hospitals, viruses which lend themselves to interruption by proper microbicide use are those which spread mainly through hands, fomites, medical devices, and environmental surfaces.",20.445073782899833,7.698434531514445

The OH goal is to assemble a comprehensive set of data across a broad spectrum of expertise, and to thereby provide solutions that are of benefit to human wellbeing within ecological settings. Most recently, this idea is being framed as effectiveness gains through dynamic cooperation in environmental contexts, and has the effect of raising environmental concerns on par with concurrent efforts in public health such as in disease surveillance and animal management.

This could easily capture the idea of OH as broadening public health into diverse fields.

In addition, a significantly large disparity in the distribution of electric charge between HOMO and LUMO was observed. When NIC binds to the amino acid residues of pepsin by charge transfer, the benzene ring and carbonyl group are the main binding groups. Moreover, the binding forces may presumably be π-π stacking or hydrogen bonding. In light of the weak interaction of NIC with pepsin, the ester groups could be the main contributors to the hydrophobic binding force [15] . The results of quantum chemistry calculations can provide a theoretical basis of how to analyze the model of drug binding with pepsin.",21.156831839769268,8.345742891908898

This indicates that differences in the epidemiologic characteristics of these viruses probably arise from other factors, including high viral loads in the upper respiratory tract and the potential for persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 to shed and transmit the virus while asymptomatic. 3, 4 Our results indicate that aerosol and fomite transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is plausible, since the virus can remain viable and infectious in aerosols for hours and on surfaces up to days (depending on the inoculum shed). These findings echo those with SARS-CoV-1, in which these forms of transmission were associated with nosocomial spread and super-spreading events, 5 and they provide information for pandemic mitigation efforts.

At a global scale, the likelihood of a global flu pandemic will certainly modify tourist travel patterns away from affected areas. In addition, the affected areas would most likely see their tourism sector respond in much the same way that SARS (Lumsdon & Page, 2004) led to the rapid loss of inbound tourism to destinations like Hong Kong where a 70% drop in the market occurred. Yet the important point to stress here, is the point at which the World Health Organisation declares a pandemic is in existence, and thereby triggering a downshift in global and regional travel. The same principle also applies with reference to many of the other issues listed in Table 2 . It is the point at which the media and tourist perception leads to a reaction against travel to regions affected by specific problems, triggering a behaviour change that is critical for the tourism industry and destinations. This is probably much clearer with reference to more tangible and easily understood human risks such as terrorism or a natural disaster as opposed to medical or health risks that are less tangible. Even so, tourist travel still has a considerable propensity to recover after the issue has subsided from media attention and travel behaviour begins to see a degree of normality return. This was evident in the case of SARS, where recovery in passenger loadings on Asian airlines 6 months after the event signalled recovery (Page, 2005) .",20.48650808446288,7.706177449320136

By air sampling, hPIV-1 was isolated from air obtained in only one of 150 infected children at a distance of 60 cm [24] . However, nasal secretions can travel a distance greater than 10 feet to contaminate surrounding fomites [23] . An experimental study demonstrated that hPIV can survive in stainless steel for 10 h [16] . Although the transfer of hPIV-3 from finger to finger or from finger to metal disc did not occur, hPIV-3 could be transferred from contaminated disks to clean hands [25] . Therefore, person-toperson spread by direct hand contact appears to be an unlikely mode of transmission, whereas contaminated surfaces may lead to direct self-inoculation. To date, only these pieces of indirect experimental evidence have supported contaminated surfaces as a mode of hPIV-3 transmission. In this context, the extensive environmental contaminations and prolonged environmental presence of hPIV-3 were clearly demonstrated, and these findings may partially explain why hPIV-3 is easily spread in the haematology ward. In addition, this emphasizes the importance of disinfection of environmental surfaces. It is noteworthy that hPIV-3 infection was documented in one minimally symptomatic healthcare worker who obtained this virus from the hPIV-3-infected patients. Although it is not exactly known whether asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic healthcare workers can transmit hPIV-3, asymptomatic hPIV-3 viral shedding in the nasopharynx among immunocompetent hosts and the previous outbreak reports suggest the potential role of asymptomatic healthy carriers in nosocomial transmission [9, 17, 26] . In our data, we could not carry out universal screening for healthcare workers during the outbreak, thus precluding our ability to define the precise role of none-tominimal symptomatic healthcare workers in nosocomial transmission. However, since the same nursing team cared for the index patients and the latterly infected cases of cluster 1, and one of the nursing team members (patient K in cluster 5) had documented hPIV-3 infection, healthcare workers may have a role in nosocomial transmission.

Historically, shedding has been assayed by culturing virus. More recently, sensitive molecular techniques, such as realtime PCR, have been used to detect and quantify CMV DNA purified from mucosal swabs . Approximately 50% of seropositive monkeys are DNA-positive in mucosal fluids at any one time. Thus, there is active and ongoing virus replication at mucosal surfaces within a persistently infected host.

Hurst et al. (1980) measured the effects of several environmental conditions on virus persistence in soil. They found that the temperature and virus adsorption to soil is more important for virus survival than the effect of pH. Enteric viruses are able to survive severe conditions in the gastrointestinal tract, such as low pH in stomach or high bile concentration. They are generally most stable near pH 7, but prefer low pH's (3-5) rather than alkaline pH's (9-12). It was shown that noroviruses are able to persist at pH 2.7 and room temperature more than 3 h . As the surface charge of viral particles varies depending on the pH, disruption of electrostatic interactions between viral particles and environmental surfaces commonly consists of changing the pH, and thus affect viral persistence in the environment (Gerba 1984) .",25.695339802677225,9.992680616126632

Furthermore, the advances in chemical synthesis of glycans coupled with the ability to probe finer nuances of glycan motif recognition by various lectins using glycan array platforms has substantially improved the knowledge on the diversity of glycan motifs recognized by various GBPs [65, 66] . These GBPs can be directly used to stain host cell or tissue surfaces and multiplexing the staining of more than one GBP can expand the knowledge of the glycan motifs distributed on these surfaces [4, 67, 68] . As an example co-staining of host tissues or cells with Sambucus nigra agglutinin I (SNA-I) which binds with high specificity to α2-6 sialylated glycans and Concanavalin A (ConA) which binds to trimannosyl core of N-linked glycans would give information on predominance of α2-6 sialylated glycans that are N-linked to the glycoproteins. These lectins can also be displayed in an array-like platform and samples such as whole viruses or virus-like particles comprising of the viral surface glycoprotein can be probed for their binding to such lectin-arrays [65, [69] [70] [71] . This would again provide information on the prevalence of specific glycan motifs that are present as a part of the glycans on the viral surface glycoproteins. The advantages of using lectins is that it provides a read on the glycan motif in their physiological context either on the host tissue or cell or viral surface and do not require any additional processing that may change the structural diversity of the glycans prior to analysis. However, a limitation in this approach arises from the lack of a comprehensive panel of lectins that can completely decode the structural diversity of the glycans. As an example while lectins like SNA-I give an accurate picture of distribution of glycans capped by α2-6-linked sialic acid, the information on whether this motif is a part of highly branched N-linked glycans or a part of long oligosaccharide branch length cannot be deduced.",21.49208007157301,8.215927864761742

To evaluate the reduction of virulence among different passages of PC22A, 100 and 1000 PFU were used in CDCD and conventional suckling piglet studies, respectively. Compared with piglets inoculated with P3, the onset of diarrhea and viral shedding was slightly delayed in piglets inoculated with P95C13 (CCL81). However, the morbidity and mortality rates of P95C13 (CCL81)-inoculated piglets were still 100%. On the other hand, lower morbidity, no mortality, milder clinical signs and histological lesions were found in P100C4-, P100C6-and P100C4 + P10inoculated piglets, indicating higher degree of attenuation in vivo (Table 1 ). However, one piglet inoculated with P100C6 still had severe villous atrophy at 10 dpi (Table 2) , suggesting the incomplete attenuation of this virus. In the P120 group, the onset of clinical signs and viral shedding were postponed until 5 dpi. Longer incubation time, lower viral shedding titers (Table 1) along with less and limited viral antigen distribution in the intestines (Table 2; Fig. 3 ) suggested that P120 replicated less efficiently in vivo than P100C4, P100C6 and P100C4 + P10. In the P140 and P160 groups, viral shedding titers and duration were reduced further, suggesting P160 full attenuation in vivo (Table 1) .

Adequate environmental protection for patients undergoing DECON is necessary and includes visual barriers from onlookers, segregation of the sexes, and attention to per-sonal belongings. 24, 25 In many EDs, DECON areas are being added to accommodate mass exposures. EDs have added or augmented DECON facilities. DECON areas should have a separate, self-contained drainage system, controlled water temperature, and shielding from environmental hazards. Exhaust fans are used to prevent the buildup of toxic fumes in these decontamination areas. For most EDs, mass DECON has been accomplished by using an uncovered parking lot and deploying heated and vented modular tent units. Uncovered parking areas adjacent and accessible to the ED have been enabled for disaster response. Other EDs use high-volume, lowpressured showers mounted on the side of a building. Serial showers allow multiple patients to enter at the same entrance and time. However, serial showers do not provide privacy, can be difficult for an ill patient to access, and can lead to recontaminated water runoff. Also, persons requiring more time may impede flow and reduce the number of patients decontaminated. Parallel showers built in advance or set up temporarily in tenting offer greater privacy but require wider space and depth. Combined serial and parallel design allows the advantages of each, separating ill patients and increasing the number of simultaneous decontaminations. 26 Often built into the ED is another DECON room for one or two patients with the following features: outside access; negative-pressure exhaust air exchange; water drainage; water recess; seamless floor; non-pervious, slipresistant, washable floor, walls, and ceiling; gas appliances; supplied air wall outlets for PPE use; high-input air; intercom; overhead paging; and an anteroom for DECON of isolated cases. PPE is recommended for use by military and fire departments during events involving hazardous materials. Hospitals use these devices and store a reasonable number of protective ensembles (i.e., gloves, suits, and respiratory equipment) usually near the ED DECON area. DECON areas are built with multiple supplied air outlets for PPE use to optimize safety and maximize work flexibility. A nearby changing area is available in some EDs. The changing area is laid out to optimize medical monitoring and to ease access to the DECON area. [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] Some capability to isolate and prevent propagation of a potential biologic agent has been designed into most EDs. Patients who present with undetermined respiratory illnesses are routinely sent to isolation. A direct entrance from the exterior to an isolation room is not usually available but has been a recent renovation in some EDs. Creation of isolation areas poses special design requirements for HVAC, cleaning, and security to ensure that infections and infected persons are contained. An isolation area should have compartmentalized air handling with high-efficiency filters providing clean air. [32] [33] [34] [35] Biohazard contamination is particularly difficult to mitigate. Keeping the facility ""clean""and safe for other patients is an extreme challenge. Biologic agents of terrorism may resist decontamination attempts. Infected patients present a risk to staff. Few triage areas and ED rooms have been designed for decontamination. Surfaces must be able to withstand repeated decontamination. Sealed inlets for gases and plumbing have also been considered. [36] [37] [38] Patients who are isolated can be observed with monitoring cameras.

Cl − does not have a chargestabilization role either, as Cl − is not bound to the Schiff-base region in GtACR1 33 ( Fig. 4a ; unlike in HsHR 48 ). One possible explanation is that strongly polarized water could bind to the Schiff base (behaving as a hydroxyl ion, as proposed in HsBR and mutants 2,49,50 ; Supplementary Discussion), and another possibility is that the partial-negative charge of the nearby Asp234 carbonyl is sufficient to weakly stabilize the positively charged Schiff base. As a result, the net charge in the Schiff-base region may represent the achievement of perhaps the most challenging evolutionary step in the adaptation to facilitate anion conduction (alongside the acquisition of positive surface electrostatic potential throughout the pore and vestibules; Fig. 4 ): namely, partial local positivity despite the obligate negative nature of the Schiff base counterion.",22.012707377349816,9.589365431374727

Because the segment 92-95 includes strictly conserved hydrophobic residues which are buried in the protein core in our structure, we propose that the fragment 1-91 studied by Zhou and Collisson (2000) was probably poorly folded and thus nonactive. We tested nucleic acid binding by IBV-N29-160 and found that the recombinant fragment was able to bind an oligoribonucleotide from the 3 0 end of the viral genome ( Figure 4 ). This result is in agreement with studies by Huang et al. (2004) , who used NMR to demonstrate that SARS-CoV N45-181 could bind a 32-mer oligoribonucleotide located at the 3 0 end of the SARS-CoV genome. Interestingly, this oligoribonucleotide has a highly conserved sequence across various coronaviruses including IBV, and adopts a unique tertiary structure (Robertson et al., 2005) . A surface representation of electrostatic charges of the IBV-N29-160 protein shown in Figure 5 reveals a striking segregation in the charge distribution on the protein surface.

This work represents a thorough bioinformatics analysis of the regularities of charge distribution (polar profiles) in two groups of proteins and their functional domains associated with Ebola virus disease: Ebola virus proteins and Human proteins interacting with Ebola virus. Our analysis reveals that a fragment exists in each of these proteins-one named the ""functional domain""-with the polar profile similar to the polar profile of the protein that contains it. Each protein is formed by a group of short sub-sequences, where each fragment has a different and distinctive polar profile and where the polar profile between adjacent short sub-sequences changes orderly and gradually to coincide with the polar profile of the whole protein. When using the charge distribution as a metric, it was observed that it effectively discriminates the proteins from their functional domains. As a counterexample, the same test was applied to a set of synthetic proteins built for that purpose, revealing that any of the regularities reported here for the Ebola virus proteins and human proteins interacting with Ebola virus were not present in the synthetic proteins. Our results indicate that the polar profile of each protein studied and its corresponding functional domain are similar. Thus, when building each protein from its functional domai-adding one amino acid at a time and plotting each time its polar profile-it was observed that the resulting graphs can be divided into groups with similar polar profiles.",17.703947791244968,9.249329850152368

Contaminated environmental surfaces are considered to represent a significant vector for hospital-acquired viral infections, which occur frequently in paediatric units. 16 Therefore, appropriate disinfection of surfaces is important for the control and prevention of such cross-infections. Although HCoV were also found to be involved in hospital-acquired infections, 3,4 their survival in the environment had not yet been tested in conditions similar to other respiratory viruses. Therefore, we tested the survival of the two known HCoV strains, 229E and OC43, in suspensions and on surfaces, using laboratory conditions designed to reproduce those found in a hospital environment as well as possible. Table I ) are shown. One hundred percent infectivity represents the infectious titre of virus incubated in PBS in the chemical disinfection assay. The current study demonstrates the survival of a PBS suspension of HCoV for up to six days, with no difference between the two HCoV strains. Culture medium with susceptible cells was tested to mimic human respiratory secretions, without possible interference from contaminating pathogens that might have been found in sputum. These laboratory conditions have been used in previous studies with the same goals as our own. 8, 15 Survival was apparently shorter for these two viruses when incubated in culture medium with or without susceptible cells, when compared with PBS. Presumably, the pH stability of PBS could explain this observation: infectivity of HCoV-229E was previously shown to be optimal at pH 6.0 and to decrease rapidly at pH :5 or 98, while the virus was found to be very stable to cycles of freezing and thawing. 17 We also tested HCoV survival after drying, according to a published protocol, 12 modified in order to test different environmental surfaces which are found in hospitals. In particular, we tested porous and non-porous surfaces since differences in survival according to these types of surfaces were described for other respiratory viruses. 8, 15 As expected, virus survival after drying was shorter than in suspension, without any differences between surfaces or virus strains. Variations according to temperature or humidity were not tested.",21.186239555326978,9.605152835644043

FETs aptasensor is based on the principle that the interaction of the aptamers immobilized on FETs and the target results in the changes of the distribution of charge on the FETs. Figure 2A is a typical scheme of FETs aptasensor. In comparison with antibodies, aptamers have the considerable advantages in fabrication of FETs aptasensors: (1) The size of aptamers is smaller (about 1 to 2 nm). The binding of the target to the aptamers occurs in the electrical double-layer, thus the resulting change of the charge distribution can be easily detected; (2) their small sizes and versatility allow efficient immobilization at high density on the FETs surface, thereby enhance the sensor sensitivity. So et al [32] developed single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT)-EFTs aptasensor for the detection of E. coli. The aptamers were immobilized on the surface of CNT.

HPIV1 was detected in all of the office buildings tested during 2004, a low incidence year. Positive fomite samples obtained during a year with low HPIV1 incidence reinforces the theory that viruses can be spread easily through closed indoor environments (Goldman 2000) . Previous research showed that nasal secretion droplets containing infectious viral particles generated via coughing, sneezing, and talking are easily transmitted over considerable distances (Barker et al. 2001) . Studies by Zhao et al. (2005) indicated that an average sneeze can travel up to 3 m at a speed of 20 m/sec. In addition, several studies have shown that viruses can be transferred from surfaces to hands, and vice versa (Aitken and Jefferies 2001; Ansari et al. 1991 Ansari et al. , 1988 Barker et al. 2001; Goldman 2000) . The average survival of HPIV is 10 h on nonporous surfaces, and over an hour on hands (Aitken and Jefferies 2001; Ansari et al. 1991; Barker et al. 2001; Brady et al. 1990 ). The majority of positive fomites in this study appear to have resulted from the transfer of contaminated nasal secretions to fomites by touching (hand to nose or mouth, surfaces, etc.), sneezing, coughing, and/or talking. Research by Couch et al. (1974) indicated that up to 10 7 infectious virions can be shed per ml of respiratory secretions. Viral shedding may occur asymptomatically, Fig. 4 Percentage of HPIV1 positive fomites by work area before symptom onset or continue for several days or weeks after symptoms have ceased (Barker et al. 2001; Goldman 2000) . Consequently, the shed and spread of HPIV1 by adult individuals with active infections is indicated by the occurrence of HPIV1 RNA on office surfaces. Studies investigating the survival of viruses on surfaces indicate very little variation in viral decay rates on nonporous surfaces (Boone and Gerba 2007) . Viruses typically survive for longer periods of time on nonporous surfaces as compared to porous surfaces (Abad et al. 1994) . Virus survival on surfaces can also be influenced by environmental changes in humidity and temperature depending on the virus (Boone and Gerba 2007) . However, research indicates that temperature and humidity variations within 10°centigrade have little effect on viral viability (Abad et al. 1994 Sattar et al. 1987 . All the surfaces sampled in this study were nonporous indoor surfaces, as a result the variables of surface, temperature, and humidity were considered to have an equal impact on the presence of viral RNA. In general, surface exposure or frequency of use has a significant impact on surface contamination (Sattar 2001) . Normally, conference rooms are used less frequently than offices or cubicles. Study data indicated more surfaces positive for HPIV1 in cubicles and offices as compared to the conference rooms. Also, there was a significant difference between the percentages of positive surfaces detected in cubicles when compared to conference rooms. Light switches in office buildings tested were usually turned off at the beginning and the end of the day, and therefore used infrequently. On average doors were only opened and closed at the beginning and end of the day indicating infrequent use. As seen in Fig. 1 , both door knobs and light switches were found to be contaminated with HPIV1 less often than more frequently used surfaces like the phone, desk, or the computer mouse.",20.533921653165045,9.12148795817968

Single virion tracking microscopy techniques provide more detail on the intermediate entry steps than infection assays and more functional information than structural methods, bridging the gap between these methods. In addition, single virion approaches also provide dynamic information about the kinetics of entry processes. This chapter reviews single virion tracking techniques and describes how they can be applied to study specific virus entry steps. These techniques provide information complementary to traditional ensemble approaches. Single virion techniques may either probe virion behavior in live cells or in biomimetic platforms.

Viral titers have also been shown to decline exponentially with time on inanimate surfaces. Therefore, unless swabs were taken immediately or close to initial contamination of the ID or lanyard, the viral titer could have been too low even for detection by PCR. The implication of this may be similar to the way viruses can become inactivated on human skin and can only survive on hands for a few minutes. 15 Furthermore, respiratory pathogens may be spread via airborne or droplet transmission, but fecal pathogens are predominantly spread via contact transmission. Therefore, unless there is clear surface contact with the lanyard, it is difficult to establish successful transmission, thereby possibly accounting for the lack of any detected fecal nosocomial infections in this study.",27.15387111801217,11.00773700738359

As a part of these recommendations, strategies for the cleaning of patient care areas were enumerated. The objective of cleaning efforts should be to keep surfaces visibly clean, to disinfect high-contact surfaces more frequently than non-high-contact surfaces, and to clean up spills promptly. For patient care areas, it is suggested that environmental services workers select Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered detergent-disinfectants to clean inanimate environmental surfaces. This is a controversial recommendation [63] , but the CDC/HICPAC guidelines note that this recommendation accommodates situations in which uncertainty exists regarding the nature of the contaminants on inanimate environmental surfaces (e.g., blood or body fluid contamination vs. routinely accumulated dust or dirt) or regarding the presence of multidrug-resistant organisms on such surfaces [4] . No specific recommendations were given regarding the frequency of cleaning, only that it should occur on a regular basis. In hospitals, patient rooms should be cleaned on a daily basis and undergo ""terminal cleaning"" after patient discharge from the hospital. During terminal cleaning, noncritical surfaces in the inanimate environment may be thoroughly cleaned using a disinfectant, typically a quaternary ammonium compound or phenolics (the latter is not advised for use in nurseries or infant care areas).

Spores of C. difficile are durable and are resistant to usual cleaning methods. Contamination of the inanimate environment by C. difficile has been reported to occur in areas in close proximity to infected or colonized patients.

Molecular techniques provide the most concrete evidence of transmission of C. difficile from environmental surfaces to patients. The findings of a study of endemic C. difficile [18] were as follows: (1) C. difficile was present on the hands of health care workers, (2) there was a correlation between the degree of colonization of health care workers' hands and environmental contamination with C. difficile, and (3) there was differential contamination of the environment by individual strain types. Among colonized patients, a single, predominant isolate was found and was more likely to contaminate the environment than were isolates that sporadically colonized patients. This finding was reproduced in a study in which (1) despite endemicity of C. difficile, a single genotype predominated in the inanimate environment, and (2) the incidence of C. difficile infection correlated well with environmental contamination [44] .

The central tenets of control are good hygiene practices in food processing and handling environments, and prevention of contamination in the preharvest environments. Because the decontamination of hands and surfaces in food processing and preparation is critical to preventing virus contamination, an important effort is assuring effective hand decontamination. The best method remains the traditional soap and water wash followed by towel drying. Commercial alcohol-based hand sanitizers should not be used in place of adequate hand washing. Of course, hand washing compliance in retail, institutional, and home settings remains a challenge and must be continuously advocated. There has been interest in further promoting the need for infected food handlers to report illness symptoms and abstain from work during periods of time in which they are actively shedding virus. However, the latter may be difficult in light of emerging evidence suggesting that shedding of HuNoV may persist for weeks after symptom resolution. Adequate cleaning and disinfection of surfaces is also important to preventing virus contamination of foods, but the availability of disinfecting agents with specific activity against the nonenveloped enteric viruses is a pressing need. Also needed are better microbiological indicator systems that have a more direct correlation with virus contamination of water in production environments, as the fecal coliforms and Escherichia coli remain poor indicators for this application.

When the disease is maintained in the reservoir population, the stages are cyclic (1) → (2) → (3) → (4) → (1). A viral infection begins with contact or exposure of an animal host with a particular pathogen. At the first stage, environmental conditions including climate, seasonality, anthropogenic disturbances, landscape and resources (i.e., habitat, food, water) may individually or collectively determine whether there is contact between host and pathogen [15, 137] . In addition, the host's intrinsic characteristics, its population and social structure, mobility, behavior and susceptibility may modulate the extent of its exposure. In the second stage, the within-host and cellular level, the virus must overcome physical barriers of the host, and must be compatible with cell receptors to gain entry into a target cell. After viral entry, the third stage, viral replication depends on host and viral genetics as well as host factors such as the immune response, prior exposure, nutritional status, co-infection, age, sex and reproductive status. Establishment of an infection in one host does not necessarily mean transmission to another host, as it may be a dead-end host. Transmission, the fourth stage of infection, depends on viral load, mode of viral shedding, host factors and the community intraand inter-host ecological interactions.

Recently, a systematic investigation involving quantitative experiments of laboratory-scale decontamination of building material surfaces (carpet, ceiling tile, cinder block, painted wallboard, unpainted wood, and painted I-beam steel) was initiated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) in collaboration with the US Army, Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (US EPA, 2008) . Another systematic investigation studied the log reduction in viable spore numbers by CD gas under the given technology operation parameters and environmental conditions, and with different types of building materials (Rogers et al., 2004) . Further, recent work by Rastogi et al. (2009; has confirmed that viable spores on indoor building surfaces can be significantly reduced using CD gas. They tested the method by measuring spore recoveries from five porous materials and one nonporous building material. CD gas as a disinfectant has been successfully applied to decontaminate isolators (Czarneski and Lorcheim, 2005) , hospitals (Luftman et al., 2006) , and buildings (Wood and Martin, 2009) , and is approved by the US National Sanitation Foundation International as a sterilant for the decontamination of biological safety cabinets.

These factors may be general indicators of frailty and susceptibility for more severe infection and may highlight individuals in whom to more closely surveille and target treatment interventions in the future. Interestingly, underlying lung disease with COPD or asthma did not appear to be associated with progression to LRTI; however, the number of patients in our study with these comorbidities was limited. It is well documented in the literature that influenza, RSV, rhinovirus, and parainfluenza viruses are associated with prolonged viral shedding in HSCT recipients, but the persistence of HCoV shedding in HSCT recipients is poorly understood [1, 10, 11] . While a ""test of cure"" is not routinely performed at our institution, patients undergo repeat NP swabs for worsening or recurrent symptoms. We found that of patients with follow-up respiratory swabs, 59% had persistent shedding of the virus, defined as shedding for ≥21 days after initial infection. No one serotype was significantly associated with persistent viral shedding, consistent with what Ogimi et al. observed in their HSCT population [12] . Additionally, the median duration of shedding in our cohort was 4 weeks, as compared to the 3 weeks described by Ogimi et al. [12] . Milano et al. found that in HSCT recipients with asymptomatic HCoV infection, the median duration of viral shedding was 4 weeks [5] . It is difficult to compare our cohort to others reported in the literature because (1) we did not screen asymptomatic individuals for infection, and (2) we did not test for persistent infection; repeat NP swab was only obtained for worsening or new respiratory symptoms.

West Nile, Chikungunya and Yellow Fever viruses are examples of arthropod-borne viruses that have jumped to new mosquito species. In particular, flying insects can greatly expand viral access to bird, wildlife and human hosts. While collecting samples from wildlife is a resourceintensive endeavour, large numbers of known arthropod vectors can be collected at much lower cost, making virus surveillance in arthropods an attractive goal. Furthermore, geographic information system-based maps that layer environmental measurements (temperature, precipitation, land use) and vector/host distribution data can be used to inform rational decisions about when and where surveillance samples should be collected. This approach has been used to correlate environmental factors with competent West Nile virus vectors trapped in urban areas of the north-eastern United States (Brown et al., 2008a,b) . Assembling such risk-based maps would concentrate surveillance efforts to maximize impact and minimize cost. While detecting genetic precursors to species jumps in sampled viruses is a long-term goal for which underlying knowledge is lacking, in the short-term, characterizing endemic viruses transmitted by local arthropod vector populations would provide baseline information required for future prediction.

Assessing the physical plant for potential infectious disease hazards and implementing prevention and control measures are important for all mass casualty incidents. However, certain disasters pose a greater risk of environmental contamination and need for intervention than other emergencies. For instance, environmental decontamination will be most critical after a flood or an outbreak of an infectious disease (such as smallpox or SARS) that is spread by direct and indirect contact. 11, 12, 38 IP input will also be important for making decision regarding when to reopen a room, floor, or building after it has been closed for a length of time and procedures to follow before patients are admitted to those areas. 11, 12 These decisions need to be made by a multidisciplinary team, such as the health care facility emergency management planning committee, of which the IP should be a member.

Grouping of bats into persistently infectious bats and transiently infectious bats was supported by the CMR multistate model selection processes (Table 3) . By exploring various scenarios in epidemic models, we found that population-level viral persistence was marginally more probable when infectious periods were heterogeneous (bats were either transiently or persistently infectious; Table 4 ). In addition to a previous study that suggested persistent infection of coronavirus in bats in North America through the small number of bats sampled [23] , our study provides much validity by using larger number of bats sampled [21] , although the sample size is still not large enough to provide robust estimates. Further understanding of the potential and likelihood of within-host persistent infections is important to understand spillover of bat-borne viruses. Persistent infections contribute not only in maintaining viruses in a population but also in triggering pulses of virus shedding. Temporally synchronised stressors such as food shortage and reproduction may weaken the immune system of bats, facilitating persistent infections in infectious bats [38] . Thus, those temporally synchronised stressors can cause viral shedding from persistently infectious bats during a limited period, leading to pulses of viral shedding. Because spillover of bat-borne viruses has been associated with pulses of viral shedding from bats [38] , the finding of persistent infection in bats contributes in understanding spillover mechanisms of bat-borne viruses.",21.682400472251974,8.764665554017762

The basic property of a monoclonal antibody, that of combining specifically with one epitope (or family of related epitopes), can be used to supply a wealth of data. A single monoclonal antibody can provide information on protein ""relatedness,"" structure, function, synthesis, processing, cellular or tissue distribution and on the association between molecules. Any attempt to separate the ways in which these data are gathered must be to some extent artificial since one study frequently yields results relevant to other areas. However, it is appropriate to differentiate between the broad areas of virological investigation. The contribution of monoclonal antibodies within each area can then be assessed. Thus, diagnostic virology, taxonomy, and epidemiology (Section 11) can be considered separately from the biochemical and molecular biological investigations described in Section 111; Section IV deals with the interaction of virus and host at the whole organism level. Consequently, the selection of virus variants is dealt with in Section I11 where information concerning protein structure or function has been obtained, and also in Section IV where pathogenesis was investigated. It is not intended in this review to provide an exhaustive list of all publications in which monoclonal antibodies have been used, but rather to illustrate how monoclonal antibodies can be applied in virology. Other reviews of different aspects have recently been published (Antczak, 1982; Blann, 1981; Kennett, 1981; Nowinski et al., 1983; Sinkovics and Dreesman, 1983; Yewdell and Gerhard, 1981) .",20.665823653447063,10.593101771958272

Characterizing the spread and distribution of such contaminants so as to minimize worker exposure to them, and to maximize the effectiveness of field procedures used in removing contaminants, has been a priority. During the anthrax outbreaks, for example, extensive environmental sampling was done by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)/National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) with over 100 individuals involved in taking approximately 10,000 environmental samples. Between 4% and 50% of environmental samples taken from a given site were positive, depending on location sampled [SMW03] . Thus there was a high degree of variability in sample results depending on sampling location. Further, many sites continue to undergo remediation to remove all traces of Bacillus anthracis. If optimal sampling locations could be determined where bacteria were most likely present, and if environmental sampling were done at these locations, it is possible that the cost of complete building remediation could be significantly reduced.

We predict that such substitutions will hinder the ability of SarS to recruit RNA polymerase to the promoter region because they have replaced negatively charged residues with polar residues, which will affect the electrostatic interactions between SarS and the positively charged RNA polymerase subunits.

Proper immunization is the most effective method. Puppies that are incompletely vaccinated should not be introduced into environments where there has been a history of parvoviral enteritis and adequate environmental disinfection cannot be guaranteed. Although extremely resistant to disinfectants, parvoviruses can be inactivated with a 1 in 30 dilution of household bleach; potassium peroxymonosulfate (Trifectant, Virkon S); accelerated hydrogen peroxide; or high-level chemical disinfectants such as glutaraldehyde and ortho-phthalaldehyde, when contact times of at least 10 minutes are used (see Chapter 11 for more information on disinfection). These disinfectants will also inactivate other enteric viruses. Steam cleaning should be used on surfaces that cannot be otherwise disinfected, and dishwashers that attain temperatures of at least 75°C should be used to wash dishes. For shelters, quarantine periods of 2 weeks have been recommended before introduction of puppies that might be shedding virus, because shedding rarely continues for longer than 10 days. 56 The bathing of recovered puppies can help to remove virus that persists on the haircoat. Rodent and insect vector control can also be used to prevent spread of the virus in the environment.

In the course of so-called investigative journalism, scientists and public institutions will always be confronted with provocative questions, which may trigger imprudent responses. The interest in objective, transparent and comprehensive reporting is often opposed to the economic interest of publishing houses. However, public institutions are well placed to provide trustworthy information, especially if expert teams are formed specifically to handle the crisis, and if these teams are given different responsibilities with regard to operational procedures, communication strategies and media work. Consultant teams consisting partially of external experts are also helpful in ensuring consistent quality control from the outset rather than only in response to medical or communicative problems. The Ebola outbreak in West Africa led to panic in the affected countries themselves, especially at the beginning of the outbreak when the extent of knowledge among all parties was minimal. This became clear, for example, when patients suffering from Ebola were hidden and helpers faced resistance from the local population. The rest of the world reacted with fear rather than panic. At no time during such an outbreak situation should the impression be created in any country that Ebola is a distant third-world disease that has no relevance to people elsewhere. Rather, the goal should be to establish trust at an early stage, both in the affected areas and also in one's own country to secure acceptance for measures that may become necessary in the future. This requires great efforts on the part of those institutions whose task it is to generate communication preparedness [7] . Resilience of all affected parties in crisis situations can only be achieved if lessons are already learned from past mistakes in crisis-free situations. The Ebola outbreak in West Africa will, in all likelihood, not be the last zoonosis to spread around the globe rapidly. Highly pathogenic, airborne and easily transmissible and mutable viruses with much greater infectious potential than the Ebola virus will continue to pose great challenges for the medical profession and societies at large. If public institutions and the media engage in proactive risk communication by admitting uncertainties and thus building trust, they can make a significant contribution to preventing the hysteria seen in the USA and Spain as described here.",20.34545337229265,7.825546110165641

The majority of viruses remain viable longer on nonporous surfaces (Tables 2 and 3) ; however, there are exceptions (1, 27) . Astrovirus survives for 90 days on porous paper but only 60 days on nonporous aluminum (2) . Initial inoculation titer can prolong viral survival on environmental surfaces (66). Brady et al. (13) found that the viral survival decay rate increased with inoculum titer: a 10 4 virus inoculation could be detected up to 6 h longer than a 10 3 virus inoculation. Virus survival on fomites can also vary significantly within viral type and strain. Typically, nonenveloped enteric viruses remain viable longer on surfaces than enveloped respiratory viruses. The enteric viruses HAV, astrovirus, and rotavirus can all remain infective on surfaces for 2 months or longer (Table 3 ). In contrast, respiratory viruses usually remain viable for several hours to several days ( Table 2 ). Virus inactivation rates can be expressed as the log decay of virus titer divided by the total time of viral survival. For comparative purposes, we calculated inactivation coefficients (K i ) using the following calculation after all viral titers were normalized to the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) per ml of virus: [log 10 reduction (initial viral titer Ϫ final viral titer)/ml]/total hours of viral viability (64) . Inactivation coefficients are linear functions and were not used to calculate T 90 or T 99 values, which are the times required for the initial viral titer to decrease by 90% (T 90 ) and 99% (T 99 ), these values were calculated using the viral survival curve, which is typically not linear. Therefore, T 90 and T 99 values underestimate viral survival compared to inactivation coefficients (K i values). On nonporous surfaces, the enteric viruses reviewed typically exhibited inactivation rates at least 2 logs lower than respiratory viruses, with the exception of adenovirus and influenza virus ( Fig. 2  and 3 ; Tables 2 and 3 ). Four out of five enteric viruses examined in this review produced inactivation coefficients between 0.0021 and 0.0059 log 10 /h, whereas four out of five respiratory viruses produced inactivation rates between 0.167 and 0.625 log 10 /h. The higher inactivation coefficient found among respiratory viruses indicates a faster decay rate or decreased survival on surfaces ( Fig. 2 and 3 ). Variations in virus survival may also occur within a viral family or strain (66, 71) , as seen between the 12-h survival of coronavirus 229E and the 3-h survival of coronavirus OC43 ( (1) demonstrated that temperature and humidity variations had no effect on the survival (60 days) of HAV and rotavirus (Table 3) . However, temperature variations from 4°C to 20°C decreased the survival of astrovirus (T 90 change from 8 days to Ͻ24 h) and feline calicivirus (T 90 change from 10 days to Ͻ24 h) (2, 21) . Humidity influences the viral desiccation rate. Humidity in the United States can range from 14 to 94% in outdoor environments (76) . Indoor humidity varies depending on outdoor humidity, temperature, and varying indoor factors (76). Abad et al. (1) found that decreases in humidity could negatively impact HAV, rotavirus, and adenovirus survival (Table 3) . Humidity variations in the Abad et al. study (1) caused a significant decline in HAV survival (T 90 change from 35 days at 85% humidity to 11 days at 45% humidity). The majority of studies investigating the effects of humidity on respiratory viruses are aerosol studies. However, Sattar et al. (64) was one of the few studies that investigated respiratory virus survival on surfaces in which humidity was used as a variable. The study found that rhinovirus exhibits optimum survival at 50% humidity (Table 2 ) (64).",23.66061940175797,10.613233961998194

Since the initial ssDNA strand is immobilized on a surface, hybridization of a second ssDNA strand leads to a charge accumulation at the site of the immobilized initial strand. This change in the spatial charge distribution can be detected electrically either using a semiconducting nanowire-based transistor (Fig. 1 ) or a planar field-effect transistor (Fig. 2a) . The second hybridization detection method utilizes the change in diameter of the hybridized DNA strand when compared to the original ssDNA (Fig. 2b) . Natural or artificial nanometer-sized pores or channels can be used as constrictions, which will limit the ionic current between two electrolytic baths.

This should apply for all points in the food chain where foodstu¡s are handled manually. The infectious dose of NLV appears to be extremely low [114] . As a result, even with strict sanitary measures, infection may not always be prevented. Foodborne outbreaks have occurred due to contaminated food sources that passed all microbiological assays. A common-sense guideline is to remove people with symptoms consistent with viral gastroenteritis from the production chain until at least 2 days after remission of the symptoms. A practical problem with this guideline is that an unknown proportion of viral infections will be subclinical, viral shedding may last longer, and^even in the incubation period infected persons may shed su⁄cient amounts of virus to cause food contamination [42, 123, 171, 177, 178] . The kinetics of viral shedding have only been studied in a few infected volunteers, and may not re£ect the real-life situation when people may have been infected with a low dose of infectious virus. Given the highly infectious nature of NLV and HAV, and the documented risk of virus transmission to food during the incubation period, it is envisioned that guidelines should be developed that consider the occurrence of gastroenteritis in contacts (e.g. children) of people working in critical points in the food chain. This should be based on data on the kinetics of viral shedding following natural infection. In addition to encouraging handwashing and other hygienic measures, policies involv-ing 'no bare hands contact' by handlers of food that will be eaten without further cooking have been implemented in many areas.

Quantitative molecular assays make it possible to promptly establish the correlation between the viral load profile and clinical characteristics of viral respiratory infections, which would provide important knowledge for clinical management in terms of antiviral therapy and infection control measures. This has been supported by several recently published studies on the pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza A virus. Virological profile determined by quantitative RT-PCR suggested that the prolonged viral shedding in young children and higher viral load in the stool had implications for formulating clinical management policies and infection control measures [55] . It was also reported that oral oseltamivir suppressed viral load more effectively and shortened the duration of viral shedding when given early in mild cases of pandemic 2009 H1N1 infections [56, 57•] .",25.286651836748185,11.414440329293749
The influenza virus can also be transmitted by contaminated surfaces. Successful control of a viral disease requires knowledge of the different vectors that could promote its transmission among hosts,0.18279178171895175,0.4025980532169342,1.4337493181228638,282ff0b3-1df0-42b0-92e3-169ef4b2048a,custom_license/Severe Childhood Respiratory Viral Infections,"The transmission of influenza can be mathematically modeled to help predicting how the virus will spread in a population [27, 28] . People who contract influenza are most infectious between the second and third days after infection, and infectivity lasts for around 10 days [27] . Children are much more infectious than adults, and shed virus from just before they develop symptoms until 2 weeks after infection [27, 29] . For influenza control it is very important to investigate viral shedding and resistant viruses [29] . According to Mitamura and colleagues [29] , viral loads are decreased after the start of antiviral agents, but resistant viruses are detected in some patients. Influenza can be spread by direct transmission when an infected person sneezes mucus into the eyes, nose, or mouth of another person; through people inhaling the aerosols produced by infected people with coughing, sneezing, and spitting; and through hand-to-mouth transmission from contaminated surfaces or direct personal contact [30, 31] . The relative importance of airborne, droplet, and contact transmission of influenza A virus and the efficiency of control measures depends on the inactivation of viruses in different environmental media. Weber and colleagues [31] systematically reviewed information on the environmental inactivation of influenza A viruses and modes of transmission. The airborne route is a potentially important transmission pathway for influenza in indoor environments. The importance of droplet transmission has to be reassessed. Contact transmission can be limited by fast inactivation of influenza virus on hands, and is more dependent on behavioral parameters than airborne transmission. However, the potentially large inocula deposited in the environment through sneezing and the protective effect of nasal mucus on virus survival could make contact transmission a key transmission mode. In the airborne route, it has been demonstrated that the inhalation of just one inhalable droplet (0.5-5 lm in diameter) might be enough to cause an infection [31] . Although a single sneeze releases up to 40,000 droplets [32] , most of these droplets are large and will quickly settle out of the air [31] . The influenza virus can also be transmitted by contaminated surfaces. Successful control of a viral disease requires knowledge of the different vectors that could promote its transmission among hosts. Thomas and colleagues [33] assessed the survival of human influenza viruses on banknotes, given that billions of these notes are exchanged daily worldwide. Banknotes were experimentally contaminated with representative influenza virus subtypes at various concentrations, and survival was tested after different time periods. Influenza A viruses tested by cell culture survived up to 3 days when they were inoculated at high concentrations. The same inoculum in the presence of respiratory mucus showed a striking increase in survival time (up to 17 days). B/Hong Kong/335/2001 virus was still infectious after 1 day when it was mixed with respiratory mucus. When nasopharyngeal secretions of naturally infected children were used, influenza virus survived for at least 48 h in one-third of the cases. The investigators concluded that unexpected stability of influenza virus in this nonbiological environment suggests that unusual environmental contamination should be considered in the setting of pandemic preparedness [33] . Bean and colleagues investigated the transmission of influenza viruses via hands and environmental surfaces; the survival of laboratory-grown influenza A and influenza B viruses on various surfaces was studied. Both influenza A and B viruses survived for 24 to 48 hours on hard, nonporous surfaces such as stainless steel and plastic, but survived for less than 8 to 12 hours on cloth, paper, and tissues. Measurable quantities of influenza A virus were transferred from stainless steel surfaces to hands for 24 hours and from tissues to hands for up to 15 minutes. Virus survived on hands for up to 5 minutes after transfer from the environmental surfaces. Their observations suggest that the transmission of virus from donors who are shedding large amounts could occur for 2 to 8 hours via stainless steel surfaces and for a few minutes via paper tissues. The investigators concluded that the transmission of influenza virus via fomites may be possible under conditions of heavy environmental contamination [34] . However, if the virus is present in mucus, the virus can survive for longer periods [31] .",25.71995976424283,10.195611708855859

Examples of what the literature refers to as high-touch objects includes bed rails, intravenous (IV) poles, call buttons, door knobs, floors, and bathroom facilities 64 ; however, a study demonstrated high-touch objects in the intensive care unit were the bed rail, bed surface, and supply cart, whereas the high-touch surfaces in a patient ward were the bed rail, over-bed table, IV pump, and bed surface. 65 Importantly, the level of microbial contamination of room surfaces was not statistically different regardless of how often they were touched before and after cleaning. Until research identifies which objects and surfaces pose the greatest risk of pathogen transmission, all noncritical surfaces that are touched must be cleaned/disinfected. 66 No-touch (or mechanical) methods for room decontamination As noted earlier, multiple studies have demonstrated that environmental surfaces and objects in rooms are frequently not properly cleaned and these surfaces may be important in transmission of health care-associated pathogens. Further, although interventions aimed at improving cleaning thoroughness have demonstrated effectiveness, many surfaces remain inadequately cleaned and, therefore, potentially contaminated. For this reason, several manufacturers have developed room disinfection units that can decontaminate environmental surfaces and objects. These no-touch systems generally use one of 2 methods: either UV light or HPV/mist. 53 These technologies supplement, but do not replace, standard cleaning and disinfection because surfaces must be physically cleaned of dirt and debris.",19.41277972816399,7.518263023700713

For example, in the United States, influenza A(H3N2) viruses cocirculated with influenza B viruses, while influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 viruses were reported only rarely during the 2014-2015 season [5] . Complicating the situation is the cocirculation with other respiratory viruses [6] , several of which have been hypothesized to influence influenza virus infection in humans [7] or directly shown to cause viral interference in animal models [8] [9] [10] To understand the impact of cocirculating human influenza A and B viruses on viral interference, Laurie et al coinfected ferrets with combinations of influenza A and B viruses that circulated in 2009 and 2010, with intervals of 1-14 days between primary and secondary viral challenge. Two of the intervals (days 1 and 3) represented the start and peak of virus shedding in the upper respiratory tract; day 5 corresponded to decreased viral shedding, day 7 represented the end of viral shedding, while days 10 and 14 represented a time when the adaptive immune response was activated. Viral shedding, as defined by reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)determined copy number in nasal wash specimens, was monitored by real-time PCR. Intriguingly, they observed several patterns of viral shedding after challenge: (1) prevention of secondary infection, (2) coinfection, (3) shortened secondary infection, (4) delayed secondary infection, and (5) no effect as compared to the control group. These patterns were influenced not only by the interval between primary and secondary viral challenge, but also by the viral strain. Interference was only observed if primary infection occurred up to 7 days before secondary challenge, suggesting that continued shedding of the primary virus may induce a temporary state of immunity that is not seen if secondary infection occurs 10-14 days after primary infection. This occurred with both antigenically related and antigenically unrelated viruses. The finding that the outcome was dependent on the viral combinations suggests that different influenza viruses induce differing levels of temporary immunity, with the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus being the most effective in this study, followed by influenza B virus and influenza A(H3N2) virus.",20.266103079883198,8.007184213984786

This is already occurring, as influenza virus investigators are forced to respond and adapt to increasing regulation of their field. One must also balance the possible effects on the careers of postdocs and graduate students in the field with increasing oversight due to the desire to protect against possible accidental releases. As the difficulty of carrying out experiments and meeting regulations increases, it may be hard to recruit the best and the brightest to this important field. Second is the danger posed by the absence of work that is simply not done to avoid controversy. Although the importance of work not done is impossible to document, experiments that are not being done could provide major insights simply because they provide more information to inform discussion and debate. Third is the possibility that additional laboratory mishaps will lead to even more draconian regulations that will curtail research more broadly. These dangers are interrelated but have in common a high likelihood that, singly or together, they could pose major disruptions to research on influenza virus and microbiology research in general.

Besides supportive therapy, information regarding specific treatments is yet very limited in affected cats. Class A CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG‐A) are short single‐stranded DNA molecules containing unmethylated cytosine‐phosphate‐guanosine motifs that stimulate production of type I interferons. Studies in cats showed the ability of CpG‐A to induce an antiviral state in vivo and to inhibit replication of FPV in vitro. Therefore, aims of this study were to investigate the effects of CpG‐A on survival and clinical score, white blood cell (WBC), red blood cell (RBC) and platelet counts, as well as viremia and fecal viral shedding in cats naturally infected with FPV. Cats with positive fecal parvovirus antigen test were prospectively enrolled if presenting clinical or laboratory sings of FPV, had body weight >500 g, were unvaccinated and not previously treated. Cats were randomly allocated to receive 100 µg/kg of CpG‐A or placebo subcutaneously, at admission and after 48 h; all cases were treated with supportive therapy. A clinical score derived from attitude, appetite, vomiting, diarrhea and temperature was assigned daily until death or during 7 days. Blood and fecal samples were collected at admission and at 1, 2, 7 days; complete blood counts were obtained and real‐time PCR was performed to quantify FPV DNA in blood and fecal samples. Chi‐square test and mixed ANOVA were used to compare treatment groups. Forty‐two cats were included: 22 received CpG‐A and 20 placebo.

S-layers are capable of interacting with particles and materials of different physiochemical properties, thereby favoring adherence of whole cells to solid surfaces.

Temperature affects each stage of mosquitoes' lifecycle.55,56 There is a minimum and maximum temperature threshold above and below which the development and survival of the vector and the parasite are not possible. Above a certain temperature anopheles mosquito vectors of malaria, cannot survive;57 their life cycle is so fast that does not allow the development of Plasmodium within their salivary glands. The temperature is a variable that affects development of both the vector population and the parasite within the vector; meanwhile the availability of water and moisture affects the vector only.58 In recent decades, outbreaks of malaria have been reported from many mountainous regions of Kenya, Uganda, and Rwanda,58 but a high degree of temporal and spatial variation in the climate of East Africa suggests further that claimed associations between local malaria resurgence and regional changes in climate are overly simplistic. Increases in malaria have been attributed to migration, breakdown in both health service provision and vector control operations, and deforestation. Economic, social, and political factors can therefore, explain recent resurgence in malaria rather than climate change.59 Models have been elaborated to predict in the next years the distribution of malaria. They forecast an extension of areas of endemic malaria and a shift in the affected areas.

The inverse relationship between the days of illness in source cases and incubation periods in their secondary cases in this study also supports this finding. Moreover, a recent study showed that the timing and intensity of viral shedding in MERS cases was similar to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) with the peak shedding after 10-12 days from symptom onset [30].

While the total number of Web sites that posted Zika virus information increased over the course of the study, the number of Web sites posting advice on the use of insect repellent and travel advisories to affected areas decreased from January to August. This unexpected decrease could be a cause for concern, as the onset of non–travel-associated transmission drastically increases the at-risk population within the United States. With localized transmission a reality, it is important that individuals, particularly pregnant women, understand the potential risks associated with traveling to areas with ongoing transmission. One hypothesis for the decreases we observed in important prevention-related topics may be an unfortunate side effect of the current paradigm of health information dissemination. As the Zika virus knowledge base expanded over the course of the emergency, posted information began to shift focus to emerging topics. Protective activities such as using insect repellent or avoiding travel to affected areas may have been deemphasized under an assumption of “common knowledge.” Public health professionals creating resources for and conducting outreach to providers should consider emphasizing the importance of continually promoting the most effective risk-reduction behaviors, no matter how “common.”",25.26848001189542,11.315353423532141

This is because emergency victims often face geographical isolation as a result of damage to local infrastructure such as energy, road and communication facilities.5 Consequently, the arrival of external rescue support may experience two or more days of delay.6 But rescue efforts in the first couple of days in disastrous events are critical.7 Community and household preparedness in self-rescue efforts prior to the arrival of external assistance may result in the difference between the chance of survival and death.8 Empirical evidence shows that sufficient household preparedness can significantly mitigate the negative consequences of emergency events.9

Here, we have shown a rationale for serology testing as a means to facilitate interventions beyond those of mitigation and suppression. Identifying and deploying recovered individuals could represent more than just a metric of the state of the COVID-19 epidemic, e.g., to better measure prevalence and the 'denominator', but an opportunity to slow transmission by developing population-level shield immunity. Many logistical, social, and dynamical challenges remain if such an idea were to move from theory to feasibility. Accurate and rapid serological tests are needed at scale, including targeted surveys to identify essential workers and via populationlevel surveys. The potential scale of shield immunity depends on both the intrinsic epidemic dynamics, driving the number of recovered individuals able to provide shield immunity, and also on the ability to identify and deploy them (e.g., via the shielding parameter α). Yet, even if such tests were available, who should get them? Public health authorities and governmental agencies should consider how to prioritize those in critical roles, those with experience in disaster response, as well as prior individuals who have tested positive for COVID-19 (and could then return for both serology-based and viral shedding assays). Positive confirmation of immunity and cessation of viral shedding could help identify and deploy (tens of) thousands of individuals as part of a shield immunity strategy, with the greatest concentration likely co-located with areas in greatest need of intervention.

Importantly, both the IgM and IgG of SARS-CoV-2 in the patients with poor recovery remained positive during the late stage of the disease. This indicated that these patients might have active viral replication in the upper airway, and that persistent viral shedding might be directly linked to the poor recovery of patients with COVID-19.

Our findings might shed light on the management of COVID-19.",22.156475003565255,8.384586639803365

The status of lymphocytes and duration of viral shedding are two most common indicators in predicting prognosis of COVID-19 patients. However, it is still unclear which one of them is more reliable and more efficient. In the present study, IgG antibody can be detected in Case 1 from Feb. 20, indicating Case 1 can initiate immune responses to viral infection. However, the mRNA level of virus in Case 1 showed a similar trend to that of death cases. Taken together, these findings indicated that immune indicators could be more sensitive and reliable than viral shedding in reflecting the overall status of patients and predicting the prognosis. Actually, a recent study found that recruitment of T cells and the presence of IgG and IgM antibodies can be found before the resolution of symptoms in COVID-19 patients 13 . Therefore, we strongly suggest that immune indicators, especially the level of lymphocytes, could be a better prognostic indicator than duration of viral shedding, especially for patients in early stage.",17.96002659826633,8.186589644056607

The methods described here provide a rapid workflow for evaluating and prioritizing safe and immunogenic regions of a viral genome for use in vaccination. With the third epidemic in the past two decades underway, and all originating from a coronavirus family virus, these viruses will continue to threaten the human population, and necessitate the need for prophylactic measures against future outbreaks. A subset of the epitopes selected here are derived from viral regions sharing a high degree of homology with other viruses in the family, and thus we expect these evolutionarily conserved regions to be essential in the infectivity and replicative lifecycle across the coronavirus family, suggesting that an immune response against the epitopes listed herein may provide more broadly protective immunity against other coronaviruses.",13.034328826659667,7.638881060419292

Since, the Arenavirus ExoN belongs to the same nuclease family as that of the nsp14 coronavirus ExoN ; which has been recently shown to promote viral RNA synthesis proofreading; we propose that Arenavirus ExoN is involved in a ""limited RNA editing"" mechanism mainly controlled by structural constraints and a low mutational/fitness ratio.",12.743709766142684,7.358421455965034
