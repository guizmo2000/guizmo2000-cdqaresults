Although rodents have served as invaluable models for studying SCI mechanisms and therapeutic development, larger mammals, in particular non-human primates, share a closer size, neuroanatomy, and physiology to humans. Importantly, their larger size provides a more relevant platform for drug development, bioengineering inventions, and electrophysiological and rehabilitation studies. Nonetheless, both small and large animal models of SCI have limitations in their ability to predict the outcome in human SCI. One important factor is high degree of variability in the nature of SCI incidence, severity and location of the injury in human SCI, while in laboratory animal models, these variabilities are less (36) . Values acquired by clinical scoring systems such as ASIA or Frankel scoring systems lack the consistency of the data acquired from laboratory settings, which makes the translation of therapeutic interventions from experimental to clinical settings challenging (36) . A significant effect from an experimental treatment in consistent laboratory settings may not be reproducible in clinical settings due to high variability and heterogeneity in human populations and their injuries (36) .

Here, using the Syrian hamster/Andes virus lethal disease model, we demonstrate that another component of the immune system is not directly responsible for the HPS-like disease cause by ANDV in hamsters. The mechanism by which hantaviruses cause disease in humans and hamsters alike is not clear, and many mechanisms of disease, both immune related and virus intrinsic, have been proposed. Making this more difficult is that aspects of the immune response to hantavirus infection are likely to be important for protection and viral clearance, even as they are viewed as contributing to disease. Still, it will be necessary to continue to evaluate other immune cell types, as we seek to understand their role in contributing to disease or protection following hantavirus infection.",25.419112332185183,13.641198643676464

Human-to-human transmission is common in Bangladesh and has also been documented in India. 55 Several species of pteropid fruit bats are known to be host reservoirs of NiV, with accumulating evidence that both NiV and other paramyxoviruses can circulate worldwide in bats. [54] [55] [56] The high fatality rate, direct infection from natural reservoirs, infection following amplification in susceptible domestic livestock such as pigs, documented human-to-human transmission, and the potential ability to transverse the globe, all emphasise the pandemic potential of NiV. 56 There are no clinically approved vaccines against NiV, however, one therapeutic approach (monoclonal antibody therapy) has recently completed a phase I clinical trial with results still to be reported. 57 While monoclonal antibody treatment may be efficacious in a short window post-exposure, this treatment option is not suitable for large-scale use, and as such, vaccine development is a key research focus for the prevention of NiV-mediated disease. Advantageously, there are a number of animal models of NiV infection which are used in vaccine development programs and are considered to sufficiently mirror NiV-induced pathogenesis observed in humans, e.g. the hamster, ferret and African Green Monkey (AGM) models.

However, MNV is now known to be a widespread infectious agent of laboratory mice with a reported seroprevalence of 20-64% [7, 8] . MNV is currently the only norovirus which replicates efficiently in tissue culture, where it has a tropism for dendritic and macrophage cells [9] . The availability of immortalized macrophage cell lines such as the murine macrophage RAW264.7, has allowed significant advances to be made in understanding the life cycle of this virus. For the first time critical processes in the norovirus life cycle have been dissected e.g. the mechanism of tissue culture mediated attenuation of MNV-1 [10] , the requirement for dynamin II and cholesterol during virus entry [11, 12] , the identification and functional requirement for RNA secondary structures in virus replication [13] and pathogenesis [14] as well as the induction of apoptosis during infection [15, 16] . In addition, MNV has allowed an unprecedented analysis of the immune response to norovirus infection [17] , [18] [19] [20] [21] . This broadening in understanding of norovirus replication has been facilitated greatly by the development of murine norovirus reverse genetics [22, 23] and its recent optimisation [24] . The role of murine norovirus in potential exacerbation or complication of other diseases, especially murine models of infection, has also been investigated. This is certainly warranted given the seroprevalence of MNV in animal houses. Studies with models of Crohn's disease [25] or bacterial induced inflammatory bowel disease [26] showed a significant impact of MNV and MNV infection prolongs the shedding of mouse parvovirus [27] . In contrast, MNV co-infection had little or no impact on murine CMV [28] , Friend retrovirus infection [29] or models of diet induced obesity and insulin resistance [30] . These contrasts warrant further studies into the nature and mechanisms of interference observed in mouse models of disease. MNV has also provided a useful experimental system in determining the immune responses required for efficient norovirus vaccination [18] , [31] .

Interestingly, despite this increased sensitivity to death in the T cells, the Drak2 -/mice effectively eliminate infectious pathogens and retain the ability to combat tumors as well as wildtype mice [2, [4] [5] [6] [7] .

The rhesus macaque model more closely mimics the mild to moderate disease observed in some patients-mainly those without significant comorbidities. The increased severity of illness in the common marmoset model is an important advance in the ability to evaluate potential therapeutic agents against MERS-CoV, as discrimination between successfully treated and control animals should be more apparent.

To overcome this impediment, it was recently demonstrated that adenovirus vectored transduction of human DPP4 into multiple strains of mice, including various knock-outs, results in productive infection and mild pneumonia [12] . Notwithstanding the aforementioned mouse models, the only naturally permissive MERS-CoV disease model that has been described to date is the rhesus macaque model [13] [14] [15] .

While this model is useful, it seems to recapitulate the mild disease observed in some human cases, rather than the more severe or even lethal disease observed in many human cases.

Based largely on their recapitulation of human disease signs, ferrets have also been used to derive serotyping reagents for assessing antigenic distance between isolates and potential vaccine strains. However, recent reports suggest that ferrets may not faithfully mimic human immune responses, and that serological tests using ferret sera may not accurately assess vaccine strain efficacy [1, 2] . Therefore, there is a need to develop additional permissive small animal models of influenza virus infection that exhibit virus shedding. Serial samples collected from such animal models allow the investigator to determine both the titer and duration of virus shedding from individual animals at multiple times without euthanasia.

Cohorts of animals are infected and euthanized, and viral load or immune responses are measured in predetermined tissues. This produces static snapshots of replication only at specific times and specific sites within the animal. Moreover, inherent animal-to-animal variability introduces significant confounding effects, resulting in studies that require hundreds of animals to acquire statistical significance.

The most important advantages of ABMs are that they can consider the heterogeneity of both individuals and environment, and also the stochastic essence of infectious disease transmission. ABMs can express explicitly the differences between individuals in terms of the attributes that influence the process of disease transmission such as physical, social, economic and environmental characteristics. For example, age, gender, occupation and lifestyle variables all contribute to the subsequent disease experience of an individual and the probability of infecting other individuals [29] . The interaction between individuals, which is one of the key components determining infectious disease transmission, can be expressed explicitly in the model.

Similarly, control interventions may be spatial in nature; for example, the imposition of quarantine zones, or culling of livestock around infected farms [17, 18] . Predictive models that incorporate a spatial dimension are thus important to identify geographic subpopulations at particular risk, and hence to more effectively target preventative measures or allocate public health resources [19] .",29.720722682773264,13.40877026580246

Differences in social distancing help to explain the different dynamics of the two outbreaks. The spring outbreak received extensive attention in the Mexican press. By incorporating data on the volume of media coverage of the outbreak and by assuming that media influence leads to increased protective practices and therefore reduction in the percontact transmission probability, we were able to account for the social distancing that took place during the spring outbreak but which did not occur during the fall outbreak, achieving a good overall fit to the epidemic curves for the spring and fall outbreaks using the same model for both outbreaks.

Many modelling studies have been concerned with predicting the spread of an infectious disease at a national or international scale. Examples of this include evaluating the effectiveness of various strategies for containing outbreaks of pandemic influenza [2, 20] and Ebola [5] . Of particular interest are the patterns of international movement that can rapidly increase the scale and human cost of disease outbreaks that would once have remained more geographically constrained. Other studies have considered transmission patterns at an urban scale. Again, a key aim is to evaluate the likely effectiveness of spatially defined control measures such as school closures [21] . In the case of dengue, urban-scale spatial models have been used to help explain observed epidemiological patterns, untangling the respective roles of human and vector movement [10, 22] .

Having an animal model that can recapitulate human disease is essential for vaccine and therapeutic development as well as testing. For a potential animal model to be susceptible to infection, the virus must be able to 1.) gain entry into host cells; 2.) overcome the host's antiviral responses; and 3.) disseminate virus following infection to allow infection of other neighbouring cells and tissues. It is also of importance for the model to be able to recapitulate human disease and viral transmission modes. When evaluating the ability of an animal to be infected by a virus and serve as a model, viral shedding, clinical disease, and seroconversion should be determined. The past animal models for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were not universal due to the expression of the virus-specific cellular receptors for entry [63] . As SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV do not share a cellular receptor, they do not share the same host range and susceptibility, which includes research animal models [64] . Cynomolgus macaques, ferrets, and cats were some of the first animals to be determined susceptible to SARS-CoV [65, 66] . The advantage of ferrets is that they are a smaller animal compared to non-human primates and also are able to recapitulate some of the clinical symptoms and transmission kinetics of human respiratory viruses including coughing, sneezing, fever, and weight loss [67] . Although mice can be infected with SARS-CoV, as shown by recovery of vRNA and the elicitation of neutralizing antibodies, infection does not cause severe disease [68] . However, SARS-CoV could be passaged in mice (15 times) for the establishment of a model with clinical features [69] . After the identification of MERS-CoV, it was quickly determined that typical research animal models were not susceptible to the virus including mice, Syrian hamsters, and ferrets. Larger non-human primate models, such as Rhesus macaques and common marmoset were determined susceptible. To make use of small animal models, transgenic mice have been engineered for MERS-CoV susceptibility through expression of the human DPP4 receptor [70] . Other attempts at other mouse model developments were not successful, including an immunocompromised 129/SATA1-/-1 mouse [63] . Having an understanding of the animal models and model development previously utilized for the other coronaviruses of interest will aid in the development of a model for 2019-nCoV. As is necessary, elucidation of the receptor will help guide in development, and creating a clinical picture of the acute symptoms in humans will be essential for vaccine and antiviral evaluation.",38.69246262352251,16.9577727587442

Although there are some differences in the length of gestation, placental structure, and fetal development between humans and animal models, many structural and functional parallels exist, [94] [95] [96] which serve as tractable platforms for evaluating the safety and efficacy of various therapies during pregnancy. Similar to humans, pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits have a hemochorial placenta, and their relatively short gestation and large litters are advantageous for performing high throughput screening of candidate therapeutics for safety and efficacy. Preclinical behavioral testing of rodent offspring has proven to be a promising avenue for identifying and predicting adverse effects associated with prenatal drug exposure in children. 97 Both rodent and rabbit models have been instrumental in testing teratogenic effects of artemisinin-based combination therapies for treating malaria in pregnant women. These studies concluded that drug-related teratogenic effects are limited to the first trimester, which supports the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation that artemisinin may be administered only during the second or third trimester in pregnant women. 98, 99 One limitation of mouse and rat models, however, is their inability to recapitulate certain elements of human congenital disease. For instance, because murine CMV is not transmitted vertically as it is in humans, other animal models, including guinea pigs and nonhuman primates, are required for studying this aspect of disease pathogenesis. Studies in pregnant nonhuman primates have been instrumental for the identification of CD4 + T cell responses as critical for early control of CMV infection and transmission during pregnancy, 100 and studies in guinea pigs have demonstrated that a single-cycle infectious CMV vaccine induces immune responses similar to natural infection and protects against congenital infection. 101 Guinea pigs are also a useful model of chlamydial genital infection in humans. Experimental venereal infection with Chlamydophila caviae mimics disease associated with C. trachomatis in humans, including both sexual and perinatal transmission. Guinea pigs have therefore served as a useful model for testing candidate vaccines and treatments. 102 Rabbits continue to serve as an important model of venereal infection with Treponema pallidum, the causative agent of syphilis, which is associated with congenital disease in humans. While natural infection in rabbits is associated with the species-specific T. paraluiscanuculi, rabbits can be experimentally inoculated with human T. pallidum, and have been instrumental in testing the efficacy of candidate vaccines. 103 Many mammalian species, including rodents, 104 ruminants, 105 and nonhuman primates, 40, 106 are susceptible to infection with Listeria monocytogenes and demonstrate similar fetal complications when infection occurs during pregnancy. Studies in various animal models have uniquely contributed to our understanding of placental listeriosis and serve as a platform for evaluating prevention strategies. 107, 108 Finally, mice, 85 cotton rats, 86 guinea pigs, 88 and sheep 87 are all susceptible to infection with RSV, and vaccination of pregnant animals has facilitated the development and testing of maternal immunization strategies for protecting against neonatal RSV.

This is supported by all the best fit models and any other competitive models. Thus, puma in our study do not appear to suffer marked mortality effects from FIV, despite the known immunosuppressive consequences of lentiviruses in humans and some cat populations. There is both theoretical and empirical evidence that argues that endemic parasites (i.e., those that are permanently maintained) can have important effects on their host (Anderson & May, 1978; Scott, 1988; Tompkins et al., 2002) . For example, studies have demonstrated that parasites, including viruses, can significantly affect wildlife mortality and shape population dynamics (Cavanagh et al., 2004; Hudson, Dobson, & Newborn, 1998; Telfer et al., 2002; Tompkins & Begon, 1999 ). An opposing notion is that endemic parasites may have little effect on their host because parasite fitness would suffer if parasites measurably reduce host life expectancy (Lack, 1954) . Our lack of evidence for FIV-induced mortality in puma supports this and fits a theory of a long history of coevolutionary association between FIV-like viruses and wild feline hosts (Carpenter et al., 1996; Carpenter & O'Brien, 1995) , or a lack of virulence in the FIV strain adapted to puma. Time post-infection to disease effects could also be a factor governing the impacts of FIV; perhaps the normal lifespan of the puma is relatively short compared to the time taken for the disease effects to become apparent. A possibility is that disease-associated mortality may be dependent on time since infection, so that the disease becomes more lethal the longer an animal is infected. A potential avenue for further research would be to test a model with a disease-associated mortality term that increases with puma age.",26.95376535535536,12.245210867109284

These animal models are indispensable for the deeper understanding of any diseases and safe and protective vaccine development process (Lorenzen et al., 2015) . The main criteria for the validation of animal models in preclinical studies are face validity, predictive validity and target validity. The face validity means that the proper similarity between the animal model and the human disease in terms of the biology and symptoms of the disease. However, assessing face validity is a tedious task due to the lack of understanding on the core biology of the disease symptoms. Predictive validity means the display of clinical interventions which exhibited similar effect in the animal models. This is also very difficult to achieve due to the incomplete correlation between animal models, the mechanism of human diseases and the incapability of standard drugs to active in many animal models. Target validity is another essential component for the validation of animal models in which the target under study must have an analogous function in the disease model as in the clinical condition (Denayer et al., 2014) . An ideal animal model is the one where an immunocompetent animal, on receiving the challenge virus at a realistic dose through a suitable inoculation route, is able to replicate the characteristics of a human disease as closely as possible (Doremalen and Munster, 2015) . Ferrets, hamsters, mice and other small laboratory animals are not ideal animal models for MERS-CoV owing to the variations in DPP4 receptor. The rhesus macaque and the common marmoset are the first non-human primate species (NPS) to be used as the animal models for MERS-CoV. Glycosylation of mouse DPP4 (mDPP4) prevents its binding to S protein of MERS-CoV. Hence, transgenic hDPP4 (human DPP4) mice were developed as animal model (Peck et al., 2015) .

For directly transmitted infections, environmental conditions can be major drivers of cycles in incidence, with influenza and cholera transmission being notable examples (e.g., see [3, 80] ). The effects of climate on flu transmission have been studied using population-level data coupled with transmission models, as well as empirical animal studies [84] , to demonstrate the effects of temperature and humidity on transmission. Although climate conditions undoubtedly play a direct role in several directly transmitted infections, they may play a more nuanced role in vector-borne disease systems in which they modulate vector population dynamics and subsequently disease transmission. For example, in the case of African sleeping sickness (Table 1) , the rainy season is hypothesized to modify tsetse fly distribution, which results in changes in human-tsetse fly contact and subsequently African sleeping sickness incidence; in this case, we can classify the seasonal driver as (1) vector seasonality alone or as (2) seasonal climate influencing vector seasonality and vector seasonality having a downstream effect on seasonal exposure.

We examined whether the expression of LAG3 and CD49b would differ based on the inflammatory response in three mouse models of lung inflammation. Mice carrying the IL-10 GFP /Foxp3 RFP dual reporters were exposed intranasally to house dust mite (HDM) protein extract (as a model of allergic asthma), Saccharopolyspora rectivirgula (SR) (as a model of HP/farmer's lung disease), or infected intranasally with WSN/flu virus (as a model of influenza infection). We observed significant percentages of IL-10-producing T cells in the lung tissue of mice exposed to HDM (Figure 3A) , SR (Figure 3C) , or WSN/flu virus ( Figure 3E) . These IL-10-producing T cells all co-expressed high levels of LAG3 and CD49b, and include Foxp3 + CD4 + , Foxp3 − CD4 − , and CD8 + subsets in all disease models analyzed (Figure 3) . However, the relative proportions of IL-10-producing Foxp3 + CD4 + , Foxp3 − CD4 − , and CD8 + subsets differed in the various disease models (Figure 3) . In contrast to the composition of IL-10-producing LAG3 + CD49b + T cells induced by Nb infection, in which the Foxp3 − CD4 + subset is the majority (72% in Figure 2D ), in HDM-induced allergic asthma model, the largest subset of the IL-10-producing LAG3 + CD49b + T cells in the lungs are Foxp3 + CD4 + T cells (60%), followed by Foxp3 − CD4 + T cells (32%), while CD8 + T cells are only around 1.4% (Figure 3B ). In the SR-triggered farmer's lung disease model, Foxp3 + CD4 + T cells are the majority of the IL-10producing LAG3 + CD49b + T cell subset in the lungs, however, there are similar percentages of Foxp3 − CD4 + and CD8 + T cells (16% each) (Figure 3D) . Strikingly in the murine model of influenza infection, CD8 + T cells are the largest subset of the IL-10-producing LAG3 + CD49b + T cells in the lungs (86%), followed by Foxp3 − CD4 + T cells, while Foxp3 + CD4 + are a minority ( Figure 3F) . These data compared the composition of IL-10-producing LAG3 + CD49b + T cells in various murine models of pulmonary inflammatory diseases. Along with the model of parasitic infection shown in Figure 2 , our data suggest that co-expression of LAG3 and CD49b marks all IL-10-producing T cell lineages in the pulmonary system, and relative abundance of the marked T cell subsets is dependent on the type of immune response as shown in the disease models.",27.338912904416464,15.179554787332048

Ross showed that malaria was transmitted through mosquitos and developed a model to describe the spread of malaria [8] . He then deduced from this model that reducing the mosquito population could control malaria in a region. This model was probably the first example of the threshold concept, which has been central in epidemiology ever since. The idea is that most mathematical epidemic models, including those that include a high degree of heterogeneity, usually exhibit ""threshold"" behaviour. In epidemiological terms, these can be stated as follows: If the average number of secondary infections caused by a single infective introduced into a wholly susceptible population is less than one a disease will die out, while if it exceeds one there will be an epidemic. This broad principle, consistent with observations and quantified via epidemiological models, has been used regularly to estimate the effectiveness of vaccination policies and the likelihood that a disease may be eliminated or eradicated.

This could occur due to demographic or biological changes that increase transmission, such as declining vaccine coverage [15] or pathogen adaptation [18] [19] [20] . Yet a recent review of transmission models for zoonotic infection identified a marked shortage of models that address the dynamics of zoonoses exhibiting stuttering chain transmission [4] . One major cause of this gap is that highresolution data describing individual-level disease transmission are rare. The introduction events that trigger the stuttering chains are sporadic, and the transient nature of stuttering chains makes them difficult to track closely. Furthermore, contact tracing is logistically challenging because it requires rapid response surveillance teams and techniques for differentiating specific routes of disease transmission. In contrast, the total size of a transmission chain (i.e. the total number of cases infected) is much easier to obtain, since it does not require detailed contact tracing and can be assessed retrospectively based on case histories or serology. Accordingly, the most common data sets for stuttering pathogens are chain size distributions, which describe the number of cases arising from each of many separate introductions. Such data can be used to make estimates of R 0 (or the 'effective reproductive number' in the presence of vaccination; for simplicity we will use the term R 0 for all settings) [2, 15, [21] [22] [23] . This strategy has been applied successfully, particularly in the context of vaccinepreventable diseases, but one important simplification is that these analyses typically have not allowed for an unknown degree of heterogeneity in disease transmission among individual cases. This is an important omission, because individual variation in infectiousness is substantial for many infections [24] and can cause significant skews in the chain size distribution [25] . Thus it may be expected to affect conclusions about chain size distributions. For example, failure to account for superspreading events caused by highly infectious individuals can trigger false alarms in systems designed to detect anomalously large chains [2, 19] .",27.304008333454973,13.450463301936445

There is a tendency on the part of mathematicians to want to study models which are too simple to capture the essential properties of a disease, while there is a tendency on the part of epidemiologists to want complete models which may be too difficult to analyze properly. Detailed models are generally difficult or impossible to solve analytically; hence, their usefulness for theoretical purposes is limited, although their strategic value may be high. Also, more detailed models contain more parameters and therefore it may be more difficult to fit parameters to the model.

Furthermore, the columns indicate at which level the impact of prevention measures is modelled, distinguishing whether behavioural change is implemented through a switch in infectious disease state (e.g. vaccination immunizes previously susceptible persons, and this can be modelled by moving them from the susceptible to the immune state), a change in model parameters (e.g. hygiene measures may be assumed to reduce the effectiveness of transmission) or in social contact structure (e.g. social distancing may be mimicked by a link-breaking or rewiring process between susceptible and infectious individuals in contact networks). Studies can appear in multiple categories, as some have multiple prevention strategies or multiple effects on the disease transmission model. For the transmission model category, we interpreted to which extent heterogeneity is introduced in the model. All references are categorized and represented in a spreadsheet that can be found as electronic supplementary material. The model type is often disease-dependent.

Studies with non-human primates [90, 91] have demonstrated that animals treated with sub-neutralizing levels of antibody develop higher serum viremia compared to untreated animals. However, attempts to reproduce DHF in non-human primates have been unsuccessful. Investigators have attempted with some success to develop mouse models of DENV infection and disease (reviewed in [92] ). The most successful mouse model of antibody enhanced severe disease is based on infecting interferon receptor-deficient AG129 mice with a mouse adapted strain of DENV2 [93, 94] . AG129 mice treated with anti-dengue monoclonal antibodies or polyclonal sera and then infected with DENV developed a lethal vascular leak disease, with similarities to DHF. The cells involved with ADE driven infection were Fc receptor bearing cells including sinusoidal endothelial cells in the liver. In addition to vascular leakage, the disease was characterized by elevated level of cytokines (TNFα, IL-6, and IL-10), and thrombocytopenia, which is similar to severe DENV illness in humans [93, 94] . While specific cellular mechanisms leading to vascular leakage are likely to be different in humans and mice, especially mice deficient in interferon receptors, these animal studies establish that antibodies can enhance viral replication and induce host cytokines responses that lead to clinical outcomes similar to DHF/DSS.

These models are often based on the mass-action principle to designate the transmission probability. Each individual has an equal probability of contracting disease given the disease state levels in the population. Metapopulation models split the population into different subpopulations with their own (spatial) general characteristics and disease-related parameters. The individual-level category consists of network models and IBMs. Network models represent disease transmission on a network where nodes (individuals) are connected to each other using links. This allows to model individuals with different degrees, representing how many links a node has (i.e. number of neighbours/direct contacts). IBMs or ABMs typically incorporate more heterogeneity and stochasticity on individuals' characteristics such as spatial location, age, gender, sexual orientation, etc. The model selection depends on disease characteristics, data availability, modelling purpose (i.e. what outcome figures are you interested in?), computational resources, etc.",30.68132960144387,13.68002304206587

The information the individual assesses can be obtained in a direct way (e.g. through prevalence in neighbours) or in an indirect way (e.g. through rumours or opinions). These models do not elaborate on how behaviour is rationally determined or influenced by relevant factors. Instead, behaviour formation is a result of a predefined threshold function. Examples include switching to social distancing when the number of infectives exceeds a threshold [114] , social distancing by rewiring once a noninfected node connects to an infected node [132] , and-as in Wu [184] [185] [186] 188, 189] . In this category, instead of a threshold, the information is a continuous input in the decision-making process of individuals. At the population level, we can characterize these BCMs as information driving the flow in and out the prevention taking compartment. Two subcategories can be distinguished: models with a direct relation between infectious disease parameters and behaviour formation (i.e. behaviour changes visà-vis disease dynamics), and models with an indirect relation, through an information spread medium. For the former subcategory, the behaviour or decision-making process is predefined as a functional relation depending on disease transmission parameters. The functional form does not need to be linear. Some examples are vaccination coverage as a positive decreasing function of perceived risk of VRSE [148] , the percentage of the susceptible population engaging in avoidance actions increases as the disease becomes more prevalent [48] and a model where the effective contact rate reduces with the number of infectives [119] . The latter subcategory requires a third-party spreading the information for individuals to receive. For instance through mass media, neighbours, formation of opinions in the population, etc. A multitude of these models introduce an 'aware' compartment in the model where aware and unaware individuals are assigned distinct disease transmission parameters such that aware individuals have lower susceptibility of acquiring infection. See for example Funk et al. [104] , in which a rate introduces people in an 'aware' class after which the awareness spreads through the population, coupling disease transmission with a BCM. Interestingly, some models introduce information spread models with characteristics from disease transmission models where individuals are, for example, susceptible to or infected with diseaserelated information. Misra et al. [105] use a model with media coverage creating awareness in the population, also introducing an 'aware' compartment in a population model. Social impact is introduced in a model by Ni et al. [186] , where they use a variety of complex networks for the spread of opinions driving the individual probability of prevention behaviour. The use of a network is convenient to model these dynamics as they allow clustering of, for instance, vaccine-related sentiments in the population. Most often these models assign additional characteristics to nodes (which represent individuals), apart from disease state. An example could be that a node is assigned a disease state and an opinion which is either provaccination or contravaccination. When simulating the disease and behaviour dynamics in this network, when nodes interact, transmission of both disease and opinions can occur. Such that if a provaccine node is surrounded by many vaccine sceptics, it might change its opinion towards the opinions of its links (i.e. neighbours) and as a result this will influence the individual's probability of taking vaccination as a prevention measure.",30.0619185896864,13.3245267000052

HeV was initially identified during an outbreak of acute respiratory disease in horses in Australia in 1994. To date, 7 human cases of HeV infection have been identified, all associated with direct contact with infected horses and with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 57% [2] . NiV was first identified as the cause of an outbreak of acute respiratory and neurological disease in pigs in 1998-99 that led to infections in humans in Malaysia (283 cases) and Singapore (11 cases) with a CFR of 38% [3] . Subsequent outbreaks of NiV have occurred almost yearly in humans in Bangladesh and India with increased CFR (75%) and higher prevalence of respiratory disease (from 40% to 75%) [2, 4] . In addition, human-to-human transmission has only been observed during outbreaks of NiV in Bangladesh. The NiV strains isolated during outbreaks in Malaysia and Bangladesh are genetically distinct and have been designated as the Malaysia strain (NiV-M) and Bangladesh strain (NiV-B), respectively [5, 6] . In hamsters and other animal models, infection with HeV is generally more severe than infection with NiV-M and NiV-B [7, 8] . These possible differences in virulence between HeV and NiV-M have also been observed in the recently developed African green monkey model [9] . Interestingly, in that same model, a recent study showed that NiV-B is more pathogenic, similar to what is seen during outbreaks of human disease [10] .

In primary COPD AECs, FP suppressed RV induction of IFN responses and also enhanced mucus production. We confirmed these findings in vivo using a mouse model of COPD exacerbation 25 , to similarly demonstrate that FP suppresses RV-induced IFN responses leading to delayed virus clearance and mucus hypersecretion in vivo. Thus, FP administration in both in vitro and in vivo COPD models was associated with suppressed IFN responses, confirming that these adverse effects still occur in steroid-resistant disease models, and the increased virus load and mucus production observed in vivo could impact adversely on exacerbation severity.

It is assumed in the homogeneous compartmental model that all individuals are linked by a regular random pattern (Bansal, Grenfell & Meyers, 2007) . On the other hand, the heterogeneous models, namely spatial and metapopulation, possess different assumptions that take into account the higher realistic contact structures. The idea of a contact network emerged from the mathematical graph theory and was first used in social sciences. Two fundamental components that form a network are called ''vertex'' and ''edge'' (Lanzas & Chen, 2015) . A vertex is a unit of interest for an individual, a group of people, a village, a city, or even an entire country. An edge is the link between a pair of vertices. The edge represents the bond between vertices, which is important in disease transmission, such as animal movement or human transportation. The interaction is further divided into directed and undirected (Martínez-López, Perez & Sánchez-Vizcaíno, 2009) , of which the directed links dictate the incoming and outgoing edges; for example, flight itineraries, whereas the undirected approach does not consider directions, such as co-author networks. In epidemiology, contact network modeling has often been used to investigate disease transmission in both humans (Vazquez-Prokopec et al., 2013; Machens et al., 2013) and animals (Craft, 2015; Rossi et al., 2017) .

For face validity there must be similarities in the pathology and clinical symptoms between the animal model and the human disease (56). As discussed above, NiV infection of pigs causes a similar respiratory and neurological syndrome as seen in human infections. Although, disease severity in pigs may be considered lower than in humans. The predictive validity of a model means that clinically effective interventions demonstrate a similar effect in the animal model (56) . No clinical trials of NiV vaccine candidates have been reported to compare with vaccine performance in animal models, including the pig. As noted above, the success of the Equivac R HeV vaccine in horses and other animal models was not replicated in swine (38, 39) , highlighting a potential issue of predicative validity when comparing NiV vaccines between animal species, which may extend to humans.

In particular, the restriction of infectious NiV work to BSL-4 containment has hampered progress. Conventional clinical trials with viruses such as NiV are not practical. To address the development of countermeasures for exotic pathogens such as NiV the FDA implemented the Animal Efficacy Rule in 2002. This rule specifically applies to the development of countermeasures when human efficacy studies are not possible or ethical. Briefly, this rule permits the evaluation of vaccines or therapeutics using data generated from studies performed in animal models that faithfully recapitulate human disease. There are currently at least eight animal models for NiV including the IFNAR-KO mouse model [35] ; the guinea pig model [36] ; the pig model [8, [37] [38] [39] ; the cat model [10, 11] ; the golden Syrian hamster model [7, [40] [41] [42] ; the ferret model [30, 43] ; and two nonhuman primate models, one in squirrel monkeys [44] and the other in African green monkeys [32] . While each of these models shares at least one or more aspects seen in human pathogenesis and can contribute to vaccine and therapeutic testing, the two animal models which completely emulate the pathogenesis seen in human cases to date are the ferret model and the African green monkey model.

Methods: Using experimental data, we formulated mathematical models of pathogen infection dynamics from which we simulated mechanistically its transmission parameters.

In bacterial microbiome studies, a powerful approach has been the ability to colonize mice with either a single defined bacteria of interest or a consortia of bacteria. By analogy, it would be ideal if the virome could be functionally interrogated in similar fashion. However, a prerequisite for eukaryotic viruses is that one must first be able to establish infection in the relevant animal model. As with establishing cell-culture systems, the paucity of animal-infection models for novel viruses stems in part from lack of effort to develop such systems. Moreover, the challenge is exacerbated by the multitude of potential infection routes that need to be evaluated, need to overcome the immune response, cross-species transmission barriers, and (even within a species) potential impact of varying genetic backgrounds. Use of transgenic animals that are immunodeficient [26] or that have been partially humanized [27] has enabled development of murine models for some viruses. In an ideal world, animal models for all eukaryotic viruses identified in virome studies would be established, enabling the roles of any single virus (or cocktail of viruses) to be functionally evaluated. Likewise, having an extensive library of cultivated phages (see above) will allow them to be combined in defined proportions along with eukaryotic viruses for experimental studies. For phages, presuming they act by modulating the bacterial community, the animal model must harbor the relevant bacterial host species, and thus the bacterial microbiome may need to be manipulated as well. Notably, some recent studies have suggested that phages may also interact directly with eukaryotic host cells [28, 29] . Overall, significant effort and resources must be expended to establish robust animal-infection models suitable to define the role of the virome.

No evidence of HeV-specific pathology was observed in any of the m102.4-treated animals and no infectious HeV could be recovered. This study revealed that hmAb m102.4 prevented wide-spread HeV dissemination in virus challenged subjects, and was the first successful post-exposure in vivo therapy against HeV and the first in a nonhuman primate [21] . During the 2010 HeV spillover occurrence in Queensland, Australia, there were two individuals that were considered to be at high risk of HeV infection [35] . The m102.4 hmAb was requested by Australian health authorities and administered to the two individuals as a compassionate use therapeutic option even though no human safety testing has been carried out and it was not recommended for use in humans. In this instance, m102.4 was administered to the individuals prior to any HeV diagnosis or onset of clinical disease [35] with doses (,19 mg/kg) sufficient to achieve a high serum concentration, and to date both individuals remain healthy and no evidence of HeV infection has been reported. The antibody appeared well tolerated when administered which was not unexpected since m102.4 is a human mAb. The m102.4 hmAb is now in further pre-clinical development stages in both the United States and Australia.",27.84070925842241,12.774984293437804

Increasingly, the expectation is that reliable forecasts will be available in real time. Recent examples in which model-based forecasts were produced within weeks of the index case include severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS; [4, 5] ), pandemic H1N1 influenza [6] , cholera in Haiti and Zimbabwe [7] , Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS; [8] ), and lately, Ebola virus disease (EBVD) in West Africa [9, 10] . In the early stages of an emerging pathogen outbreak, key unknowns include its transmission potential, the likely magnitude and timing of the epidemic peak, total outbreak size, and the durations of the incubation and infectious phases. Many of these quantities can be estimated using clinical and household transmission data, which are, by definition, rare in the early stages of such an outbreak. Much interest, therefore, centres on estimates of these quantities from incidence reports that accumulate as the outbreak gathers pace. Such estimates are obtained by fitting mathematical models of disease transmission to incidence data.",29.536431730972698,12.500834533984898

The development of the existing disease models and studies of CCHFV-infected cells indicate the importance of the early innate immune response in disease [88, 125] . In order to better model early events in human infection, continued efforts should be made in the development of immunocompetent CCHF animal models. An immunocompetent model may provide critical insight into correlates of protection and enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenesis that are largely restricted to in vitro investigations at this time. Given the complex role of the immune response in CCHF pathogenesis, such models would be invaluable for screening new therapeutic and vaccine candidates. CCHFV has been recognized as a significant emerging public health threat and is becoming a higher public health priority. Vaccine and therapeutic development for CCHF are rapidly expanding fields.

For the past 20 years, in vivo CF-related research has predominately used genetically modified murine models [1] . These mouse models have proven invaluable for studying aspects of CF pathophysiology, however, they have important limitations. Obvious disparities between murine and human anatomy and physiology mean that phenotypes observed in humans are not always reproduced in mice [2] . Investigating some features of CF airway disease in mouse models has proven problematic, as CF mice fail to develop hallmark features including mucus obstruction, chronic bacterial infections, and persistent inflammation. Of all clinical manifestations associated with human CF, progressive lung disease is the predominant cause of morbidity and mortality among patients [3] .

Similarity between human disease phenotypes and animal model phenotypes is critical factor for elucidation of the pathogenesis of the human diseases. However, susceptibilities of animals to human pathogens differ significantly depending on animal species and strains. Then, phenotypes of infectious diseases on animal model may differ slightly from the human diseases requiring careful interpretation of the animal model phenotypes. Existing murine models of asthma with respiratory virus infection have shown influenza viruses are involved in asthma development [11] . However, other murine models developed to examine the pathogenesis of influenza/allergic asthma show that asthmatic mice are highly resistant to influenza virus infection [12] [13] [14] , which contradicts the findings of epidemiological studies in humans, implying that further studies using other animal models are needed to elucidate the pathogenesis of this complicated comorbidity of influenza virus infection in asthmatics. An ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized and OVA-challenged murine model (based on BALB/c mice) is one of the most popular and proven models of allergic airway inflammation [15] . However, it is often difficult to reproduce complicated clinical settings faithfully with animal models using only a few inbred laboratory mice strains because different laboratory strains of mice show different susceptibilities and responses to antigens [16, 17] . An inbred strain of laboratory mice, NC/Nga, has been used as an animal model of human atopic dermatitis [18] [19] [20] because they harbor mutations on chromosome 9 that are linked to increased IgE production and increased Th2 responses [21] . Repeated administration of allergens to the skin of these mice induces atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions; this does not happen in BALB/c mice [22, 23] . Moreover, massive and prolonged allergic responses, such as eosinophilic infiltration and IgE production with severe airway inflammation, were observed in OVA-sensitized and OVA-challenged NC/Nga mice, but not in BALB/c mice, indicating that NC/Nga mice are more sensitive to several types of allergic disease/reaction (including allergic airway inflammation) than BALB/c mice [24, 25] .",27.706270054238374,14.680620732247895

It is, therefore, important to establish a general role of neutrophils in respiratory virus infection to provide a groundwork into more specific questions (e.g., are neutrophils capable of catering to a virus-specific response?). Herein, the evidence for the presence and activities of neutrophils during respiratory viral infection is reviewed. Having established spatio-temporal aspects of the neutrophil response to influenza A virus (IAV), the potential antiviral function(s) of neutrophils during acute virus infection as well as recovery from infection are discussed. The discussion will focus on IAV and neutrophil activities during the course of a ""typical"" flu infection: activation, migration, and effector functions in situ (Figure 1) . IAV are particularly wellsuited for the study of neutrophils in viral respiratory disease, since they are well-studied in humans and animal models, and it is well-established that infection with specific viral variants (i.e., genetic point mutations) alter the course of disease from mild to severe (28). More recently, specific IAV viral variants that affect pathogenicity have been linked to alterations of the neutrophil response (29). Thus, a comparison of the neutrophil response between disease phenotypes of a single virus species (Influenza A virus) may elucidate a role for neutrophils in the viral microenvironment. Herein, we review evidence of neutrophil responses during the course of disease in various IAV phenotypes in animal models of infection, as well as comparing these responses to what is known about neutrophil responses during bacterial infection of the airways.",32.99738547986345,14.829165772844938

The evaluation of an antiviral, in the context of a host with a functioning immune system, enables better understanding of therapeutics' potential efficacy. The evaluation of an antiviral in the context of an impaired immune system enables better understanding of therapeutic use in a particular immunosuppressed population. Pathogen host range, especially if not a simple issue of receptor utilization, can confound the ability to interpret, and extrapolate to the human, some of the nuances of the host pathogen interaction and prediction of potential human therapeutic benefit. Of the small animal models used to evaluate antiviral efficacy, all have used stringent virus challenges (all greater than 10 × LD 50 ) and shown survival benefit. Routes of infection have used methods that attempt to simulate potential human routes of infection and resultant human illness courses. Given the uncertainties of what a human infectious or lethal monkeypox dose is, it is difficult to extrapolate the potential -best fit‖ of any of these models for human disease. The clinical time course of disease in the prairie dog model, however, has a temporal relationship that is close to what has been described with human systemic orthopoxvirus (variola or monkeypox) disease. However, a limitation of the prairie dog and some of the other described animal systems, with the exception of the mouse model, is a paucity of immune reagents. There are a handful of antiviral compounds which show promise in these small animal models using monkeypox virus as the challenge. Additional studies evaluating treatment benefit when used in later stages of disease, their effect on elicitation of a protective immune response, evaluation of antiviral resistance, and their effect on viral shedding will improve our understanding of how they may be used in treatment of human disease, or in response to epidemic disease.",32.369071154671715,13.57811619451367

Arboviruses need multiple hosts to complete their cycle (i.e., host and vector), making it possible to impact disease by targeting either the arthropod vector and/or the pathogen. For some of these pathogens, efficient antivirals or vaccines are not available, in some cases due to the genetic variability of these viruses. Moreover, there are a limited availability of animal models to study infections, and some of them display a poor immunogenicity and some others viral infections cause neglected diseases that have not been deeply studied. Transmission between the vector and the host occurs when the vector feeds on the blood of the host by biting. However, the vector does not act as a simple vehicle that passively transfer viruses from one individual to another. Instead, arthropod-derived factors found in their saliva have an important role in infection and disease, modulating (positively and negatively) replication and dissemination within the host [1, 2] . In addition, the inflammatory response that the host mounts against these vector molecules can enhance the severity of arbovirus infection [3, 4] .",27.63819811157448,12.394091269316494

Here a SISI (S for susceptible and I for infectious) epidemiological model for human to human in two areas describing MERS-CoV disease transmission is presented, as well as the associated basic reproductive number. Firstly, we formulate a SISI model to describe the transmission of MERS-CoV in two areas. Next, we evaluate the basic reproductive number using the next generation matrix method. Basic reproductive number is discussed in order to identify influential model parameters, so with controlling parameters in it, the outbreak of the disease can be eliminated.

The advent of new imaging and ""omic"" technologies has provided the ability to follow these interactions from whole animal to cellular and molecular levels, enabling a greater understanding of the mechanisms involved; this facilitates the development and refinement of new and existing vaccines and therapeutics. For example, advances in bioimaging provide a noninvasive means of identifying the internal systemic spread of infection in animal models and the impact of a prophylaxis or a therapy on the disease process. This can be combined with the analysis of responses at a cellular level using flow cytometry and microscopy techniques. The use of microarrays has also enhanced our understanding of the host response to infection and provides supportive information to help elucidate the innate and adaptive immune mechanisms essential for protection against pathogens, as well as the virulence mechanisms deployed by the pathogen. Although in its infancy, next generation sequencing also holds great potential for defining host-pathogen interactions. This review will assess the impact of these technologies on the ability to assess the host response and how this has been applied to help progress the development of vaccines and immunotherapies against biodefence agents described in the Centers for Disease Control and prevention (CDC) Select Agent list (http://www.selectagents.gov/). Biodefence agents are dangerous pathogens that require high levels of biocontainment and are relatively less-studied (compared with the majority of public health pathogens) and cases are relatively rare. Therefore, studies to test the efficacy of therapeutics in a healthy population from an endemic area are often not feasible and the use of animal models is essential. This review focuses on the use of these new techniques to help us understand host responses in animal models as well as humans. In this context, both ""omic"" and imaging technologies hold great promise for important breakthroughs in the rational development of vaccines and therapies. ",25.290534884187814,11.384791420557729

However, employing DNA as a basis for vaccination also implicates some disadvantages. A concern in this context is the long-term persistence of DNA plasmids upon injection. Indeed, DNA persistence was shown in various preclinical studies that demonstrated the presence of plasmid DNA for up to 2 years upon IM injection with low but detectable expression and immunogenicity in a mouse model (88) . According to the FDA, DNA persistence is not generally evident at ectopic sites in biodistribution and persistence studies, but remains detectable at the injection sites for periods exceeding 60 days 8 . Especially in the context of this long-term persistence, the presence of foreign genetic information in the nucleus of transfected cells poses the additional risk of genomic integration into the host's chromosomes and the resulting threat of mutagenesis and oncogenesis. Despite negative results in several studies focusing on detection of DNA integration events upon IM injection in small animal models, genomic integration events were detectable following electroporation in mice (89, 90) demonstrating that integration represents a small risk that nevertheless needs to be considered in systems with enhanced DNA uptake. The FDA recommends integration studies to be included whenever plasmid DNA exceeding 30,000 copies per µg of host DNA persists in any tissue by study termination. The WHO advises integration studies as part of the preclinical safety program of DNA vaccines 9 . In addition, injection of bacterial DNA, sensed by the presence of unmethylated CpG motifs, has been associated with safety concerns, such as the generation of antibodies against the injected DNA. However, no anti-DNA antibodies have been detectable in mice, rats, rabbits or non-human primates (90) . Potential expression of the antibiotic resistance marker in vaccinated organisms has likewise raised safety concerns that are met by the replacement of these markers in next generation DNA vaccines. Lastly, expression of cytokines or co-stimulatory molecules that are used to enhance DNA immunogenicity might lead to unintended adverse effects upon cytokine expression and release such as generalized immune suppression, chronic inflammation or autoimmunity. The WHO recommends monitoring the persistence of a cytokine expressing plasmid as well as appropriate preclinical models, such as animal models responsive to the respective human cytokine to ensure vaccine safety.",20.071184341371772,9.868549840143572

Since then, a lot of complex models have been developed that deal with various epidemiological aspects of malaria as well as drug target identification. These models are a function of host-and parasite-specific factors, their interactions and environmental conditions. While the basic Ross model focused on the susceptibility of humans to malaria, models such as the Macdonald, Anderson-May models have gone deeper into the parasitic life cycle within the host [33, 34] .

It represents the leading cause of non-traumatic disability among young adults and has a great socio-economic impact in developed countries. MS is a very heterogeneous disease, indeed its clinical signs and symptoms are very variable and depend on the parts of the affected CNS (brain and spinal cord), including motor, sensory, autonomic and cognitive disabilities (Noseworthy et al., 2000) . It can run at least three clinical courses: the relapsingremitting (RR), which is the most frequent (85%) and it is characterized by exacerbations and subsequent periods of clinical stability; secondary progressive (SP) and the primary-progressive (PP) subtype (Noseworthy et al., 2000) . CNS tissue from Multiple Sclerosis patients shows discrete lesions with inflammatory infiltrates, demyelination, astrogliosis and early axonal damage. MS is widely considered an autoimmune demyelinating disease, where an autoimmune reaction by myelin-specific CD4 þ T helper 1 (Th1) and Th17 cells, which initiate the neuropathology, has been described (Hafler et al., 2005; Sospedra and Martin, 2005) . A specific cause for the pathogenesis of MS has not been identified so far, although several genetic and environmental risk factors have been suggested to play a central role. In this context, animal models of MS had allowed to explore mechanisms of disease initiation and progression and test several novel therapeutical approaches for the disease. the question whether these animal models could really represent a good model for MS since they do not perfectly reflect all the aspects of the human disease. In particular, disease initiation is usually highly artificial in the animal models (induced by active immunization with an auto-antigen). Also the time-frame of the clinical symptoms onset is different between humans and mice. In humans, physiological processes underlying the disease are undetected for years before the onset of clinical manifestations, while symptoms in the animal models can be detected within weeks or even days after induction of the disease. Moreover the treatment in these therapy studies started very early in the course of the induced autoimmune disease, whereas any therapy for humans is administered in a late phase of the disease. More importantly, most of the experimental studies use inbred strains mice with genetic homogeneity and often these mice may have accumulated genetic irregularities that are very difficult to find in human population. Although it has become clear that rodent and human immune systems have profound differences (as they are evolutionarily distant), they share some essential principles and, in this context, the availability of three major animal models of MS allowed the understanding of relevant features of the human MS. The most commonly studied animal models of MS are (1) the experimental autoimmune/allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE); (2) viral induced models, mainly Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection and consequential chronic demyelination and (3) toxin-induced models of demyelination, such as the cuprizone and the lyso-phosphatidylcholine (lysolecithin) models.",30.16129012937259,12.999660484117456

Due to urgent public health need for effective treatments against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, development of animal models of CoV infection emphasized these pathogens [58, 59] . Reproducible models of highly pathogenic coronavirus infection in common laboratory animal species have utility not only in development and testing of pan-coronavirus drugs, but also in elucidating mechanisms of viral replication or disease pathogenesis. Desirable qualities for animal models of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV include recapitulation of severe disease symptoms seen in SARS and MERS patients, and lethality caused by fulminant viral infection of the lung as indicated by high viral titers, inflammatory infiltrates, and aberrant cell signaling programs. Although therapeutic efficacy against viral transmission is essential to disrupting SARS or MERS outbreaks, current animal model development has focused on disease resulting from relevant infection routes (i.e. intranasal) over directly developing models of CoVs transmission.",35.49055304542495,13.989183583312826

A key finding from our review of the literature is that current animal models for highly pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are not adequate to support advanced development of antiviral therapeutics. MERS-CoV continues to circulate on the Arabian Peninsula, providing the opportunity to investigate some treatments of MERS in clinical trials. However, future emerging coronaviruses may require use of the FDA Animal Efficacy Rule for Investigational New Drugs (INDs). INDs must fulfill the Animal Efficacy Rule criteria of i) reasonable safety for initial use in humans, ii) pharmacological data that support reasonably well-understood mechanism of activity against the pathogen, and iii) efficacy in animal models with disease signs representative of clinical illness in humans (including one nonrodent model). While the vigorous pursuit of small animal models has been successful in generating rodent models that recapitulate severe SARS and MERS disease signs (including morbidity and mortality), progress in generating additional animal models has lagged, particularly in primate models of SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV infection. Past strategies for experimental treatment regimens primarily relied on combination therapies with approved drugs known to have acceptable safety profiles and broad-spectrum antiviral activity including IFNs, ribavirin, and corticosteroids. However, analyses of data returned from these treatments indicated that most regimens were not effective in treating SARS and MERS patients. With sufficient investment in the development of drug discovery pipeline model systems, pan-coronavirus targets based on supportive in vitro and in vivo evidence for effective treatments during the current MERS outbreaks and future outbreaks of emergent CoVs (Figure 3 ).",28.356943076231833,13.97930876501656

Whilst it is sure that the vast majority of the animal models used in the laboratory are mice and rats because of well rehearsed arguments: they are small, easy to work with, inexpensive to keep, their generation time is short and they have large litters that can allow controlled breeding programmes, however, in part because of their short lifespan, murine models may fail to reproduce authentically the human diseases process. Therefore, longitudinal studies still need to be performed in large animal models. Dog, cat, sheep and, in general, large animal models have a longer lifespan, their physiological parameters, e.g. their immune system, and their size make them more similar to humans than the murine models. This does not address the question of ethics, and certainly not of cost. The use of larger animal models allows the disease states to be modelled more accurately than rodent models, some of these diseases are even naturally occurring e.g. gene therapy has been evaluated in the brains of cats affected with α-mannosidosis (AMD) and the RPE65 −/− dog suffers from early and severe visual impairment, similar to that seen in human Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). The pig can be used both for the prevention of (porcine) foot-and-mouth disease and in studying human heart disease. Horses naturally develop arthritis. Even choosing to move to fish as an initial model is, quite rightly, covered by the same ethical issues as murine models. So we are not advocating zebrafish as an insignificant model, rather we are highlighting that some fish models may enable useful biological data to be collected in certain research areas, with regard to skin pigmentation, deafness, and for cancer studies, and especially we stress that fish are relevant for the ease of production of 200-600 embryos and then looking in vivo with single cell resolution. The cellular and genetic basis of disease (phenotypes at high resolution) can be routinely studied in zebrafish and medaka. We are keenly aware of the importance of refinement (in the experiment), reduction (in the total number of animals used), and replacement (of animals with cells lines or computer modelling) (the 3Rs). We are not aware of any published examples that did not translate from one model to another. Animals are useful models for studying a treatment hypothesis of a specific disease, but we always need to verify that hypothesis in human clinical trials.",32.224977230805564,13.462148497027599

The main constraint calls for maintaining the correspondence of transmission rates in the two models. A variation of parameters in Table 1 , for example, may significantly alter the dynamics of the Taiwan outbreak through changes in the disease transmission rate, which could be derived anew using the basic or network-based model. Alternatively, variations of parameters in Table 2 could be explored by utilizing either model with the appropriate previously-derived rate of disease transmission. In bringing this section of the paper to a close, quantitative results from the basic epidemic model elucidate changes in outbreak dynamics due to variations of selected parameters in Tables 1 and 2 .",28.14461939631707,10.620225535179994

This can involve inhibitory effects at multiple levels of the hypothalamic-pituitarytesticular axis. Men with critical illness, burn trauma, sepsis, and rheumatoid arthritis have elevated serum TNF and IL1 levels and reduced testosterone. 367,683-685 Similar decreases in gonadal function have been reproduced in experimental animal models of chronic inflammation and systemic immune activation. For example, experimental adjuvant-induced arthritis causes a dramatic reduction in serum testosterone levels in rats, 686, 687 and conditioned medium from testicular macrophages isolated from adjuvant-induced arthritic rats is inhibitory to Leydig cell testosterone production in vitro. 687 The literature contains numerous experimental models that have been used to study the effects of inflammation on testicular function, although interpretation of the results can often be problematic. In general, studies employing bacterial or viral infections are complicated by the difficulties in distinguishing the effects of inflammation from the actions of the pathogen itself, or the subsequent immune response to the pathogen. Furthermore, although inflammation is characteristically inhibitory to Leydig cells steroidogenesis, increases in androgen production may be observed in some models of infection. 592, 604 Likewise, experimental models involving active immunization, spontaneous autoimmunity, vasectomy, or tumors suffer from similar complications, where it is difficult to separate the inflammatory response from the immune response. More precise information can be obtained from studies using LPS, other TLR ligands, or inflammatory cytokines, to induce inflammation in the absence of a specific pathogen or antigen.",25.193332722158516,15.732492917408496

For example, knockout mouse technology has helped transform our understanding of the immune response. The study of single and multiple gene knockout animals has provided new perspectives on T-cell development, costimulation, and activation. ""Humanized mice,"" transgenic severe combined immunodefi ciency (SCID) mice grafted with human cells and tissues, enable research in regenerative medicine, infectious disease, cancer, and human hematopoiesis. In addition, high-throughput DNA sequencing efforts, positional cloning programs, and novel embryonic stem cell-based gene discovery research areas all exploit the knockout mouse as their laboratory. Engineered animal models are proving invaluable to pharmaceutical research since small animal models of disease may be created and validated to mimic a disease in human patients. Mouse, rat, and zebra fi sh are the most common models explored and used. Genetic engineering can predispose an animal to a particular disease under scrutiny, and the insertion of human genes into the animal can initiate the development of a more clinically relevant disease condition. In human clinical studies, assessments of effi cacy and safety often rely on measured effects for surrogate biomarkers and adverse event reporting. Validated transgenic animal models of human disease allow for parallel study and possible predictability prior to entering clinical trials. Also, it is possible to screen potential drug candidates in vivo against a human receptor target inserted into an animal model. The number of examples of transgenic animal models of human disease useful in drug discovery and development efforts is growing rapidly (Sharpless and DePinho 2006 ; Schultz et al. 2007; Wu et al. 2011b ; Clark and Pazdernik 2012b ) .

This article proposes a conceptual framework to fill this knowledge gap and illustrates the model establishment. The conceptual model consists of two networks and two diffusion processes. The two networks include: an infection network that transmits diseases and a communication network that channels inter-personal influence regarding preventive behavior. Both networks are composed of same individuals but different types of interactions. This article further introduces modeling approaches to formulize such a framework, including the individual-based modeling approach, network theory, disease transmission models and behavioral models. An illustrative model was implemented to simulate a coupled-diffusion process during an influenza epidemic. The simulation outcomes suggest that the transmission probability of a disease and the structure of infection network have profound effects on the dynamics of coupled-diffusion. The results imply that current models may underestimate disease transmissibility parameters, because human preventive behavior has not been considered.

This article proposes a conceptual framework to fill this knowledge gap and offer a more comprehensive representation of the disease system. This twonetwork two diffusion framework is composed of four components, including individuals, networks, infectious diseases, and preventive behavior of individuals. The individual-based modeling approach can be employed to represent discrete individuals, while network structures support the formulization of individual interactions, including infection and communication. Disease transmission models and behavioral models can be embedded into the network structures, and simulate disease infection and adoptive behavior, respectively. The collective changes in individuals' infection and adoption status represent the coupled-diffusion process at the population level. Compared to the widely used influenza-only models, the proposed model produces a lower percent of infection, because preventive behavior protects certain individuals from being infected. Sensitivity analysis identifies that the structure of infection network is a dominant factor in the coupled-diffusion, while the variation of communication network produces fewer effects.",27.063903720601267,12.239499192434899

Hormone and hormone inhibitor treatments in animal models have successfully been used to describe the role estrogens play in modulating Multiple Sclerosis [9, 64] , a phenomenon originally observed in pregnant women with the disease. We established a second parallel model in non-pregnant mice implanted with hormone pellets. The biodegradable pellets are implanted under the skin and release a steady stream of sex hormone for 21 days. While pregnancy is a complicated process with regularly fluctuating hormone levels, using this model, we are able to control a single variable and contrast these observations with analogous results in the pregnancy model. Using these two models, we found that high expression of estrogen appears to play a significant role during influenza infection. It appears to have protective effects by suppressing inflammatory responses [65] , and weight loss is reduced in the estrogenpelleted mice compared to placebo. However, estrogen also reduces CD8 T-cell cytotoxic activity both directly and as a result of less efficient APC activation. Since CD8 T cells function to kill virus-infected cells, this is likely to be responsible for the delayed viral clearance found during pregnancy. NK cell responses are also reduced during influenza infection, which likely contributes to the delay of adaptive immunity (Pazos et al. manuscript under review).",24.641727424986247,11.71685309813865

The ideal animal model for human viral disease should closely recapitulate the spectrum of clinical symptoms and pathogenesis observed during the course of human infection. Whenever feasible, the model should use the same virus and strain that infects humans. It is also preferable that the virus is a low passage clinical isolate thus animal passage or adaptation should be avoided if model species can be identified that are susceptible. Ideally, the experimental route of infection would mirror that occurs in natural disease. In order to understand the interplay and contribution of the immune system during infection, an immunocompetent animal should be used. The aforementioned characteristics cannot always be satisfied; however, and often virus must be adapted, knockout mice must be used, and/or the disease is not perfectly mimicked in the animal model. Well-characterized animal models are critical for licensure to satisfy FDA ""Animal rule."" This rule applies to situations in which vaccine and therapeutic efficacy cannot safely or ethically be tested in humans; thus licensure will come only after preclinical tests are performed in animal models. Many fields in virology are moving toward standardized models that can be used across institutions to test vaccines and therapeutics.

Models can help investigators choose between different intervention strategies, determine the potential of specific interventions, and compare investments across pathogens. Infectious disease models play a critical role in incorporating indirect effects that can vary substantially across alternative programs. The design of immunization campaigns against human papillomavirus has to weigh the direct effects protecting women from human papillomavirus infection, as well as indirect protection resulting from immunization of both women and men. The tradeoffs of alternative programs in protecting individuals at risk of the most severe outcomes and those at little risk have been best evaluated in transmission models (64) .",37.55039609130448,14.366514139668931

The clinical heterogeneity of MS, as well as the finding of different pathological patterns, suggests that MS may be a spectrum of diseases that may represent different pathological processes. 1 This has led to the development of many different animal models, including rodents and nonhuman primates, that reflect the pathological processes and could allow for the development of therapeutic approaches. At the present time, the exact etiological mechanism in humans is not clear; however, several animal models are available providing insight into disease processes. The relative inaccessibility and sensitivity of the central nervous system (CNS) in humans preclude studies on disease pathogenesis, and so much of our understanding of infections and immune responses has been derived from experimental animal models. The experimental systems include Theiler's virus, mouse hepatitis virus, and Semliki Forest virus infections of laboratory rodents. Additional information has been obtained from studies of experimental infections of other animals that result in demyelination, notably maedi-visna virus in sheep and canine distemper virus in dogs. In humans and animals, most natural cases of demyelinating disease are rare complications of viral infections.

Vaccination has been one of the main areas of application for pharmacoeconomic models that incorporate models of infectious disease transmission. Such transmission models are needed in order to capture the inherent nonlinear effects of vaccination, as a result of the potential of vaccines to protect not only directly vaccinated individuals but also their contacts. The infectious disease models used to predict the effects of vaccination have been reviewed elsewhere. [20] Screening. Screening for infected individuals allows them to be treated before they progress to more severe disease and/or infect other individuals. Models need to incorporate transmission if early detection affects transmissibility. This has been shown to be important for many infectious diseases such as Chlamydia [8] and HIV. [21] Such models may allow for the possibility that a screened and treated individual may be re-infected, which would decrease the cost effectiveness of screening. Social distancing. Planned responses to large outbreaks of infectious diseases such as an influenza pandemic often involve social distancing measures such as isolation of suspected cases, school closures, travel restrictions and cancellation of mass gatherings such as football matches. [22, 23] While these may affect the progress of the epidemic, they come with a cost in terms of both individual liberty and economic activity within the population. Their benefit depends crucially on the frequency and type of interactions that occur between individuals in different age groups and settings (such as families, work places and schools). Such information can be obtained from populationbased surveys that are available in Europe [24] and the US. [25] On a smaller level, models can estimate the impact of isolating infectious individuals during outbreaks in closed institutional settings such as hospitals, nursing homes and schools. [26, 27] Post-exposure treatment. Chemotreatment options such as antimicrobials can be dealt with using static models, unless they alter the transmissibility of an individual, or a transmittable characteristic of the infection. Models falling into the latter categories include the use of antiretrovirals for HIV (which increases the life expectancy of infected individuals but decreases their infectiousness), [28] antimicrobial use against pathogens that can develop resistance [29] and antiviral prophylaxis to delay the spread of pandemic influenza. [30] Culling. For animal and plant diseases, one option to interrupt transmission is to deplete the host population by culling both infected livestock and even healthy livestock at risk of being infected. Models examine the trade-off between reduced infection transmission and the detrimental death of animals or plants as a result of culling. Such models have been applied to epidemics of diseases such as foot-andmouth disease [31] and avian influenza. [32] 3. Modelling Infection Transmission",34.06278592256778,16.106360146083688

[7] Since these interventions consume scarce healthcare resources, decision makers are increasingly interested in combining such models with pharmacoeconomic techniques in order to investigate whether or not interventions provide good value for resources invested. However, despite the expansion in the applied literature on economic evaluations of infectious disease interventions, the models underpinning such evaluations have not always been used appropriately. Many economic evaluations of infectious disease interventions apply models that do not take into account the unique complexities of infectious diseases, such as their trans-missibility from infected to susceptible individuals, the possibility of acquiring natural immunity to infection and the uncertainties that arise as a result of their complex natural history and epidemiology.",29.46429055052028,14.454885148912261

Although the purpose of an intervention is ultimately to reduce the burden of disease rather than infection, transmission models need to take into account unreported cases (both asymptomatic and symptomatic), as these contribute to infection transmission and hence affect the consequences of interventions. One example is the 2009 influenza pandemic, where the number of cases of symptomatic disease were reduced by widespread asymptomatic infection leading to natural immunity in the population.

These issues complicate the study of pathogen transmission in the surrogate model, because it may not take place at all or it may result in invalid measures of pathogen life history traits such as the duration of the infectious period. laboratory animals, especially mice, have been the main animal models for studying specific aspects of human pathogenesis and immunity. However, mice are more often surrogate models than natural models for the pathogen under study.

One such case is that of infections such as rabies and West Nile virus, which have environmental reservoirs largely unaffected by the proportion of infected people in the population. An intervention targeting human hosts rather than animal or insect reservoirs will have little effect on the force of infection. The same is true for interventions affecting the severity of disease in infected people but not their transmissibility, such as end-of-life therapy for cervical cancer, which does not significantly affect the transmission of the causative infective agent (HPV), since this occurs decades before the development of cancer. Another example is that of a vaccine that prevents individuals from getting disease from an infection but does not prevent them from acquiring the infection asymptomatically. For instance, early economic models of pneumococcal [45] and rotavirus [46] vaccination were largely static because it was not known whether vaccination would prevent transmission, or simply reduce the risk of disease. More recently, however, evidence has emerged that the vaccines may also prevent transmission, [47, 48] so, more recently, dynamic models of vaccination incorporating herd immunity have been developed.

Only a few nonhuman primates are susceptible to infection with HIV-1 and infected animals do not progress to AIDS. 56 Therefore, it is important to use other disease models that mimic the HIV-AIDS pathologic progression. 57 One such potential model is feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). FIV was discovered in 1986 and is known to cause an AIDS-like disease in domestic cats and mimics HIV-related dementia in humans. 58 A vaccine for FIV was approved by the FDA in 2002. 59 While the FIV model is potentially informative, its use is not sufficient as a basis for development of a prophylactic HIV-1 vaccine. An ideal animal model would display a pathological response to infection with HIV-1 that is very similar to the one that occurs in humans. Unfortunately, HIV-1 does not cause pathology leading to the development of AIDS in any host other than humans. [60] [61] [62] [63] However, animal models have been developed and used that allow partial understanding of the pathology of HIV-1, the natural immunological response to infection, and the response of the host to novel therapeutics. One of these models involves the simian immunodeficiency virus MAC (SIV MAC ) that replicates and causes an AIDS-like disease in baboons, cynomolgus, and pigtailed macaques. While the similarities of SIV MAC to HIV-1 have allowed for insight into pathology, transmission, and immunological response of the infected host to the virus, the differences between SIV MAC and HIV-1 are still too great to be able to draw conclusions regarding potential human responses to an HIV-1 prophylactic vaccine. 63 Therefore, to broaden the scope of animal model usage, a chimeric SHIV virus was engineered to incorporate both SIV and HIV-1 proteins or genes. 64 While macaques infected with SHIV do go on to develop AIDS, the time to progression is much different from the time to progression to AIDS of HIV-1-infected humans. Infection of macaques with SIV mac 251 strain mimics HIV-1 infection in humans by leading to chronic, slow disease progression. Route and dose required for infection, viral tropism, replicative capacity of the viruses, and pathology of SIV/SHIV-infected monkeys are all very different than these parameters in humans. 65, 66 This distinction has been well characterized by the recent Phase IIb STEP trial, which involved 3000 healthy, uninfected volunteers. The result of this trial was termination at its first scheduled efficacy assessment due to its failure to suppress viral load in subsequently infected individuals and then-suspected increased HIV-1 infection due to interaction of the immune system with vaccine components. 67 The vaccine, a recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) virus incorporating the gag, pol, and nef genes from HIV-1, had been previously tested in an SHIV model in macaques and the results of that experiment were not suggestive of the results of the human trial. 68 This disparity underscores the need for animal models that more closely reflect the pathology seen in human infection with HIV-1 as well as identification of immunological correlates of protection that reflect control of HIV-1 viral load in human subjects. Therefore, the search for an appropriate animal model or the appropriate use of current animal models in the search for a prophylactic HIV-1 vaccine continues. Until a model can be derived that will allow for observation of each stage of infection, progression of disease, and response of the immune system in a way that is comparable to this process in humans, we will not be able to logically predict which vaccine candidates should be moved forward to clinical trials.",36.25174596824357,16.558457492007197

In particular, hamsters have been recognized as valuable animal models for studying emerging and high consequence acute human viral diseases caused by bunyaviruses (Niklasson et al., 1984; Hooper et al., 2001; Milazzo et al., 2002; Fisher et al., 2003) arenaviruses (Smee et al., 1993; Sbrana et al., 2006) , henipaviruses (Wong et al., 2003) , flaviviruses Xiao et al., 2001; Siirin et al., 2007) and SARScoronavirus (Roberts et al., 2005) .

In humans, it is often difficult to prevent contacts, particularly with the ease of long-distance travel [1] . However, in livestock and animals, movements can be the subject of legislation or strict controls and there is a real opportunity to reduce disease transmission.

Although Becker's linear logistic model is capable of testing the Greenwood and Reed-Frost models, it cannot fully account for the characteristics of infectious disease data mentioned above. Hierarchical models with Bayesian underpinnings are one solution to such correlated data with multilevel structures. Applying the proposed Bayesian hierarchical models to the empirical data used to monitor the influenza epidemic demonstrates that the parameters on the individual, generation, and household levels can be derived based on inferences made using the MCMC method in conjunction with DAG. The Bayesian hierarchical models are also capable of uncovering the interactions between contextual effects, such as socioeconomic status and vaccination, to elucidate their joint effect on the occurrence of influenza.

Moreover, the characteristics and conditions that make an antibody protective against EBOV in animal models and/or in humans are not fully understood. Furthermore, the protective ability of a specific mAb in one animal model does not necessarily imply that it provides protection in another animal model. Nacayama and Saijo (2013) have comprehensively reviewed the different animal models used to study EBOV infection, mainly rodents and non-human primates (NHP), and have summarized their strengths and weaknesses. NHP, particularly rhesus and cynomolgus macaques, better mimic EBOV infection in humans and more closely reproduce the symptoms of the disease than do rodents. However, the use of NHP presents researchers with more significant practical and ethical hurdles (Nacayama and Saijo, 2013; Geisbert et al., 2015) than does the use of rodents. Different rodent models have been developed to do EBOV research, including some knockout variants (Brannan et al., 2015) . The practicality of using rodents in the laboratory and the possibility of using genetically modified animals has made them an attractive model with which to study the protective effect of anti-EBOV therapies and vaccines. However, the EBOV has to be adapted to cause lethal infection in rodents, which represents a highly restrictive situation given the high risk presented by handling a BSL-4 pathogen, such as EBOV. Moreover, some widely used rodents, such as mice and guinea pigs, do not exhibit some of the distinctive symptoms of EBOV in primates, such as fever and rash, which further suggests dissimilarities between the anti-EBOV immune response in rodents and primates. In general, anti-EBOV protection in rodents is not a conclusive indicator of protection in humans. Probably the best example of this is the case of mAb KZ52, which is neutralizing and protective in rodents but not in NHPs. In the particular case of anti-EBOV mAb therapies, NHP studies appear to be a mandatory step in predicting efficacy in humans. However, no clear correlation can be established between therapeutic effectiveness in NHPs and humans due to the limited amount of clinical data in humans.",27.651663060216762,12.212879429588746

Such an assumption ignores the complex socio-demographic and environmental factors afflicting the transmission course of a disease among various subgroups (e.g., the wealthy, middle class, and the disadvantaged).

Samples taken from fatal human cases of SARS-CoV and influenza virus infections often do not represent the full range of the different temporal stages of a disease. Instead, they are more likely to represent late-stage disease. In addition, the lesions caused by the viral infection may be complicated by lesions caused by clinical treatments and concurrent preexisting disease. Therefore, to be able to study the course of the disease caused by these viruses, good animal models are necessary for SARS-CoV and influenza virus infections in man. Good animal models for SARS and influenza in man should ideally show virus replication dynamics, clinical illness and pathological changes that resemble those of human cases. The choice and design of an animal model used in an experiment is crucial for the outcome of the investigation and should be considered carefully. Time course experiments provide information about the temporal and spatial dynamics that help to design such animal models, including which time points and which samples are best to gain the most useful information (van den Brand et al., 2012a) . Not only the best time points and analyses of the most informative samples should be considered carefully, but also the animal species, the inoculation route and the age of the animals are important, as is shown by studies of H5N1 influenza in ferrets and of SARS in aged mice and macaques (Rockx et al., 2009; Smits et al., 2010; Bodewes et al., 2011) .

Due to the decreased efficiency of RV entry into nonhuman epithelial cells (and likely differences in the nuances of cellular machinery required for replication), a high amount of viral load is required to elicit a biological response to RV in laboratory animals (e.g., 10 6 TCID 50 in mouse vs 5À10 TCID 50 in experimental human infection models). Human RV strains also demonstrate limited viral replication and different replication kinetic between mouse and man. These differences highlight the importance of confirming findings in relevant patient cohorts/samples and the utility of using human experimental models in parallel with animal models. This point is not purely for academic consideration. More so, it is important to take into consideration clinical trial design and outcomes. For example, mouse models highlighted the key relevance of IL-5 in asthma pathology through use of knockout mice 209 and antibody blockade. 210 However, the initial randomized control trial assessing anti-IL-5 therapy (mepolizumab) in a broad asthma population failed to demonstrate any clinical effect. 211 It was not until subsequent trials limited recruitment to patients with demonstrable eosinophilic asthma (a patient subset that is more closely modeled by the experimental mouse system) that clinical improvements were observed. 212, 213 8.14.2 Future directions for animal models In a similar way to experimental human infection models, there has been a narrow focus in animal models.

A summary of key findings from mouse models of RV-induced exacerbations of airway disease is presented in Table 8 .2.

Many chronic inflammatory CNS disorders have an infectious etiology. In humans, several types of demyelinating encephalomyelitis are associated with viral infection, and in animal models infection with viruses induces demyelination during chronic infection. For example, paramyxovirus nucleocapsids and high concentrations of antibody to measles virus were found in brains of patients having subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE: a chronic neuroinflammatory disease of both grey and white matter) patients. Progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy (PML), which is also a human demyelinating disease characterized by rapidly progressive dementia and motor deficit, was found to be caused by a Human papovavirus (JC virus) infection in the oligodendrocytes in a patient with PML. However, till date, no reproducible viral infection has been isolated from the CNS of MS patients. A possible role of human herpesvirus type 6 (HHV-6) and establishment of a latent CNS infection in man has been associated with MS, as HHV-6 protein and DNA have been identified in the neuroglial cells present in 'active' MS lesions. Oligoclonal bands, associated with MS, have shown features of antigendriven response: like clonal amplification and extensive somatic hypermutations. Thus it is strongly predicted that a virus might be reactivated after years of latency and induce oligodendrocyte damage or could initiate immunopathology, which might lead to demyelination. Hence, viral models of MS are of prime importance to study immunopathogenesis of MS as well as direct oligodendrocyte damage. Along with these, viral models of MS elucidate direct virus induced alteration of neuronal and glial cells, and viral-induced 'neuroinflammation'. In general, viral infection induced demyelination simultaneously uses two mechanisms: direct infection to neural and/or glial cells and immune-mediated (both innate and adaptive) tissue injury (Gilden 2005) .",23.342066474463312,13.048535424169916

Many of the presentations during this workshop addressed studies in murine models, especially mouse strains with defined genetic defects. The extension of findings in such models to other species is a key point for further study. Clinical testing of candidate agents needs to rigorously assess clinical, virologic and immune measures, in part because of the safety issues raised by modulating immune responses. Placebo-controlled studies of selected immunomodulators in uncomplicated influenza are now possible. These would provide useful information regarding possible effects on virology and immune responses but would be of uncertain value in predicting safety and efficacy in more severe disease states like influenza viral pneumonia.

Mathematical models are being used to predict how the disease will spread over a period of time. In recent years, many attempts have been made to develop realistic mathematical models for investigating the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases, and the asymptotic behaviors of these epidemic models are studied [10, 11, 42, 62] . Vaccination and antiviral drugs are the two most effective pharmaceutical interventions used for the control of an infectious disease. But due to strain's novelty most people may lack innate immunity to the disease, available vaccine may not provide protection against the pathogen and effective antiviral drug may not be available in sufficient amount. For example, Bird flu viruses H5N1 and H7N9 that have sporadically infected humans, could, with a few mutations to a key protein on their surface, become capable of infecting cells along the human upper airway and thereby take a step towards turning into pandemic-causing strains [50, 51] . In that scenario, the role of isolation, quarantine and other non-pharmaceutical interventions stimulated by media coverage becomes more significant as disease control strategies.",26.213426850314406,12.776042945907923

However, a commercial safe and efficacious vaccine for HIV-1 is still not available and is unlikely in the near future, despite exhaustive efforts in HIV-1 vaccine development that began 20 years ago immediately after the initial characterization of HIV-1. 566 Several serious issues that must be resolved for future vaccine success include identification of immune correlates of protection against either lentivirus infection or virus-associated disease. The apparent difficulty of addressing this question was predictable since virus elimination has not been observed during natural infection with immunodeficiency-inducing lentiviruses, even when strong virus-specific cellular and humoral immune responses have been detected in the infected host. Vaccine-induced protection against pathogenic challenge has been difficult to achieve in both the SIV and FIV animal models, and when observed, has been inconsistent. An additional complication is presented by the specter of vaccine-induced immune responses that prove detrimental rather than protective as reported for FIV and more recently in the SIV animal model. The complication of virus strain diversity has barely been addressed by vaccine design in animal models and surely poses a major complication for HIV-1 vaccine success in the future. Successful resolution of these obstacles in vaccine development, and most particularly the lack of understanding of why some vaccines such as attenuated viruses are sometimes protective, absolutely requires continued examination of viral pathogenesis and host immune responses in animal models including both nonhuman primate and nonprimate lentivirus animal models. Elucidation of pathogenic mechanisms used by these immunodeficiencyinducing lentiviruses during the earliest stages of virus exposure and virus-host interactions will be critical for design of vaccines that will have any potential for sterilizing immunity, if such a goal is possible. Similarly, a far more precise understanding of viral mechanisms for immunodeficiency will also be necessary for design of therapies of immune reconstitution in both acutely and chronically HIV-1-infected hosts, which can only be gained through experimental animal model studies.",26.89003868163456,12.96102853557756

Although studies on the temporal dynamics of diseases proved insightful, observations that pathogens (like substances) diffuse from high to low density regions of space enticed the development of spatially explicit models capable of discerning, for example, disease transmission hotspots. Incorporating space explicitly into epidemiological models revealed that a pathogen may go extinct even if the basic reproduction number is greater than unity [16] .

Second, appropriate animal models that adequately mimic the pathology of the human disease, anatomic distribution of the agent, and the human immune response to the infection must be developed. There are numerous agents that are so highly adapted to humans that no adequate animal model exists. Other models utilize animal species that do not permit effective analysis of the protective immune response owing to lack of reagents to evaluate the immune cells and proteins and absence of animals that are genetically inbred or have knockout of specific genes. Third, studies of animal models and of humans and their cells, cytokines, and antibodies are employed to elucidate the mechanisms of protective immunity. Development of a vaccine that stimulates the presence of memory cells that generate the immune components required to kill the invading pathogen rapidly requires determining which elements (e.g., antibodies, CD4, and/or CD8 T lymphocytes) are critical. Fourth, the antigens of the particular infectious agent that stimulate the protective memory immune components must be identified. For subunit vaccines, some antigens stimulate protective responses, and others suppress protective immunity. Fifth, the animal models are utilized to develop and test vaccine candidates that stimulate protective memory immune responses without harmful side effects. At the point of the primary identification of the etiology of the emerging infection, it would be unlikely that any of these five steps would have been addressed.",27.27005700348934,14.152745439883988

Similar approaches are used in classical physics to predict the movement of an object by translating inertia and gravity (assumptions regarding the laws of physics) and the force and angle at which an object is thrown (the data) into the trajectory of the object (the prediction). Epidemics of infectious diseases among humans are driven by transmission of the infectious agent among humans either directly, via fomites in the environment or via animal vectors. Disease transmission can also depend on biological characteristics of both the pathogen and the host, as well as social, behavioral and environmental factors. It is possible to express these dynamics in terms of mathematical equations. [3] While the dynamics of infectious diseases can be extremely complex, in many cases relatively parsimonious models can be used to describe the essential properties of epidemic dynamics. [6] In the simplest epidemic model, a closed large population of size N is partitioned into three classes of individuals: Susceptible, Infectious, and Recovered ( Figure 1 ). All individuals are assumed to be identical in terms of their susceptibility to infection, infectiousness if infected, as well as mixing behavior associated with disease transmission (the so-called homogenous mixing assumption). The assumption that all individuals are identical in terms of disease dynamics permits the grouping of individuals into aggregate ""compartments"". The resulting SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) model can be used to describe the number of individuals in each class at time t (S(t), I(t) and R(t)) based on two further assumptions. Firstly, the rate at which susceptible individuals become infected during any small time interval Δt is assumed to be proportional to the prevalence of infectious individuals. Secondly, infected individuals recover with long-lasting immunity after an average infectious duration of 1/α. These assumptions can be translated into the following equations describing the epidemic dynamics:",30.447629502674495,12.602747905195946

Several animal models have been evaluated for SARS-and MERS CoVs including mouse, guinea pigs, hamsters, ferrets, rabbits, rhesus macaques, marmosets, and cats. 42, [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] Early effort was directed in developing animal models for SARS-CoV, but the specificity of the virus to ACE2 (receptor of SARS-CoV) was a major hindrance to such efforts. Later, a SARS-CoV transgenic mouse model was developed by introducing hACE2 gene into the mouse genome. 51 The first animal model used for developing a MERS-CoV vaccine was rhesus macaques. Infected animals showed clinical symptoms such as increased body temperature, piloerection, cough, hunched posture, and reduced food intake. 52 Another frequently used animal model for MERS-CoV is the common marmoset, wherein the virus caused lethal pneumonia. 53 Humoral and cell-mediated immunity could be detected in both rhesus macaques and common marmoset following MERS-CoV immunization. 43 47 These hamsters are a potential model for studying CoV pathology and pathogenesis and vaccine efficacy. The attenuated NSP16 CoV vaccine was studied in mice. 54 Attempts to develop animal models for MERS-CoV such as mice, hamsters, and ferrets face limitations due to the inability of MERS-CoV to replicate in the respiratory tracts of these species. Small animals (mice or hamsters) resisting natural infection with MERS-CoVs (which are susceptible to SARS-CoV) have been genetically modified to a more humanized structure, e.g., hDPP4 human, hDPP4-transduced, and hDPP4-Tg mice (transgenic for expressing hDPP4), and ascertained for susceptibility to MERS-CoV infection. 55 Alteration in the mouse genome using the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing tool could make the animals susceptible to CoV infection and virus replication. 56 Genetic engineering was used in the generation of 288-330 +/+ MERS-CoV mouse model, which is being used for the evaluation of novel MERS-CoV vaccines and drugs. 57 Compared to the large animal models, small animals such as mice and rabbits are preferred due to lower cost, ease of manipulation, and readily available efficacy methods. 43 Further studies are needed to recognize suitable models for emerging SARS-CoV-2 by identifying receptor affinity of SARS-CoV-2 and studying disease manifestations, pathologies/viral pathogenesis associated with experimental inoculation of the virus in mice, rats, and other models, as well as examining virus-specific immune responses and protection.

A better understanding of the distribution of target cells and viral concentration will provide a guide for accurate and early detection of the virus. The status of the immune function should be a key parameter in gauging the treatment of SARS infection. The state of the immune system at different stages of the disease gives clues as to how immune suppressive, immune supportive and steroid therapy may best be administered in treating the disease, and may also help to determine the timing and the dosage of the treatment. Due to the lack of a good understanding of the pathogenesis and the role of immunopathology during the SARS epidemic, the administration of steroids in treating SARS was a controversial topic, and the outcome of such treatment was not uniformly beneficial. The wide spread distribution of the virus in the body and the high concentration of the virus in the blood and leukocytes imply that the virus may be transmissible through blood and body fluid. The detection of virus in the intestine, the kidney, the stool and the urine indicate that the contaminated stool and urine may also be a vehicle of viral transmission. The development of vaccine to SARS depends on the establishment of appropriate animal models. As immune dysfunction and immune pathology play pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of SARS, the measurement of immune indices should be important parameters to be monitored in evaluating animal models and effectiveness of any vaccine under investigation. Unfortunately, this important fact has to date been neglected by investigators developing vaccines to SARS.

From an ecological and evolutionary perspective, this ongoing debate prompts even broader reflection about how studies of infectious diseases in laboratory and captive settings apply to natural populations in the real world. Unlike the laboratory, the real world is complex and most animals, including humans, interact with parasites and pathogens in this highly variable context. This reality has fueled ideas that ""wild"" animal models may be as important as laboratory models in the study of infectious disease processes (Wolfe et al. 1998; Pedersen and Babayan 2011) . Whereas laboratory animal models have paved the way toward advancing our understanding of disease processes occurring at the genetic, molecular, and cellular levels, the promise of wild models lies in their potential to help define how mechanisms revealed in the laboratory operate within the genetic, phenotypic, and environmental contexts that characterize natural populations. The use of wild models may also facilitate the inclusion of a more diverse set of organisms in infectious disease research, allowing for increasingly powerful comparative studies. However, the challenge is to find wild study systems that will balance realistic complexity with tractability and can thus serve as effective models for discovering how infectious disease processes function in nature.",33.207027722966835,13.402042644570527

Two countries are considered: one disease-free country and one visited or source country with a running endemic or epidemic infectious disease. Two models are considered. In the first model (disease importation), susceptible individuals travel from their disease-free home country to the endemic country and come back after some weeks. The risk of infection spreading in their home country is then estimated supposing the visitors are submitted to the same force of infection as the local population but do not contribute to it. In the second model (disease exportation), it is calculated the probability that an individual from the endemic (or epidemic) country travels to a disease-free country in the condition of latent infected and eventually introduces the infection there. The input of both models is the force of infection at the visited/source country, assumed known. The models are deterministic, but a preliminary stochastic formulation is presented as an appendix. The models are exemplified with two distinct real situations: the risk of dengue importation from Thailand to Europe and the risk of Ebola exportation from Liberia to the USA.

In addition, good wild models might be characterized by close genetic, physiological, or other similarity to humans or their domestic animals. Moreover, if wild models are to act as bridges between the laboratory and the real world, the ideal wild models should be associated with resources and tools that allow for molecular-level approaches to be applied in the field. Several groups of mammals squarely fit these criteria (e.g., wild rodents, wild primates).

Additional innovations in modeling applications and methodologies (Box 14.1) have enabled the optimization of trial designs to maximize statistical power and feasibility [13] , the evaluation of synergistic or antagonistic roles of coinfection in terms of morbidity risk [14] , the incorporation of population behavior and perceptions toward vaccines and other interventions [3, 4] , and the inference of previously immeasurable quantities such as the relative contributions of different host groups and subgroups to transmission [15, 16] . Compartmental, stratified compartmental, network, and agent-based models lie along a continuum of increasing resolution into individuality. Fine-grained models have an appeal because of the potential to account for inhomogeneities that cannot be easily captured with models that group individuals into classes.

Although each model reviewed in this article has some utility in the study of SARS disease and prevention, the kinetics of viral replication and resolution of disease are much more rapid in animal models compared to human infections, and no model fully reflects the spectrum of clinical illness (morbidity and mortality), associated pathology, and viral replication observed in human cases of SARS. Of the animal models that have been employed for evaluating SARS-CoV replication and disease, those models that have been most fully characterized and which offer the best potential for evaluation of prevention and therapeutic strategies are discussed here and include inbred mice, to demonstrate pneumonitis (129S) and clinical signs of SARS disease (aged BALB/c) (Glass et al., 2004; Hogan et al., 2004; Roberts et al., 2005a; Subbarao et al., 2004) .

Under the FDA's Animal Efficacy Rule (""Animal Rule"") therapeutics against rare, emerging, or virulent agents can achieve regulatory approval provided efficacy is demonstrated in two animal models (one of which must be a non-rodent species) that display clinical illness representative of human disease (FDA, 2014) . The ideal animal model is permissive to infection and reproduces the clinical course and pathology observed in humans. An algorithm for the development of animal models is presented in Fig. 1 . Small animal models offer several advantages over NHPs including availability of animals and species specific reagents, ease of handling, reduced cost, and the ability to use sufficient numbers for statistical analysis. Especially with coronaviruses, rodents vary in susceptibility and may be semi-permissive to infection and refractory to clinical disease , even so, they can be used to screen countermeasures Bisht et al., 2004; Buchholz et al., 2004; . Thus, to generate a rodent model that displays clinical disease it may be necessary to adapt the virus to enhance virulence for the rodent host or generate transgenic animals.

In the majority of cases these pre-clinical models collect the entire volume of lymph flowing through mesenteric or thoracic lymph duct cannulas and therefore provide an absolute indication of the extent of lymphatic transport. Other models have also examined the use of a lympho-venous shunt which has the advantage of allowing sampling of lymph over much longer periods, although in this case the relatively small database for lymph flow rates makes estimation of the absolute extent of lymphatic transport difficult [63] . The majority of lymphatic transport studies described in the literature have utilised rats [62] , reflecting the relative ease of sourcing and housing small laboratory animals, however, larger animal models such as dogs [11] [12] [13] , pigs [64] , sheep [65, 66] and rabbits [67] have also been described.

Because of the promiscuity of TCRs and B cell receptors (BCRs), cross-reactivity between infectious agents and self antigens (molecular mimicry) is not rare, although such activities are better documented at the antibody level than at the T cell level. Recent evidence from animal models of autoimmune disease indicates that disease progression may be due to the activation and recruitment of autoreactive lymphocytes, regardless of the initiating event. These autoreactive lymphocytes are specific for epitopes that are distinct from and non-cross-reactive with the disease-inducing epitope, and resuh from chronic tissue damage (epitope spreading). Support for this hypothesis comes primarily from autoimmune models in which disease is induced with a defined autoepitope and responses to non-cross-reactive T-and/or B-cell epitopes on the same or different self proteins are assessed for pathological potential during disease progression. Induction of chronic tissue pathology by viruses also leads to epitope spreading. Epitope spreading has been demonstrated at the T cell level, particularly in relapsing-remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (R-EAE), in antibody-mediated disease models such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and in viral diseases including Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus-induced demyelineating disease.",32.04980371835521,15.781319588968572

For example, recent genomic studies on several inflammatory diseases have shown a lack of correlation in responses between mice and humans 14 .

One issue is that some of the phenotypic markers used to discriminate immune cell populations in mice are absent in humans, and some subpopulations of immune cells differ between humans and mice (reviewed in REF. 18 ).

Predictions from network models can be considerably different from those that use mean-based approaches. Although individuals may have the same number of contacts per unit time in both network and mass action models, the fixed contact structure in networks can lead to rapid, localized spread of an infection followed by a slowing down of the process as the number of susceptible individuals depletes locally.

While there are advantages to currently available small animal models, there are also significant drawbacks that have limited translation of research findings to humans. Large animal models such as newborn pig, sheep and nonhuman primates have complex brain development more similar to humans, but these animals are expensive, and developmental testing of sheep and piglets is limited. Ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) are born lissencephalic and undergo postnatal cortical folding to form complex gyrencephalic brains. This review examines whether ferrets might provide a novel intermediate animal model of neonatal brain disease that has the benefit of a gyrified, altricial brain in a small animal. It summarizes attributes of ferret brain growth and development that make it an appealing animal in which to model perinatal brain injury. We postulate that because of their innate characteristics, ferrets have great potential in neonatal neurodevelopmental studies.",27.127944989992763,13.199330428637818

Yet it is only in the last decade that a chronic, relapsing EAE closely resembling MS has been studied in any detail.

In addition, since animals such as mice do not naturally develop asthma or COPD, the underlying baseline inflammatory profile and the acute pathology that mice develop in response to viral challenge in these experimental models may not be completely reflective of human disease [104, 113] . This, coupled with the inability of these species to be naturally infected with HRVs and other human viral respiratory pathogens, the high titer of viral inoculum required for infection (generally 10 6 50% infectious dose in tissue culture [TCID 50 ] versus 5 to 10 TCID 50 in humans), and minimal replication of virus make these models less than ideal for studying virus-induced exacerbations of asthma and COPD.

The disease was caused by an unknown animal coronavirus (CoV) that had crossed the species barrier through close contact of humans with infected animals, and was identified as the etiological agent for SARS. This new CoV not only became readily transmissible between humans but also was also more pathogenic. The disease spread across the world rapidly due to the air travel, and infected 8096 people and caused 774 deaths in 26 countries on 5 continents. The disease is characterized by flu-like symptoms, including high fever, malaise, cough, diarrhea, and infiltrates visible on chest radiography. The overall mortality was about 10%, but varied profoundly with age; the course of disease seemed to be milder in the pediatric age group and resulted rarely in a fatal outcome, but the mortality in the elderly was as high as 50%. Aggressive quarantine measures taken by the health authorities have successfully contained and terminated the disease transmission. As a result there are no SARS cases recorded recently. Nevertheless there is a possibility that the disease may emerge in the population with high vigor.

Due to this, animal models are utilized to gain insight into the pathogenesis of disease with the overall goal of identifying potential targets for intervention and evaluating specific therapeutics and vaccines.

Influenza A viruses, far from being benign respiratory pathogens, are a major public health problem that calls for a serious and sustained research response. An essential part of that process is the development of laboratory animal models of influenza virus infection for the study of pathogenesis and the evaluation of new drugs and vaccines.

The sporadic nature of disease outbreaks and the ethical issues associated with conducting a human vaccine trial make such a study difficult to execute. Early-stage development of vaccines has historically occurred in mouse and guinea pig models of filovirus disease, but these models use adapted viruses obtained through sequential passage in the rodent species because the wild-type virus does not cause uniform lethality (Bray et al., 1999; Connolly et al., 1999) . The disease observed in rodents does not reproduce the extensive disseminated intravascular coagulation seen in human filovirus disease. Besides the requirement for an adapted virus, there are reports that the rodent models are not necessarily predictive of efficacy in NHPs (Feldmann et al., 2003; Geisbert et al., 2002; Jahrling et al., 1996) . NHPs are relevant models to study infectious disease as their immune system is similar to humans and they are good predictors of efficacy in vaccine development and other intervention strategies. Licensure of a filovirus vaccine will require testing in a NHP species. The macaque model is the most frequently used model in filovirus efficacy studies involving vaccines or therapies. Given the drawbacks of rodent models of filovirus disease, there is a critical need for development of a small animal model that develops disease consistent with human infection using wild-type virus.",27.72616446933863,14.125926539526393

By tracking tower locations for a subscriber, we can capture where he or she is moving. In practice, to ensure confidentiality, CDRs are usually averaged over millions of subscribers to provide estimates of flux between different locations in a country. Transmission models built upon CDR-based estimates of seasonal patterns of human movement have been used to explain patterns of rubella disease in Kenya [48] and dengue in Pakistan [31] .

However, none of these treatment methodologies is curative, and many have a limited life span, such as interferon (IFN)-β that induces neutralizing antibodies in some MS patients [1] , or cause serious side effects (progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy) such as monoclonal anti-very late antigen (VLA)-4 antibodies (natalizumab, Tysabri®) [2] and thus cause patients to drop out of clinical trials or stop taking the treatment. In addition, although many studies have dissected the intricate pathways involved in the aetiology, development, and pathogenesis of diseases such as MS, we still do not have a definitive understanding of how these diseases manifest and, indeed in the case of MS, whether it is a single disease or rather a spectrum of disorders with similar characteristics. Therefore, researchers have used animal models to aid our understanding of disease pathways, immune cell functions, and pathology. An example of the importance of animal models was the demonstration that CD4 T cells specific for a myelin epitope injected into naïve animals were sufficient to induce a central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating disease with CNS lesions similar to those observed in MS [3, 4] . In addition, these models are a useful preclinical aid to developing novel therapeutic agents.

The development of an appropriate animal model for MERS-CoV, on the other hand, provides unique challenges because the viral receptor used for cell entry is radically different in mice. Models thus far have included transient transfection [30] and transgenic mice [31] , although it is still unclear whether these models accurately recapitulate human infection.

The expected number of infections at some time T is illustrated for a directly transmitted disease in the above equation. Dynamic and mechanistic models of disease spread, regardless of complexity, capture these relationships in order to improve inference or predict the disease dynamics. The study of infectious disease dynamics encompasses the study of any of the shared drivers of the mechanistic processes of disease spread with an eye towards better understanding disease transmission. As illustrated above, these include: The size of the susceptible population ( ): The number of people available to be infected. The dynamics of susceptibility is not shown here, but can itself can be complex, as new susceptibles enter the population through birth, immigration and loss of immunity. For many diseases (e.g., dengue, influenza), susceptibility is not a binary state, and complex models may be needed. The force of infection: The force of infection is the probability that any individual who is susceptible at a given time becomes infected (analogous to the hazard of infection). The size of the susceptible population times the force of infection is the reproductive number ( ). When this value is above 1, the epidemic will grow. When it falls below 1, it will recede. The infectious process ( ): The infectious process dictates the chances of becoming infected on a direct or indirect contact with an infectious individual. Here represented as a per contact probability of infection, this itself can be a complex, multi-faceted process. The contact process ( ): The process by which infectious contacts are made, whether directly or mediated by a some vector or the environment, is one of the most complex parts of the infectious process. Much modern research focuses on accounting the role of space and population structure in the contact process.

However, as a result of the need to deal with dependent happenings, there remained a strong subpopulation within infectious disease epidemiology that used models of an entirely different type. Variously referred to as Bmathematical,^Bdynamic,^or Bmechanistic^models, these models are characterized by having a mechanistic representation of the dynamic epidemic process that determines how the population's state at time t + 1 depends on its state at time t (hereafter referred to as mechanistic models). Historically, these models have more often been deterministic and built top-down from first principles rather than based on patterns in any particular dataset. However, as increasing computational power has caused an explosion in the types of models that can be subject to rigorous statistical analysis, there has been a shift toward more data-driven and statistical approaches and a greater focus on stochasticity and uncertainty. This confluence between principled statistical inference and mechanistic processes is paying huge dividends in the quality of the work being produced and the types of questions being answered across disciplines within infectious disease epidemiology. Infectious disease models are being given a firmer empirical footing, while the use of generative mechanistic approaches allows us to use models as tools for forecasting, strategic planning, and other activities in ways that would not be possible with models that do not represent the underlying dynamic epidemiologic processes.",28.4141498386442,12.026682117864764

First, the mechanism of neutralization by rNTD vaccination in mice is unknown and requires further investigation. For example, the nature of the neutralization antibodies detected by the pseudovirus neutralization assay and PRNT assay remains unclear. Second, pathological lesions and antigen expression indicated by IHC were detected after the mice challenged by MERS-CoV, although significant humoral and cellular immunity was elicited by the rNTD vaccination. Whether this was the result of a memory response need further study. Additionally, the limitations of the animal models restricted the assessment of the protective efficacy of rNTD vaccine in mice [37] . The MERS-CoV infection animal model used in this study was developed by transducing mice with an adenovirus vector expressing human DPP4 [31] . MERS-CoV infection in this model is highly dependent on the transduction of cells and the level of DPP4 expression from the adenovirus vector; therefore, the model may not reflect the natural disease process [38] . Additionally, the 5-day animal model imposed the limitation that the viral titer data could not be collected for further investigation of the immune system response following clearance of the virus after rNTD vaccination in the mice. Other animal models, such as the transgenic mouse, might overcome this shortcoming. Whereas several studies have developed transgenic mouse models of MERS-CoV infection [39, 40] , the non-specific damage and virus detection in the brain of transgenic mice restricted the application of the model. Other small animal models, such as ferrets [41] , immune-deficient mice [42] , or hamsters [43] , were not susceptible to MERS-CoV infection.",27.25716509220002,11.653457063724092

Ideally an animal model should reproduce the hallmarks of human disease as closely as possible in an immunocompetent animal following a realistic dose of challenge virus via an appropriate inoculation route (Safronetz, Geisbert, and Feldmann, 2013 ). An important component of the FDA's Animal Rule, which concerns the approval of new drugs when human efficacy studies are not ethical or feasible, states that FDA will rely on evidence from animal studies if the animal models used are expected to react with a response predictive of humans or a single animal model is sufficiently characterized to predict the human response (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Food and Drug Administration, 2014).

Plenty of treatment modalities were developed on the basis of animal experimentations. Meanwhile, there is an increasing number of failed clinical trials, particularly on chronic and complex diseases that biased from the results of studies on inappropriate animal models [4, 5] . It is time to ask whether animal models truly predict human health conditions. While validity and acceptability of current successful trials and guidelines are debated in the 21st century because they are not patient tailored, how could we rely on animal models as an appropriate predictor of human conditions? Simplifying a complex system is inevitable to study the basis of a complex phenomenon. However, simplified models do not reflect all the properties of complex systems [4, 6] . When an animal model is used as the basis of a clinical trial, it is needed to mimic the complex properties of the patients. Otherwise, animal models might be misleading; consequently, a large number of therapeutic modalities might have lost in translation [7] . This study was therefore undertaken to provide shreds of evidence against the validity of animal models. It has been systematically discussed why the authors believe that it is time to re-evaluate the validity of animal experimentations. Although plenty of state-of-the-art disease modeling techniques have been introduced recently, their acceptance and application in the medical science society are scarce; nevertheless validity of these modern modeling techniques needs further evaluation as well.

In this article, we review the knowledge on inappropriate modeling of chronic and complex disorders, which is very important point for the predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine. The translation medicine in this point has to deal with this problem in order to support further and smooth development of PPPM. It is absolutely essential the experts in all fields of medicine, and beyond, are aware of the described problems. The predictions in PPPM and potential preventive actions may very well be compromised if inappropriate modeling is being widely used in numerous cases, let alone the creation of personalized models for an individual patient.

A large number of responsible factors have been suggested for developing Alzheimer and among them are aging, inflammation, oxidative stress, vascular abnormalities, and amyloid depositions. Surprisingly, lifestyle, nutrition, education, academic achievements, and even career are also related to Alzheimer development [94] [95] [96] . Now it is time to ask, how could we synthesize such a complex, chronic, multi-factorial disease of an extremely complex organ (human brain) in a mouse model? Is a transgenic model such as amyloid precursor protein transgenic mouse model a suitable model for human Alzheimer disease [97] [98] [99] ? It has been shown that patients with Down syndrome develop Alzheimer earlier than the normal population due to having three copies of chromosome 21 and hence three copies of amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene. However, does it mean that Alzheimer in Down syndrome is equal to Alzheimer in elderly?! Does an Alzheimer model, which was developed by means of applying a mitochondrial toxin to a rat, is a good representative of Alzheimer in a Nobel laureate? How could we compare cognitive impairment in animals and human beings? We have to change the names of our models. Amyloid precursor protein transgenic mouse model is not an Alzheimer model. It is nothing but three copies of amyloid precursor protein deposition in the brain of a mouse. Conclusively, targeting a single aspect of a multifactorial disease such as Alzheimer will not appropriately model such a multifactorial chronic complex disease. In fact, none of age, oxidative stress, education, and other responsible genes were reflected in APP models of Alzheimer. It seems that in neuroscience, it is inevitable to fade out the stress of primary animal models. Weight of human trials is not comparable with the animal studies.

The most commonly used models are called population (compartmental) models. Developments by WH Hamer, Sir Ronald Ross and Kermack and McKendrick between 1910 and 1930 resulted in the core mathematical models that continue to be used to understand and predict the transmission of infectious diseases today (Kermack and McKendrick 1927) . These deterministic dynamical models have been extended to stochastic variants for use under certain circumstances, and for modelling diseases with other modes of transmission than those originally studied, as well as for studying endemic and endemo-epidemic diseases. Age structure and spatial structure have been introduced as further features to the dynamical models. More detailed spatial structure between subpopulations, taking account of social groups and travel patterns, captures a subclass of pandemic models with increased spatial heterogeneity. Network models of infectious disease take advantage of modern computing power and increased amounts of readily available social network data to model transmission based on models of individual people's contacts with others in their social groups. Agent-based models go one step further and Where the animal is marked with an asterisk (*), this indicates that the disease's zoonotic origin was traced back to the same animal host. Note that where there is no observed recent animal-to-human transmission for some diseases, it remains likely that the disease's earliest origins were via zoonosis. Smallpox's mode of transmission is suspected to be airborne but was not fully confirmed before its extinction in 1979 (Milton 2012) (if applicable) and pathogenic agents, thus removing some of the assumptions underlying the dynamical models and attempting to generate real-world epidemic behaviour directly from the interactions of the agents. 5 By definition, pandemics occur only if the susceptible population is sufficiently large that sustained transmission can occur over large swaths of the planet. For this to happen, there needs to be low residual immunity in the population: it is emerging or re-emerging pathogens that are likely to give rise to pandemics. Moreover, in an unconventional risk transfer context, the principal use case is to model the risk of emergence of a novel pathogen capable of reaching pandemic scale, and subsequently the size, scale and impact of that pandemic. It is for this reason that industry focuses its attention on population models with spatial heterogeneity: they are able to capture the large-scale behaviour of pandemics relevant to counterparties involved in risk transfer transactions.",29.70427827664848,12.60410407006763

A significant hurdle in successful gene therapy is the efficient delivery of the therapeutic gene to the correct target cells. Often the most important target cells, for example, stem cells, have low permissivity to retroviral infection. A better understanding of the host-virus interactions that determine permissivity will enable the design of retroviral vectors with higher infectivities in relevant cell types. Furthermore, understanding the determinants of species-specific retroviral replication will enable us to improve animal models for AIDS. Current models comprise rhesus macaques infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac) and its derivatives as HIV-1 is strongly restricted by both rhesus TRIM5α and APOBEC3G. The current models have been successful in understanding the immunology of AIDS (Mattapallil et al., 2005) , but their use in testing vaccines and anti-HIV therapeutics is limited. Altering HIV-1 so that it can replicate and cause disease in rhesus macaques would be expected to significantly improve the AIDS animal model.

In the context of infectious diseases for which it is not feasible or ethical to perform clinical trials, animal studies play an additional role. Under the FDA's Animal Efficacy Rule (""Animal Rule"") therapeutics against rare, emerging, or virulent agents can achieve regulatory approval provided efficacy is demonstrated in two animal models (one of which must be a non-rodent species) that display clinical illness representative of human disease (46). The ideal animal model is permissive to infection and reproduces the clinical course and pathology observed in humans. An algorithm for the development of animal models is presented in Figure 1 . Small animal models offer several advantages over NHP's including availability of animals and species specific reagents, ease of handling, reduced cost, and the ability to use sufficient numbers for statistical analysis. Especially with coronaviruses, rodents vary in susceptibility and may be semi-permissive to infection and refractory to clinical disease (47) , even so, they can be used to screen countermeasures (48) (49) (50) (51) . Thus, to generate a rodent model that displays clinical disease it may be necessary to adapt the virus to enhance virulence for the rodent host or generate transgenic animals.

One may pay particular attention to differences in how a pathogen is delivered in nature (i.e., mosquito, superficial dermis, salivary proteins) and how this may or may not translate depending on how we deliver in the context of vaccination (i.e., needle, intramuscular or subcutaneous, no salivary proteins). Note added after review: Back correlations between efficacious vaccines and mechanisms of protection should be carried out to derive correlates of protection. Alternative approaches using in vitro organoids and ex vivo studies should be used to supplement live animal models, although their role in supporting product development is uncertain. Several other parameters of animal models can be poorly reflective of the human infection and disease experience. For example, the time course of infection in animal models can be remarkably different from humans. Further, lethal challenge models (e.g., Nipah) do not provide endpoints suitable for translation to clinical trials. Model relevance was also discussed in the context of a Zika pregnancy model in immunocompetent mice, in which the infected dams did not get viremia and there was no detectable vertical transmission of virus, yet there was virtually 100% fetal demise. Monoclonal antibody blocking studies indicated that, despite the absence of productive infection, the pathology was apparently caused by virus, raising the possibility of fetal demise due to specific placental pathology [7] . There would be great value in developing high quality, standardized animal models and challenge strains of particular pathogens that are broadly accepted. Following Good Laboratory Practices within high bio-containment required for handling some pathogens is difficult and could impact countermeasure development efforts in these areas.

Spatial infectious disease models and Cellular Automata (CA) models are two outstanding types of them. In essence, spatial infectious disease models [6] are composed of a system of differential equations and understandably have the common shortcomings as differential equation models. However, CA models are a new kind of computational techniques for simulating the real world, introduced first by Von Neumann [7] . At first, they were mainly used for simulation of physics systems. In recent years, many researchers from all kinds of fields have had an increasing interest in them thanks to the development of the computer techniques. Some authors have applied CA to model infectious diseases [1, 2, 5, 8, 9] . They basically construct the CA based on differential equation models. By that way, some epidemiological features of an infectious disease can be expressed more directly. Moreover, CA simulation can present visual results that enable us to ascertain some key features of the spread of an infectious disease through experiment and observation. In most existing studies, CA models use cellular space that is generated by equably dividing the research area into regular lattices. And in those studies, the classic neighbor patterns, such as Moore and von Neumann neighbors, are applied and the transition rules of the CA are derived from the relevant differential equation models. These, however, have some shortcomings. First of all, the classic neighbor patterns are not suitable for some special diseases while they are suitable for characterizing the spread of some infectious diseases. SARS is one of the typical examples. The spread of SARS shows the small world characteristic [10] which is completely different from the behavior expressed by the classic neighbor patterns. On the other hand, the real background space where diseases spread comprises irregular geographical regions (which generally have different sizes and shapes), so it is also not suitable to impersonate physical geographical regions using regular lattices.",29.043924462264627,15.032853696756607

These individual-based models use a bottom-up approach, which starts with discrete individuals of a population, and tries to understand how the population's properties emerge from interactions among individuals (Grimm & Railsback, 2005) . This approach offers three advantages for modeling disease transmission. First, the heterogeneity of both individuals and their interactions can be explicitly represented, as can the subsequent heterogeneity in disease transmission (Keeling, 1999; Koopman & Lynch, 1999) . Second, the randomness of disease infection between a pair of individuals can be captured as a stochastic process. Third, by aggregating individual infections, the outcome of disease transmission can be studied at multiple scales, such as the community, city, national and international scales. These three advantages bring the epidemic modeling closer to reality than other traditional models. However, the increased realism demands more assumptions to be made and more parameters to be estimated, bringing more complexity in modeling (Judson, 1994; Koopman, 2002) .",31.25078215769351,12.374637693166704

Clearly, the pathogenesis of disease can only be studied in animal models that replicate key aspects of the disease. But animal models do not need to replicate all aspects of disease to provide useful information in evaluation of vaccines and immunoprophylaxis. For example, an animal model can be useful in vaccine efficacy studies if the following two criteria are met: (i) virus titer correlates with disease severity; and (ii) the virus replicates in the animal model to a sufficiently high titer so that differences in the level of replication between immunized and mock-immunized control groups can be meaningfully distinguished. Under these conditions, demonstration that a vaccine or antibody can prevent or significantly reduce the level of replication of challenge virus would be convincing evidence of efficacy.

One of the most recent examples is the outbreak of Ebola virus (Filoviridae) in West Africa, which started in December of 2013 in Guinea and evolved as the largest Ebola outbreak recorded with more than 28,600 cases [8]. Furthermore, during recent years, outbreaks caused by other emerging viral pathogens from Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, and Flaviviridae families among others, disturbed public and private health, social networks and the economies of the affected countries [9], [10]. Prevention and control of emerging and reemerging viral diseases is efficient when several actions are combined: i.e. creating diagnostic networks and surveillance programs, training medical and veterinary staff, informing the population about sanitary measures, and also promoting research on prophylaxis, treatments and on the causative agent pathogenesis. Regarding the last point, animal models are crucial to study the viral and host factors contributing to the disease as well as transmission outcomes of virus infection and to allow pre-clinical testing of antiviral drugs and vaccines. Non-human primates (NHP) are the preferred models for pathogenesis studies, and potential vaccine and treatment testing, as they better translate to humans [11]. However, working with NHP is costly, with limited availability, and raises ethical problems. Therefore small-animal models are usually the first choice for drug screening. The United States Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Animal Rule provides guidelines concerning the appropriateness of animal models for licensing purposes [12]. Additionally, by controlling the disease in animal reservoirs and/or in intermediate hosts, virus transmission to humans can be significantly reduced [13], [14]. This is particularly true for domestic or feral animals for which efficient vaccines and vaccination strategies can be implemented [15]. Therefore, in cases of new pathogenic virus outbreaks, the search for natural hosts or potential target animals (as opposed to laboratory animals) seems to be relevant not only to implement prophylactic solutions but also to improve the preparedness for an eventual global extension of diseases. Nowadays, this task is rendered possible by the availability of improved biosafety levels 3 and 4 (BSL3 and 4) animal facilities, which can accommodate large animal experimentation with such highly virulent pathogens [16].",30.665323871661705,14.100413394372978

However, whether there is an advantage to the application of defensins as a therapeutic measure against a virus is another question. We may extrapolate from a few relevant in vivo studies using animal models. Defensin-deficient mouse models (Ryan et al., 2011; Gounder et al., 2016) are similar to prophylactic models since they allow the presence or absence of defensins at the time of target virus infection to be studied. Furthermore, in these models, the inhibition of viral infections observed in vitro was not recapitulated in vivo. To be truly therapeutic, externally or artificially supplied defensins should be able to reduce the replication of a target virus as observed in vitro. In a Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection model of burn-wounded mice (Park et al., 2014), a local transfer of allogeneic cells infected with an HBD4-expressing Newcastle disease virus vector was used as an effective therapeutic application. Others also showed the feasibility of an adenovirus-mediated human defensin gene delivery as an antibacterial therapy (Moon and Lim, 2015).

However, a number of reports have provided both insights and tools for further study including extensive sequencing data, reverse genetic resources, and monoclonal antibodies for treatment of infection (Zumla et al., 2015). In contrast, vaccine strategies have been limited due to the absence of robust animal models. Typically examined in mice, the presence of specific charge and glycosylation difference between human and rodent DPP4, the receptor for MERS-CoV, prevent infection (Peck et al., 2015). Therefore, the traditional approaches to study pathogenesis and vaccine efficacy have been stunted. The lack of a small animal model has shifted MERS-CoV research into larger in vivo models including non-human primates and ungulates (van Doremalen and Munster, 2015). Koch's postulates were first achieved for MERS-CoV in rhesus macaques (Falzarano et al., 2014).

Previously, to examine the replication of SARS-CoV, various animal models were used which showed the symptoms of severe infection [43]. In contrast to SARS-CoV, no MERS-CoV pathogenesis was observed in small animals. Mice are not vulnerable to infection by MERS-coronavirus due to the non-compatibility of the DPP4 receptor [44]. As the entire genome of the 2019-novel coronavirus is more than 80% similar to the previous human SARS-like bat CoV, previously used animal models for SARS-CoV can be utilized to study the infectious pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. The human ACE2 cell receptor is recognized by both SARS and Novel coronaviruses. Conclusively, TALEN or CRISPR-mediated genetically modified hamsters or other small animals can be utilized for the study of the pathogenicity of novel coronaviruses. SARS-CoV has been reported to replicate and cause severe disease in Rats (F344), where the sequence analysis revealed a mutation at spike glycoprotein [45]. Thus, it could be another suitable option to develop spike glycoprotein targeting therapeutics against novel coronaviruses. Recently, mice models and clinical isolates were used to develop any therapeutic strategy against SARS-CoV-2 induced COVID-19 [46], [47]. In a similar study, artificial intelligence prediction was used to investigate the inhibitory role of the drug against SARS-CoV-2 [48]. SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were also used to conduct randomized clinical trials [46], [49], [50]. It is now important that the scientists worldwide collaborate the design a suitable model and investigate the in vivo mechanisms associated with pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.",27.00381309301781,13.47909480213021

Salmonella is a leading cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide, and Yersinia pestis is the causative agent of plague. As general models of infection, Salmonella and Yersinia pestis are among the best characterized with in vitro and in vivo animal models. These bacterial pathogens must use a well-orchestrated series of regulatory and metabolic changes to replicate and persist in the inhospitable host environment. Among these highly regulated processes is the process of secreting bacterial proteins into the host that modulate the host’s response network. Early efforts have focused on developing methods to investigate and model the coordinated regulatory and metabolic changes occurring in the pathogen during infection and to identify and characterize the secreted bacterial proteins responsible for manipulating the host networks (5, 6).

Currently, the ferret is thought to be the most suitable animal model for respiratory influenza virus infection56 since ferrets are physiologically susceptible to wild type influenza viruses due to a similar respiratory tract and are able to transmit the virus once infected. As mentioned previously, ferrets display similar clinical disease as humans following influenza infection which include fever, weight loss, and sneezing and these positive features have been well discussed previously2124263056. As well, the ferret has been shown to have similar features as human in regard to IFN pathway function and is potential model for the study of human IFN-gamma signalling2457. Although the ferret is an appropriate model, it is imperative to be mindful of the disparities between animal models and the nature human infection to have an accurate assessment of research findings especially from ferret-influenza studies. During experimental influenza infections in animal models, a specific and known amount of virus is administered to the animal in a controlled manor, usually by intranasal inoculation. Modeling the infectious behaviour of a virus is more predictable when the infection route and dose are controlled. This is in contrast to natural infection where humans are infected with an unknown amount of virus in an unknown route, which must be considered when extrapolating results from animal model studies. Most significantly, ferrets as well as other animal models used in influenza studies are typically ‘Specific Pathogen Free' (SPF). In this case, the ferrets are determined to be influenza free prior to study initiation. Unlike humans who have been previously exposed to various subtypes of influenza viruses, ferrets used in influenza studies are completely naïve to the virus. The nuances of the immune response subsequent to multiple influenza infections, such as the phenomenon of original antigenic sin58, has only started to be elucidated in the ferret model53 and much work is still required to have a full understanding of the effect of sequential influenza infection on the specific immune response mounted. Furthermore, since the influenza virus is subject to both genetic shift and genetic drift35, the clinical manifestations of sequential virus infections by a virus that undergone multiple genetic drifts would differ from a response of a virus that had undergone a significant genetic shift as that of the H1N1 2009 pandemic variant.",27.70153531471002,14.241127009825783

Hence, the rate at which susceptibles become infected is given by kSI where S and I represent population densities of susceptible and infected people, respectively. In this context, the rate at which infected individuals become recovered is given by λI, while the rate at which recovered individuals become again susceptible is given by μR; k, λ and μ are analogy constants.

During the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa in 2014–2016, thousands of people were infected and many of them died due to the viral infection [1]. EVD is generally considered as an endemic disease in Africa. However, its spread can be broadened through travel to all parts of the world. It is known to be transmitted from humans, bats, rodents, and chimpanzees to humans. Ebola virus belongs to the Filoviridae family [2]. Ebola virus has a negative sense RNA genome that encodes 7 different proteins and is surrounded by an envelope that contains the virally expressed glycoprotein (GP). There are five species of Ebola virus including, Zaire ebolavirus, Sudan ebolavirus, Tai Forest ebolavirus, Bundibugyo ebolavirus and Reston ebolavirus, all of which were named after the places where they were first discovered [3]. Ebola virus GP is associated with viral attachment to the host cell receptor prior to viral entry into the cells [45]. To date, neutralizing antibodies targeting Ebola virus GP have been reported to be somewhat effective at reducing the severity of Ebola virus infection and disease progression in animal models and humans. For example, when Ebola virus-infected monkeys were treated within 24 hours following Ebola virus challenge with ZMAb (composed of three monoclonal antibodies [MAbs] against Ebola virus GP), all survived from Ebola virus infection, while all monkeys without ZMAb treatment died within five days of viral infection [67] Furthermore, ZMapp (Mapp Biopharmaceutical) treatment is known to be effective at reducing mortality rates in patients infected with Ebola virus [8].

During recent decades, the public health risk represented by zoonoses was suggested by the onset of outbreaks and epidemics of previously unknown human infectious diseases that emerged from animal reservoirs such as Ebola virus, West Nile virus, Nipah virus, Hanta virus, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. More recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses [1] have shown that biological agents and animal breeding activities can pose a significant public health risk, because several animal infectious diseases are not only endemic but also epidemic-prone, such as leptospirosis, brucellosis and rabies [2]. Therefore, these agents can potentially cause epidemics at any time.

Although the studies in C3−/− mice were consistent with models of complement-dependent control of other viral infections including HSV, influenza, and LCMV (2–4, 31, 32), no investigation had systematically addressed how the different activation pathways coordinate protection. Our experiments demonstrate that all complement activation pathways are required for control of severe WNV disease. The virologic experiments suggest that complement limits viral spread and facilitates clearance of WNV within the CNS. As many complement proteins are constitutively expressed within the CNS (33) and up-regulated after infection with other neurotropic viruses (34–36), complement activation in the CNS could be critical for destruction of viral particles or virus-infected neuronal cells. Alternatively, the defects observed in priming adaptive immune responses to WNV in complement-deficient mice (see below) may result in earlier spread and/or decreased clearance.",12.55600937668759,7.804764443263386

We adapt each of the disease transmission models to incorporate two mechanistic representations of movement: the first is an Eulerian movement model which we call the Flux model, and the second is a Lagrangian movement model which we call the Simple Trip model. We directly compare the Flux and Simple Trip models by setting parameters such that the total flux of travelers between each sub-population remains constant, thus emulating a case where one might have a single data set from which one could calibrate either movement model. We examine how disease model outcomes can change with di erent movement models for each transmission model. For all three transmission models, we find that the modeled quantities of interest relating to disease dynamics can di er dramatically depending on one's choice of movement model. We conclude by applying this analysis to a model of malaria transmission and importation on Bioko Island in Equatorial Guinea, and use intuition based on our prior analysis to frame our understanding for why the Flux model surprisingly fails to produce meaningful predictions of transmission intensity in that context.",28.45627610072925,12.94774454499187

This means that they have distributions of residence times in each stage that only resemble reality to the extent of having the same expected values, with radically different values of all higher moments. This has been known for some time (Krylova & Earn, 2013; Lloyd, 2001a Lloyd, , 2001b Wearing et al., 2005) and solutions to the challenge are available (Krylova & Earn, 2013; Lloyd, 2001b) . But the huge simplicity of compartment models relative to Erlang distributed; integro-differential or delay differential models has meant that they have continued to play a prominent role in disease modelling, including many published papers modelling COVID-19 (see introduction). However, their discarding of information on the length of time individuals have been in a compartment creates serious deficiencies in the ability of compartment models to replicate the dynamics of real epidemics, such as COVID. In the examples examined here, including a model using parameter values based on COVID dynamics in Wuhan, SEIR models underestimate the proportion of the population that will be Infected when the epidemic is at its peak and overestimate the epidemic duration, by factors of three and two respectively. The models in this paper show that the peak of infection in our explicit time model may be either earlier or later than the peak in the simple SEIR model. The implications of our findings for state policies to manage of COVID-19 epidemics are not clear. If SEIR models use parameter values estimated independently from data they will underestimate the proportion of the population which will be infected at the epidemic's peak. But if inverse modelling uses SEIR models to estimate parameters from disease time series (Fang et al., 2020) , they may give parameter estimates that are too pessimistic. Another consideration is Wearing et al. (2005) assessment that the standard models overestimate the effectiveness of quarantine and underestimate the importance of early detection.",21.264305876141254,10.045040540154687

New transformative treatments could be developed by understanding the genetic associations conferring risk or protective effects. In addition to rapid expansion of epilepsy-associated gene list discovered mainly with monogenic causes of seizures, human GWAS studies of generalized epilepsy identified more than a dozen novel genome-wide significant loci and biological plausible candidate genes [4] [5] [6] . However, human GWAS approaches have had limited success in identifying risk loci associated with certain forms of epilepsy (e.g. partial epilepsy) and specific seizure outcomes (e.g. SUDEP), partially due to complex disease etiologies and underpowered sample sizes 7, 8 . Animal studies remain essential for understanding the mechanisms of epilepsy and for identifying new therapeutic targets. In particular, animal models offer phenotypic repeatability and a means to study a trait in a controlled environment, as well as providing a level of experimental testing and validation that is not ethical or possible in human subjects, such as in the case of SUDEP.

In general, the spread of an epidemic is considered to be a dynamic process in which the disease passes from one individual to another through contact between individuals on the contact network (kleczkowski et al., 2011) . Disease transmission often occurs in a dynamic social environment, and individual health behavior decision-making is guided by cultural norms, peer behavior and media reports (Kim et al., 2019) . Although vaccination is a major strategy to protect individuals from infection, the development, testing and production of new vaccines often take a long time (stohr &amp; esveld, 2004) . Before getting enough vaccines, the best protection for individuals is to take preventive actions, such as wearing masks, washing hands frequently, taking drugs, avoiding contact with patients, etc. (Centers for Disease Control and prevention, 2008) . The historical experience of SARS tells us that effective national control measures, such as early identification and isolation of SARS cases, tracking and isolation of the contacts, screening of travelers, and raising public awareness of risk, can help to contain the spread of the virus (Ahmad et al., 2009) . As the public gradually realized the importance of personal behavior in preventing the spread of infection, researchers began to explore the mathematical model of disease transmission including personal behavior. These models have been used to guide strategies for disease transmission control (vardavas et al., 2007) and quantify the role of individual protective measures in controlling several outbreaks, including the Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa in 2014 (fast et al., 2007) , the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong in 2003 and the H1N1 outbreak in central Mexico in 2009 Mexico in (springborn et al., 2007 . Saunders et al. (2017) also tested the effectiveness of personal protective measures in preventing the spread of pandemic influenza in humans. Recently, the research on the outbreak of COVID-19 from the perspective of transmission dynamics is also increasing. Sun et al. (2020) evaluated the epidemiological trend of COVID-19 based on the public epidemic data, and studied the outbreak progress in all parts of China. Understanding the impact of the media on the spread of the disease can help improve the prediction of epidemics and identify preventive measures to slow the spread of the disease. Many models also link the disease-related media transmission with the protection function, usually assuming that the influence of media will reduce the effective transmission rate and slow down the spread of diseases. These studies indicate that the impact of media increases with the number of people infected (Sun et al., 2011; , or both with the number and the rate of change (tchuenche &amp; bauch, 2012; Xiao et al., 2015) . When the number of cases is high or the prevalence of diseases increases rapidly, the information diffusion slows down the spread of diseases and creates interesting disease transmission dynamics, such as multi-wave outbreaks . However, it is not clear whether the media function formalization proposed by the model fully reflects the actual influence. The choice of media function directly affects the form of disease transmission, making the accurate parameterization of the media is the key (collison et al., 2014) . However, most of the current researches only focus on the development of the disease itself on the complex network, as well as the impact of protective measures on the spread of the disease. There are relatively few studies on the spread of disease-related information, and only a few of them are carried out through numerical simulation with the preconditions which are too idealized and too dependent on the setting of parameters. In addition, the model has just begun to consider how to combine the data from actual media reports (collison et al., 2015) , lacking the econometric analysis based on real-time data. In decade years, China's Internet has experienced unprecedented development, various online social media based on the Internet (such as major search engines, social networking sites, news sites, etc.) have been integrated into people's daily life, providing a broad platform for the dissemination of various information. Compared with the outbreak of SARS in 2003, the economic link between regions are increasingly close, and during the Spring Festival in China, the population flow is more frequent. Although the government has taken unprecedented measures to prevent and control the epidemic, and the official media and social media have timely released the latest epidemic information, the actual effect needs to be further tested. By combing and integrating the existing literature, we propose the hypothesis that information diffusion is helpful to curb the spread of new coronavirus.",20.848483784006685,9.437454414419658

Early warning of such communicable diseases before the onset of symptoms can potentially improve both patient care and public health responses. An example of such an early warning system is the PRESAGED (Presymptomatic Agent Exposure Detection) system [1] which uses host-based physiological signals to detect an individual's exposure to pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria, before overt symptoms emerge and infectiousness is peak. In animal models, the PRESAGED algorithm has been shown to provide two to three days of early warning before the onset of incipient symptoms (e.g., fever), independent of the particular pathogen, exposure route, pathogen dose, or animal species [1] . These results are consistent with findings of Speranza et al. that show presymptomatic upregulation in biomarkers potentially linked to pathogen exposure around the same time in non-human primates exposed to Ebola [2] .

Perhaps the most important one has to do with the inability of current large-scale epidemiological models to fully account for behavioral changes in the population when a disease is evolving.

This produces undesired effects such as a collapse in the emergency rooms at hospitals, a proliferation of information sources that do not provide sensible advices in all cases, anticipated economic loses and, in general, uncoordinated responses.

Our findings join those of others to suggest that social adversity is particularly relevant to the inflammatory response, one of the first lines of defense in the innate immune system (49) . Because biomarkers of inflammation in turn predict disease and mortality outcomes (50), these findings suggest that social regulation of immune gene expression may partly mediate social gradients in health. However, contrary to current predictions based on data collected in unstimulated conditions, low status females did not mount attenuated gene regulatory responses to viral challenge (6, 32) . Instead, they show a stronger up-regulation of genes involved in the regulation of type I IFN when comparing Gard to control samples. Further, for these genes, the status-dependent polarization of gene expression patterns observed following exposure to a bacteriaassociated challenge disappears following exposure to a virus-associated challenge.",16.324528249756863,7.2034979367551495

Additionally, note that we have not explicitly included in the model the possibility of asymptomatic transmission, which should not be mistaken by transmission from undetected or unreported cases. Asymptomatic spreading is still under scrutiny and the statistical evidences are scarce and not significant enough as to be taken by granted. In any case, including this possibility would be trivially possible in this kind of models.",16.849114290756503,7.189503967919828

The main ingredients are: I m (t) is the birthand-death processes and R m (t) is the associated pure birth processes. The process of transmission is the Poisson process with intensity β (time to next transmission has the exponential density βe −βt , t > 0). After the intervention (for t ≥ t 0 ), the Poisson process of transmission for m-the group has intensity β m . We treat this model as purely stochastic despite parts of it can be written it terms of systems of stochastic differential equations.
