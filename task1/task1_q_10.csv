To do this, we challenged rats with either a mix of bacterial and viral components in adjuvant, adjuvant alone, or saline on postnatal day 10 (P10). The time point of P10 was chosen for exposure as it roughly translates to the first year of life in humans [16, 17] and represents an age of peak brain growth in rats [18] . We then evaluated the subsequent peripheral and CNS immune response 2 and 5 days later to compare early vs. late post-challenge immune responses. As a readout, we analyzed cytokine and chemokine levels in the serum as well as cortical, hippocampal, and cerebellar lysates. Additionally, we assessed the numbers and activation profiles of microglia and astrocytes within the cortex and hippocampus. Given the inherent heterogeneity in the immune response due to genetic background and sex [19, 20] , an additional aim of the study was to compare the CNS and peripheral immune response following immune challenge in male and female Lewis and Brown Norway (BN) rats. These strains of rats were chosen as they exhibit immune response skewing, with Lewis rats skewing toward a T helper (Th) 1 cell (cellular, proinflammatory) response and BN rats skewing toward a Th2 (humoral, regulatory) response [21, 22] . While evidence exists suggesting sex-specific differences in CNS immune responsiveness during early postnatal development [23] , the influence of genetic background on sex-specific immune responses is not as well documented.

We have modeled that responses to different antigens are generated independently of each other and do not compete. We have done so because vaccines are likely to cause relatively mild infections during which the densities of pathogen and immune cells do not reach sufficiently high levels required for competitive interactions to be important.

For example, HIV-1 Env is engaged in a constant battle with the antibody-mediated adaptive immune response. The ability of Env to evade an innate immunity might be limited by the need to resist antibody attack. This scenario is illustrated by the loss of IFITM3 resistance in transmitted founder HIV-1 strains, which mutate Env in order to resist autologous antibodies as infection progresses [60] . One implication of this finding is that relatively high level of IFITM3 may mount high enough inhibitory pressure to limit Env mutation pathways in evading inhibition by antibodies, thus creating a synergistic control of HIV-1 infection. It is equally possible that given the interferon-inducible nature of IFITM3 expression, subsidence of interferon response after the acute stage of HIV-1 infection may lead to reduction in IFITM3 level, thus mounting less pressure on HIV-1 Env and allowing Env to change and resist neutralizing antibodies.",18.746184739297405,10.347753458707551

Both formulations employed the virosomes technology (Figure 4) , in which the viral proteins are bound to the surface of a liposome in an array, similar to what is seen on viral particles [171] . The idea is to create a safe viral-like particle that can induce strong protective immune response. Similar technology could be applied to DNA vaccines to improve immunogenicity. In fact, liposomes on their own could elicit immune response even in the absence of other antigens. It has been demonstrated by Lay et al. that DOTIM (octadecenoyloxy-ethyl-heptadecenyl-3-hydroxyethyl imidazolinium chloride)/cholesterol cationic liposome-DNA complexes (JVRS-100), in which an empty plasmid DNA vector was incorporated, were able to induce high levels of antibody and T cell immunity in mice and non-human primates [174] . Since lipid composition, particle size, surface charge and DNA entrapment efficiency of the liposomes can affect their immunogenicity and potency, these parameters must be carefully characterized and controlled. The major limitation of liposome as DNA vaccine carrier is long-term stability, as lyophilization of liposomes may not be always possible [171] . [175] . Plasmid DNA encoding Ag85A was complexed with the lipids. Following intranasal immunization in mice, naked DNA was completely ineffective, probably due to the degradation of the DNA by mucosal nuclease. The lipid-DNA formulation was capable of inducing a weak cell-mediated immune response, and no humoral immune response was detected. The co-lipid intranasal formulation was compared with another cationic lipid formulation, Vaxfectin, which was used for intramuscular administration. It was found that the intramuscular formulation was able to induce a better immune response. However, combining intranasal and intramuscular administrations resulted in stronger immune responses in the lungs. Considerable improvement is needed to further develop the formulation for intranasal use.",17.70277058759652,10.816344695168365

They have been demonstrated to be strong adjuvants and are able to boost immune response against any antigen which is presented together with the phage particle. This immunostimulatory effect of phage-based vaccines eliminates the need for adjuvants that are frequently administered along with recombinant proteins and synthetic peptides to improve immune response to vaccines. Thus, phages can be used as an alternative to classical carrier proteins. For example, f1 filamentous phage displaying the B2.1 peptide on it surface has been indicated to generate an immune response in mice more potent than coupling the peptide to traditional carriers such as ovalbumin [58] . One important factor contributing to the immunostimulatory property and adjuvant capacity of phages is the presence of a number of unmethylated CpG motifs in their genome. These motifs can account for the activation of the innate immune system through Toll-like receptors (TLRs) [59, 60] . The function of phages as a natural adjuvant abrogates the need for alternative adjuvant purification and further conjugation to the vaccine. Therefore, the incorporation of phage particles into the formulation of vaccine candidates enormously decreases the expense of producing new vaccines while increasing efficiency. Due to their particulate nature, phage vaccines can be taken up by antigen presenting cells (APCs). APCs engulf phages with antigenic and immunogenic determinants, process them efficiently, and present phage-mediated antigens through major histocomaptibility complex (MHC) class I and II pathways [61] . MHC-mediated peptide presentation stimulates both cellular and humoral immune responses. It has been revealed that phages as particulate antigens not only activate antibody production via MHC class II pathway, but also mount cell-mediated immunity through gaining access to MHC class I pathway.",17.48185640640421,10.489060196514696

Viral and bacterial infections have been associated with induction or protection against asthma, suggesting that innate immunity plays an important role in disease pathogenesis [176] . On the basis of several epidemiologic, human, and animal studies, the timing and extent of LPS exposure, and presumably TLR4 activation, appears to determine whether a protective Th1 response or a permissive Th2 response develops in the lung [177] . For example, it was demonstrated that low dose administration of intranasal LPS induces a Th2 biased immune response in the lung whereas elsewhere in the body LPS is a strong inducer of a Th1 immune response [178] . Nevertheless, experimental treatment of mice with microbes [179] or TLR agonists [180, 181] inhibits allergic sensitization, eosinophilic inflammation, and airways hyperresponsiveness. Recently, experimental intranasal infection of pregnant mice with Acinetobacter lwoffii F78 was shown to confer protection against ovalbumin-induced asthma in the progeny.

The innate immune system comprises both a cellular and a humoral arm. Components of the humoral arm include soluble pattern recognition molecules (PRMs) that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns and initiate the immune response in coordination with the cellular arm, therefore acting as functional ancestors of antibodies. The long pentraxin PTX3 is a prototypic soluble PRM that is produced at sites of infection and inflammation by both somatic and immune cells. Gene targeting of this evolutionarily conserved protein has revealed a non-redundant role in resistance to selected pathogens. Moreover, PTX3 exerts important functions at the crossroad between innate immunity, inflammation, and female fertility. The human PTX3 protein contains a single N-glycosylation site that is fully occupied by complex type oligosaccharides, mainly fucosylated and sialylated biantennary glycans. Glycosylation has been implicated in a number of PTX3 activities, including neutralization of influenza viruses, modulation of the complement system, and attenuation of leukocyte recruitment. Therefore, this post translational modification might act as a fine tuner of PTX3 functions in native immunity and inflammation. Here we review the studies on PTX3, with emphasis on the glycan-dependent mechanisms underlying pathogen recognition and crosstalk with other components of the innate immune system.",17.683243430128194,10.870554620787177

Herein, we show that IPS-1, the central adaptor protein to RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling, is essential for triggering of innate immunity and for effective development and regulation of adaptive immunity against pathogenic WNV. IPS-1 2/2 mice exhibited increased susceptibility to WNV infection marked by enhanced viral replication and dissemination with early viral entry into the CNS. Infection of cultured bone-marrow (BM) derived dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages (Macs), and primary cortical neurons showed that the IPS-1-dependent RLR signaling was essential for triggering IFN defenses and controlling virus replication in these key target cells of infection. Intriguingly, infected IPS-1 2/2 mice displayed uncontrolled inflammation that included elevated systemic type I IFN, proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses, increased numbers of inflammatory DCs, enhanced humoral responses marked by complete loss of virus neutralization activity, and increased numbers of virus-specific CD8+ T cells and non-specific immune cell proliferation in the periphery and in the CNS. This uncontrolled inflammatory response was associated with a lack of regulatory T cell expansion that normally occurs during acute WNV infection. Thus, the enhanced inflammatory response in the absence of IPS-1 was coupled with a failure to protect against WNV infection. Our data define an innate/adaptive immune interface mediated through IPS-1-dependent RLR signaling that regulates the quantity, quality, and balance of the immune response to WNV infection.",16.946558232372062,10.436500082753867

Multiple oral vaccinations of OVA encapsulated in PLGA particles can stimulate CTL immune response in mice, although not as efficient as the formulation of OVA with ISCOMs (Maloy et al., 1994) . Mansoor et al. reported that PLGA particles encapsulating bovine parainfluenza virus type-3 (BPI3V) peptides or proteins induced an early, gradually increasing humoral immune responses via intranasal delivery, suggesting the advantage of slow and prolonged release of antigens in particulate systems compared to those in the soluble form (Mansoor et al., 2014) . Two peptide antigens of bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) co-encapsulated in PLGA microparticles induced both mucosal immune response in upper and lower respiratory tract and T-cell mediated immune response in mice after a single-dose intranasal administration, which is not observed with soluble antigens (Kavanagh et al., 2013) . Peptide antigens of malaria carried with PLGA microparticles induced stronger systemic immune response compared to those absorbed to alum either orally or subcutaneously administered in mice, and meanwhile the Th1-mediated cellular immune response was only observed in the previous formulation (Carcaboso et al., 2003) . In another study, recombinant envelope protein E2 of classical swine fever virus (CSFV-E2) as the antigen was encapsulated in PLGA microspheres, with rabbit serum albumin as the protein stabilizer, for the mucosal and systemic vaccine development (Brandhonneur et al., 2009) . Immunization tests were realized in rabbits through three routes (intranasal, oral and intramuscular) followed by an intradermal boost.

HMGBs operate upstream of cytoplasmic RLRs and endosomal TLRs and they are essential for nucleic acidinduced activation of innate immune response. In our experiments both HMGB1 and HMGB2 were detected in cell culture supernatants of influenza A virus-infected macrophages. These results suggest that HMGBs have an important role in the activation of innate immune response to influenza A virus infection. Our proteomics approach showed also increased secretion of galectin-3 in response to influenza A virus infection. This finding is especially interesting since galectins are known to bind extracellularly carbohydrate structures and the envelope of influenza A virus contains two glycoproteins, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. Hemagglutinin is required for influenza A virus entry, and it can be speculated that the extracellular galectins restrict viral entry. It is easy to envision that secreted galectins may have also other functions in antiviral response since there is ample evidence about the role of galectins in innate immunity to bacterial and fungal infections [53] .

Inclusion of internal influenza antigens in a vectored vaccine can also induce high levels of protective cellular immunity. To generate sustained immunity, it is an advantage to induce immunity at sites of inductive immunity to natural infection, in this case the respiratory tract. Several vectored vaccines target the respiratory tract. Typically, vectored vaccines generate antigen for weeks after immunization, in contrast to subunit vaccination. This increased presence and level of vaccine antigen contributes to and helps sustain a durable memory immune response, even augmenting the selection of higher affinity antibody secreting cells. The enhanced memory response is in part linked to the intrinsic augmentation of immunity induced by the vector.

The idea that RV infection, particularly URTI, is linked to exposure to cold air is a widespread and long-standing popular belief that has been extensively studied over the last centuries without finding a direct pathophysiological effect. To some extent, the work of Foxman et al. [190] is the first demonstration of how temperature can directly impact virus-host interaction and weakens the innate immune response to infection. Testing other RV strains, but also other respiratory viruses, could bring a better understanding of this function and perhaps allow a generalization of this immune mechanism in the host antiviral response. A limitation of this study is the use of a mouse model system and mouse-adapted virus and it would be interesting to confirm these results in a human model, such as a three-dimensional human airway epithelia reconstituted in vitro [59].",16.659187280920886,8.219696503207793

Firstly, among four serotypes of DENV, there was a relatively preponderant immune response to DENV2 as revealed by the highest titers of IgG and nAb ( Table 1) . This may be related to the fact that the cE80 sequence shares the highest homology in amino acid DENV2, and it has the shortest evolutionary distance from DENV2, and phylogenetically clustered together with DENV2 (Sun et al., 2017) ; secondly, cE80 contains many predicted epitopes within DENV2 (Supplementary Figure S1 and Table S1 ). These factors could have contributed to a more robust humoral immune response and protective immunity to DENV (Schein et al., 2012) . Additionally, there is a growing consensus that CD8 + T cell immune response plays an important role in the protection induced by dengue vaccine (Lam et al., 2017) . It was reported that a stronger CD8 + T cell response requires non-structural protein (NS), although there are some CD8 + T cell epitopes within E protein (Yauch et al., 2009) .

Thus, microbe and host both contribute to host damage and where an individual patient's immune response lies on the continuum of the DRF parabola determines the nature of the disease process. At one end, on the left, a weak immune response can result in tissue damage due to fungal proliferation that results in compression of brain tissue with little or no inflammation in what is primarily microbe-mediated damage. At the other end, on the right, a strong cellular immune response can also damage brain tissue due to excessive inflammation in what is primarily host-mediated damage. The occurrence of host damage in the setting of weak and strong immune responses provides important clues as to why it has been so difficult to consistently use agents that modulate inflammation, such as corticosteroids and interferon, to improve the outcome of cryptococcosis. Although adjunctive IFN-␥ therapy in HIV-associated cryptococcosis (27) and corticosteroids can ameliorate IRIS (28) in some patients, such immune-modulating agents may not be effective in other patients, because physicians do not usually know whether the preponderance of damage is due to host factors, microbial factors, or both. In this regard, the failure and detrimental effects of steroid therapy in patients with HIV-associated cryptococcosis (19) probably represent additional suppression of weak immunity resulting in enhancement of fungus-mediated damage. Hence, the effective use of immunotherapy is likely to require a rational approach that incorporates knowledge of where the immune response of an individual lies along the immune response co ntinuum depicted by the DRF parabola.",20.87228867426638,10.479021920316352

They are essential for both antigen processing and presentation (host adaptive immune response) and activation of endosomal Toll like receptors (innate immune response). Pathogens can produce proteases and also natural inhibitors to subvert the host immune response. Several pathogens are sensed through the intracellular pathogen recognition receptors, but only some of them use the host proteolytic system to escape into the cytosol. In this review, I provide an update on the most recent developments regarding the role of proteinases and their inhibitors in the initiation and regulation of immune responses.",18.662462484878738,12.928440634623025

Like CoV PLPs, cellular DUBs were identified as negative regulators of the innate immune response. A20 is considered a ''central gatekeeper in inflammation and immunity'' [56] because of its ability to interact with and mediate ubiquitinediting on signaling molecules such as RIP1, TRAF6, RIP2 and NEMO. A20 DUB activity removes K-63 linked polyubiquitin chains from RIP1, TRAF6, RIP2 and NEMO which results in negative regulation of the innate immune response. In addition, A20 has been shown to act by antagonizing interactions between signaling molecules and ubiquitin conjugating enzymes [57] . Interestingly, both A20 and CoV PLPs can act on K-63 linked ubiquitin chains [14, 58] . Further experiments are needed to determine if recognition, processing or sequestering of K-63 linked ubiquitin is important for CoV PLPs negative regulation of the IFN response. Cellular proteins DUBA and CYLD also negatively regulate the innate immune response. Kayagaki and co-workers found that DUBA targets and deubiquitinates TRAF3, a signaling molecule required for activation of IRF-3 [55] . They showed that reducing the expression of DUBA augments the IFN response to poly(I:C) whereas ectopic expression of DUBA blocks the IFN response. CYLD has been shown to deubiquitinate RIG-I to inhibit IFN production [53, 54] . Ectopic expression of CYLD antagonizes the IFN response whereas siRNA-mediated knockdown of CYLD expression allows for a more robust IFN response. It seems that CoV PLPs are usurping the function of cellular DUBs by behaving as negative regulators of the innate immune response through targeting STING for both deubiquitination and dimer disruption.",17.71450685058004,10.59462707745918

Recently, small animal models have been developed that mimic some of the features of the human disease. Specifically, BALB/c mice infected with mouseadapted SARS-CoV develop severe respiratory disease. Here, we show that the T cell response is defective in these mice and that this results from inefficient activation of the initial immune response to the virus. This defect can be corrected by several treatments, including depletion of inhibitory macrophages from the lungs and direct activation of respiratory dendritic cells, important in initiating the immune response or transfer of activated dendritic cells prior to infection. All of these modalities result in improved initiation of the immune response and an enhanced anti-virus T cell response.

The primary objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that administration of an Ad5-based Ebola vaccine by either the nasal or oral route can circumvent pre-existing immunity and confer full protection upon challenge.

Bypassing pre-existing immunity could maximize Ad5 vaccine efficacy. Vaccination by the intramuscular (I.M.), nasal (I.N.) or oral (P.O.) route with Ad5 expressing Ebola Zaire glycoprotein (Ad5-ZGP) fully protected naïve mice against lethal challenge with Ebola. In the presence of pre-existing immunity, only mice vaccinated I.N. survived. The frequency of IFN-c+ CD8+ T cells was reduced by 80% and by 15% in animals vaccinated by the I.M. and P.O. routes respectively. Neutralizing antibodies could not be detected in serum from either treatment group. Pre-existing immunity did not compromise the frequency of IFN-c+ CD8+ T cells (3.961% naïve vs. 3.661% pre-existing immunity, PEI) nor anti-Ebola neutralizing antibody (NAB, 40610 reciprocal dilution, both groups). The number of INF-c+ CD8+ cells detected in bronchioalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) after I.N. immunization was not compromised by pre-existing immunity to Ad5 (146614, naïve vs. 120616 SFC/million MNCs, PEI). However, pre-existing immunity reduced NAB levels in BAL by ,25% in this group. To improve the immune response after oral vaccination, the Ad5-based vaccine was PEGylated. Mice given the modified vaccine did not survive challenge and had reduced levels of IFN-c+ CD8+ T cells 10 days after administration (0.360.3% PEG vs. 1.760.5% unmodified). PEGylation did increase NAB levels 2-fold. These results provide some insight about the degree of T and B cell mediated immunity necessary for protection against Ebola virus and suggest that modification of the virus capsid can influence the type of immune response elicited by an Ad5-based vaccine.",16.74806519322439,9.409877202813778

While these results are extremely encouraging, further characterization of the immune response against both the encoded antigen and the adenovirus vector in larger, clinically relevant animal models is vital for both understanding the biology of Ad vaccines and for the development of an effective Ebola vaccine suitable to populations with different requirements [57, 58] . The issue of pre-existing immunity must also be adequately addressed in order to develop efficient recombinant adenovirus-based vaccines. While the majority of the literature suggests that pre-existing immunity significantly hamper the effective use of AdHu5 vaccine carriers, other investigators have reported that pre-existing immunity did not interfere with the potency of recombinant Ad5-based vaccines in both pre-clinical models of disease and in humans [59, 60] . Thus, additional studies identifying clinically relevant conditions under which to test Ad-based vaccine candidates are necessary to assess the full impact of pre-existing immunity on vaccine potency, including in different compartments.

Interestingly, the T-cell mediated immune response was significantly reduced and antibody levels increased in naïve animals given a single oral dose of the PEGylated vaccine with respect to that seen in animals given the same dose of unmodified Ad5-ZGP. It has been shown that modification of virus capsids by PEGylation can significantly dampen the T-cell mediated immune response against the virus and stimulate the antibody response against a secreted antigen [26, 27, 30, 54] .

Increasing the vector dose or adopting a prime-boost regimen in order to overcome pre-existing immunity to the virus is a common approach [2] . There is mixed enthusiasm for this plan, however, due to the documented toxicity associated with high doses of adenovirus and the length of time required for primeboost regimens when only a prime could be sufficient [13, 14] . 'Seroswitching', using recombinant adenoviruses constructed from chimpanzees or rare human serotypes with limited exposure rates such as adenoviruses 35 and 11 can elicit potent immune responses that are minimally affected by pre-existing immunity [7, 8, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Hexon-chimeric adenoviruses can also avoid neutralization [22, 23] . Both approaches offer promise in the context of addressing pre-existing immunity, but require further investigation in response to concerns regarding safety and feasibility of largescale production. Covalent attachment of polyethylene glycol or incorporation of the virus into polymer matricies can also effectively protect Ad5 from neutralization [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . Delivery of Ad5-based vaccines by mucosal routes can also circumvent the effect of pre-existing immunity and induce a significant immune response against an encoded antigen [32] .",16.607352076856053,8.821363374204154

AMPs have been proposed as multifunctional peptides that participate in the elimination of pathogenic microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses [6] . In particular, defensins, one of the major AMP families in mammals, contribute to the antimicrobial innate immune response by disrupting the cell membranes of pathogens [7] . Six α-defensins and 31 β-defensins are expressed in humans. Human β-defensins (HBDs), unlike α-defensins, are produced in a wide variety of epithelial tissues, including skin and mucosa, and cells, including phagocytic cells and mucosal epithelial cells [7] . The expression of defense genes is tightly regulated by cytokines as part of the host defense and is suppressed by various virulent factors of pathogens [6] . It is important to note that AMPs were recently reported to modulate adaptive immunity by triggering the recruitment and activation of immune cells via various pathways linked with innate immunity [8] . For example, HBDs are chemotactic for immature dendritic cells (DCs) and memory T cells to the site of pathogen invasion by interacting with CCR6 and promote the adaptive immune response by recruiting immune cells [9, 10] .

Previous studies have suggested that high levels of IFN-γ have a deleterious effect on protective immunity [26] . However, Shen et al. recently reported that protective immunity against PCV2 in mice was mediated by Capspecific CD8 + cells and a seroneutralization response [27] . Fort et al. also demonstrated that PCV2-specific cellular responses in pigs contributed, together with neutralizing antibodies, to viral clearance [2] . A previous study also showed that immunization with adjuvant-free baculovirus displaying the rodent malaria Plasmodium berghei circumsporozoite protein on its envelope induced high levels of antibodies and IFN-γ-secreting cells, and protected 60% of mice against sporozoite challenge [28] . In this study, we observed a significantly enhanced cell-mediated immune response in mice immunized with BV-GD-ORF2 compared with that of mice immunized with pc-ORF2. A higher background of nonspecific IFN-γ production in splenocytes harvested from the baculovirus-injected mice was also observed. This might be because gp64, the baculovirus envelope protein, recognizes the TLR9 molecule and thus activates the innate immune response [29] . This is consistent with the results of a previous study in which intranasal immunization with WT baculovirus alone provided sufficient protection from lethal challenge with the H1N1 influenza virus [8] .",17.163420072348572,10.595914319061318

This is largely due to the limited availability of suitable immunocompetent animal models of viral infection that allow in-depth investigations of the endogenous immune response. The concept that passive immunotherapies utilizing antiviral mAbs can induce long-term protective immunity has recently been established using an immunocompetent mouse model, consisting of short immunotherapies given to young animals infected with the FrCasE murine leukemia virus. The induction of such 'vaccine-like' effects by antiviral mAbs, as well as some of the mechanisms involved, are reviewed in detail elsewhere. 39 In brief, the inoculation of mouse pups with FrCasE is fatal because the antiviral immune response is too weak to control the viral propagation. In contrast, treatment with a neutralizing mAb for several days shortly after infection blunts viral propagation and induces a lifelong protective antiviral immunity composed of both a highly neutralizing humoral response and a cytotoxic CD8 + T-cell response. [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] This induction of protective immunity strictly depends on the Fc fragment of the neutralizing mAbs. 43, 44 Moreover, the formation of ICs composed of the administered mAbs and infected cells rather than virions is crucial for the enhanced antiviral immune response. 43 Such ICs are recognized by the FcγRs expressed by DCs, which facilitate ICs internalization and lead to stronger activation and more efficient antigen presentation by DCs, eventually leading to stronger cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses. An Fc-mediated effect that occurs concurrently is the inhibition of regulatory T-cell (Treg) expansion. This depends on the mAb effector functions 45 and occurs rapidly. Moreover, it is necessary for the development of the protective humoral and cellular responses, as Treg-mediated immunosuppression is observed in all cases of chronic viral infections, where it dampens antiviral immune responses, thereby permitting the establishment of chronicity. Finally, breastfeeding and placental transfer of maternal anti-FrCasE Igs induced by mAb immunotherapy not only led to the viral propagation blunting in infected pups, but also to the induction of long-lasting protective humoral immunity in these animals. 42 This is a particularly interesting observation when one considers that the FrCasE model is reminiscent of perinatal infection by HIV, including breastfeeding-mediated mother-to-child virus transmission.",17.488522377774725,9.79931185892022

It is well known that certified cells for vaccine or gene therapeutic production such as certified Vero and MDCK cells have defects in their immune defense, e.g. low type I IFN secretion. Immunity can be subverted by autophagy primarily through three mechanisms, i.e. removing endogenous inflammasome agonists [139] , degrading immune mediators such as IRF3 [140] , and inhibiting type I IFN response via inducing mitophagy [141] . Immunity can be prohibited by apoptosis as apoptotic cells induce immunological tolerance [142] . Immunity can be initiated and modulated by lipids given the unique roles of lipid droplets in maintaining cellular mass homeostasis [143] . The two adaptations on cell housekeeping physiology programs, cell cycle alteration and lipid metabolic reprogramming, can be modulated in either way by viruses to create a favorable environment for their replication. Cell cycle arrest at G2/M, G1/S, or G0/G1, or promotion to the S phase is a common feature during the infection of many viruses. The consequences of cell cycle alteration can be very diverse including, e.g. maintaining a replicative state, preventing the passage of damaged DNA to daughter cells, initiating DNA damage repair and/or suppressing immune response. Such a process is typically associated with cell survival programs and regulated by pRB and TP53-mediated signalings [144] ; Cell cycle arrest may lead to less immune response due to reduced cell production [145] . Lipid metabolic reprogramming avails in almost all stages of virus infection, i.e. from initial entry, till replication and assembly, to progeny egress. Lipid droplet, as an energy source, could be produced via cell survival programs to fuel viral production. Autophagy can regulate lipogenesis through modulating the degradation of triglycerides accumulated in cytosolic lipid droplets. Released fatty acids are imported to mitochondria where they undergo β-oxidation to produce ATP for viral replication [146] . Apoptosis is typically accompanied with rapid accumulation of cytoplasmic lipid droplets, by diverting fatty acids away from oxidation to de novo lipogenesis [147] .",17.536879779938616,9.105017400498504

The RV-based MERS-CoV vaccine platform can rapidly induce antibody immune response and higher cellular immune response than the GEM-based vaccine platform. However, there is a risk of incomplete inactivation in the process of inactivating the RV/MERS. Additionally, RV/MERS vaccine needs to be purified through many purification steps. These factors must be considered in vaccine production. Antigen protein density and distribution on a particle are two key parameters in eliciting an efficient immune response in vaccine design; a high density and ordered antigenic array displayed on a particle makes binding events between the host B-cell surface immunoglobulins and the particle occur more easily, which is an important step in inducing sequential immune response [47] . The GEM-based vaccine platform could display antigen protein in a high density, while the RV-based vaccine platform not only displayed the antigen protein but also expressed the RV GP protein. This may be why the GEM-based vaccine of MERS-CoV induces a much stronger humoral immune response in mice than that of the RV-based vaccine. Micro-particles could promote a humoral immune response, and nano-particles are much easier to induce a cellular immune response [48, 49] . The size of the RV/MERS virion is about 167 nm, and the diameter of the MERS BLP particles is about 2161 nm. This may be a critical factor in inducing a different cellular immune response by two different vectors of vaccine platforms. Specific molecules of microbial origin, as intrinsic innate immune triggers, are endowed with adjuvant activity, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), bacterial lipopeptides, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), ribonucleic acid (RNA), and other conserved molecules [50] . The receptors for these molecules are the mammalian Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Members of the TLRs have been confirmed on the cell surface membrane (TLR1/2/4/5/6/10) and on the membrane of endosomes (TLR3/7/8/9) [51] . Peptidoglycan, the main component of the GEM particles, is a TLR 2 ligand which is an activation of TLR-2 receptors in human peripheralblood mononuclear cells inducing a Th1-type immune response [52] . Single stranded RNA, the component of inactivated rabies virus, is a TLR 7 ligand [51, 53] . TLR7/8 agonists have shown Th1 polarizing effects on the immune response. Different receptors play an important role in delivering different signals to the host cells. The activated antigen presenting cells (APCs) precisely define the nature of the perceived danger and send this information to the secondary lymphoid organs, inducing relevant adaptive immune response. This may be another ignored factor of inducing a different immune response by the immune system thinking that the danger is from a virus infection or a bacterial infection. The immune system is triggered by a combination of events and stimuli in vaccine immunology. The compound adjuvants containing the emulsion and PolyI:C (TLR 3 ligand) may be another assignable cause. The speed of the antibodies' production and cellular immune response needs to be further improved in future study of the GEM-based vaccine platform. To solve the problems, we can try to screen optimum adjuvants for the vaccine or co-displaying protein-adjuvants on GEM particles, such as flagellin (TLR 5 ligand). Furthermore, the GEM-based vaccine platform may be more suitable to develop mucosal vaccines considering that Lactococcus lactis has been safely used as a probiotic in our foods. Understanding the modes of action of the GEM-based vaccine platform will allow us to design a much safer, cost-effective, and protective vaccine with the desired immune response.",18.342003871657568,11.951546006779214

Examination of immune responses elicited by ANDV (pathogenic in hamsters) and SNV (non-pathogenic in hamsters) showed that passaged SNV evoked a stronger adaptive immune response than did ANDV; however, ANDV infection induced a much stronger innate immune response at late time points, despite both viruses replicating to similar levels. Depletion of T cells did not alter the outcome of infection [74, 86] ; thus, these data suggest that, at least in the hamster model, the activation of the T cell-mediated immune response is not responsible for immunopathogenesis, and perhaps the innate immune response, either elicited from infected endothelial cells, macrophages and/or neutrophils, might contribute to disease.",17.978864633494446,10.101886617351413

There appears to be several ways that these viruses evade and otherwise redirect the immune response [1, [42] [43] [44] [45] . The pathways that lead to the induction of the antiviral type I interferon (IFN) response are common targets of many viruses, and coronaviruses are no exception. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are contained in double membrane vesicles (DMVs), that prevents sensing of its genome [1, 46] . As with most coronaviruses several viral proteins suppress the type I IFN response, and other aspects of innate antiviral immunity [47] . These alterations of the type I IFN response appear to play a role in immunopathology in more than one way. In patients with high initial viral titers there is a poor prognosis [39, 48] . This indicates that reduction of the antiviral response may lead to direct viral-induced pathology. There is also evidence that the delayed type I IFN response can lead to misregulation of the immune response that can cause immunopathology. In a mouse model of SARS-CoV infection, the type I IFN response is delayed [49] . The delay of this potent antiviral response leads to decreased viral clearance, at the same time there is an increase in inflammatory cells of the immune system that cause excessive immunopathology [49] . In this case, the delayed antiviral response not only causes immunopathology, it also fails to properly control the viral replication. While more research is needed, it appears that MERS has a similar effect on the innate immune response [5, 50] .",19.96752207212468,12.258272527222703

The trajectory of adult worm numbers in the T. colubriformis mono-infected sheep shows a classic convex age-intensity curve, indicative of host immune responses removing adult worms [30, 40, 41] . In the co-infection treatment group the number of worms reached an asymptote, suggesting that adult worms were not being removed by the host immune response. There was, however, some evidence of a reduction in the larval establishment in this co-infection group (though less than in the mono-infected group), probably indicating that an anti-T. colubriformis response was beginning to develop. This is consistent with previous studies that have shown the anti-T. colubriformis immune response acts first against incoming larvae [42] . As we hypothesized, the difference in the number of T. colubriformis adults between co-infection and mono-infection groups appears to be immune-mediated. Our data demonstrate that there was a reduced immune response in the jejunum in the co-infected animals, compared to the T. colubriformis mono-infected animals, and most pronounced in the latter time points (weeks 14 and 18 post-initial infection; figures 3 and 4 and electronic supplementary material, S7). This differentiation between the infection groups suggests that the immune suppression we observe is dependent on the adult H. contortus (since by week 14 all larvae would have developed to adulthood or arrested their development). We use the presented immune measures as general indicators of anti-helminth immune responses, rather than implicating individual immune components.

The cellular immunity is needed to clear the infection, whereas the humoral immune response (antibody mediated) is required for protection from initial and subsequent RSV infections. During the 1960s, vaccinations performed with FI-RSV suggested that FI-RSV immunization leads to a predominant Th2 type allergic response. Whereas wild type RSV activates T helper type 1 (Th1) skewed immune providing protection against RSV disease [1] . Thus, the Th1 type immune response is desired for protection against natural RSV infections. To understand the mechanism and type of immune responses for FI-RSV immunizations, different animal models such as monkeys [29] , bovine [30] , mice [31] , and cotton rats [23, 32] were tested. All models challenged with wt RSV following the immunization with FI-RSV stimulated the Th2 type allergic response [23] [24] [25] [29] [30] [31] [32] . In contrast, animals immunized and challenged with wt RSV developed Th1 type antibody protection against RSV. Likewise, natural RSV infection produces a Th1 mediated immune response against RSV. However, the most desirable immunity against any kind of pathogen is a balanced Th1/Th2 response. Even though the exact mechanism of FI-RSV mediated enhanced disease was not fully understood, Murphy et al. suggested that formalin treatment altered the protective epitopes of F and G proteins and failed to produce neutralizing antibodies against real RSV infections. They also reported that the sera from FI-RSV immunized recipients did not neutralize RSV in vitro due to the lack of RSV specific neutralizing antibodies compared to the sera from wt RSV immunized recipients [23] . Consequently, the native form of RSV F is required to produce neutralizing antibodies and provide immunization against RSV infections. DNA vaccines are thought to be more advantageous due to the processing of antigens in their native forms by eukaryotic cells and due to the efficient presentation of antigens to antigen presenting cells. Thus, antibodies produced against the recombinant antigen expressed in the target host would easily recognize native nondenatured proteins of the pathogen and provide more efficient and specific protection against real pathogens compared to the recombinant protein vaccines expressed in bacteria [33] . In a previous study, we developed a DNA vaccine containing a region of RSV F (412-524 amino acids) conjugated with a modified cholera toxin gene and used to immunize mice which resulted in higher immune response [24] .",17.883532395585274,10.548299780208232

Several factors influence the clinical outcome of COPD. Importantly, the crosstalk between intrinsic factors (the stability and integrity of the airway immune response and structure in addition to hereditary factors), and the extrinsic factors (lung microbiome, viral and bacterial infections, meteorological factors, and noxious inhalation) determines the fate of lower airway opportunistic infection by H. influenzae. Intriguingly, NTHi has been one of the most isolated pathogens at both stable and exacerbation states of COPD. Such persistent airway colonization of NTHi costs virulence fitness to counteract with the bactericidal effect of the host immune response. Adversely, the impaired defense mechanisms in COPD are not only unable to protect the lung structure from inhaled physical assaults, but they also fail to suppress NTHi infection. The disoriented immune response in COPD instead allows the pathogen to cause more harm and inflammation in the airways. The currently used bronchodilator and inhaled corticosteroid therapies have limited efficacy in preventing disease progression in COPD. Moreover, the inhaled corticosteroid therapies might have side effects that may weaken the immune response. Hence, more investigations are needed to garner a more adequate knowledge regarding the variabilities in immune networking of COPD. This knowledge will be an important platform for a more efficient drug design. In addition, a vaccine targeting NTHi is another important approach in controlling the infective exacerbations in COPD as the antibiotic treatment is also getting dampened by the emergence of NTHi antibiotic resistance.",16.51624756328801,8.937189358923723

This was demonstrated by a reduced capacity to produce IFN-γ in response to NTHi (42) . Importantly, this compromised cell-mediated immune response was strongly associated with airway inflammation, specifically, elevated levels of IL-1β and IL-6 (16), indicating a possible link between localized inflammation and systemic adaptive immunity. The mechanisms driving the association between airway inflammation and NTHi-driven IFN-γ in children with bronchiectasis have not been determined. However, IL-1β and IL-6 are integral to the initiation and phenotype of the adaptive immune response. IL-1β drives the inflammatory cascade by localizing neutrophils and promoting the production of inflammatory modulators such as IL-6 and IFN-γ-inducible protein 10 (IP-10; CXCL10). IL-6 plays a complex role in the inflammatory response, from promoting inflammation to wound healing. Dysregulation of IL-6 pathways is associated with chronic inflammation (46) . In addition to its inflammatory modulating properties, IL-6 is integral to initiating the adaptive response and in directing its primary phenotype. In the lung, IL-6 polarizes the adaptive immune response in favor of the humoral response by inhibiting IL-12 production (47, 48) and by promoting the differentiation of B-cells into antibody-producing plasma cells (49) . These data suggest that IL-6 and IL-1β may be more than simply markers of inflammation, but rather indicative of suboptimal T-helper pathways that result in impaired clearance mechanisms and persistent infection. Collectively these data support an association between impaired cell-mediated immune responses to NTHi, dysregulated airway inflammation, and the pathogenesis of bronchiectasis in children. These data in children complement extensive studies of NTHispecific immune responses in adults (43, 44) to show that a Th1 polarized cell-mediated immune response contributes to protective immunity against NTHi. In these studies, King and colleagues showed that circulating CD4+ T-helper cells from healthy adults responded to an in vitro NTHi challenge with increased expression of IL-2 and IFN-γ, in a predominantly classic Th1 manner. In contrast, the cytokine response from adults with bronchiectasis and chronic NTHi infection was polarized in favor of IL-4 and IL-10 and complemented by low expression of IL-2 and IFN-γ.",18.38393220818105,11.995464310354212

It is generally thought that a virus must either avoid or evade an adaptive immune response to persist within a vertebrate host. The role of innate immunity in preventing viral persistence, apart from its role in initiating an adaptive response, is not completely understood. Type I interferon (IFN) is a cytokine with pleiotropic roles in the antiviral response, including innate control of viral replication. Murine norovirus (MNoV) replicates in cells of the innate immune system, including dendritic cells (DCs), and IFN signaling in DCs is important for early control of MNoV replication. We found here that MNoV persists when DCs are unable to respond to type I IFN. MNoV persistence is correlated with increased adaptive immune responses, likely reflective of increased early viral replication. MNoV also persists in chimeric mice with a 50% mix of wildtype and type I IFN receptor deficient DCs, consistent with a cell-intrinsic role for IFN responses in preventing MNoV persistence. These findings demonstrate that an innate immune deficiency can result in viral persistence apart from its role in generating an adaptive immune response.",19.418080650542276,11.521600561311775

The results of T subsets showed that the vaccination of the groups containing SPP (especially 30 mg/mL SPP) may lead to the polarization of cell responses within 7 days. These findings indicate that the SPP could significantly enhance cellular immunity, which in turn could activate the antibody response. The SPP exhibit an immunity adjustment function by affecting T and B lymphocyte multiplication.

The mechanism by which NiV VLPs are recognized by host cells and trigger the induction of innate immune response, and how this translates into effective adaptive immunity is not known. Here we have taken the first step ( Figure 6 ) towards understanding this process. With the experimental conditions as described, we observed VLP-induced activation of some of the genes that are known to be involved in the induction of an effective innate immune response [75] . Results presented in the heat map in Figure 6 show that relative to the ''mock'' treated cells, NFKB2 gene (in the NFKB pathway) was up-regulated 89 fold as a result of VLP exposure, and TBK1 (in the IRF pathway) was 7 fold higher. In the light of these findings, we are testing PCR array expression profiles of the same set of 84 genes in 293 and other cells at earlier and later time points to identify their upstream effectors, and NiV VLP-responsive signaling networks. In this respect, the murine system, with the many available immunological reagents and knockout strains may provide the best system to identify these host sensors. Currently there is minimal information on live NiV infection-responsive cellsignaling changes [76] and there is none on array-based transcriptional alterations for comparative analysis. Likewise, it has not been possible to compare the NiV VLP-induced transcription modulation with those induced by other paramyxovirus VLPs since to our knowledge, such studies have not been undertaken so far. Lastly, a growing number of reports point to viral surface glycolproteins as relevant in host cell signaling and triggering of innate immune response.

However, current parenteral immunization modalities generally fail to induce mucosal immunity, while mucosal vaccine delivery often results in poor systemic immunity. In order to find an immunization strategy which satisfies the need for induction of both mucosal and systemic immunity, we compared local and systemic immune responses elicited by two mucosal immunizations, given either by the intranasal (IN) or the intrapulmonary (IPL) route, with responses elicited by a mucosal prime followed by a systemic boost immunization. The study was conducted in BALB/c mice and the vaccine formulation was an influenza subunit vaccine supplemented with GPI-0100, a saponin-derived adjuvant. While optimal mucosal antibody titers were obtained after two intrapulmonary vaccinations, optimal systemic antibody responses were achieved by intranasal prime followed by intramuscular boost. The latter strategy also resulted in the best T cell response, yet, it was ineffective in inducing nose or lung IgA. Successful induction of secretory IgA, IgG and T cell responses was only achieved with prime-boost strategies involving intrapulmonary immunization and was optimal when both immunizations were given via the intrapulmonary route.

Innate memory, also referred to as trained immunity, is a multifaceted response. A recent component of trained immunity involves its modulation of hematopoiesis [154] . Although myeloid cells have a short lifespan in circulation, the administration of the agonist ß-glucan resulted in myeloid progenitor expansion and subsequent improved responses to a secondary challenge with the agonist LPS. Trained immunity was able to reduce myelosuppression from chemotherapy, and was associated with metabolic shifts in cholesterol biosynthesis and glucose metabolism [154] . Other benefits of innate myeloid memory have been elegantly reviewed by Netea and colleagues [155] . In brief, monocytes are influenced by vaccination and viral infections, and are more responsive upon re-challenge. This innate memory response helps mitigate pathogens via upregulated cytokine production and enhanced pathogen elimination response times. This exciting new field may allow vaccines to be optimized for viruses by targeting the innate memory response.",18.575988420400133,9.112729760998079

Neibergs 6 , Bovine Respiratory Disease Complex Coordinated Agricultural Project Research Team","The common pathways underlying response to two or more of the challenge organisms include pathways with major roles in innate immunity that are less pathogen-specific. For example, we found the toll-like receptor pathway and MAPK signaling which are responsible for the phosphorylation and activation of kinases which regulate cytokine production [33] , TGF-beta signaling, which functions in cytokine regulation [34] and natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity whereby populations of lymphocytes are activated to cytotoxicity via the production of cytokines and chemokines [35] . The cytokine and chemokine-related pathways were all up-regulated in the challenged animals. Cytokines and chemokines have important functions in the innate and adaptive immune systems. The production of cytokines by innate immune cells occurs as an acute response to inflammation and infection across diverse etiologies. The release of cytokines and chemokines orchestrates immune responses through communication with other cells. For the immune response to efficiently function, the synthesis and release of cytokines must be controlled [36] and the pathways enriched for DE genes detected in our analyses of these data are involved in this process. It is important to note that cytokines underlying the control of viral immunity differ from those that are most relevant to anti-bacterial defense. For example, an effective immune response to BRSV, IBR and BVDV requires the development of cytotoxic T cells, which are critical for the elimination of virus infected cells. Production of interleukin 12 and interferon gamma by T helper type 1 cells facilitates the priming of CD8 cytotoxic T cells. Whereas, in humoral immunity, antibody production is associated with interleukin 4 expression and interleukin 17 stimulates a neutrophil response in the defense against many bacterial pathogens [37] .",18.4458791911087,7.645487464946363

The threshold of immune response is determined by many factors including environmental factors, genetics, diet, stress, age, and even preceding inflammatory events. Thus, the threshold is varied between different individuals and even in different parts of the same individual (Shekhar et al., 2017; Snelgrove et al., 2011; Wissinger et al., 2009) . The condition of the lungs demands the threshold of immune response higher to avoid overmuch and excessive inflammatory response. To achieve this purpose, the lungs execute multiple site-specific immune regulatory strategies to restrain inflammation. For example, compared with macrophages from other parts of body, alveolar macrophages, which are dominated in airway (>95%), express lower levels of MHC Class II and costimulatory molecules and display a suppressive phenotype by secreting interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) (Thepen et al., 1994) ; airway epithelial cells secrete high levels of TGF-β, IL-10 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to limit DC responsiveness and alveolar macrophage activation (Li and Flavell, 2008) ; pattern recognition receptors, especially Toll-like receptors, play a critical role in activating the innate immune response and subsequent adaptive immune response. Studies found that although TLR4 molecules are constitutively expressed in human alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells, they mainly express intracellularly rather than on the cell surface (Guillot et al., 2004) .",16.881494921648596,11.233258542191418

Activated Th cells recruit other naive Th cells, T c cells and B cells, providing signals necessary to amplify the immune response against the target antigen. Th cells also initiate the development of memory B and T cells to provide long-lasting immunity against the antigen upon subsequent exposure. Small, synthetic peptides designed to induce a humoral or cell-mediated immune response usually do not contain an appropriate Th-cell epitope and therefore are not always effective vaccines by themselves.

When the PRRs on DCs are stimulated, immature DCs participate in the innate immune response by releasing various soluble mediators, such as inflammatory cytokines and type I interferon (IFN) [42] . Immature DCs reside in both peripheral tissues and in the lymphoid tissues [42] . DCs that reside in the peripheral tissues migrate to regional lymph nodes upon activation. After activation, DCs initiate an adaptive and antigen-specific immune response by processing antigens and presenting them to naive T cells in the lymph nodes [43] . At the same time, DCs upregulate MHC class II and costimulatory molecules, promoting interactions between DCs and T cells [44] . Stimulating DCs shapes adaptive immunity by controlling the type, quality and magnitude of the immune response and memory. The balance between inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine production in DCs, such as IL-12 and IL-10, respectively, is crucial in determining the type of Th-cell response. For example, IL-12 drives polarization of Th cells towards a Th1 response, which favors stimulating T c cells, and mediates immunity to most pathogens [45] , notably intracellular pathogens [46, 47] . IL-10, on the other hand, has a regulatory role and can mediate a Th2 response, which leads to humoral immunity and anti-inflammatory pathways [48, 49] .",19.124124930580425,10.561270282862573

At the same time, L-theanine directly reduces the expression of mRNA of TLRs (TLR-2, TLR-4), and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-2) as observed in this study. Earlier reports have also demonstrated this ability of L-theanine to inhibit stress-induced inflammatory response by decreasing serum TNF-α and IL-1β levels in mice (Jiang et al., 2012) . Moreover, it was also observed that L-theanine is potentially responsible for downregulation of cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) along with improving the anti-oxidant ability of cells affected by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) toxicity. Theanine is not an anti-oxidant but enhances the activity of anti-oxidant enzyme activities and increases the concentration of glutathione (GSH). Many studies have shown favorable role of L-theanine on immune system as revealed by epidemiological studies and experiments on cell cultures, animals and humans (Kim et al., 2008; Chattopadhyay et al., 2011; D'Arena et al., 2013; Kuo et al., 2014; Huijun wang et al., 2014) . After oral intake of L-theanine, it is absorbed in blood through the gut and hydrolyzes in glutamic acid and ethylamine in liver and intestine (Tsuge et al., 2003; Scheid et al., 2012) . This ethylamine is capable of the proliferation of γδ T lymphocytes that are subsets of T-cells and act as the first line of defense in case of pathogenic attack as reported in a clinical study (Rowe et al., 2007) . So these potential effects of L-theanine by enhancing proliferation of T lymphocytes while decreasing expression of pro-inflammatory response mediate immune response effectively. Results revealed that L-theanine-mediated growth and immune response in broiler by modulation of intestinal microbiome that ultimately influences better nutrient utilization and metabolism along with positively influencing intestinal immunity. This mediation of intestinal microbiome was also coupled with the reduction of pathogenic bacteria in gut and regulation of expression of inflammatory cytokines and TLRs in the intestine that provided two-fold responses in terms of growth and immune response. However, further studies are required to explore the mechanism of modulation of intestinal microbiota and T lymphocyte-mediated immune response in chicken by L-theanine.

As a consequence of adaptive immune memory, if an infectious agent makes a second attempt to infect a host, pathogenspecific memory T cells, memory B cells, and antibodies will mount a secondary immune response that is much more rapid and intense than the initial, primary response and, thus, better able to inhibit infection and disease. Immune memory is the basis for the use of vaccines that are given in an attempt to stimulate an individual's adaptive immune system to generate pathogen-specific immune memory. Of note, in some cases the response of the immune system to an infectious agent can contribute to disease progress. For example, immunopathology is thought to be responsible for the severe acute disease that can occur following infection with a dengue virus that is serotypically distinct from that causing initial dengue infection (Screaton et al., 2015) . An immune host is someone protected against a specific pathogen (because of previous infection or vaccination) such that subsequent infection will not take place or, if infection does occur, the severity of disease is diminished. The duration and efficacy of immunity following immunization by natural infection or vaccination varies depending upon the infecting agent, quality of the vaccine, type of vaccine (i.e., live or inactivated virus, subunit, etc.), and ability of the host to generate an immune response. For example, a single yellow fever vaccination appears to confer lifelong immunity, whereas immune protection against tetanus requires repeat vaccination every 10 years (Staples et al., 2015; Broder et al., 2006) . In malariaendemic areas, natural immunity to malaria usually develops by 5 years of age and, while protective from severe disease and death, it is incomplete and short-lived (Langhorne et al., 2008) .",18.86216623822214,9.395125831502444

They lack important features commonly present in pathogens like lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or unmethylated CpG-containing-DNA that are able to activate the innate immune system and shape the adaptive immune response. For toxicity reasons, whole killed or attenuated pathogens cannot be used in many cases. Adjuvants are then needed to increase the immunogenicity of the subunit vaccines.

For the most part, vaccines have relied upon serum responses, although there are good examples of successful oral vaccines (i.e., vaccine against polio virus).

Some of these factors are contributors to a shift toward the humoralmediated immune response, as well as a blunted immune response. In addition to the immaturity of the immune system, maternal antibody interferes with endogenous production of immunoglobulins, as well as response to vaccine antigens until 6 to 16 weeks of age. The immune response of puppies and kittens will always be variable due to differences in immune development, maternal antibody, antigen load, or route of vaccination. Taking into account differences in the immune system of the neonatal puppy or kitten will help determine future vaccination guidelines. Further characterization of the predominant immune system in neonates may be beneficial for developing new vaccinations to promote a balanced immune response.

While this topic has been the subject of recent reviews in Immunological Reviews, Wilks and colleagues (45) focus their article on the impact of commensal bacteria on the host response to virus infection, as exemplified by the impact all of antibiotic treatment on IAV pathogenesis and the host adaptive response to the virus (46, 47) .

While neutralizing antibodies produced by B cells are commonly viewed as the crucial component of protective immunity, T-cell responses are also essential. 4 Because many studies assessing the impact of psychosocial factors on the immune response to vaccines have involved influenza vaccination, the immune response to influenza and the influenza vaccine is outlined here. It should be noted, however, that the immune response is similar to other types of inactivated vaccines. Respiratory epithelial cells are the primary target for influenza virus. 5, 6 On infection, these cells produce chemokines and cytokines to recruit and activate cells of the innate immune system. The innate immune cells, primarily macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), are then responsible for initiating the adaptive immune response. This response occurs when the macrophages and DCs phagocytose and degrade the virus so that viral antigen can be expressed along with major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) or MHCII. The macrophages and DCs migrate to draining lymph nodes where they come into contact with T cells. Viral antigen presentation in the context of MHC, along with recognition of costimulatory cues, causes virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to clonally expand in the lymph nodes. These antigen-specific T cells can then leave the lymph node and traffic back to the site of infection to eradicate virally infected cells. Although most of these effector T cells will undergo apoptosis when the virus is eradicated, a fraction of these cells become long-lived memory cells. 5 On reinfection, the virus-specific memory T cells that were generated from the primary infection will begin to reactivate. Effector memory T cells, which are characterized by their shortened telomeres and lack of CD62L, CD27, and CCR7, are the first responders to antigen. 7,8 T cells can quickly enter nonlymphoid tissue and begin responding to the viral infection. Central memory T cells, on the other hand, do express the adhesion molecules CD62L, CD27, and CCR7 on their surface, and as a result are able to quickly move to lymphoid tissues where their specific antigen is present. 7, 8 Here they undergo clonal expansion before migrating to the infected peripheral tissue.",19.276030935127793,12.21708049282207

Similar differences are evident with animal stressors, and a study by Powell and colleagues 56 showed that DCs from mice exposed to a repeated social stressor have an increase in costimulatory molecules important for CD8+ T-cell activation (eg, CD80, MHCI, CD44) on their cell surface and secrete an increased amount of inflammatory cytokines in response to in vitro stimulation of Toll-like receptors. Repeated exposure to social stress has also been shown to enhance the adaptive response to influenza virus infection, by increasing the number of antigen-specific memory CD8+ T cells that are critical for establishing virus-specific immunologic memory. 57 Together, these studies suggest that the stressor enhanced the ability of the DCs to process antigen and stimulate adaptive immunity. Although it is not completely clear why this stressor would enhance, rather than suppress, DC activity, it was shown that exposure to the social stressor caused the DC to be resistant to the suppressive effects of CORT. 56 These studies indicate that when determining the impact of stressor-induced hormones on adaptive immunity, a crucial mediating factor is the impact that the hormones have on antigenpresenting cells.

However, in NYVAC/MVA combination strategies, initial priming with the NYVAC recombinant followed by the MVA recombinant gave the broadest cellular immune response. By contrast, the weaker response of the NYVAC recombinant as a booster immunogen may reflect anti-vector immunity elicited by the significantly smaller MVA vector. In this case, the immune response would be focused on a smaller number of common genes present in both NYVAC and MVA, leading to greater inhibition of the NYVAC booster immunogen.

When the alveolar epithelium becomes infected, infected cells alert other cells and organs to the infection by secreting cytokines and chemokines. The infected epithelial cells are likely the first responders, and initiate the innate immune response. The earliest response of human alveolar type II cells to influenza virus infection involves the expression of interferon and interferon-responsive genes (40) . Presumably this interferon response increases the resistance of neighboring cells to infection. The next phase of the innate immune response involves the expression of cytokines, which can both attract and activate immune cells and stimulate neighboring cells to amplify the defensive response greatly by secreting additional cytokines and chemokines.

Furthermore, human alphavirus epidemics occur very infrequently. This suggests that the general population will have little pre-existing vector immunity against an alphavirus-based vaccine vector. However, it was suggested early on that in horses, pre-existing antibodies against one strain of alphavirus can interfere with infection from other alphavirus strains ( Calisher et al., 1973 ) . This could pose problems for repeated vaccination in humans using alphavirus replicons. For example, antivector immunity generated after vaccination with a VEE replicon could subsequently impede booster vaccination with the same or even a different alphavirus replicon. Indeed, there is evidence in humans that the immune response generated from vaccination with one alphavirus can interfere with the immune response generated from subsequent vaccinations with different alphaviruses ( McClain et al., 1998 ) .",19.437484968779785,10.86857195712865

Early animal vaccines such as for Foot and Mouth Disease Virus were mixtures of virus antigen and immune sera and were developed followed the observation that, while passive transfer of an immune serum would provide a short window of immunity, the use of a serum mixed with live virus provided long lasting immunity (Lombard et al. 2007 ) . Even today, the principle continues to be used in new animal vaccine development, to provide a stronger immune response to a standard dose of vaccine antigen, to overcome the infectivity that remains in an attenuated virus preparation or to overcome existing immunity, for example maternal immunity (Haddad et al. 1997 ; Jeurissen et al. 1998 ) . In man too, the use of ICs has been shown to be bene fi cial. Treatment of chronically infected Hepatitis B patients with Hepatitis B surface antigen complexed with immunoglobulins was suf fi cient to boost immunity (Wen et al. 1999 ) . Immune complexes have also been shown to overcome the problem of pre-existing immunity that limits the therapeutic use of adenovirus expression vectors, through the purposeful generation of adenovirusantibody complexes which then target immune processing cells in preference to the normal target of Coxsackie Adenovirus Receptor (CAR) bearing cells (Leopold et al. 2006 ) . In all these cases, the formation of an immune complex, through the incubation of antigen and antibody, effectively decorates the antigen with the crystallizable fragment (Fc) of the immunoglobulin heavy chain and thereby enables its interaction with Fc receptors (FcR) present on antigen presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells (DCs) . Once targeted in this way, the antigen is ef fi ciently taken up and processed by APCs and the subsequent adaptive immune response is accelerated and intensi fi ed ( Fig. 3.1 ). Both the major histocompatibility processing pathways, that is Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I and MHC class II, are active in APCs with the relative split between their activity associated broadly with the processing of either endogenous (e.g. virus) or exogenous (e.g. bacteria) antigens which are also recognized by various pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) within the processing cell. In general endogenous antigens processed by the MHC class I pathway activate CD8 + T cells while exogenous antigens are processed by MHC class II to activate CD4 + T cells. However, both processing pathways co-exist in APCs and some exogenous antigens can also be ""cross presented"" on MHC class I, especially those capable of binding FcRs on DCs (Regnault et al. 1999 ) . Delivery of an antigen to APCs, particularly DCs, via an IC is therefore an effective ""one stop shop"" to ef fi cient presentation to the immune system irrespective of the nature of the immunogen and is capable of stimulating the response by 100-10,000 fold when compared to antigen alone (Kunkl and Klaus 1981 ; Ma et al. 2005 ; Obregon et al. 2006 ) .",16.717997125321723,10.187148040569756

It seems that during HIV-1 infection, the immune response is mostly directed against highly variable and accessible Env regions such as the V1, V2 and V3 loops rather than against functionally important but less accessible conserved domains such as the receptor and co-receptor binding sites. The propensity of the immune system to respond to immunodominant, strainspecific highly variable antigenic sites instead of to subdominant conserved epitopes that are able in principle to Requirements for empirical immunogenicity trials 11 elicit a more broadly protective immunity, has been called deceptive imprinting because it allows the virus to escape immune pressure [190] . Attempts to overcome deceptive imprinting by redirecting the immune response to less strain-specific epitopes have been made using a strategy called immune refocusing. By introducing several new glycosylation sites into the V1 and V3 loops, it was possible for instance to obtain immunogens that induced a broader neutralization response that was effective against heterologous strains [191] . Some of the reported immunization results, however, are difficult to interpret because linear instead of cyclized loop peptides were used in inhibition experiments aimed at determining the specificity of the induced antibodies. Attempts have also been made to redirect the immune response to conserved neutralization epitopes by deleting some or most of the variable loops from Env, but the results were not satisfactory [192, 193] . Other approaches to overcome the problem of extensive antigenic variability include using as immunogen either artificial consensus sequences based on the most common amino acid in each position in an alignment [194, 195] , or alternatively combinatorial convergent peptide libraries consisting of thousands of V3 peptides known as mixotopes that are recognized as a single entity by immune receptors [196] . Other strategies to deal with the existence of many antigenic variants by means of polyvalent vaccine cocktails have also been proposed [197] . Recent results have shown that the V3 loop may, in fact, be able to induce a neutralizing response against many different HIV-1 clades, indicating that a polyclonal response to V3 may have a much greater neutralizing breadth than that displayed by any single Mab or even a cocktail of Mabs [17, 173, 198] .",16.986676870723684,8.78247804306849

Although a single epitope is able to induce a strong immune response, it appears usually insufficient to induce protective immunity. The in vitro synthesized peptide properly representing the main antigenic determinant of the pathogen is highly likely not to be itself a strong immunogene primarily because of its small size (<10 nm) and high risk of proteolytic degradation. This problem may be overcome by the use of nanoparticles. It has been shown in a considerable number of works that in order to induce a strong immune response, antigenic determinants should be exposed on the surface of nanoparticles whose shape and size (20-150 nm) mimic those of the virus (Fig. 1) . In this respect also, VLPs, the nanoparticles composed by viral proteins capable of self-assembly (multimerization) into structures morphologically resembling viruses, are the choice selection for the role of a strong immunogene. Antigenic determinants multiply repeatedly on the VLP surface and promote complement fixation and B-lymphocyte receptor clusterization leading to the activation of the immune response. Additionally, the same antigen multiply displayed on the surface of the particle promotes the multiplication of the pool of autoreactive B-cells, which is the primary objective when designing vaccines against autoimmune diseases and tumors [29] .",19.49031164583839,12.342831166764567

Since the first smallpox vaccine by Jenner, numerous different approaches for vaccination have been developed. Traditionally vaccine formulations are divided in two major classes, live and inactivated (Table 1) . Live vaccines contain attenuated or non-pathogenic strain of a pathogen or an expression vector. Such a vaccine is unable to induce disease but is able to induce suitable immunity; over-attenuation is a potential risk a vaccine scientist has to be aware of. It is the challenge for the vaccine developer to find the right balance between the virulence of the vaccine virus and its ability to replicate sufficiently in order to induce immunity. Attenuation can be achieved by many different ways (some examples are given in Table 1 ). For this, approaches used have been passaging of a pathogen in cell cultures, derivation and/or isolation of temperature sensitive mutants, which are restricted for significant replication in internal body organs. The use of related apathogenic strain by Jenner is yet another example. More modern methodology would involve the use of molecular biological techniques to remove virulence genes from a pathogen or to engineer non-pathogenic, replicating agents to express immunity inducing antigenic epitopes of a pathogen. Replication-defective vectors have also been developed as safe effective vaccines for some viral diseases. Live vaccines generally induce both Th1 and Th2 immune response and have been used in situations where antibody responses are not correlated with protection or where existing circulating antibody interferes with the induction of immunological response; interference due to maternally derived antibody (MDA) in un-weaned host is a common problem, particularly for killed vaccines administered parenterally. For many viral diseases, killed or inactivated vaccines have been widely used as a safe option. Killed vaccines generally induce humoral immune responses and often require the use of adjuvants to boost the immune response. Adjuvants can play a major role in the direction of the immune response. Aluminium hydroxide for instance is a strong inducer of humoral immune responses, whereas others such as saponins and derivatives may induce cellular responses as well [ [2] , and references therein]. As is the case with live vaccines, different inactivated vaccine formulations are known, such as inactivated whole virus vaccines, subunit vaccines, peptide vaccines, and split virion vaccines.",17.74315169536641,10.385333036176858

Up to 80% of the general population is seropositive for JCV and JCV-specific cellular immune response is necessary for containment of viral proliferation. The mechanism of JCV reactivation and immunity in a transplanted immune system remains unclear. Methods: We prospectively enrolled 30 patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT, and collected blood and urine samples before and 3, 6, and 12 months after HSCT. We detected JCV DNA by PCR in blood and urine samples, performed ELISA for detection of JCV IgM and IgG, as well as Elispot and ICS for measurement of T-cells responses to JCV. Multivariate analysis accounted for conditioning regimens, cancer diagnosis, concurrent viremia, age, and transplant type. Results: Pre HSCT, JCV DNA was detected in 7/30 urine, 5/ 30 PBMC and 6/30 plasma samples. While viruria remained stable after HSCT, viremia was detected in only 1/22 plasma and none of 22 PBMC samples 12 months after HSCT. Prevalence of anti-JCV IgG was 83% pre HSCT and remained stable at 72% at 12 months. Anti-JCV IgM was rarely detected. A significant increase in JCV-specific T cell responses 12 months after HSCT was mediated by both CD4+ and CD8+ Tcells. While JC viruria correlated directly with detection of anti-JCV IgG, the cellular immune response to JCV measured by ELISPOT was inversely correlated with anti-JCV IgG response. Age of the patients and the diagnosis of leukemia both significantly reduced cellular immune responses to JCV. Conclusions: JC viruria triggers an antibody response in HSCT. However, an increase in JCV-specific cellular immune response 12 months after HSCT leads to suppression of JC viremia, and decrease in JCV humoral immune response. This prospective study in HSCT patients provides a model of interactions between the host immune response and viral activation in multiple compartments over time.",17.84687804088272,10.187151177891563

As demonstrated in the CALAA-01 phase I clinical trial [21, 114] , high doses of polymer NP treatment may result in transient increases of serum cytokines, potentially inducing a T helper (Th)2-mediated immune response [114] . Previous work with gold NPs and other engineered NP systems (ENPS) have also shown that these particles can activate the NLRP3 (NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3) inflammasome pathways, a danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) non-infectious immune response [126] (Fig. 18 ). Activation of NLRP3 stimulates a Th2 response, resulting in interferon (IFN) a and c expression, and is hypothesised to be dependent on the physicochemical properties of nanomaterials including NP size, shape and coating. The T helper response is important in antiviral immunity, as it secretes IFNs and other cytokines to attract lymphocytes and direct the immune response. A T helper response is also important for B cell activation, for a high level of antibody production, and for inducing cellular memory conferring long-term protective immunity [127, 128] . Immune cells including macrophages and dendritic cells are largely responsible for this activation; however, other cells such as fibroblast and epithelial cells can also induce this response.",21.08150191682381,10.090028544785886

In the late part of the 20th century, the T cell was identified as the ultimate controller of the immune response and vaccines were just beginning to be designed to activate T cells. In the 21st century, we recognize the importance of innate responses and especially the dendritic cell (DC) in the optimal development of specific immune responses. The innate and immune responses progress through a series of stages which are orchestrated by the DC, conducted by the T cell and appropriate cytokines, and then delivered by activated cells and antibody. DCs are essential for initiating an immune response, presenting antigen to the T cell, and determining the nature of the immune response delivered by the T cells. A better understanding of the biology of activation of DCs, the cytokines produced by DCs, and their mechanisms for antigen presentation has fostered new developments in vaccine design and formulation. Unfortunately, DC biology is still very confusing for several reasons. First, mouse and human DCs are very different with different activation requirements and cell surface receptors. Second, there may be more than five different subsets of DCs based on their surface markers including the two major subsets which can be distinguished by expression of CD11c, the myeloid (CD11c ϩ ) and plasmacytoid (CD11c Ϫ ) dendritic cells (9) . The characteristics and development of DCs are discussed to greater extents in other reviews (3, 6, 9, 23, 32, 34, 39) .",20.219679501464185,9.880208090328749

In the seven years since their demonstration in mammalian immunity, it is now clear that each TLR senses a different set of microbial stimuli.

These experiments suggest that an immune response to an allograft in the brain is a combination of (a) drainage of soluble antigen from the allograft to the cervical lymph nodes (b) a peripheral immune response and (c) the immunoregulatory characteristics of the CNS-resident cells and their microenvironment. These elements appear to be required to finally trigger rejection of the allograft. As the brain is protected from the external environment, no microorganisms or foreign material enter the brain unless they pass through peripheral tissues. In a natural environment, organisms entering the brain would have passed through respiratory or gut epithelium or skin before entering the brain thus inducing a peripheral immune response. In this way, an immune response in the CNS may be triggered by the drainage of antigens along the perivascular lymphatic drainage pathways to lymph nodes that are already sensitised to those antigens (Weller et al. 2010) .

PRR signaling is particularly important in determining the initiation of specific immunological modules and thereby tailors the response to the particular group of pathogens invading the host. For example, certain microbial pathogens, including many viruses, bacteria and intracellular parasites, trigger type 1 immunity, with elevations in the expression of specific cytokines, including IL-17 and interferon-γ (IFN-γ). In contrast, multicellular pathogens, including helminths, stimulate a type 2 response, with elevations in IL-4 and IL-13 (ref. 3) . As the specific ligand recognized by cells of the innate immune system does not have to be processed or presented by antigen-presenting cells, the innate response develops more quickly than the adaptive response does. Thus, the type of immune response that develops during infection is often determined before the activation of T cells and B cells. Therefore, the events in specific tissue microenvironments that initiate an innate immune response, including interactions between cells of the innate immune system, are critical for understanding the nature of the immune response. Here we discuss the initiating events in specific tissue microenvironments that determine the nature of the innate immune response. We focus on key interactions involving myeloid cell lineages and also innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) in the setting of bacterial, fungal and parasitic infections, but we exclude the topic of viral diseases, which has already been reviewed elsewhere [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] .",21.53225313448555,12.14229984470483

TLRs are a family of highly conserved receptors that regulate innate antigen-specific immunity by recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns [77] . TLR9 is expressed on B and T lymphocytes, plasmacytoid cells, and DCs. Activation of TLR9 may reduce immune tolerance and improve tumor antigen recognition and cell death via both innate and specific immune systems [78] . Through the TLR9 signaling pathway, immunostimulatory oligonucleotides activate a complex cascade that leads to stimulation of an immune response and increased production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines [79, 80] . TLR9 agonists enhance the maturation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). Mature pDCs exhibit increased cell-surface expression of MHC class II molecules and the costimulatory molecule B7. They secrete cytokines such as IFN-α that are associated with a T H 1 response and secondarily activate NK cells, monocytes, and neutrophils [81, 82] . Induction of this rapid innate immune response can be followed by an adaptive (antigen-specific) immune response through presentation of tumor antigens to CTLs. TLR9 agonists can reduce the threshold for antigenic stimulation of B cells, enhancing differentiation into antibody-secreting plasma cells and potentially promoting antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity [83] . It has been shown that TLR9 is expressed in many lung cancer cell lines and lung cancer specimens, whereas nonmalignant lung tissue expresses low levels of TLR9 [84] . It is thought that this stimulation of the immune system leads to the antitumor effects of CpG oligonucleotides [79, 80, 85] .",18.356520069638467,12.008515046586446

This paved way for the development of nucleic acid based vaccination, an effective way for the in vivo expression of desired protein to initiate immune response (Oshop et al. 2002; Liu 2003) . The application of DNA immunization as a new generation vaccine has been well studied since its invention, and a variety of such vaccines have undergone clinical trials, in veterinary practice (Dunham 2002; Oshop et al. 2002; Babiuk et al. 2003; Babiuk et al. 2007 ). The DNA vaccines elicit desired immune responses viz. cell mediated immunity (CMI) and humoral immune response (HIR); and it is much easier for their manipulation using recombinant DNA techniques and production in bacteria using fed-batch fermentation (Liu 2003; Liu et al. 2006) . As an effective vaccine, plasmid DNA have a gene encoding a protective antigen of a pathogen, which when injected into host, is transcribed and translated, to induce a specific immune response. The DNA vaccines, described as genetic immunization to elicit a protective immune response, have been further improved by exploiting various gene delivery methods, cytokine adjuvants and prime-boost (DNA vaccine priming and recombinant protein boosting) approaches (Sharma and Khuller 2001; Jiang et al. 2007 ).",16.901630440837216,11.546941937824215

Several observations suggest an association between a nonfatal outcome after filovirus infection and the development of an effective adaptive immune response. For example, fatal cases of EBOV hemorrhagic fever (EHF) show signs of an impaired immune response (Bray and Geisbert, 2005; Hoenen et al., 2006) , lacking the development of a cellular immune response (Sanchez et al., 2004) and in comparison with nonfatal cases, demonstrating little or no circulating antibodies against the virus (Baize et al., 1999) . Thus, a rapid and effective adaptive immune response may be required for recovery. Data also suggest that a strong well regulated innate inflammatory response is associated with a better outcome after EBOV infection (Baize et al., 2002; Leroy et al., 2000) . Antigen presenting cells such as DCs and macrophages that act as a vital link between the early innate and later adaptive immune response (Reis e Sousa, 2004) serve as early targets of EBOV infection in vivo (Geisbert et al., 2003) and likely play a prominent role in the pathogenesis of EHF (Bray and Geisbert, 2005) .

In immunologically naïve hosts, viruses will induce T cell responses that, dependent on the MHC, recognize a distinct hierarchy of virus-encoded T cell epitopes. This hierarchy can change if the host has previously encountered another pathogen that elicited a memory pool of T cells specific to a cross-reactive epitope. This heterologous immunity can deviate the normal immune response and result in either beneficial or harmful effects on the host. Each host has a unique T cell repertoire caused by the random DNA rearrangement that created it, so the specific T cells that create the epitope hierarchy differ between individuals. This ""private specificity"" seems of little significance in the T cell response of a naïve host to infection, but it is of profound importance under conditions of heterologous immunity, where a small subset of a cross-reactive memory pool may expand and dominate a response.

Cytokines produced by innate effector mechanisms may retard the replication of the pathogen and influence the deviation of an immune response into a type 1 or type 2 direction. These distinctions between the timing and the roles of innate vs adaptive immunity are not so clearly delineated in the context of heterologous immunity, a phenomenon that we would argue is quite common. A cross-reactive memory cell population may be constitutively effective and not need the time for clonal expansion that a naïve population does. If the cross-reactive memory population is deviated in a type 1 or type 2 direction, it, rather than innate mechanisms, may dictate the deviation of the immune response in the newly developing T and B cells. The laws of innate immune system effects on antigen-presenting cells for the generation of immunodominance hierarchies become perverted in the presence of high frequencies of pre-existing cross-reactive T cell clones. One might also suspect that the rapid production of memory T cell cytokines, such as IFN-γ, might curb the replication of the pathogen, thereby reducing the induction of type 1 IFN and its subsequent effects on lymphopenia, memory cell loss, DC suppression, and NK cell activation. Superimposed on the uncertainty of these events is the variation due to the memory pool's private specificities that are unique to an individual host.",17.122272190941942,8.505775114022445

This is influenced by immunosuppressive regimens or impaired immune responsiveness.

While some recombinant vectors appear to be more encouraging than others, ideally it is hoped that several different vectors will ultimately be used to vaccinate against different diseases. An important hurdle to overcome in the development of recombinant vectors is the problem of pre-existing immunity to many of the vectors being tested. The issue of pre-existing immunity must also be addressed for recombinant viruses that humans currently do not have immunity against. This is because people have to be vaccinated multiple times for influenza virus, as the viral HA protein mutates. If a strong immune response is generated against the vector after the first vaccination, the vector may not be able to replicate sufficiently after successive administrations. This would prevent the formation of an immune response to the mutated HAs, leaving the individual vulnerable to infection with the altered influenza viruses. This is being addressed for VSV by the generation of vectors that express different serotypes of VSV G protein that do not cross-react. Recombinant VSV vectors expressing HIV Env elicit a strong immune response to Env, and subsequent vaccination with different VSV vectors expressing HIV Env and other G proteins can be used to boost the initial immune response . Further work in this area is needed to overcome this limitation of recombinant vectors. A comparison of the viral vectors is shown in Table 1 . Overall, recombinant vectors provide a Zuniga et al.

Given prior reports, we expected the live vaccine to be superior to the bacterin in inducing heterologous protection. Live bacterial vaccines have been shown in many cases to be more effective at eliciting broad immune responses involving both antibody-and cell-mediated immunity. Also, live vaccines are often superior at stimulating mucosal immunity, which may be crucial for controlling H. parasuis colonization and disease. The variability in results of previous studies examining cross-protection with bacterins may be explained by examining the relatedness of the isolates used in the studies and/or the prior colonization/immune status of the piglets used. For instance, in young pigs maternally derived immunity often interferes with the development of an active immune response to a vaccine, especially with bacterins that largely induce a systemic antibody response. Since we used naive pigs, no such interference would have occurred. Thus, whether both vaccines would be equally efficacious in the face of maternal immunity still needs to be investigated. Unfortunately, the fact that SW114 demonstrated some virulence makes it a less attractive candidate as a live vaccine. However, further rational attenuation may make it a more suitable candidate, or identification of other nonpathogenic strains may be undertaken.

In fact, the Th1-type immune response, associated with cellular immunity, is known to be an important component of the protection against Salmonella. Regarding this point, we determined whether the lymphocytes primed with FliC-expressing lactobacilli had the ability to induce IFN-␥ production as a benchmark of Th1-type immune responses. A high level of IFN-␥ production was elicited from the primed lymphocytes by stimulation with flagellin ex vivo. Moreover, the ability was much higher than that of soluble flagellin even though the amount of antigen for the priming was about 10-fold lower. CD4 + cells producing IFN-␥ in response to the stimulation were also detected by flow cytometry. These results suggest that FliC-specific cellular immunity can be induced by immunization with L. casei producing FliC and be enhanced in combination with the bacterial cells.

The observation that the provision of an exogenous source of IFNA at the time of vaccination resulted in an increased presence of IFNG SC and a reduction in the amounts of IL1, IL6 and IL10 readily secreted by PBMC, is consistent with this notion.

For other pathogens such as RSV the clearance of infection is not followed by protective memory since re-infection with the same virus can occur multiple times, although with decreased severity of illness (Hall, 2001) . Finally other pathogens such as HCMV, EBV or M. tuberculosis are not eliminated by the immune response and establish a life long carrier state where an equilibrium is reached between the host immune response and the pathogen that persists in a latent or dormant state (Reddehase, 2002; Sacchettini et al., 2008) . The life long carrier state poses a risk of widespread infections when the individual becomes immunosuppressed or immunodeficient. In addition HCMV can superinfect an already immune donor and does so by evading the CD8 T cells response, a process that complicates the development of preventive vaccines (Hansen et al., 2010) .",18.548744702349996,8.459873136285754

Conglutinin and mannose-binding protein prefer to bind to mannose or Nacetylglucosamine, whereas collectin-43 prefers to bind to mannose or N-acetylmannosamine. Collectins may act as opsonins that may bind to mannan-containing particles, allowing for enhanced phagocytosis by the innate immune system, or they may act through activation of the complement system. Several organisms, including some viruses, have been shown to have mannans with structures similar to MOS (Epstein et al., 1996; Medzhitov and Janeway, 1997; Nielsen et al., 1999; Srinivasan et al., 1999) .

It is unknown whether there are mannan components associated with rotavirus, however, if present, as they are in other viruses, mannans may be a target of the innate immune response. It may be that MOS acts as an adjuvant by stimulating the production of mannose-binding proteins (collectins) in cattle. The collectins would then be available for binding to the rotavirus after immunization, which could lead to improved phagocytosis, activation of complement, and enhancement of the immune response. Medzhitov and Janeway (1997) suggest that involvement of the innate immune system is essential for activation of the adaptive immune response. They suggest that the innate immune system provides signals that direct the adaptive immune response in the proper direction such as toward a humoral response or toward a cell-mediated response. In the present study, supplementation of MOS enhanced the humoral immune response of the dams. Enhancement of the cellmediated immune response was not investigated.",18.480177828195746,7.587556344253887

In this study, the S1 gene of PHE-CoV was subcloned into the pVAX1 vector, the only eukaryotic expression vector approved for human use by the FDA, to construct the recombinant plasmid pV-S1, which was used as the PHE-CoV DNA vaccine. Mice were given three intramuscular injections of IPV or S1 alone or combined immunizations with IPV ϩ 2S1 or 2S1 ϩ IPV; these immunizations resulted in the induction of serum neutralizing antibodies and a protection efficacy of 100% against PHE-CoV challenge, but the mice did not receive full biological protection, because PHE-CoV could still be detected by RT-PCR in the S1 and IPV ϩ 2S1 groups. The results of subclass serum antibody analysis showed that IPV mediated a primarily IgG1 immune response, whereas S1 mediated an IgG2a response, which suggests that the IPV may induce a predominantly Th2-type immune response, since alum is known to selectively stimulate an IgG1-dominant, type 2 immune response (15) .",15.287799165788552,11.489477090189993

Later on, using leishmaniasis rgp63 as an antigen, it was shown that small liposomes stimulated a Th2 response, while large ones induce a Th1 response accompanied with higher interferon gamma levels [66] . Furthermore, the head group charge has been thoroughly investigated and it was shown that liposomes with different net charges had different adjuvant activities [85] . Nonetheless, the outcome of the response will be also influenced by the antigen and thus it is difficult to predict. Not only are the properties of the liposome important, but the location/interaction between the antigen and the liposome can also modulate the immune response.

T cells are beneficial in terms of eliminating virus-infected cells; they coordinate a regulated immune response and, as T FH cells, promote high-affinity durable antibodies. Failure to control viral dissemination can lead to severe disease. T reg cells restrain effector responses through various mechanisms, including suppressive cytokines (IL-10, IL-35 and TGF-b) and possibly active killing via perforin and granzyme B (GzmB).

Immunity acquired in response to an antigen is called active immunity. Active immunity is long lived-sometimes as long as the natural life of the host. Immunity can also be acquired passively.

However, the role of lipids in the immune response has historically been ignored or, at its best, relegated to a second level when compared to the importance given to proteins and nucleic acids. Nonetheless, advances in immunology and vaccinology are demonstrating that not only lipids are as potent as proteins and nucleic acids in mounting an immune response, but they also have the ability to modulate the response triggered by the antigen.

Mucosal sites are continually exposed to predominantly innocuous stimuli and therefore must maintain tight regulation of innate immune responses to prevent excessive inflammation. Even in the face of pathogenic infection, it is important that the immune response does not 'over-react' and compromise organ function. In the lungs, alveolar macrophages play a key role in regulating the balance between activating and inhibitory signals of immunity through corresponding receptors that are engaged on alveolar macrophages, the balance of which determines their activation threshold. They have described this as the 'innate immune rheostat', similar to a light controlled by a dimmer switch. 76 Activating molecules on alveolar macrophages include PRRs, CD40 and OX40L. Molecules that are involved in dampening the response include suppressive cytokines (e.g. IL-10), TGF-b, adenosine and CD200L.

First, natural infection fails to result in resistance to reinfection. In fact, repeated infections can occur throughout life (Hall et al., 1991) . Second, pulmonary disease following infection appears to result mainly from a host immune inflammatory response (Varga and Braciale, 2002) .This situation was exaggerated following the use of a formalin-inactivated vaccine in children. Many vaccine recipients developed severe disease, several of which were lethal following natural infection with RSV (Kapikian et al., 1969) .The explanation for the ineffective and untoward immune response to RSV remains obscure. Thus, infection induces neutralizing antibody production as well as CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell responses to peptides from most viral proteins. For unknown reasons, infection can occur in the presence of neutralizing antibody and T-cell immunity. The latter form of immunity, however, is of brief duration, especially in the respiratory tract (Varga and Braciale, 2002) .

We now propose that the innate and adaptive immune systems are one integrated defense network that rely on each other not only for amplification but also regulation. The innate immune system has its own auto-regulatory mechanisms including soluble decoy receptors, intracellular negative regulators, transmembrane protein regulators, reduction of TLR expression and regulation by apoptosis [20] . The Treg cell is a well-known population in the adaptive immune system that can regulate both innate and adaptive immune responses by secreting cytokines (e.g. IL-10 and TGFb) and/ or by cell-cell contact [22, 23] . Our recent study has reported that conventional T cells of the adaptive immune system could unexpectedly regulate innate response in a cell-cell contact manner [21] . Rather than standing by in the early phase of infection, the adaptive immune system can now be thought to actively serve as an indispensable part of the innate immune response. As with most complex biological systems, a stimulatory signal is accompanied by a protective antagonistic response. Although it has long been assumed that the lack of a proinflammatory response by adaptive cells during early infection equates to inactivity, our data instead indicate that adaptive immune cells are full participants, albeit not in the expected manner. It seems that the 'black and white' division of innate and adaptive immunity should be reconsidered.

The viral vectors may be replicationdefective or replication-competent and some examples of viral vectors being utilized for this purpose are pox viruses, adenoviruses, alphaviruses, measles virus, yellow fever virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus. The antigens may be of viral, bacterial, or parasitic origin but generally derive from those infectious agents for which no effective vaccine exists such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), malaria, dengue virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and ebola virus. Because the immune response elicited by live viral III.

In addition, human virulence of the vaccine may not be predicted from known virulence of the vector alone and studies in appropriate animal models are conducted to evaluate virulence. The nonclinical toxicity studies for live virus vectored vaccines are conducted according to the EMA [10] and WHO guidelines for nonclinical evaluation of vaccines [2] , with some exceptions. Regarding species relevance, regulatory guidelines indicate that it is preferable to use the species in which an animal model of disease has been established. When evaluating the immune response to the vaccine, consideration is given to preexisting immunity and nonprotective immunity to the vector and/or heterologous antigens. The immunogenicity evaluation also includes quantitative as well as qualitative data which characterize humoral, cell-mediated and innate immune responses, as appropriate, to both the intended protective antigen as well as the antigens of the vector. When selecting groups to be evaluated on nonclinical toxicity studies, it is required that a group consisting of the vector alone be included.

Currently, it is widely taught that the effector class is tailored to the pathogen driving the immune response: for example, we make IgE to a worm infection, and killer cells against a virus. I no longer believe this. Although pathogens certainly have an influence on the immune responses made against them (usually finding ways to modify those responses to their liking), I believe that there is a more fundamental underlying system of control. I believe that the ultimate controllers of immunity are the tissues that the immune system was designed to protect. When injured, tissues emit alarm signals that initiate immune responses. When not injured, tissues present their own antigens, or release them to passing DCs to present to T cells in order to induce tolerance. Moreover, when an immune response does occur, the tissues send signals that direct the immune system to tailor that response to an effector class that can eliminate the pathogen without causing more damage to the tissue.",19.594031808086637,11.06628882791394

Therefore, it is presumed that a desirable immune response can be achieved by controlling the antigen presentation pathway and cellular immune response has been reported to be more effective in removing infected cells and cancers than humoral immunity [10] .

However, despite mucosal inoculation, no OVA-specific IgA was observed, indicating that the HNP augmentation may not allow for class switching. A subsequent study co-administered OVA intranasally with HNP1, HNP2, HBD1, or HBD2 individually and found that the predominant IgG isotypes and interleukin profiles were unique to the defensin used, highlighting the complexity of the interaction between defensins and immune cells [145] . Finally, the augmented immune response has been shown to be functionally relevant, as intraperitoneal injection of HNPs enhanced the antibody response to a syngeneic tumor challenge and increased the survival time of mice after tumor challenge [146] .

While concern in purposely eliciting an immune response in the lung is justified, we and others [52] indicate here (and elsewhere [5] ) that by doing so with VLPs, the power of tissue-specific immunity can be harnessed to provide a safe and appropriate response in the context of both the pathogen (sterilizing immunity), and the protection of lung function. Furthermore, the onset of immunity when the lung is pre-exposed to sHsp is accelerated, again indicating that the pretreatment with sHsp impacts the future, unpredictable pathogen challenge.

Once engaged, innate immunity can activate a series of immune components: such as, microbial sensors (Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors, NLR, RIG-1 like helicases), certain critical cell types, cytokines, chemokines as well as a group of complement components; all directed to assist the host with eliminating the current insult (Table 6 .1).",25.085251510857006,13.490302160632073

Chronic HCV is linked to dysregulation of innate and adaptive immune signaling and viral-induced cytotoxicity/apoptosis in the hepatic environment which together affect infection outcome, response to therapy, and likely contribute to liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. HCV accomplishes this immune dysregulation by evading the host innate immune response at multiple points, to prevent the initial coordination of innate immunity that primes the entire immune response, including adaptive immunity, leading to increased viral replication and contributing to viral persistence. Within the liver microenvironment, multiple cell types contribute to the immune response towards HCV, and interruption of any aspect of the innate response by HCV could lead to an unbalanced, ineffective immune response, both in natural and treatment-induced HCV clearance, that could drive the progression to liver disease. A full understanding of how viral immune modulation imparts infection outcome requires us to define the spectrum of antiviral and immunomodulatory cytokines that govern the cross-talk between the various cell types within the complex liver tissue. For example, how do IFN-α and IFN-λ responses crosstalk to one another and with hepatic responses to proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, IP10, and others, implicated in hepatic inflammation? What are the key producer cells for these cytokines in the infected liver, and how is production of these cytokines stimulated and/or regulated during HCV infection? There may also be a role for hepatic stellate cells in mediating some of these processes as they have recently been implicated in driving inflammatory responses during HCV-infection of hepatocytes 100 .",21.944485766438007,12.947542285881017

The resulting virus is released from the hepatocyte in association with host lipoproteins, such that in the blood HCV is present as a lipoprotein-coated virus 11 . During the viral replication process HCV is sensed as non-self by pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) in the host cell that identify and bind to pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP) motifs within viral products, leading to coordinated activation of the innate immune response and adaptive immune responses. Both the innate and adaptive arms of immunity, including cross-talk between liver-resident and infiltrating cells, such as hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, pDCs, natural killer (NK) cells, and other immune cells, contribute to the host's ability to resolve HCV infection [12] [13] [14] . However, despite these immune defenses HCV infection becomes chronic in about 70-80% of those who are acutely infected 2 . This outcome is due to a combination of host and viral factors that regulate the intracellular innate immune response against HCV. Importantly, inactivation of this intracellular innate immune response by HCV may also result in a non-functional adaptive immune response. Indeed, PRR signaling (specifically MAVS) is required for functional innate and adaptive responses during infection with West Nile virus, a related virus of the Flaviviridae family 15 . While outside of the scope of this perspective, a functional adaptive immune response is also critical to resolving HCV infection (reviewed in 14, 16 ).",19.43697229586967,12.687346584071962

Infection occurs within hepatocytes, the chief parenchymal cell of the liver. HCV typically causes a chronic infection, and is a major cause of liver disease, liver transplantation, and liver cancer 2 . The first line of immune defense against HCV relies on cell-intrinsic innate immunity within hepatocytes. This innate immune response serves to recognize HCV as non-self and induces local antiviral defenses in the infected cell and liver tissue which can function to recruit and modulate the actions of immune cells of the adaptive immune response. Hepatic innate immunity is therefore essential for controlling the outcome of HCV infection and immunity. However, the majority of those infected with HCV fail to mount a productive immune response that clears infection. Underscoring this problem is that HCV has evolved multiple mechanisms to regulate and evade innate immunity, thus providing a foundation for chronic infection. The standard of care therapy for HCV infection has been treatment with pegylated IFN-α plus ribavirin. As an antiviral cytokine, IFN is an innate immune therapeutic but is very unpleasant for the patient and for those infected with the difficult to treat HCV genotypes (1 and 4) it is only curative 40-50% of the time 3 . While first-generation direct acting antiviral drugs are now being introduced into the clinic, they are applied in combination with IFN to enhance efficacy and reduce chances for viral resistance breakthrough [4] [5] . Moreover, underlying HCV infection outcome are polymorphisms in IFNL3 (also referred to as IL28B), a human gene of the host system of innate antiviral defense, and these polymorphisms can influence both the outcome of infection and response to therapy [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Understanding how HCV regulates hepatic innate immune responses is essential for guiding the improvement of HCV therapy, developing effective vaccine applications, and designing new therapeutic strategies to control infection and suppress liver disease.

The innate response is effective even in the immunologically naive host, whereas the adaptive response depends on some degree of ""immunologic education"" and requires a minimum of several days to become active.

This suggests that the vector-specific response to the first dose of HPIV3/GP reduced, but did not completely restrict replication of the second dose of the vector in all animals. While vector-specific immunity did not preclude a boost, this secondary immune response might be more substantial if the effect of vector-specific immunity can be circumvented. For example, the use of serologically distinct VSV vectors for primary and secondary immunizations against human immunodeficiency virus-1 significantly improved the response to vaccination in mice [31] and induced a highly potent immune response in monkeys [32] . Our studies to date have resulted in the development of three distinct respiratory tract vaccine candidates against EBOV, namely (i) HPIV3/GP, used as the positive control in the present study, (ii) HPIV3/ F-HN/GP, a version of HPIV3/GP in which the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase and fusion glycoprotein neutralization antigens of the HPIV3 vector have been deleted [12] , and (iii) NDV/GP, developed in the present study. Thus, these three vectors provide the basis for primary and secondary immunizations using antigenically distinct paramyxovirus vectors. This should result in a more potent response against EBOV GP than that induced by a homologous prime/boost regimen, and could provide more effective protection against EBOV challenge. Ultimately, a comparison of various vaccination regimens involving sequential administration of each of the three vaccine candidates or the use of various combinations of two different constructs for the primary and secondary vaccination will identify the most effective regimen of vaccination.",16.584346289034727,9.12486705592137

The requirement for foreign sequences to induce Th for the B-cell response and to help the CTL response has been known for many years [98, 99] . Since Th cells control responses to vaccination, it is quite obvious that self-antigens, which do not contain epitopes likely to be recognized by available Th cells, are incapable of inducing immunity. A strategy to activate Th cells for inducing antitumor immunity is to engage a repertoire against nontolerized antigens. The use of xenogeneic antigen to break tolerance is likely due to the presence of some foreign sequences in the xenogeneic antigen that are able to activate Th cells [100] . Focusing on the antimicrobial repertoire, the principle has been applied to realize the DNA fusion gene vaccines encoding the tumor antigen linked to an antigen derived from tetanus toxin. Fusion of the Fragment C (FrC) of tetanus toxin amplified the immune response against a range of tumor antigens, leading to suppression of tumor growth [87] .

Humoral immunity results in serum virus neutralizing (VN) antibodies which first appear 7-10 days after infection. There is a gradual increase in VN titers until 5-6 weeks after infection, with a hypergammaglobulinemia occurring in most cats that develop clinical FIP.

The increased cell death may be due to infection or to the response of the immune system on the infected cell. Since no viral antigens are present on the plasma membrane, it can be stated that antibody-mediated lysis is inhibited. The expression of MHC I is not inhibited in infected cells, indicating that the cellular immunity may still be able to lyse the infected cell, if viral peptides are presented. It is generally accepted that a strong cellular immunity enables the cat to overcome infection (Pedersen and Black, 1983; Hayashi et al., 1982; Weiss and Cox, 1989) . However, it has also been postulated that, during a chronic FIPV infection, the cell-mediated lysis is inhibited due to apoptosis and T-cell depletion caused by soluble mediators released during infection (Haagmans et al., 1996; de Groot-Mijnes et al., 2005) . Taking into account all these observations, it becomes clear that the outcome of a FIPV infection is a complicated interaction of the immune system and the virus.

The success of vaccination programmes depends on the ability of the birds to mount a vigorous immune response after vaccination. In addition to the innate ability of a particular bird to mount an immune response to a vaccine or an infection there are numerous external factors influencing the level of protective immunity. The purpose of this chapter is to review the mechanisms, and impact of immunosuppression, which can have multiple causes, and the ability of pathogens to counteract immune responses by immunoevasion. Immunosuppression is defined as ""A state of temporary or permanent dysfunction of the immune response resulting from insults to the immune system and leading to increased susceptibility to disease"" as originally proposed by Dohms and Sail (1984) with the addition of ""and often a suboptimal antibody response"" as suggested by Liitticken (1997) . Such dysfunction often results from infection of cells of the immune system, leading to their impaired function against the primary and subsequent infections, in a non-specific manner. For this chapter, we define immunoevasion as ""Pathogeninitiated responses counteracting the immune responses to the specific pathogen"". The major difference is that immunosuppression is the consequence of the overall replicative strategy of the causative agent, resulting in increased susceptibility to other pathogens but not necessarily to the causative agent, while immunoevasion is achieved by specific pathogen-encoded determinants, primarily favouring replication of the causative agent. In some instances, infections can result in immunosuppression and immunoevasion, e.g. infection with Marek's disease virus (MDV) .",18.451429873869024,10.687087534425478

The course that most cells take during an immune response depends on the cytokine milieu generated during the innate phase of immunity. Generally speaking, Th1-cells generate cell-mediated immunity, while Th2cells induce antibody production. CD8 T-cells are activated in the same manner and are destined to become specific cell killers (i.e., cytotoxic T-cells).",21.28801463394575,10.661682266217712

Therefore, live attenuated vaccines have two common traits: (i) attenuated virulence to a host, and (ii) induction of protective immunity in the host against a challenge with a virulent pathogen. The gene mutation is required to attenuate the virulence of the live pathogen, making the vaccine relatively safe for the vaccinated host. Live attenuated vaccines may still grow inside the host, but the growth is greatly limited. To make the attenuated vaccine live allows the attenuated vaccine strain infect the host in a pathway that is often similar to the virulent parent pathogen. This way the vaccine most likely stimulates strong cellular and antibody responses as well as some time of immunity, which can be short term, long term or lifelong. One difference between virulent pathogen infection and vaccination is that after a host is infected with a virulent wild type pathogen, the survived host is normally resistant to any reinfection, and the protective immune response in the host usually lasts for life. However, the immunity resulting from vaccination with a live attenuated vaccine is often short lived although a lifelong immunity may sometimes be induced. However, the exact differences between live attenuated vaccines and their virulent wild type strains in terms of immune response inductions are typically unclear.",17.517751135587282,10.498286028063154

By contrast, Patient 2 has an infectious disease that reflects the outcome of an overly exuberant immune response, such as mediastinal fibrosis from histoplasmosis or allergic aspergillosis. In this individual, an anti-inflammatory immunomodulator could dampen the host the inflammatory response, thus reducing damage and symptoms of disease. Notably, the immune response of this individual could have already resulted in microbial clearance. These patients illustrate that the kind of immunomodulator that would be beneficial is probably to be influenced by the immune status of the affected individual. phagocytosis or antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and/or to activate complement [8] . However, a significantly more robust menu of potential mechanisms of antibody action, which includes direct antimicrobial action, immunomodulation and generation of oxidative species, has emerged over the past decade [8] . For example, the efficacy of a pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide-specific antibody was associated with modulation of the cellular response to pneumococcus in the lungs of mice with pulmonary infection [9 ] . This finding suggested that the well-documented ability of serum therapy to ameliorate fever and other clinical symptoms of pneumococcal pneumonia [10] could have reflected a downregulation of the host inflammatory response (or damage control). Perhaps the observation that pneumococcal pneumonia was only responsive to serum therapy with the homologous capsular polysaccharides-specific antiserum in the first three days of symptoms indicated that its capacity to mediate immunomodulation was limited to the early stages of disease. Antibodies to other microbes, including C. neoformans and Histoplasma capsulatum are able to modulate the cellular immune response to pulmonary infection (see [11 ] ). Studies of antibody action have shown that the older dichotomous view that antibody immunity was only effective against extracellular pathogens, whereas cellular immunity was responsible for immunity against intracellular pathogens has been deconstructed by evidence that antibody reagents can be effective against classical intracellular pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, C. neoformans, H. capsulatum and scores of viruses [11 ].",18.38552646222923,11.60194721553847

These high-affinity populations are generated during the initial immune response to infection and are mainly generated within the germinal center (GC), although they can also be generated in GC-independent pathways. Vaccines replicate this process without the threat replicating pathogens pose to the body. While vaccines have been the most effective intervention for many infectious diseases, there are still pathogens that have evaded successful vaccine design [7] . This can be the result of the genetic diversity of the pathogen, immune subversion and immunosuppression, and inconsistencies between local and systemic responses, for example, where a vaccine is not targeted to generating a mucosal immune response that may be critical for successful protection.

Although the main emphasis of this review is on understanding the role of lncRNAs in the IFN response, the mode and mechanism of function of lncRNAs in other immunity-related processes can provide a valuable context for understanding the scope and impact of lncRNA-mediated regulation of the IFN response. Further, many lncRNAs are involved in regulation of immune-related processes that directly or indirectly affect the IFN response. Thus, a brief review of our current state of knowledge of RNA-mediated regulation of the immune system is provided below.

It is well accepted that neutralizing antibody is a key component of sterilizing immunity . For vaccine-based immunity, the rapid induction of neutralizing antibody is the ultimate goal, as it would provide protection against infection. Induction of antibody secretion from B cells requires T cell help, and T cells are required for killing virally infected cells; however, we know very little mechanistically about cell-mediated immunity against PRRSV. The final section relates to innate immunity, and is presented last because it aims to tie together findings described for adaptive immunity against PRRSV. As mentioned above, we know that pigs do eventually ""see"" PRRSV and can clear the infection. Thus, identifying the epitopes and immune cells necessary for clearance and pairing those antigens in the context of ""proper"" innate immune activation will be necessary to find solutions for enhancing PRRSV immunity, and developing strategies to significantly decrease the time it takes to develop protective immunity.",16.606708563559174,9.694775868472975

Because of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) that restricts the access of immune mediators and cells from the blood, the mechanisms leading to proinflammatory signaling in the brain are different from those of systemic organs. For this reason, the term bimmune-privileged organQ has long been used to describe the reduced exposure of the brain to inflammatory events and its inability to mount an immune response and process antigens. Contrary to this notion, there is an elegant innate immune response that takes place in a very well organized and coordinated manner in the central nervous system (CNS) during systemic infection and cerebral insults. Like systemic APCs, brain microglia react to PAMPs in a TLR-dependent manner. Emerging evidence suggests that innate immunity plays beneficial roles in host defense and recovery, although microglial reactivity is becoming a hallmark of neurodegenerative processes. This lecture will present both sites of the story and highlight the mechanisms involved in control of the inflammatory response in the brain that either protect neurons or is the direct cause of some neurodegenerative disorders.",17.015862738085346,8.318491405494406

PRRSV immunity research must move beyond observational studies to identification of mechanisms and immune functions to significantly advance beyond our current stage of knowledge. This will require a full understanding of the modulating effect that PRRSV has on the innate immune response in vivo. In addition, methods for a mechanistic evaluation of immune cell function, such as culture and immortalization of porcine antigen-specific T and B lymphocytes are needed. The ability to evaluate immune cell function requires a sustained commitment and investment that is independent of any particular pathogen. Such an investment will be extremely beneficial for understanding PRRSV immunity, as well as immunity to other swine infectious diseases.

Driving the immune response towards Th1 responses may be an attractive feature of RHDV-VLPs as immunity associated with a Th1 response is thought to be essential for the control of several pathogens, particularly viral infections. IFN-␥ stimulates MHC expression in antigen-presenting cells and efficiently inhibits FMDV replication [51] . Chimeric RHDV-VLP immunised animals were able to elicit IFN-␥ producing cells against the vector and the FMDV epitope, mainly in the adjuvanted group, indicating that Montanide has an adjuvanting effect for the establishment of an effector T cell response in the anti-viral immunity. For the development of a potent immunisation, a prolonged immune response is required to provide protection against a subsequent infection. Hence, the potential of chimeric RHDV-VLPs immunisation to sustain a memory T cell response was investigated after two weeks. Results show that immunisation with chimeric RHDV-VLPs was sufficient to induce a specific cellular memory response. Although induction of neutralising antibodies is considered to be the most important immune correlate with FMDV protection, specific T cells are also induced in convalescent and conventionally vaccinated animals and are relevant for protection [52] . A previous study with dendrimeric epitope based on 3A peptide and a relevant B-epitope (FMDV site-A) has shown that high stimulation indexes (SI) were present in protected animals against FMDV challenge [31] . Thus, it is conceivable to speculate that chimeric VLP-immunised animals exhibiting similar SI to 3A peptide in Cubillos et al. might exert some degree of response against FMDV infection. An additional study has to be performed to get insight the efficacy of RHDV-3A-VLP immunisation, since the aim of this study was only to investigate the immunogenicity of the vector in pigs.",19.15460178510131,10.914025952811276

One of its principal goals is the in silico prediction of immunogenicity at the level of epitope. The set of pathogen epitopes that interface with the host immune system is known as the 'immunome' . Recently developed in silico tools and databases can be used to identify, characterize or predict antigen epitopes recognized by T-and Blymphocytes, cells that play significant roles in infection and protective immunity. In particular, a central role is performed by Tlymphocytes, which activate B-cell growth and differentiation and are effectors of cell-mediated immunity. To carry out this role, they need to recognize peptide fragments of pathogen antigens displayed by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins at the surface of antigen-presenting cells. Methods to model the MHC-peptide interface and predict immunogenic peptides sequences that account for T-cell responses, also known as T-cell epitopes, are essential in this approach to vaccine design. With the availability of entire pathogen genomes, the genome-wide application of immunogenetic approaches (immunogenomics), and immunoinformatics tools for epitope mapping, the discovery of T-cell epitopes has been accelerated, facilitating the development of vaccines [59] . Besides the cellular immune response of T-cells, the adaptive immune response is due to antibody-secreting B lymphocytes that are responsible for the humoral immune response. B-cell epitopes are defined by the discrete surface region of an antigen bound by the variable domain of an antibody. While T-cell epitopes are short linear peptides, B-cell epitopes can be linear, contiguous amino acids or they can be discontinuous (conformational) amino acids, separated within the sequence but brought together in the folded protein.",19.742949274083465,9.73363200169322

Some pathogens elicit a major immune response and a longlasting immunity. Other pathogens only lead to a transient immune response. In this case, the antibody content of human milk can be manipulated by immunizing mothers during pregnancy. This can be done as a passive immunization by infusing preparations of pathogen-specific antisera or, more frequently, as active immunization by vaccination. Vaccination in pregnancy leads to a normal immune response and no pregnancy-specific side effects have been reported (Englund et al., 1998; Munoz and Englund, 2000) . This approach is particularly useful in cases (like RSV), where vaccination only leads to a shortterm immune response and infants can be seriously affected by the infection. Immunization of mothers during pregnancy with RSV antigen leads to the transfer of antibodies to the offspring via placenta and colostrum and helps to prevent RSV-induced disease (Englund, 1994; Englund et al., 1998) . A potential drawback to this approach may relate to the finding that maternal antibodies can suppress the infant's own immune response to certain pathogens (Englund et al., 1998) . Therefore, careful analysis of the host-pathogen interactions is required before embarking on vaccination during pregnancy. Nevertheless, immunization during pregnancy may help to prevent a wide spectrum of diseases. Milk can also be used as a medium for the active immunization of the neonate with antiidiotypes. This can be achieved by immunizing mothers with pathogen-neutralizing antibodies. The mother will develop an immune response against the variable region of the neutralizing antibody and transmit secondary antibodies (i.e. antiidiotypes) to the offspring via placenta and milk. The offspring's immune system will respond by generating tertiary antibodies, which recognize the same epitope as the primary neutralizing antibody.

The principle of vaccination is to stimulate the antibody (B-cell) response and cell-mediated response (T-cell) such that the immune system will mount an immediate, sustained and sufficiently powerful attack against exposure to the pathogen invading the host. Vaccination should have long-term, lasting protection. Table 5 lists diseases that are preventable through available vaccines. However, there are limitations to the value of existing vaccinations. The protective effective of the vaccination may take longer than the time between exposure and onset of disease, many vaccines require multiple doses to achieve a protective immune response, not all persons mount an immune response subsequent to the vaccination, and finally, persons with impaired immunity either cannot generate an immune response to the vaccine or may experience side effects to the vaccine. Vaccines, as with any therapeutic product, may have side effects. Most side effects may be minor (injection site swelling, fever, malaise). Major side effects may include allergic reactions because of the medium the vaccine was grown in (egg or tissue culture) or additives or the disease itself from the administration of a live virus.",23.331040122273787,12.70092179015987

The most prominent of these reactions is immunity. The traditional view maintained that immunity occurs in two ways: an adaptive sophisticated, immensely effective clonal immune response, and an innate, brachial and primitive response that provides an approximate and barely functional first line of defense. Needless to say, the discovery of pathogen-associated molecular patterning receptors, such as the rapidly growing family of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) [9] , has significantly altered that perception: we now know that the innate immune system is much more sophisticated than had been suspected. The current enthusiasm for TLR immunotherapies (of everything, from pathogens to cancer) may be excessive: TLR stimulation is a potent double-edged sword, and in our own experience chronic administration of TLR agonist can be severely counterproductive [10] .",19.825641772364477,11.832731975540732

Modern techniques help us elucidate the pathways and components of the host response. The immune system and its components are a mainstay of our protection against infections and malignancies. 4, 5 Inflammation is often an unpleasant side effect as the immune system contains and eradicates a microbe or foreign tissue. Specific arms of the immune system can be used as markers in favor or against the presence of an infection. The humoral or antibody response to an invading microbe is an example. Some of the antibodies that are produced have a protective effect with other parts of the immune-inflammatory system and are responsible for eradicating the infection. Other antibodies may not be as effective in this role. However, in their ability to recognize unique and specific structures of a microbe, they serve as beacons that a microbe was recently present or was present in the distant past. Substances such as antibiotics which can rapidly kill a microbe may modify the immune response by removing the infectious driving force for a full-scale response. In clinical medicine and veterinary medicine, measurement of the immune response helps the diagnostician decide what infection was present and how recently. In these situations the intention is to provide treatment. For other pieces of the puzzle, the forensic scientist may exploit parts of the immune response to discover who is likely a victim of an attack and who might be responsible. This chapter will discuss the basics of the host immune response that can have utility in the microbial forensic sense. Examples will provide a sense of what information is achievable and what is not likely to provide clues with a high degree of certainty.",19.53659675116584,11.394742933495202

Both vectors expressed high levels of gene products, but differences were observed with regard to cytokine expression and breadth of responses. By microarray analysis, MVA enhanced the expression of several proinflammatory cytokines in contrast to NYVAC. However, in NYVAC/MVA combination strategies, initial priming with the NYVAC recombinant followed by the MVA recombinant gave the broadest cellular immune response. In contrast, the weaker response of the NYVAC recombinant as a booster immunogen may reflect anti-vector immunity elicited by the significantly smaller MVA vector. In this case, the immune response would be focused on a smaller number of common genes present in both NYVAC and MVA, leading to greater inhibition of the NYVAC booster immunogen. The increased breadth of cellular immunity elicited by the NYVAC vector could be linked to its greater induction of apoptosis, leading to a greater abundance of antigens available for cross-priming.

One, whether antigens are injected selectively into the brain parenchyma (does not prime a systemic immune response), or into the brain ventricles (does prime a systemic immune response), and whether the antigen injected is particulate and will thus remain restricted to the injection site in the brain parenchyma (and will not prime a systemic immune response), or can diffuse and eventually reach the brain ventricular system (and prime a systemic immune response) [reviewed in (23) (24) (25) (26) ].",20.68251713668727,9.848571246806761

Mucosal B-lymphocytes, stimulated by i.n. vaccination to secrete anti-FIPV IgA antibody, will migrate to the gut mucosa and also confer local gut immunity 12'1a. The ts-FIPV, because it is given i.n., and because of its ability to grow at temperatures present in the nasopharyngeal region 9, stimulated a local immune response as indicated by IgA antibody in saliva. In addition, the ts-FIPV vaccine stimulated a CMI response to FIPV following two vaccinations. The CMI response was still detectable 137 days postvaccination and was amplified following challenge. A CMI response to FIPV did not occur in non-vaccinated cats infected with virulent FIPV. Humoral immunity is reported to enhance rather than protect against experimental FIPV infection 14. Our studies suggest that a humoral response to FIPV, per se, is not detrimental. The ts-FIPV vaccinated cats developed IgG, IgA and virus neutralizing antibody titres without the cats being sensitized to FIPV. However, it should be noted that the geometric mean VN titre of vaccinated cats was less than 10% of the geometric mean titre of the non-vaccinated control cats following challenge.

This may occur because the patient has an inadequate immune response, often as the result of underlying comorbid illness; because of anatomic abnormalities (endobronchial obstruction, bronchiectasis); or because of therapy-induced dysfunction of the immune system (corticosteroids, endotracheal intubation). 2, 45, 46 In addition, genetic variations in the immune response make some patients prone to overwhelming infection because of an inadequate response and others prone to acute lung injury because of an excessive immune response. 16 In fact, the failure to localize the immune response to the respiratory site of initial infection may explain why some patients develop acute lung injury and sepsis because the infl ammatory response extends to the entire lung and systemic circulation. 47 Pneumonia can even occur in patients who have an adequate immune system, if the host defense system is overwhelmed by a large inoculum of bacteria (massive aspiration) or by a particularly virulent organism to which the patient has no preexisting immunity or to which the patient has an inability to form an adequate immune response. With this paradigm in mind, it is easy to understand why previously healthy individuals develop infection with virulent pathogens such as viruses (infl uenza), Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. However, for chronically ill patients, it is possible for them to be infected not by these virulent organisms but also by organisms that are not highly virulent. Because of host defense impairments, organisms that commonly colonize these patients can cause infection as a result of immune responses that are inadequate. These organisms include enteric gramnegative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp.) and fungi (Aspergillus and Candida spp.).",19.70633047245616,8.624980632443586

In a review of more than 200 scientific articles that evaluated healthy older adults who were selected by the SENIEUR protocol [57] , the magnitude of decline in T-cell-dependent immune response with age is modest (ie, w25% decline versus healthy older adults) [23] relative to that of the aging mouse model [8, 9] . In contrast, the T-cell-dependent immune response of frail older adults is impaired 2 to 3 times more than that of healthy older adults of ages comparable to those of frail older adults, [23] . Moreover, the greater impairment in immunity in vulnerable older adults is associated with a decline in induction of proinflammatory IL-12 response and increased anti-inflammatory IL-10 [2, 23] . These results suggest that changes in the immune tissue microenvironment may play an important role in age-related decline in T-cell-dependent immune response in humans. This is not unexpected, for the aging mouse model had shown previously that the age-related decline in T-cell-dependent immune response is caused by changes occurring in the immune cells (intrinsic changes) and in immune tissue microenvironment (extrinsic changes) [58] . Also consistent with this is a review that analyzed changes in various physiologic functions with age from 469 studies involving more than 54,000 older adults. The comprehensive review included 43 immunologic studies of 372 individuals. They found that the mean annual rate of decline with age in immune functions is greater than the average rate of decline of all other physiologic functions that were assessed. The investigators concluded that the deterioration in immune function in older adults is the result not only of biologic aging but also of the presence of chronic disease [59] . To address this hypothesis directly, a study analyzed the influence of chronic disease burden on T-cell immunity using the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS). CIRS is an instrument that measures disease burden in individuals who have various chronic diseases but no evidence of acute deterioration or infection. T-cell immunity was related inversely to disease burden (increasing CIRS), with impaired proliferation to phytohemagglutinin, increased production of immunoinhibitory IL-10, and trends toward decreased immunoenhancing IL-12 but no correlation with chronologic age between 51 and 95 years [2] .",19.507905953979087,9.711365053901531

In the late part of the 20th century, the T cell was identified as the ultimate controller of the immune response and vaccines were just beginning to be designed to activate T cells. In the 21st century, we recognize the importance of innate responses and especially the dendritic cell (DC) in the optimal development of specific immune responses. The innate and immune responses progress through a series of stages which are orchestrated by the DC, conducted by the T cell and appropriate cytokines, and then delivered by activated cells and antibody. DCs are essential for initiating an immune response, presenting antigen to the T cell, and determining the nature of the immune response delivered by the T cells. A better understanding of the biology of activation of DCs, the cytokines produced by DCs, and their mechanisms for antigen presentation has fostered new developments in vaccine design and formulation. Unfortunately, DC biology is still very confusing for several reasons. First, mouse and human DCs are very different with different activation requirements and cell surface receptors. Second, there may be more than five different subsets of DCs based on their surface markers including the two major subsets which can be distinguished by expression of CD11c, the myeloid (CD11c ϩ ) and plasmacytoid (CD11c Ϫ ) dendritic cells (9) .

The ability of AMPs to neutralize immunoactivating structures on microorganisms and block microorganisms from binding to host cells prevents infectious agents from inducing an inflammatory response. This activity may play a part in preventing unintended or constant inflammation at mucosal surfaces. The mucosal surfaces of the body are constantly exposed to a high antigenic load and a balance must be maintained between active and passive immunity, so these sites are not in a permanent state of inflammation. This activity may be particularly relevant to AMPs expressed constitutively at mucosal surfaces. Given their immediate induction during an innate immune response, the ability of AMPs to mod-ulate inflammation may contribute to an appropriate immune response at sites of infection. The resolution of inflammation is a crucial aspect of an immune response, and through their anti-inflammatory influence, AMPs may act as a counter-regulatory mechanism that dampens the immune response (Bowdish et al., 2005) .",19.945452882023638,9.622663332631385

This type of platform is especially noteworthy, as it may be utilized as an immunomodulatory agent alone (as in the case of pretreatments), for modifying the current state of immune homeostasis, or as a carrier and adjuvant for a defined antigen of interest. This phenomenon of immune homeostasis and skewing has been extensively described in terms of an individual's history of pathogen and allergen exposure [3, 51] . However, to date few attempts to harness the potential of immune priming, with or without involving pathogen-specific epitopes or proteins, have been described [4] . Thus, we propose that we have identified an approach which utilizes strategies for priming against undefined broadspectrum antigens, and also for delivering a highly efficacious single-dose vaccine against a defined antigen. Importantly, we have additionally shown that the route of delivery (directly to the lung by intranasal instillation) results in the creation of an immune response that is specifically tailored to that tissue, and its individual requirements. While concern in purposely eliciting an immune response in the lung is justified, we and others [52] indicate here (and elsewhere [5] ) that by doing so with VLPs, the power of tissue-specific immunity can be harnessed to provide a safe and appropriate response in the context of both the pathogen (sterilizing immunity), and the protection of lung function. Furthermore, the onset of immunity when the lung is pre-exposed to sHsp is accelerated, again indicating that the pretreatment with sHsp impacts the future, unpredictable pathogen challenge.

This is important because how it is formulated and delivered will dramatically influence the quality as well as the magnitude of the immune response generated. For example, a parenterally administered nonreplicating vaccine will induce only a systemic immune response, but have very little ability to induce mucosal immunity. Currently, there is extensive evidence to suggest that delivering the vaccine to mucosal sites is the most effective way to induce mucosal immunity. Another advantage of mucosal delivery is that the animal also develops systemic immunity, in addition to mucosal immunity. In addition to broadening the immune response, mucosal immunity has other advantages such as avoiding the pain and injection site reactions, and broken needles, etc. associated with parenteral injection. This route of administration can also be less expensive, but depending on management systems, may be more difficult to perform. For example, wild range cattle are not very receptive to intranasal delivery of vaccines; therefore, oral delivery may be more attractive in these circumstances. Unfortunately, despite many experimental reports few oral vaccines are licensed for livestock. The reason for this is the lack of effective delivery systems that target the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). The difficulty of delivering vaccines to the GALT is a result of a combination of many factors including degradation of the antigen and various physiological barriers. For example, in the ruminant, traversing the rumen to the intestine where the GALT is provides a major challenge. However, despite these challenges a number of promising developments are being pursued.",19.87900342578868,9.461281658334663

Persistent activation of immune cells may result in autoimmune or inflammatory diseases. With aging, it seems the acquired immune cells once ''fired'' are not removed. This process normally is accomplished by a process called programmed cell death or apoptosis. Aging is associated with ineffective apoptosis of some cells that may populate immune tissues and either prevent fresh cells from being produced or impair activity of those cells (so called suppressor cells). Hence, both premature apoptosis (failing to sufficiently activate an immune response) or inability of immune cells to undergo apoptosis (populate immune tissues with ineffective cells) can result in impaired host resistance [7] . The interface between innate and acquired immunity, that regulation of turning on or off of an immune response occurs, may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of aging and the interaction of age-or comorbidity-related inflammation. It seems this critical interface is where the major age-associated impairment in host resistance occurs and results in increased risk for common infections and poor vaccine responses [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] .",19.858010922404006,7.855115061338898

A similar approach has been used to develop vaccines against pseudorabies virus. High proportions of Ig2a IgG and high levels of IFN-γ were found, indicating a Th1-type immune response. Studies using baculovirus capable of displaying circumsporozoite proteins from plasmodium on the virion surface and expressing the same protein in transduced mammalian cells demonstrated that the baculovirus induced a mixed Th1/Th2 response, resulting in strong protection against infection [27, 28] . By comparing a baculovirus vector that could only display HA with a vector that could both display and express HA, we showed that different biases in Th1 and Th2 immune responses were induced. The balance between Th1 and Th2 responses mounted against an infectious agent can influence both the control of the pathogen and immunopathology. Humoral immune responses are essential for immunity against viral infections, but they may not be sufficient to clear the virus [6] .

Oral delivery of vaccine antigens or biologics using such polymeric microparticles offers remarkable advantages over others such as induction of mucosal as well as systemic immune response, protection of antigen from gastric degradation, prolonged presentation of antigen to the immune system, and obviation of the need of vaccine adjuvants because microparticles themselves can act as self-adjuvants. 3, 14 Strategically designed particulate delivery systems incorporate enteric polymers to protect the biological entity from harsh gastric conditions and to target ligands to enhance its uptake from M cells of the Peyer's patches in the small intestine. M cells, or microfold cells, act as sampling ports for any foreign entities encountered in the small intestine. These M cells house various dendritic cells and immune cells. For oral vaccines, particles are sampled by M cells, processed by dendritic cells or antigen-presenting cells, and presented on MHC class I or class II molecules.

Also intestinal mucin-type glycoprotein 1 and 2 have been identified as receptors for F4ac, 9,10 but these have not been reported to initiate endocytosis or induction of a mucosal immune response, and are therefore unlikely to be F4acRs involved in transcytosis and induction of mucosal immunity.",18.742011939499264,9.952541166797001

Alternatively, early escape from or completely bypassing the endosomes during the intracellular delivery process could perhaps avoid this immunostimulatory activity of siRNA. Moschos et al. [61] reported that when TAT-conjugated siRNA was administered to the lung of the mouse, no immune response was observed. However when penetratin-conjugated siRNA was administered in the same way, innate immune response was observed, possibly through the activation of TLR. Since siRNA, TAT or penetratin alone did not induce innate immune responses, the different fate between TAT-conjugated and penetratin-conjugated siRNA systems could only be explained by their different cellular uptake mechanism.

Innate immune cells will be the first to respond and will attempt to clear the pathogen through phagocytosis and/or lysis. As pathogens have developed strategies to evade the innate immune response, all vertebrates are capable of eliciting a highly specific response by virtue of their adaptive immune system. The adaptive immune system can generate humoral immunity and cell-mediated immunity (see Fig. 14.1 and Table 14 .3). Antibodies, produced by B-cells, are the typical representatives of humoral immunity. An antibody belongs to one of four different immunoglobulin classes (IgM, IgG, IgA, or IgE) (cf. Chap. 8). Antibodies are able to prevent infection or disease through several mechanisms: 1. Binding of antibodies covers the pathogen with Fc (constant fragment), the ""rear end"" of immunoglobulins. Phagocytic cells, such as macrophages, Antibodies are effective against many, but not all infectious microorganisms. They may have limited value when pathogens occupy intracellular niches (such as intracellular bacteria and parasites), which are not easily reached by antibodies. In this case cell-mediated immunity is required to clear the infected cells. T-cells are the major representative of cell-mediated immunity and can clear infections by the following mechanisms: 1. Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs, also called cytotoxic T-cells) react with target cells and kill them by release of cytolytic proteins like perforin. 2.

This response is absent or diminished in calves with passively acquired specific antibodies in serum and intestine. Oral vaccination with modified live rotavirus of calves fed colostrum with rotavirus antibodies did not induce a protective intestinal immune response. This is most likely explained by neutralization of the vaccine virus as suggested by De Leeuw and Tiessink (1984) . In addition or alternatively, serum antibodies might suppress the development of intestinal immunity. Although oral vaccination rapidly induced a protective intestinal immune response in calves which were not fed colostral rotavirus antibodies, it is not sensible to omit or delay colostrum feeding. Therefore, alternative vaccination methods are needed to induce an active intestinal immune response or a persistent secretion of rotavirus antibodies in milk.

In this regard, there are interesting parallels between Ebola virus infection and the highly pathogenic 1918 influenza virus (see the accompanying review by Ahmed and colleagues 66 ). For example, Kobasa and co-workers found that a reconstituted 1918 strain of influenza shows high levels of viral replication, which correlates with macroscopic lesions in lung tissue of infected cynomolgus macaques 67 . Infection in this animal model culminated in acute respiratory distress and an overwhelmingly fatal outcome. Interestingly, infected animals were able to mount an immune response that was in many ways similar to the responses observed during Ebola infection in nonhuman primates. The immune response to 1918 influenza was characterized by an aberrant interferon response and the expression of abnormally high levels of cytokines and chemokines. The authors concluded that the high lethality of the 1918 influenza strain can be attributed in part to the generation of an atypical and harmful innate immune response that is insufficient for protection.",20.056851384671198,11.736393939625305

However, the protective role of immunoglobulins remains uncertain, as a recent report indicates that the passive transfer of the neutralizing human monoclonal antibody KZ52 is unable to control infection in a macaque model 40 . Based on these considerations, it is becoming increasingly evident that an early and robust, but transient, innate immune response and the subsequent activation of adaptive immune response are necessary to protect against fatal infection. If such a host immune response is not generated, the virus evades immune control, and the infection progresses to end-stage disease.",18.392218376032375,11.520273133805546

The initiation of innate immune responses begins with the interaction of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) on the pathogen side with pattern-recognising receptors (PRR) such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on the host cells involved in the innate immunity (e.g. dendritic cells). A major functional criterion commonly used for the evaluation of various new adjuvants involves their ability to stimulate the innate immunity cells. This would include engaging other PRRs and the co-receptors and intracellular adaptor signalling proteins with which they are associated. PAMPs and their derivatives are utilised by adjuvant developers to harness the power of innate immunity to channel the immune response in a desired direction. Based on the identifi cation of several TLRs and PAMPs recognised by them, various PAMP agonists were tested as adjuvants. Examples of TLR-PAMP-specifi c interaction include bacterial or viral unmethylated immunostimulating CpG oligonucleotides interacting with TLR9 and liposaccharide and its component monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) interacting with TRL4. These two types of adjuvants are in advanced stage of testing in clinical trials and some already licensed vaccines contain MPLA in liposomal form [ 70 , 71 ] .",19.98503569208514,11.33444833760486

The success of vaccination relies on the induction of a protective immune response and a longlasting immunological memory. Vaccination is also referred to as active immunization, because the host's immune system is activated to respond to the ""infection"" through humoral and cellular immune responses, resulting in adaptive immunity against the particular pathogen. The immune response is generally highly specifi c: it discriminates not only between pathogen species but often also between different strains within one species (e.g., strains of meningococci, poliovirus, infl uenza virus). Albeit sometimes a hurdle for vaccine developers, this high specifi city of the immune system allows an almost perfect balance between response to foreign antigens and tolerance with respect to selfantigens.

Thus, 131-2G mAbtreated mice infected with the RSV r19F strain show an enhanced and sustained humoral response characterized by an increased ratio of anti-RSV IgG2a to IgG1, as compared with nontreated, infected mice. Moreover, the stimulation and skewing of the humoral response also correlate with an increase in follicular helper T cells (Tfh) and a higher frequency of CD8 + T cells directed to infected cells. It should be noted, however, that the effects on B-cell and T-cell responses are not Fc-dependent, as the 131-2G F(ab 0 ) 2 fragment leads to the same shift of the adaptive immune response as the whole mAb [48, 49] .

Even though PRRSV-specific neutralizing antibodies can protect pigs from homologous challenges to a certain level, higher titers of antibodies are required for complete protection (Lopez et al., 2007) . Additional problems associated with existing vaccines include viral persistence and possible reversion to virulence. Incomplete protection against field viruses (heterologous PRRSV) makes current vaccines less valuable in the field (Kimman et al., 2009) . Aberrant and delayed cell-mediated immune responses make hard to clear the virus persistently residing in the lymphoid tissues and even harder to control the transmission from persistently infected pigs to naive pigs. Thus, a vaccine that can improve the host anti-viral immune response including the innate immunity, CD4+ T cells, CTLs, and B cells will be of a significant benefit. Immunological hallmarks of PRRS are that the innate immunity (namely type I IFNs) is suppressed and the adaptive immunity is perturbed and delayed. Since type I IFNs prime the proliferation and maturation of adaptive immune responses, it is tempting to speculate that the disturbed and delayed adaptive immune responses against PRRSV is due to the suppression of type I IFNs response in host by PRRSV. A replication-competent recombinant PRRSV co-expressing various type I IFNs increases the IFN levels in pigs and elicits protection against PRRSV, but no significant PRRSV-specific adaptive immune responses are observed in this study (Sang et al., 2014b (Sang et al., , 2012 . Different observations have been made for an increased and prolonged adaptive immune response when using the porcine IFN-a expressing plasmid as an adjuvant for PRRSV vaccination (Meier et al., 2004) . This suggests that the timing and routes to deliver IFNs and how long it will last in animals make a difference in priming the adaptive immune response against PRRSV infection. Studies by Brockmeier et al. (2009 Brockmeier et al. ( , 2012 show the protective role of IFN-a in pigs. In these studies, IFN-a was expressed in vivo by adenovirus-mediated gene delivery. Following virulent challenges with PRRSV, the pigs showed delayed viremia and enhanced PRRSV-specific cell-mediated immune response. These results indicate that a higher level and sustained production of IFNs for an extended period is critical for the control of PRRSV in pigs. During PRRSV infection, a swift response of type I IFNs is observed which may reach a relatively high level of IFN (Albina et al., 1998a,b;  unpublished data from our laboratory). However, this response is only transient and the IFN levels drop quickly as the infection progresses. One of the reasons for this decrease may be due to the potent viral IFN antagonism. Other than exogenous administration of IFNs, promoting endogenous IFNs is also thought to function better to prime the adaptive immune responses. Indeed, the induction of IFN production in vivo has resulted in the increase of adaptive immune responses (Wang et al., 2013c) .",17.704548427514418,10.483740711379312

In HPIV3-immune guinea pigs, despite restriction of rHPIV3-ZEBOV GP replication by HPIV3 neutralizing antibodies, these animals produced ZEBOV GP-specific antibodies at nearly the same level as HPIV3-naive animals [94] . In HPIV3-immune rhesus macaques, the antibody response to ZEBOV GP was substantially lower when compared with HPIV3-naive animals following the first immunization. However, the antibody response was comparable between HPIV3-naive and -immune animals following a second immunization [65] , achieving a level that has been previously characterized as being required for 100% protection in this model [47] . Unfortunately, there is no report of these animals being challenged to demonstrate that pre-existing immunity does not interfere with protection from challenge. In order to circumvent pre-existing vector immunity, a construct that does not contain the F or HN gene of HPIV3 was developed that solely expresses ZEBOV GP on its surface. While its replication in guinea pig lungs appeared to be even more restricted, a single immunization was sufficient to protect guinea pigs from lethal ZEBOV challenge and induced an immune response comparable to previous constructs [62] . This construct was able to incorporate twofold more ZEBOV GP into virus particles and also appears to be even more attenuated than the complete rHPIV3 vector used in previous experiments.

Many viruses, with both DNA and RNA genomes, dampen host protein synthesis by various mechanisms [12] [13] [14] . Interestingly, however, not all of the identified genes that decrease host protein synthesis affect viral replication in vitro -in the case of the herpes virus vhs protein, an effect is seen solely in virulence in vivo [14] . These data suggest that, at least in some cases, the effects of host protein shut-off might not be competitive for protein production as much as subversive of the immune response. For example, a cell that is not expressing adequate levels of MHC class I or II molecules will be impaired in its antigen presentation capacity, both in initiating an adaptive immune response and in being targeted by it [cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) killing] (Figure 1) . Indeed, it has been shown that the herpes protein that causes RNA degradation inhibits antigen presentation by dendritic cells [15] and directly decreases the specific immune response to the virus [16] . Additionally, production of proinflammatory cytokines, which alert the innate immune system to the presence of virus, can also be blocked [17] . The kinetics of the response also suggest involvement of the innate immune response because the presence of a gene that decreases host protein production can enhance viral replication in vivo before measurable adaptive immunity [14] .

This suggests that the immunodominant neutralizing epitopes for PRCV and TGEV are probably not the major contributors to passive protection. Our results also show that the initial PRCV dose, in the range of 108-2 × 109 PFU, did not correlate with the magnitude of the primary immune response. Thus, the degree to which PRCV replicates in the respiratory tract and induces immunity is probably more dependent on host factors and the virus strain rather than on the initial virus dose. The second booster dose did not increase the humoral immune response, but the third dose did (P= 0.0001 ), presumably due to the emulsification with adjuvant and the IM route.

The mucosal immune system provides the first immune defense barrier for more than 90% of potential pathogens and represents the largest immune organ in the body. The mucosal immune system is an integrated system that fortifies the mucosal barrier with immune reinforcements from the innate and adaptive response and at the same time regulates and engages the immune system ( Fig. 1) and has a greater concentration of antibodies than any other tissue in the body. It must not only protect against harmful pathogens but the mucosal system also tolerizes the immune system to dietary antigens and normal microbial flora. If the barrier is breached the next line of defense is the innate immune response in the lamina propria (LP) with phagocytic cells and production of various cytokines, chemokines, and proteins that not only provide antimicrobial protection but also recruit cells through the proinflammatory process and activate the acquired immune response (see Fig. 1 ). The acquired immune response with its myriad of B cells, T cells, cytokines, and antibodies provides the pathogen-specific memory with continued duration protective for subsequent infections with the same pathogen (see Fig. 1 ).",17.24992909690144,7.941660362791427

Whereas mucosal delivery of microbial antigens (e.g. cholera) can elicit significant response also in immunosuppressed patients, a particular characteristic of the mucosal system is the induction of tolerance (especially to T-dependent antigens able to elicit delayed type hypersensitivity reactions, DTH). The phenomenon of oral tolerance (or ignorance) is a very important physiological mechanism to avoid development of DTH and other allergic reactions to ingested food proteins and other antigens. Oral tolerance and induction of mucosal immunity usually involve different types of antigens, oral tolerance being difficult or impossible to induce with strong immunogens, while the reverse is true for the mucosal immune response. However, the two phenomena are not mutually exclusive and sometimes the same mucosal immunisation procedure may concomitantly give rise both to a local significant IgA antibody formation and to tolerance or suppressed peripheral immune response. Therefore, mucosal immunisation and induction of oral tolerance may represent promising approaches to induce protection against mucosal infectious agents and against systemic inflammatory autoimmune disorders, respectively.",19.890373447184615,10.950919418062467

Studies performed in mice reveal a reduced protection from bacterial infection in the genital tract in response to progesterone (Kaushic et al., 1998) . Also, viral infection appeared to be enhanced in dioestrus (corresponding to the secretory phase with high progesterone levels in humans), while viral replication was reduced during the estrogen-dominated preovulatory phase (Gallichan and Rosenthal, 1996) . Hence, a window for increased susceptibility to STIs, for example, HIV, has been proposed for the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle due to the suppression of innate, humoral, and cell-mediated immunity by progesterone and high estrogens (Saba et al., 2013; Wira and Fahey, 2008; Hafner et al., 2013) . In conclusion, immunity in the female reproductive tract faces a contradictory demand by suppressing an immune response against allogeneic sperm antigens and promoting the implantation of a semiallogeneic blastocyst. This is at the expense of immunity against local pathogen challenges. The female menstrual cycle influences local immunity. Alternating hormone levels regulate the functions of the female reproductive tract to allow fertilization and implantation. In the proliferative phase, during which the endometrial lining is reconstituted, estrogens are predominant and their levels rise, resulting in ovulation and the onset of progesterone synthesis. After ovulation, the corpus luteum produces both progesterone and estrogens, both of which control local processes in preparation for a potential pregnancy. In the absence of fertilization, corpus luteum degrades, inducing inflammatory degradation of the endometrium and the onset of menses. Local immunity changes with fluctuating hormone levels, resulting in an increased susceptibility to viral and bacterial infectious diseases during the secretory phase.

The constantly rising levels of progesterone and the enhanced GC production in response to HPA-axis activation could increase the susceptibility to or severity of infectious diseases due to the suppression of a proper immune response necessary to control and eliminate pathogens (Tait et al., 2008) . In pregnant mice, infection with Leishmania major, Salmonella enterica, and Toxoplasma gondii is more severe due to the suppressed Th1 immunity that would usually mount an antiparasitic response (Krishnan et al., 2013) . Pregnant women are at an increased risk to suffer from acute and chronic viral infections such as rhinovirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome, coronavirus, varicella zoster, hepatitis E/B, HIV, and cytomegalovirus (Harger et al., 2002; McDonagh et al., 2004; Wong et al., 2003) .

However, the amino acid sequence composition of the antigen-binding site (CDR3 region) of the expressed V H region in bats is different from those of humans and mice with a higher proportion of arginine and alanine residues, and lower proportion of tyrosine residues, and thus possibly a lower poly-reactivity [20] . Such antibodies have lower avidity and form a weaker association with antigens. Furthermore, the primary antibody response may be delayed from reaching a peak and the secondary antibody response may also be slow or delayed in bats. In adverse environmental situations such as prolonged exposure to low temperature at 88C simulating the state of hibernation, bats may temporarily fail to mount an antibody response but resume this ability 1 week after transferring to 248C. Importantly, bats may clear viral infection even in the absence of neutralizing antibody by other unknown mechanisms [14] . Bats appeared asymptomatic during bat-SARS-CoV infection despite a high viral load in their anal swabs with absent or low serum neutralizing antibody although their body weights were generally lower than the uninfected bats [4, 21] . As for a cell-mediated immune response, those of bats are generally slower to peak after stimulation by T-cell mitogens. Environmental changes such as roost ecology and physiological alterations such as pregnancy also affect cell-mediated immunity of bats [14] .

A sprinkling of cytokine can be specific responses to apart from infections and get transition into recovery, but an excessive cytokine production may cause the immune system out of control, and cause the precipitation of pathological consequences (Allison and Rosenthal, 2010) . Some diseases of fever, kidney dysfunction, and liver problem could be attributed to body's response to excessive cytokine production that storm physiology of the body, such as IL-6 and TNF-α (Clark, 2007) . This virulent immune response with production of large amounts of inflammatory cytokines often was named as immunoinflammatory response, and played the most important role in the pathogenesis of liver damage and dysfunction (Seely and Christou, 2000; Wang and Ma, 2008; Aldridge et al., 2009) . The results demonstrated that liver pathological changes were observed significantly in LPS-treated animals, and the serum concentrations of ALT and AST, which were functional readout for liver damage, increased drastically in LPS injection animals, but decreased to normal level with BHT prevention (Fig. 3) . These changes were accompanied by changes of inflammatory cytokines, especially sudden change of IL-10 signaling (Fig. 2C ). There were no significant changes of other cytokines of IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-γ (data not shown). This raised the intriguing possibility that excessive production of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 (Fig. 2) , which also caused excessive immune response, may be the direct cause of liver damage, and BHT was able to prevent the pathological process. Because the activation of the innate immune response can be a prerequisite for triggering of acquired immunity (Akira et al., 2001) , the adaptive immune system always works in synchronization with innate immunity (Abdelsadik and Trad, 2011) . Depending on the combination of cytokines produced in response to the stimulus, innate and adaptive immune responses are initiated. As reported, LPS-induced proliferation of lymphoid cells is thought to be primarily restricted to B cells in acquired immune (Tough et al., 1997) , and nearly all B cells require the help of Th cells before they can mature and differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells. The conventional T cells played a critical role in tempering the inflammatory response recognized by innate immune system (Kim et al., 2007) . In this study, the results of immunoglobulins and T cell subpopulations showed that humoral immunity mediated by B cells was activated by LPS without CD 4+ cell (Th cells) increase, but cell immunity carried out by CD 8+ cells (Tc cells) was inhibited by LPS. Due to the role of BHT, the CD 8+ cell decrease was prevented totally (Fig. 4B ), but enhanced humoral immunity was still kept at a high level (Fig. 4C-E) . Therefore, BHT did not affect the activated adaptive immunity, but prevented the cell immunity inhibition and excessive cytokines in innate immunity by LPS at the same time.",19.34720481573397,11.893281243230888

IFN-γ induction by TGEV results from interactions between an outer membrane domain of El and the PBMC membrane (Charley and Laude 1988) ; however, these authors did not study the expression of IL-4 by PBMCs. The expression of IFN-γ was higher than IL-4 in the immunized group, and the Th1/Th2 balance was broken in our study. After immunization with recombinant Lactobacillus, IFN-γ played a major role in the mucosal immune response. However, after TGEV infection, the systemic and local immune responses shifted from Th1 to Th2. The systemic humoral immune response was stronger than the cellular immune response after TGEV infection. This is the first study to demonstrate that TGEV infection polarized the immune response to Th2 immunity and that recombinant Lactobacillus could weaken TGEV infection in the form of Th2 immunity. From these results, we found that the immunization did not polarize Th2 immunity more seriously compared to the PBS control group. The proteinbased SARS coronavirus vaccine boost induced similar levels of Th1 and neutralizing antibody responses that protected vaccinated mice from subsequent SARS-CoV challenges but induced stronger Th2 and CTL responses (Zheng et al. 2008) . The UV-inactivated SARS coronavirus vaccine retained its immunogenicity and promoted Th2type immune responses (Tsunetsugu-Yokota et al. 2007 ).

In this regard, dogs can suitably model the physics and challenges of vector delivery to large volumes of tissue and model potential adverse reactions of an evolved mammalian immune system (Wang et al., 2009) . The immune response to rAAV in canines has been investigated in several studies (Mount et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2007a Wang et al., , 2010 Yuasa et al., 2007; Ohshima et al., 2009; Halbert et al., 2010; Haurigot et al., 2010) . We and others have previously evaluated rAAV delivery to striated muscle (Yuasa et al., 2007; Gregorevic et al., 2009; Ohshima et al., 2009) and have observed significant humoral and cell-mediated immunity utilizing a variety of rAAV serotypes (Wang et al., 2007a Yuasa et al., 2007; Ohshima et al., 2009 ). However, canines used for research purposes are routinely vaccinated against several potential pathogens, one of which is canine parvovirus (CPV). CPV infection is associated with high mortality in young puppies and is very contagious (Patel and Heldens, 2009) . High risk of CPV infection necessitates early vaccination in the majority of kennels. Like AAV, CPV is a member of the Parvovirus family and shares significant sequence identity with AAV and other family members. As follows, any immune response generated against CPV vaccination has the potential to cross-react with other members of the Parvovirus family, including AAV.

Finally, HBD 2-conjugated S RBD interacted with C-C chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2), and Nod2 was involved in HBD 2-mediated CCR2 signaling, which was associated with the activation and M1 polarization of THP-1 cells. Therefore, HBD 2 promotes CCR2-mediated Nod2 signaling, which induces production of type I IFNs and an inflammatory response, and enhances primary innate immunity leading to an effective adaptive immune response to HBD 2-conjugated antigen.",17.583624888723847,9.596542721234773

Many viruses can replicate productively without causing cell death, and a number of them can cause persistent infections. In such instances, the initial dynamics resemble those of an acute infection, following which the virus titer decreases somewhat but then reaches a set point that may be maintained indefinitely or gradually decline. Examples of this pattern are hepatitis B virus (HBV), HIV, and LCMV of mice. Immune tolerance and persistent infection with nonlytic viruses. A virus that persists at a high level has to escape an effective immune response that would control the infection. Therefore, high-titer virus persistence is often accompanied by immune ""tolerance,"" an apparent absence of a virus-specific adaptive immunity. The mechanisms by which tolerance can be induced include deletion of ""forbidden"" clones of naïve T lymphocytes in the thymus, or exhaustion of peripheral virus-specific T lymphocytes in the presence of excess antigen (see Chapter 6, Aberrant Immunity). Tolerance may be limited to specific components of the effector limb of the immune response.

For instance, clone 13 of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) differs from the Armstrong strain by virtue of its ability to replicate more rapidly in dendritic cells and macrophages (professional antigen-presenting cells). The rapid destruction of dendritic cells by clone 13 interferes with antigen presentation, thereby suppressing the immune response which, in turn, permits the virus to escape clearance. As a result, clone 13 initiates a persistent infection without acute illness. In contrast, the Armstrong strain, which does not interfere with induction of adaptive immunity, causes a benign immunizing infection with rapid virus clearance. These differences have been mapped to just two amino acids in the surface protein of LCMV.

Potentially effective immune surveillance is circumvented by mechanisms such as antigenic variation, infectious immune complexes, or intercellular bridges. In contrast to most high titer persistent infections, lentiviruses induce immune responses rather than tolerance. The immune response to lentiviruses is quite effective, as judged by its ability to rapidly contain the acute phase of infection, resulting in a reduction from peak viremia at about 6 weeks to a set point about 1000-fold lower at about 3-6 months. Once this set point is reached, a dynamic equilibrium is established between virus production and clearance. The plasma half-life of individual SIV virions is <30 min in the absence of immunity and about 10 min in infected animals with an established immune response. It has been calculated that to maintain virus titers of 10 2 -10 4 infectious virions per ml of plasma requires the production of 10 10 -10 12 new infectious virions daily. In this instance, high titer persistence is maintained by an extraordinary rate of virus production that exceeds the rate at which a potent cellular immune response can clear virus-infected cells.

Evidently, pre-existing T-cell immunity established by previous infections from related viruses would be able to recognize the conserved epitopes and sometimes even cross-recognize the mutated epitopes, thereby helping the host to clear the novel viruses and also shed light on its universal vaccine development (Quiñones-Parra et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016b) . However, such pre-existing cellular immunity could be a double-edged sword. Sometimes, the host could mount cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) targeting the previous strains with weak responses to other immunogenic variants present, which is the ""original antigenic sin"" of T-cells (McMichael, 1998) . The ""original antigenic sin"" correlated with preexisting T-cell might result in anergy and enhancement of the disease (Cobey and Hensley, 2017).

With the possible exception of certain vertically transmitted virus infections and the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (prion diseases), there are signs of an immune response in all infections. Therefore it is to be expected that there will nearly always be some contribution of the immune response to pathological changes. Often the immunological contribution is small, but sometimes it forms a major part of the disease.

In the classical tubercle a central zone of bacilli with large mononuclear and giant cells, often with some necrosis, is surrounded by fibroblasts and lymphocytes. Mononuclear infiltrations, giant cells and granulomatous lesions are characteristic pathological features of TB.

Comparative analyses of the MmmSC-specific humoral and cellular immune responses were performed between animals recovering or dying from the MmmSC infection. Cattle recovering from an MmmSC infection are known to develop long-term immunity [6, 7] . Characterization of the MmmSC-specific immune mechanism generated, therefore, during the primary immune response and persisting in the regional lymph nodes of these recovered animals will thus unravel the basis of immune protection against CBPP and the MmmSC-specific memory response, responsible for the protective anamnestic response. Understanding the mechanisms operative in the development of these memory T-cells is a central goal in the development of effective vaccination strategies.",19.078371424087404,11.422260118040423

They have an adaptive immune response, in which the receptor is divergent to the jaw vertebrate recombinant antigen receptor. Interestingly, they use an unusual gene rearrangement process to produce receptor diversity [12] . Lymphocyte-like cells in the intestine of the sea lamprey were isolated, but no sequences with significant similarity to MHC and T cell receptor were found. The lamprey was considered to reach a stage for the emergence of adaptive immunity [3] . Although the above various factors were found in our EST sets, the similarity was still very low. Significantly, the heat shock protein was relatively abundant. More and more evidence showed that heat shock proteins participated in specific and non-specific immune response. Besides, the heat shock protein, as a molecular chaperone with antigen information, can promote spe- cific immune response and stimulate the body's immune response, but sometimes heat shock proteins can also activate immune reaction [26] [27] . Due to the lack of B cell, T cell receptor and MHC antigen in L. japonica, it was reasonable to estimate that L. japonica tried to make use of heat shock protein to carry out antigen targeting or activating immune reaction in the early adaptive immunity stages. The other representatives which expressed abundantly were involved in protein synthesis and energy metabolism, such as Blood plasma apolipoprotein LAL2, Ribosomal protein, NADH dehydrogenation oxidase, Cytochrome oxidase and ATP synthase. Previous studies had identified that Blood plasma apolipoprotein LAL1 and LAL2 were abundant in lamprey blood [28] . Here, our results demonstated that they were highly expressed in the liver. Apolipoprotein, playing the major role in transportting, dissolving cholesterol and phospholipids, was controlled by the apolipoprotein E gene which was secreted in the liver. Moreover, it also was responsible for inducing macrophage and cholesterolste accumulation, and significantly promoting macrophage proliferation. Mouse liver SAGE data analysis showed that apolipoprotein mRNA expression was higher than 3.8%. Furthermore, the genes which encoded plasma proteins expressed highly in L. japonica liver. In addition, our results also indicated that 123 transcripts corresponded to the Ribosomal protein.",17.747115141864747,10.651071300457563

Adjuvant possibilities for human application are very limited because of safety considerations and this may limit the application of monomeric subunit vaccines in humans. VLPs on the other hand have been shown to induce protection even without the addition of adjuvants (Li et al., 2004; Roy, 1996) . An alternative way to modulate the immune response is by the addition of recombinant cytokines as vaccine adjuvants. Cytokines can either be added separately to the vaccine or may be included in VLPs. This approach may not only modulate the magnitude but also the type of immune response (Lofthouse et al., 1996) . By carefully choosing which cytokine is added the immune response can be driven in a certain direction. Interferon gamma (IFN-) may be added to stimulate macrophages, while addition of interleukin-12 (IL-12) promotes cellmediated adaptive immunity (Abbas and Lichtman, 2005) . IL-12 can be efficiently produced with baculovirus vectors as functional dimers that shift the immunogenic balance to Th1 cells in bovine calves (Takehara et al., 2002) . IL-12 added to influenza VLPs enhances antibody responses but in this case VLPs alone already result in 100% protection (Galarza et al., 2005a) . Immune reactions to helminths involve Th2 responses. Interleukin-4 (IL-4) drives the immune response to differentiation of Th2 cells and to the production of heminth-specific IgE antibodies (Abbas and Lichtman, 2005) . Addition of IL-4 may therefore be helpful for vaccines against helminths (Lofthouse et al., 1996) .

The mammalian immune system has two major branches, innate and adaptive immunity. The innate immune system recognizes pathogen associated molecular patterns through a limited number of germ-line encoded pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs). The innate immune response is relatively nonspecific in recognizing pathogens and does not induce immune memory. In contrast, the adaptive immune system utilizes a large repertoire of rearranged receptors. The innate immune system acts at the early phase as the front line host defense whereas adaptive immunity plays a major role in eliminating pathogens in the late phase of infection as well as in generating immunological memory. A hallmark of the vertebrate adaptive immune system is its ability to remember an encounter with a foreign antigen even for a whole lifetime in cases of some vaccine or pathogen antigens (Kaech et al., 2002) . Acquired immunity develops by clonal selection from a vast repertoire of lymphocytes bearing antigen-specific receptors that are pre-generated via a mechanism generally known as gene rearrangement during an early developmental stage (Burrows and Cooper, 1997) .

Therefore, to enhance specific cellular immune response by vaccine administration is likely to accelerate the clearance of the virus and represents a potential alternative therapeutic method against SARS. As an internal protein of SARS-CoV, N protein is more conserved than surface protein such as S or M proteins, which makes it an ideal candidate for inclusion in a broadly protective vaccine for induction of cellular immune response.

Recognition of the latter was driven by clinical observations that antiretroviral therapy initiation in patients with AIDS [24] and antifungal therapy in some patients with solid organ transplants [25] could trigger IRIS-associated cryptococcosis [26] , and cryptococcosis in previously normal patients may be associated with aberrant inflammation [27] .

Measurements of anti-VLP titers can provide an important indication of vaccine efficacy with respect to the neutralization of a virus challenge, a cellmediated immune response also plays an important role in antivirus immune defense [126, 127] . Activation of a cellmediated immune response can also be the primary desired outcome of VLP vaccines, particularly for chimeric or other modified VLP vaccines that target non-virus pathologies. A potent cell-mediated response to VLP vaccines is dependent upon cross-presentation of VLP-derived antigens on MHC-I. CD8 + T cytotoxic (T C ) cells can recognize through MHC-I antigen complexes through their TCR, and become primed for activation. These antigen-primed T C cells require additional signaling for activation, including interaction with costimulatory receptors, and cytokines from T H cells.

Based on the supposition that the immune system can discriminate tumor from normal self, investigators have pursued immune-based treatments for cancer for over 100 years [7] . Over the past 30 years, a large body of data has been accumulated showing that cancer patients generate B and T cells that recognize antigens expressed on autologous pancreatic tumor cells [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . In addition, evidence has been obtained in animal models showing that mice deficient in genes associated with immunity (e.g., IFN [15] and perforin [16] ) are prone to develop cancer. Furthermore, extensive analysis of immune infiltrates in human tumors has demonstrated a positive correlation between prognosis and the presence of a humoral response to pancreatic tumor antigens, such as MUC-1 and mesothelin, and of tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic T cells and Th1 cells [10, 11, 17, 18] . By contrast, in a mouse model in which an activating K-Ras mutation is expressed in the pancreas, preinvasive pancreatic lesions are characterized by the infiltration of immune suppressor cells rather than immune effector cells, suggesting tumor immunity may be blocked from the inception of pancreatic cancer development [19] . All mice with the K-Ras mutation develop pancreatic adenocarcinoma and eventually die of disease. Finally, the finding that antagonism of negative T-cell regulators, such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated (CTLA) protein-4 and B-and T-lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA), can augment the antitumor immune response confirms that patients mount an immune response to their tumor [20, 21] . Despite mounting evidence that an antitumor immune response is elicited in cancer patients, this response is ineffective and does not result in the elimination of tumor. Given that most tumor antigens are self-or mutated self-antigens and that the pancreatic tumor microenvironment is immunosuppressive (discussed at length below), this is not surprising [22] . Of particular note are the findings that both the prevalence of Treg in peripheral blood and tumor, and expression level of programmed death-1 ligand (PD-L1) in tumor are independent predictors of poor survival in pancreatic cancer [23] [24] [25] . Tregs that constitute 5-10% of CD4 T cells induce immune tolerance by suppressing host immune responses against self-and nonself-antigens [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] , thus playing a critical role in tolerance and the immune response to malignancies. These findings strengthen the notion that pancreatic cancers induce antitumor immune responses. Thus, efforts towards improving the clinical efficacy of immune therapy should involve strategies to neutralize or overcome immune suppression.",18.01993191776521,9.179727645598316

Among all organs, most of these differences fall into olfaction, reproduction and the immune system 1 . Many of the differences in the immune system relate to innate immunity 2 , which ensures the survival of the individual during the first days after infection until the adaptive immune response can be tailored to the specific needs of the particular challenge. Since mice and men encounter virtually non-overlapping groups of pathogens due to their occupation of different ecological niches, these have shaped the innate immune system of the two species quite differently. These differences become especially important, because the innate immune system initiates both rapid and adaptive immune responses, and, therefore, human immune system reactivity towards vaccines, pathogens and human disease causing conditions in general are difficult to model in mice.

In this type of immune response the deposition of macrophages and virus-antibody complexes around small venules leads to a pyogranulomatous vasculitis that is responsible for the formation of effusions typical of wet FIP. If a strong cell-mediated immune response develops in the early stage of the infection, virus replication could be lowered and infection can be limited or successfully cleared with no evidence of clinical signs. Conversely, if the cell-mediated response is weak and unable to reduce virus replication an intermediate response can also occur with a continuous release of virokines and chemokines that recruit neutrophils and macrophages into infection sites. This leads to the formation of pyogranulomas, typical of dry FIP. Dry FIP may also become effusive in the terminal stage of the disease when the immune system collapses. Thus, the development of FIP depends on the balance between humoral and cellular immune response (Pedersen, 2009 ). The cytokine interferon-g (IFN-g) is one of the main modulators of cell mediated immunity (Berg et al., 2005) . IFN-g shifts the immune response from T-helper 2 to T-helper 1 with a consequent enhancement of immune cytotoxic activity due to the activation of macrophages and CD8+ T cells.

DNA Vaccines against Autoimmune Diseases of the CNS E. DNA Vaccines against Prion Diseases References 243,"The immune response to virus infection is divided into two components, the innate response and the adaptive response, which are serially expressed in partially overlapping temporal phases. Soon after the host is first infected with a virus, the innate immune response is activated. Many cells secrete interferons a and ~, while natural killer (NK) cells (and, rarely, activated macrophages) secrete interferon-y (IFNy). (IFNy is also an important effector molecule released by T cells during the antigen-specific phase of the immune response; this is described in more detail below.) Upon exposure to these cytokines, noninfected cells are rendered resistant to virus infection; the interferons therefore limit the ability of the virus to spread locally. Meantime the NK cell population expands, usually peaking approximately 3-4 days postinfection. These cells cannot specifically detect virus-infected cells, instead being triggered by a combination of 2 factors: poorly characterized stimulatory molecules, and the absence of class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. As the innate response wanes, so the adaptive response expands. The adaptive response differs from the innate in two key ways. First, the adaptive response is antigen-specific; it recognizes specific structures (usually proteins, but occasionally carbohydrates and glycolipids) on viruses or on virusinfected cells. Second, the adaptive response exhibits memory; antigen-specific cells are maintained long after the infection is cleared, and these memory cells permit a more rapid and elevated response if the host is reexposed to the antigen. Antigen-specific memory forms the cornerstone of vaccination; a vaccine induces memory cells specific for the appropriate antigen(s), and these cells respond rapidly, should the host encounter the related pathogen. This chapter is devoted to vaccination, and so we shall focus below on the adaptive immune response. All antigen-specific immunity relies on lymphocytes, of which there are two types: B lymphocytes (which produce antibodies) and T lymphocytes.",18.486926247898637,12.310051285801693

To use an attenuated vaccinia virus as a live vaccine vector, one critical question is whether or not this virus is still immunogenic for inducing specific immune response against foreign antigens. To address this question, the immune response against the vector and foreign antigen was determined. With a suboptimal dose of 10 5 PFU, MVTT 2-GFP and VTT induced similar levels of neutralizing antibody responses to VTT (Fig. 7) . GFP-specific humoral and cell-mediated immune responses were detected. The levels of these responses are comparable to those induced by a VTT GFP virus. Since GFP is apparently stable in the genome of MVTT 2-GFP , this virus can be developed further to become a live vaccine vector for infectious pathogens or tumors. In this case, the genes encoding the pathogen or tumor specific antigens can be placed in the genomic location of the GFP gene. In future studies, a comparative study using MVTT 2-GFP and other vaccinia strains (e.g. MVA) is essential to reveal the fundamental differences or advantages of these systems to serve as vaccine vectors. Considering that MVTT 2-GFP remains replication-competent in several mammalian cells tested, a correlation between dosing and vaccine efficacy needs to be evaluated, as would the non-invasive mucosal routes of vaccination. The latter is critical because the inoculation of vaccinia-based vaccine via mucosal route can induce immune response against foreign genes even in the presence of preexisting anti-vector immunity (Belyakov et al., 1999) . It was demonstrated that mucosal inoculation of vacciniaimmune BALB/c mice with recombinant vaccinia expressing HIV-1 gp160 induced specific serum antibody and strong HIV-1specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses. For live viral vaccine vectors, it is essential to evade the preexisting anti-vector immu-nity and to stimulate robust immune responses at the site of viral transmission (e.g. influenza and HIV-1). For individuals who did not receive smallpox vaccination (born after 1980), the preexisting anti-vector immunity is not an issue.",17.289320554391413,11.777628570913826

These responses are initiated by the innate immune system, which recognizes 'molecular patterns' (such as double-stranded RNA) that are unique to pathogens. The adaptive immune system -which consists of T cells that can kill virus-infected cells and B cells that produce pathogen-specific antibodies -then proceeds to mount a response. Initiation of the adaptive and/or innate immune response results in the production of chemokines and other cytokines that induce a pro-inflammatory response and attract cells, such as neutrophils and macrophages, to sites of infection. These cells, in turn, might release cytotoxic substances, such as matrix metalloproteinases. Although these responses are crucial to clear the infection, all of these processes can cause damage to normal host tissues. Indeed, 'side-effects' of the immune response account for many of the signs and symptoms in human infections: for example, during infection with hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, measles virus or respiratory syncytial virus [1] [2] [3] . Consequently, a 'normal' immune response often results in a transient disequilibrium of tissue homeostasis, and this is required for clearance of an infection but can contribute to disease.

Certain elements of the innate response were attenuated, perhaps because of the activity of the NS1 gene which is known to interfere with the immune response. In contrast, other immune responses, in particular inflammatory cytokines, were enhanced, resulting in a ""cytokine storm.""

The secreted IgA in plasma cells reaches membrane cavities through the epithelium and combines with membrane secretion to form secretory IgA (SIgA). Once they have been transferred to the membrane cavity, the SIgA will combine with specific pathogens (such as pathogenic microorganism toxin), and thereby produce certain immune protection. Subsequently, B lymphocytes activated in the mucosa, secrete serum type-specific antibodies into the blood, and generate certain immune protection. The cytokines in Th cells of the mucosal immune system also can activate cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and elicit a strong cellular immune response. Thus, transgenic plant vaccines can induce mucosal immunity and also cause humoral and cellular immunity.

Human leukocyte antigens (HLAs), known to play critical roles in immune response to viruses, contribute to the heterogeneity of the immune response to rubella virus as a result of their polymorphic nature, whereby HLA class I and II polymorphisms restrict the available repertoire of rubella antigens presented to T cells and therefore influence the subsequent immune response (Mitchell et al., 1996; Ou et al., 1994 Ou et al., , 1998 .

These studies have provided new insights relevant to two major goals in vaccinology: the elucidation of a vaccine's mechanism of action, and the identification of a molecular signature able to predict a patient's response to vaccination (i.e. whether or not the vaccine will confer protection). For instance, Obermoser et al. recently used blood transcriptome measurements to investigate the differences in immune response after vaccination with influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. They observed significant differences in the gene expression profiles elicited by the two vaccines, with the influenza vaccine producing a strong interferon signature and the pneumococcal vaccine producing an increase in inflammation-related transcripts [17] . The authors suggest that 'comparing global immune response elicited by different vaccines will be critical to our understanding of the immune mechanisms underpinning successful vaccination.' Methods that can model the interactions between multiple genes are crucial for providing a truly systemlevel view of the transcriptome and its response to vaccination (or infection). Regev, Hacohen, and colleagues have used a system-level perturbation strategy to reconstruct regulatory networks involved in the immune response. In dendritic cells they measured gene expression profiles after stimulation with pathogen components to identify candidate regulators of immune response. They then perturbed each candidate regulator using shRNA knockdown, again stimulated the cells with pathogen components, and observed the resulting changes in a gene expression signature of immune response. The direct responses to regulator perturbation allowed construction of regulatory networks [18, 19] .",16.99932552927219,7.02086033765196

IPA defines mitochondrial dysfunction as anything (genetic or environmental) that interferes with the regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) causing the superoxide to overpower the antioxidant system. ROS are potent elements in the mitochondrial antimicrobial defense system, and mitochondria may participate in the innate immune response by triggering the production of ROS (81). However, as is the case in the IFN pathway, microbes may have evolved strategies to manipulate such defense mechanisms, and any alterations in mitochondrial function may affect the immune response of cells to virus infection. For example, HCV is able to block the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (found on the outer membrane of the mitochondria) downstream signaling pathway, which leads to the expression of IFN β, thereby enabling HCV to evade host immunity (85).

For each pathogen, we scale the abovementioned two factors by considering the following five dichotomous variables that are measurable in practice. As an explanatory variable that would partially reflect antigenic stability, one can examine if a disease is caused by (i) an RNA virus or protozoa that is known to experience rapid evolution. As an indirect measure of evolutionary pressure, (ii) the existence of asymptomatic infection could act as a complementary factor that potentially mirrors the antigenic diversity. That is, if an infection involves a substantial fraction of asymptomatic infections, the infection is unlikely to impose strong clinical selection pressure, and thus, we regard it as reflecting low pathogenicity (or low virulence) or the infection caused by an evolved pathogen. Third, (iii) a high affinity to cells in blood and immune systems is considered as a variable that reflects the limited protection by humoral immunity (e.g. Mycobacterium tuberculosis in phagocytic immune cells can escape from humoral immune response). Moreover, (iv) the transmission via a common route (i.e. respiratory or through direct contact) is also considered as inversely associated with the requirement of cellular immunity, because the establishment of infection via the common route involves many opportunities of humoral immune response. Fifth, (v) the existence of interactions between different pathogens, including enhancement within an identical pathogen species and epidemiological interference between different pathogens, is considered, because the interaction can be consistent with both broad antigenic diversity (due to a rich multstrain evolutionary dynamics) 6 and also with the requirement of cell-mediated immunity (e.g. non-specific temporal immunity shortly after influenza virus infection is believed not to be humoral 7).",17.57999589071877,8.72196292389604

Here, we predicted both B cell and T cell epitopes for conferring immunity in different ways, but other recent studies about HCoV represented the T cell epitope only, and we want to express our greater findings here.56 There are several criteria that need to be fulfilled by a vaccine candidate epitope, and our predicted epitope fulfilled all the criteria.

Innate immunity is the critical first line of defense for the lungs. Adaptive immunity (acquired immunity) is antigen-specific and is required to ward off encapsulated bacteria, viruses, and intracellular pathogens. This form of immunity relies on immunologic memory and lymphocyte production of antibodies to nonself threats. Some important changes in the innate immunologic response occur with aging. Toll like receptors (TLRs) are key molecules in recognition and initiation of the innate immune response. In the context of aging, there are conflicting data regarding the impact of age on murine and human expression of TLRs or downstream signaling mediators.38,49–51 While some of these murine studies on monocytes and macrophages report reduced expression of one or several TLRs,34,49 another report demonstrates alterations in downstream TLR signaling involving p36.51 Reduction in p38 signaling is supported by studies in human monocytes from aged subjects, where dampened p38 signaling was associated with diminished phosphorylation of p38.37 Additionally, these authors observed a reduction in TLR1 but no changes in TLR2 expression. While the data are divergent on how aging impacts TLR expression, the data do suggest that alteration in the TLR pathways plays a role in an age-related aberrant initiation of the innate immune response and may contribute to an inability in rapidly recognizing and eradicating a pathogen. In studies of cigarette smoke exposure, elevated expression and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kβ murine neutrophil chemokines, CXCL1 and CXCL2, were observed in aged mice.52 This was accompanied by a protracted neutrophilia in the lung parenchyma.52 Moreover, following exposure to environmental toxins such as diesel exhaust, the increased pulmonary neutrophilia in lung parenchyma led to congestion and delayed clearance in aged animals as compared to young mice.53 These data suggest that inhaled pollutants cause a prolonged, aberrant pulmonary immune response, which may translate into increased tissue damage, playing a part in environmental, age-related pathology like COPD. Pulmonary infection with Francisella tularensis in aged rodents demonstrated delayed production of neutrophil chemokines in conjunction with an attenuated neutrophil recruitment at early times points,43 supporting the concept of an aberrant initial immune response with age. At later time points, inoculation of LPS into the respiratory tract of aged mice was associated with subsequent heightened levels of chemokines CXCL1 and CXCL2, IL-1β, and lingering pulmonary neutrophilia at 72 hours in aged animals as compared to young.44 Considering the delicate lung alveolar architecture and the highly hydrolytic enzymatic degranulation products of activated neutrophils, this may contribute to excessive tissue damage and reduced lung function over time.",18.240620784891327,10.983854830788014

The ability of an epitope-based vaccine to stimulate an effective specific immune response with a minute structure and without any unexpected side effects has made it a good choice for vaccine development.49 In this instance, we started with the preferable target, namely, the envelope glycoprotein, but failed to identify any unique conserved region (Figure S1; multiple-sequence alignment of the envelope glycoprotein of CCHFV.) to design a peptide vaccine against the envelope glycoprotein. This was also revealed by phylogeny analysis, which is shown in Figure S3; phylogenetic tree showing the evolutionary divergence among the different envelope glycoproteins of CCHFV. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, a product of the L-segment of the genome, comprises a unique conserved region among all the available strains of CCHFV (Figure S2; multiple-sequence alignment of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase-L of CCHFV). This was the pedestal to think about a novel vaccine candidate. To ensure a firm immune response, we looked for the activation of both T-cell and B-cell immunity with a single epitope.50 Antigenicity of the conserved peptides indicated their ability to provoke potential immune response and they were used for further analysis involving T-cell epitope prediction. Through the analysis of the output of both NetCTL and CTLPred, it was found that the epitope “DCSSTPPDR” would be the best candidate for the activation of T-cell immunity with potential antigenicity. Analysis of the MHC ligands for both type I and II revealed that the core epitope “DCSSTPPDR” would interact with the highest number of HLA molecules and that it would support the MHC molecules to present the epitope on the T-cell surface.

Some important molecules are involved in this process. For example, in Leishmania infantum infection, Dectin-1 and mannose receptor, two kinds of C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) expressed on macrophages, respectively activate Sykp47phox and arachidonic acid-NADPH oxidase signaling pathways, and they are crucial for reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and also trigger Syk-coupled signaling for caspase-1 induced IL-1β release. In contrast, specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin receptor 3 (SIGNR3), another kind of CLRs, helps parasite resilience through inhibition of the leukotriene (LTB) 4-IL-1β axis. Therefore, CLRs are key modulators for macrophage polarization, and are served as potential targets for prevention as well as treatment of Leishmania infantum infection 37. Arg1 is not only an important marker of M2 phenotype macrophages but also a regulator of the immune response in parasite infestation. A study using myeloid cell restricted Arg1 deficiency Schistosoma mansoni infection model suggested that Arg1 appeared to be a key mediator for the development of helminth infestation through restraining both unrestricted Th2-mediated fibrotic pathology and intestinal damage associated with increased Th1/Th17 cytokines, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) 2 levels, and endotoxemia38, 39.

Targeting viral immune-evasion pathways compromises the viral load and in general results in a reduction of pathology. However, unlike reducing the virus growth rate which not only reduces pathology but also reduces the immune response, 'directed' attenuation might instead increase the immune response. Using a simple computational model of the immune response to viral infection, we indeed find that disruptions of some, but not all, viral antiimmune responses can attain the desirable goal of reduced pathology without compromising the generation of immunity. Our model allows us to identify characteristics of the immuneevasion pathways that should be targeted to achieve the desired outcome. Changing more than one parameter in the model allows us to explore the consequences of targeting multiple virus pathways.

Virus is killed by innate and adaptive immunity at rates proportional to current immunity levels and the parameters k Z and k X respectively. Innate immunity, Z, is activated by infection and saturates at 1, so Z equals the fraction of the the maximum value of innate immunity. Adaptive immunity, X, grows in proportion to innate immunity (Z). This representation is a modification of that usually used, where the stimulation of adaptive immunity depends only on the amount of virus V . It is justified on biological grounds that the generation of immune responses requires stimulation by innate immunity and that this can occur even after replicating antigen is cleared. We let the extent of pathology, P , equal the maximum level of virus. The basic form is similar to that used previously [26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31] .

The final way which consider for evasion of innate immunity is by decreasing the rate at which innate immunity kills the virus. A vaccine strain of virus that has an increased susceptibility to innate immunity will have lower pathology and lower immunity (as seen in Fig 3) .

Early methods of attenuation were hit-and-miss, and these are now much improved by genetic engineering. But even current attenuation methods operate on the principle of genetic harm, reducing the virus's ability to grow, which in turn limits the host immune response below that of infection by wild-type. We use mathematical models of the dynamics of virus and its control by innate and adaptive immunity to explore the tradeoff between attenuation of virus growth and the generation of immunity. Our analysis suggests that directed attenuation that disables key viral defenses against the host immune responses may attenuate viral growth without compromising, and potentially even enhancing the generation of immunity.

Using a multifaceted structural approach, we reveal a specific area of high glycan density on MERS S that results in the formation of under-processed oligomannose-type glycan clusters, which was absent on SARS and HKU1 CoVs. We provide a comparison of the global glycan density of coronavirus spikes with other viral proteins including HIV-1 envelope, Lassa virus glycoprotein complex, and influenza hemagglutinin, where glycosylation plays a known role in shielding immunogenic epitopes. Consistent with the ability of the antibody-mediated immune response to effectively target and neutralize coronaviruses, we demonstrate that the glycans of coronavirus spikes are not able to form an efficacious high-density global shield to thwart the humoral immune response.
