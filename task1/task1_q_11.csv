In the early days of the H1N1 influenza pandemic in Mexico in 2009 [2] , social distancing measures were implemented with the aim of slowing the epidemic during its early stages.

For influenza, policy options are clearly outlined in national pandemic plans, but there is rarely any clear statement of policy objectives [12] . The problem is that these different objectives are potentially conflicting in their effects, and clear prioritisation is therefore necessary. Is the aim to minimize mortality and morbidity, is it to limit the peak prevalence of serious disease so that public health resources are not overwhelmed or is it to minimise the impact of the intervention on society and economy?

We assessed changes in time to hospitalization and isolation in relation to collective and public health attention to the epidemic, measured by three indicators (Google Trends, ProMED-mail, Disease Outbreak News). Results: Modelled importation events were found to reproduce both the temporal and geographical structure of those observedthe Pearson correlation coefficient between predicted and observed monthly time series was large (r = 0.78, p < 10 −4 ). The risk of secondary transmission following importation increased with the time to case isolation or death (OR = 1.7 p = 0.04) and more precisely with the duration of hospitalization (OR = 1.7, p = 0.02). The average daily number of secondary cases was 0.02 [0.0,0.12] in the community and 0.20 [0.03,9.0] in the hospital. Time from hospitalisation to isolation decreased in periods of high public health attention (2.33 ± 0.34 vs. 6.44 ± 0.97 days during baseline attention). Conclusions: Countries at risk of importation should focus their resources on strict infection control measures for the management of potential cases in healthcare settings and on prompt MERS cases identification. Individual and collective awareness are key to substantially improve such preparedness.",26.30692715511594,11.933486694823262

The World Health Organization (WHO) highlighted the value of national surveillance systems in the International Health Regulations (2005) , an agreement among all member states to develop and maintain sufficient capacity for the detection, reporting, and control of public health threats of international concern [2] . Infectious disease surveillance should enable (i) the timely detection of outbreaks, (ii) the quantification of health problems, (iii) the identification of subpopulations at risk, and (iv) the assessment of temporal trends including the impact of control strategies [3, 4] . National surveillance systems typically collect data from patients seeking care at sentinel hospitals or other healthcare facilities and can provide useful information for public health purposes. However, hospital-based surveillance generally underestimates disease burden since only a proportion of cases visit a hospital for care [5] . Low case detection may also undermine the value of hospital-based surveillance for outbreak detection. Moreover, if patients captured by the surveillance system are not representative of all cases in the community, surveillance statistics could lead to erroneous interpretations of disease patterns and misallocation of prevention resources. In particular, sex, socioeconomic status, or distance can affect healthcare seeking at hospitals, especially where access to care is limited [6] [7] [8] [9] . Surveillance evaluation guidelines, such as those established by the US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, list sensitivity and representativeness among the attributes that a public health surveillance system should possess and that require assessment [10, 11] . In order to follow these guidelines, we need external reference data that are often unavailable in resource-poor settings [12] .",25.971693942602833,11.874528324981258

This fact stresses the importance of health education in which parents and teachers play an important role. No protective effect was observed in the multivariate analysis for the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers. The use of masks could not be assessed due to the low number of responders to this question in the pediatric outpatient setting. Although there is limited data to support the use of face masks and/or respirators in healthcare and community settings, evidence suggests that given the potential loss of effectiveness with incorrect usage, general advice should be to only use masks/ respirators under very particular, specified circumstances, and in combination with other personal protective practices [20] . Other studies in our setting have found an adherence rate of < 50 %, and suggested that facemasks are not useful in reducing seasonal influenza infections in the community due to their low acceptance, although they could be effective in those who wore them [11] .

The random-based vaccination strategy randomly identifies a fraction of the population to vaccinate. The basic idea of degree-based, betweenness-based, and strength-based strategies is first to rank the importance of individuals and then vaccinate the individuals from highest importance to lowest. The degree-based vaccination strategy ranks individuals according to the number of contacts during the day of measurement for vaccination. The betweenness-based vaccination strategy prioritizes individuals according to their betweenness centrality [50] , capturing the extent to which a particular node lies on the bridge among different communities. The strength-based vaccination strategy ranks individuals according to their total time exposed to others during the day of measurement for vaccination.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) summary and literature update-as of 9 May 2014 in KSA suggested that more than 60% patients including health care workers have acquired infection in hospital setting. Besides, 15% of health care workers tested positive with MERS-CoV severe infection were either admitted to intensive care unit or died. Last update (7 March 2015) by European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control on MERS reported a total of 938 cases and 402 deaths in KSA, suggesting epicenter of outbreak, with health care workers at highest risk of acquiring infection. Mode of transmission was mainly by close contacts with infected person such as those caring for or living with them. However, virus transmission through a hospital cluster suggested that the mode of spread is through contact and in the form of droplets (2) . With reported morbidity and mortality of health care professionals contracted with MERS-CoV has pointed out inadequate infection control practices in health care settings. This led Ministry of Health to re-emphasize the need for strict compliance for infection control guidelines prescribed by World Health Organization (WHO) and Center for Disease Control and prevention (CDC) in health care facilities by creating awareness among health care workers. These guidelines encompassed standard precautions, droplet and airborne precautions and eye protection while dealing with suspected or infected cases of MERS-CoV (3) .

This research estimates the combined effectiveness of both control strategies and individual preventive behavior. The results imply that previous studies on control strategies are incomplete, and the control effectiveness might be under-estimated. The comparison between two model results indicates that preventive behavior of individuals has an extra effectiveness, in addition to the effectiveness from typical control strategies alone. This extra effectiveness produces an even smaller attack rate of influenza, lower epidemic peak, and earlier peak time. By considering the combined effectiveness, the control of influenza epidemics may not require as much health resources as estimated in previous studies. For example, the 80% TAP strategy could be replaced by the 60% one, reducing the burden of local agencies to prepare health resources. Likewise, the 10% workplace closure strategy, rather than the 33% strategy, would be sufficient to control the seasonal influenza epidemic in the study area. Enormous socio-economic disruptions could be possibly avoided. A low-level combination of the three strategies is recommended to suppress influenza epidemic in the study area, while a high-level combination is no longer a must. Particularly, with the help of individual preventive behavior, the 50% travel restriction strategy and the lowlevel combined strategy can successfully confines the spatial dispersion of influenza in the study area.",34.83308431156605,13.356747564940108

SARS had a dramatic impact on health care services and economies of affected countries, and the overall mortality rate was estimated to be 9%, but rising to 50% in those aged 60 or above [4] . A notable feature of this disease was its predilection for transmission in the health care setting and to close family and social contacts. The disease is presumed to be spread by droplets, close direct or indirect contact, but the relative importance of these routes of transmission is presently unclear. A study showed that viral aerosol generation by a patient with SARS was possible and therefore airborne droplet transmission was a possible means of transmission [5] . However, the role of fomites and environmental contamination in transmission of infection is presently still unclear. An outbreak of disease affecting over 300 residents in high-rise apartment block (Amoy Gardens) in Hong Kong could not be explained by respiratory droplet transmission from infected patients [6] . Infectious virus is detectable in the faeces [7] , and aerosolization of virus in contaminated faeces is believed to be the mode of transmission of this outbreak [8] .",28.16974696418893,14.236851580097657

Human contact networks exhibit strong community structure. Understanding how such community structure affects epidemics may provide insights for preventing the spread of disease between communities by changing the structure of the contact network through pharmaceutical or non-pharmaceutical interventions. We use empirical and simulated networks to investigate the spread of disease in networks with community structure. We find that community structure has a major impact on disease dynamics, and we show that in networks with strong community structure, immunization interventions targeted at individuals bridging communities are more effective than those simply targeting highly connected individuals. Because the structure of relevant contact networks is generally not known, and vaccine supply is often limited, there is great need for efficient vaccination algorithms that do not require full knowledge of the network. We developed an algorithm that acts only on locally available network information and is able to quickly identify targets for successful immunization intervention. The algorithm generally outperforms existing algorithms when vaccine supply is limited, particularly in networks with strong community structure. Understanding the spread of infectious diseases and designing optimal control strategies is a major goal of public health. Social networks show marked patterns of community structure, and our results, based on empirical and simulated data, demonstrate that community structure strongly affects disease dynamics.

First, the use of facemasks among health care providers on different social occasions and in media appearances was crucial for the construction of this new social norm and for normalizing the use of facemasks, because of their social power. Health care professionals, as a social institution, allowed them to exercise social control with respect to facemask use in the community, which motivated the participants to use a facemask during the SARS outbreak. Second, the participants used facemasks as a form of symbolic support for health care providers. Because facemasks were perceived as a tool for infection prevention, using a facemask did not simply prevent the participants from becoming infected, but by so doing, it also implied a show of support for health care providers in an attempt to reduce their workload and the burden on the health care system. Using a facemask was akin to a symbolic declaration that they were committed to reducing the burden on the health care system by preventing themselves from becoming infected. Such symbolic support for health care providers through facemask use extended further to the social implication of displaying civic responsibility.

National primary care bodies can coordinate with public health leads to cascade information to practitioners, communicate with the public, and collate health intelligence from the frontline primary care. 8 The Ebola crisis taught us a valuable lesson about what happens when an outbreak takes health workers away from core functions to focus on crisis response; the number of people who died from reduced access to usual care probably exceeded the number killed by the virus. 9 Strong health systems built on comprehensive primary care are able to integrate both functions, disseminating the emergency response resources and information required to community-level staff who have the breadth of training required to manage new suspected cases alongside routine family medicine.

The disease is caused by the zoonotic trematode worm Schistosoma japonicum with the Oncomelania hupensis snail serving as the intermediate host for the parasite [1, 2] . Historically, Jiangsu Province was among the endemic areas with the highest level of schistosomiasis transmission in China. Due to extensive control efforts with a particular focus on intermediate host control in the past three decades, the province reached the criterion of transmission control in 1976, and no acute cases were reported between 1978 and 1984 [3, 4] . After that, various environmental changes (e.g. frequent flooding) altered the level of disease endemicity; snail habitats re-established or expanded resulting in re-emergence of highly endemic areas and reappearance of acute human cases [5, 6, 7] . In 2005, the government of Jiangsu Province revised and strengthened the schistosomiasis control strategies by the implementation of a package of comprehensive measures, such as integrated chemotherapy with praziquantel for humans and bovines, snail control, improved water supply, enhanced sanitation with focus on personal hygiene and health education [8] . After 5 years of extensive implementation of this comprehensive control program, all endemic counties in Jiangsu Province reached the criterion of transmission control (i.e. ,1% human/bovine prevalence and absence of snail infection) [9] . After achieving this level of control again, the province embraced the next control objective -elimination of schistosomiasis transmission by 2020 [10] . Yet, challenges on route to this goal are present as traditional surveillance (e.g. focusing on infected humans and snails) is inadequate due to limited sensitivity of current diagnostic tools, which cannot support control strategies tailored to the new low-transmission situation [11] . In addition to host-based diagnostic methods, the use of mice challenge to assess environmental risk (the mouse bioassay), is widely used [12] . However, also the sensitivity of the mouse bioassay becomes unreliable when transmission levels decrease. These limitations present formidable challenges for surveillance and control, which have yet to be overcome, so a sensitive and field-friendly alternative is very much needed.",23.152855012468855,9.920777661878194

Consequently, it is not surprising that Ebola outbreaks have been amplified in health care settings [24, 25, 79, 80] including the ongoing epidemic in West Africa. Indeed, a total of 375 health care workers have developed EVD as of 23 September 2014 [81] . Fortunately, past experience also indicates that early and drastic enhancement of infection control measures in health care settings can substantially reduce the size and geographic scope of Ebola outbreaks [82, 83] . For instance, Figure 8 shows that the rising trend in infected health care workers during the1995 Ebola outbreak in Congo rapidly declined following the implementation of control interventions. The combined impact of the rate of diagnosing symptomatic cases and the relative infectiousness of hospitalized cases on the probability of observing major epidemics is illustrated in Figure 9 .",34.644271873293704,16.456813283761775

In addition to individual epidemiological data, the timing of such interventions should be recorded along with the scale and extent of interventions (for example, closure of class rooms or entire schools).

Hence, our current working toolbox available to control the spread of Ebola still hinges on supportive medical care to increase the survival of those infected and basic non-pharmaceutical public health measures [96] to prevent transmission, namely: 1) infection control measures including standard precautions in health care settings; 2) rapid contact tracing and isolation of infectious individuals; and 3) social distancing interventions in the community which may include the dissemination of awareness campaigns to inform the population on how to avoid contracting the disease, quarantining individuals potentially exposed to infectious individuals and restricting the movement of communities exhibiting local transmission to prevent onward transmission. These actions must be conducted in close collaboration with local community leaders to effectively reach the population at large. With the ongoing epidemic in West Africa, the development of treatments and vaccines against Ebola is accelerating [96, 97] . For instance, emergency use of a trickle of doses of an experimental drug with unknown efficacy or safety record in humans has been initiated during the outbreak [97] . Recent experiments in monkeys provide promising evidence that this experimental drug could have a significant impact on mortality burden during Ebola outbreaks [98] . Furthermore, a promising bivalent Ebola vaccine against the Zaire and Sudan Ebola strains is entering human safety trials in September 2014 [99] with an initial goal of building a stockpile of 10,000 doses by November 2014. Nevertheless, apart from pharmaceutical effects on the prognosis of infection, we have yet to examine how medication changes the transmission dynamics. Hence, careful studies could be useful for assessing the impacts of treatment on contact, transmission and diagnosis as well as on the disease burden [100] . If an Ebola vaccine is developed successfully, one could assess the effectiveness of pre-emptive and reactive treatment and vaccination plans in the context of limited stockpiles.

As a result, there is renewed interest in prevention of airborne disease transmission in health care facilities. Research has led to the development of useful methods for the prediction of various aspects of airborne disease transmission. Physical modeling of, and experiments on, aerosol transport have revealed mechanisms for dispersion, heat, and mass transfer of aerosols in different size regimes from submicrometer to millimeter. Many detailed infection models such as Wells-Riley model (1) and dose-response model (e.g., (5) to (9)) have been suggested for prediction of the spread of airborne disease in health care facilities. The current state of research has also shown that important sources for airborne pathogens including human activity (expiratory, resuspension, and shedding) and building microbial ecology (indoor environment and HVAC components). The viability and infectivity response of various airborne pathogens to environmental conditions, such as temperature and relative humidity, have also been understood and quantified in considerable depth. For example, animal tests, culture methods, molecular methods, and plaque assay methods have been used to measure pathogen viability and infectivity decay rates for many different classes of microbes although all these techniques suffer from substantial shortcomings. The effect of different ventilation strategies (mixing, displacement, and natural) on air exchange rates and the spread of aerosols has also been studied. For example, mixing type ventilation can achieve sufficient dilution of contaminated air to reduce the infection rate. A displacement ventilation strategy, if implemented successfully, helps segregate contaminated from noncontaminated air, thus reducing the infection risk. Under ideal conditions, natural ventilation has been shown to exhibit very high air exchange rates (and thus dilution) that reduce the airborne infection risk. In addition, various building codes have implemented preventive measures to reduce the airborne infection risk. For example, high efficiency filtration and high air exchange rates are mandated for critical care units (surgery and protective environment rooms), and exhaust outlets are recommended to be installed close to contaminant sources.",26.627631315826246,12.9075291486915

Results: Among 3048 respondents (response rate 38%) an average of 3.79, 3.69 and 3.88 floors were visited by each HCW each week in the 3 hospitals, with a standard deviation of 2.63, 1.74 and 2.08, respectively. Physicians reported the highest rate of direct patient contacts (> 20 patients/day) but the lowest rate of contacts with other HCWs; nurses had the most extended (> 20 min) periods of direct patient contact. ""Other HCWs"" had the most direct daily contact with all other HCWs. Physicians also reported significantly more locations visited per week than nurses, other HCW, or administrators; nurses visited the fewest. Public spaces such as the cafeteria had the most staff visits per week, but the least mean hours spent per visit. Inpatient settings had significantly more HCW interactions per week than outpatient settings. Conclusions: HCW contact patterns and spatial movement demonstrate significant heterogeneity by occupation. Control strategies that address this diversity among health care workers may be more effective than ""one-strategy-fitsall"" HAI prevention and control programs.",36.430476994864456,17.94176690185399
Early hospitalisation in facilities with the ability to isolate patients effectively-a key element of control efforts for Ebola,0.17961973313464688,1.4662020206451416,1.3116482496261597,770aac5b-be42-465c-bf43-0332d1f41112,comm_use_subset/Exposure Patterns Driving Ebola Transmission in West Africa: A Retrospective Observational Study International Ebola Response Team,"Early hospitalisation in facilities with the ability to isolate patients effectively-a key element of control efforts for Ebola-is clearly a priority to reduce community transmission. Investigations of the initial phase of this epidemic, as well as previous outbreaks, have highlighted the potential role of within-hospital transmission before or shortly after Ebola is identified as the causative agent [37, 38] . Here we found that hospitalisation, defined broadly as anything from visiting a clinic to admission to an ETU, reduced transmission risk, showing that prompt hospitalisation may be an effective intervention as long as appropriate control measures are applied. However, hospitalisation did not eliminate transmission risk, indicating that improvements in infection control are needed in many health care settings. It should be noted that the meaning of date of hospitalisation may be different among cases, depending on how many and which types of facilities they visited in the course of their disease, and furthermore that there is potential for misclassification in the recording or interpretation of information on hospitalisation. In particular, while the health care facility of first admission was commonly reported, patient transfers to other facilities may not have always been recorded. Thus, there may be ambiguity about the type of health care facility a case was in at a particular time. Such missing information reduces our ability to resolve differences between types of facilities in their effectiveness at implementing case isolation, which could lead to underestimation of differences between facility types in isolation effectiveness. However, our results are broadly consistent with analyses of the outbreak in Conakry [29] . Half of reported non-funeral exposures where the matched contact was eventually hospitalised occurred after the reported date of hospitalisation. These results underscore the importance of further improving infection control in all health care facilities, but particularly in non-ETUs. However, in contexts where hospital bed capacity is insufficient or infection control in health care settings is imperfect, greater consideration might be given to measures to reduce within-family exposure-for example, via education and/or providing a home protection kit with hand disinfectant, protective equipment, and clear guidance for those caring for sick family members.",39.788966256857236,15.731740865576377

The aim of this review is to identify and evaluate the existing economic evaluation literature in this area and to offer advice on how future evaluations on this topic should be conducted. Methods: We searched the Scopus database for all literature on economic evaluation of mask or respirator use to control respiratory infection transmission. Reference lists from the identified studies were also manually searched. Seven studies met our inclusion criteria from the initial 806 studies identified by the search strategy and our manual search. Results: Five studies considered interventions for seasonal and/or pandemic influenza, with one also considering SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome). The other two studies focussed on tuberculosis transmission control interventions. The settings and methodologies of the studies varied greatly. No low-middle income settings were identified. Only one of the reviewed studies cited clinical evidence to inform their mask/respirator intervention effectiveness parameters. Mask and respirator interventions were generally reported by the study authors to be cost saving or cost-effective when compared to no intervention or other control measures, however the evaluations had important limitations. Conclusions: Given the large cost differential between masks and respirators, there is a need for more comprehensive economic evaluations to compare the relative costs and benefits of these interventions in situations and settings where alternative options are potentially applicable.

VFR travelers typically take longer trips, stay in local homes or accommodations, eat locally prepared meals, and take fewer pretravel precautions. Many VFR travelers return to their country of origin with children who were born at the new place of residence and lack the immunity their parents acquired before migration.

On arrival, I discovered the veterinarians and farmers have been wondering why the disease does not follow the usual expected seasonal pattern. The PE exercise revealed that the movement of sheep for grazing (by farmers) based on the dynamics of the climate in the region is responsible for the peculiar distribution/pattern of the disease amongst sheep. In effect, the PE exercise helped me to better validate and appreciate the limitation of my model and to explain how host movement is critical to sustainable control of the disease. Additionally the farmers and vets got the answer they have been seeking for, by so doing, they have come to appreciate the significance and how the farmer's practice of host movement based on changes in climate predetermines the real-time seasonality of the disease in question on the farm (PE revealed what was right before their eyes all along).",24.873017711380307,9.622734722523603

These findings are important in several ways. lation has been previously noted by Lipsitch and colleagues [14] , we note that the strongest predictor for transmission having occurred is admission to a non-isolation ward. This has previously been suspected based on outbreak descriptions from healthcare settings. For example, in an outbreak of SARS among hospital workers in a community hospital in Hong Kong, it was observed that most staff was infected from exposure to patients with unsuspected SARS in non-isolation wards [15] . Similar observations of nosocomial transmission arising from unsuspected, non-isolated cases of SARS have been made across different countries and different hospital settings. These include other community hospitals [16, 17] , acute care wards [5, 18, 19] , intensive care units [20, 21] , and emergency rooms [22, 23] .

Based on WHO data, 1 in 10 MERS-CoV cases have been found to be health care workers; these patients generally have reduced disease and death likely due to younger age and absence of existing health conditions. The recent reports of numerous infected health care workers in Wuhan indicate human to human infection can occur with 2019-nCoV and may be the product of a super spreading patient [44] .

For measles, we found evidence of geographic variability that provides potential insight into the effectiveness of surveillance and public health interventions.

There is a rich literature around fertility control for management of roaming dog and wildlife populations [68, 69] . However, as rabies transmission varies little with dog density, reproductive control measures carried out with the aim of reducing dog density are not likely to be effective for rabies control. In theory, reducing population turnover (e.g. through improving life expectancy and/or reducing fecundity) could help sustain population immunity between campaigns and improve cost-effectiveness. However, there is little empirical evidence that dog population management tools have been able to achieve this [67] . Furthermore, even in populations with a high turnover, achieving a 70% coverage during annual campaigns has been sufficient to sustain population immunity above critical thresholds determined by R 0 [70] . The relatively high cost of sterilization also means that strategies which combine vaccination and sterilization are less cost-effective in terms of achieving human health outcomes than strategies based on dog vaccination alone, even in populations with a large proportion of roaming dogs [39] . Improved dog population management is undoubtedly a desirable longer-term goal for animal health and welfare and may have important secondary benefits for rabies control, for example by enhancing community or political support [67] .

This increase in capacity represents the transition from a small health care system to a medium health care system, as defined in Fig 5. This clearly shows the importance of early detection; the time delay in delivering the additional capacity is less important over this timescale of 0-8 weeks, because the existing health care system is capable of accommodating patients in the early stage of the outbreak. As expected, reducing the force of infection from both dead bodies and from infectious individuals in the community has a dramatic effect on disease transmission and substantially increases the likelihood of control (Fig 9) .

In the context of the ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in Liberia, Drake and colleagues, in this issue of PLOS Biology, employed an elegant modeling approach to capture the distributions of the number of secondary cases that arise in the community and health care settings in the context of changing population behaviors and increasing hospital capacity. Their findings underscore the role of increasing the rate of safe burials and the fractions of infectious individuals who seek hospitalization together with hospital capacity to achieve epidemic control. However, further modeling efforts of EVD transmission and control in West Africa should utilize the spatial-temporal patterns of spread in the region by incorporating spatial heterogeneity in the transmission process. Detailed datasets are urgently needed to characterize temporal changes in population behaviors, contact networks at different spatial scales, population mobility patterns, adherence to infection control measures in hospital settings, and hospitalization and reporting rates.",30.677008154310737,14.681671441407287

These additional interventions include the use of household protection kits, designed to reduce transmission in the community; improvements in infection control protocols in health care settings that reduce transmission among health care workers; and the impact of rapid diagnostic kits in Ebola treatment centers, which reduce the time to isolation for infectious individuals seeking hospitalization. Increasing awareness and education of the population about the disease could have also yielded further reductions in case incidence by reducing the size of the at-risk susceptible population (Fig. 3) [27] . Nevertheless, some of these effects could have been indirectly captured implicitly by the time-dependent safe burial rate parameter in their model. Importantly, prior models of EVD transmission [23, 28, 29] and the model by Drake and colleagues have not incorporated spatial heterogeneity in the transmission dynamics. In particular, the EVD epidemic in West Africa can be characterized as a set of asynchronous local (e.g., Figure 5 . Epidemic growth in two populations characterized by two different underlying contact networks. Random mixing leads to a rapidly disseminating infectious disease that spreads exponentially fast. By contrast, disease spread is significantly slower in a highly clustered contact network because the contacts of recently infected individuals are likely to be already infected by other infectious individuals. The contact networks are shown for illustration and are composed of a set of nodes (individuals) denoted by red dots while blue lines (links) between nodes denote static contacts. Each solid blue curve of cumulative cases corresponds to a stochastic epidemic realization of the simple SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed) [16] , while the dashed red curve corresponds to the average of 100 stochastic realizations.",28.19795148312118,14.135015724685521

The serial interval is defined as the time from illness onset in a primary case to illness onset in a secondary case [15] and has been estimated at 15 days on average for the ongoing epidemic [12] . The basic reproduction number, R 0 , quantifies transmission potential at the beginning of an epidemic and is defined as the average number of secondary cases generated by a typical infected individual during the early phase of an epidemic, before interventions are put in place [16] . If R 0 < 1, transmission is not sufficient to generate a major epidemic. In contrast, a major epidemic is likely to occur whenever R 0 > 1. When transmission potential is measured over time t, the effective reproduction number R t , can be helpful to quantify the time-dependent transmission potential resulting from the effect of control interventions and behavior changes [17] . Estimates of R 0 for the ongoing epidemic in West Africa have fluctuated around 2 with some uncertainty (e.g., [12, [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] ), which are in good agreement with estimates from past EVD outbreaks [23] . R 0 could also vary across regions as a function of the local public health infrastructure (e.g., availability of health care settings and infection control protocols), such that an outbreak may be very unlikely to unfold in developed countries simply as a result of baseline infection control measures in place (i.e., R 0 < 1) while poor countries with extremely weak or absent public health systems may be unable to control an Ebola outbreak (i.e., R 0 > 1).",25.86334722258721,12.139316021962223

To implement a successful POC diagnostics programme, the engagement of policy makers, stakeholders and partners to ensure buy-in and align necessary resources is a critical first step. Training and certification of vast number of health care providers to use POC diagnostics, and ensuring an effective supply chain for tests and drugs across the country present an enormous challenge to health systems that are already suffering from a critical shortage of human resources. Quality assurance systems, that include providing proficiency testing, sites visits, and corrective action, are essential to ensure that accurate results are being used to guide treatment decisions, and to ensure that control strategies are based on accurate surveillance data. Studies have shown that deployment of POC diagnostics can be an opportunity to improve health outcomes and strengthen health systems [29] [30] [31] . Overcoming challenges will in turn motivate health care workers and increase capacity and efficiency to test and treat appropriately. RDT introduction and implementation must be culturally sensitive and accompanied by an inter-connected system to monitor the necessary processes. Another key barrier to the appropriate use of POC diagnostics is the need to train clinicians to create a demand for them and then use the test results to effectively manage the patients.

These documents apply the same strategies to emerging diseases, and they are all similar in calling for more and better surveillance and laboratory diagnostics, as well as prevention and control actions in the field. However, we need a venue for considering new, complementary, integrative approaches that are especially pertinent to the zoonotic diseases. Zoonotic diseases require substantially different prevention and control strategies than is the case when the etiologic agent has long employed only human-to-human transmission for its survival. Acute infectious disease prevention and control strategies used in public health agencies were largely developed from experiences with the vaccine-preventable childhood diseases, sexually transmitted diseases, hepatitis, etc. With these diseases, traditional, clinically based or laboratory-based surveillance has provided the foundation for intervention activities such as vaccination or antimicrobial chemotherapy. For the zoonoses, prevention and control strategies have come from other amazingly diverse bases. At the heart of these strategies have been individual scientists who have spent whole careers accumulating highly specialized knowledge and experience. In fact, the work of these scientists might best be described as basic research-research that aims to understand the full context, the full ecology of the zoonotic disease of interest, while at the same time seeking the means for its control and prevention.

In a before-after design, the rate of health care-associated RSV infection among infants during the period that gowns and masks were routinely worn by HCP was not statistically different from the rate during the period when gowns and masks were not used (32% vs 41%). 20 A second prospective, randomized study failed to show that the use of gowns and masks prevented respiratory illness among HCP. 21 One factor in the ineffectiveness of gowns and masks in these studies may have been poor personal protective equipment adherence among HCP. In another study, as compliance with use of gowns and gloves increased from 39% to 95%, the incidence of health care-associated RSV decreased from 6.4 to 3.1 per 1000 patient-days. 22 Some have expressed concerns that the use of gowns and gloves may facilitate transmission by serving as fomites, particularly given the prolonged survival of RSV on rubber gloves compared with skin. 18 One study of seven Canadian pediatric hospitals actually noted an increased risk of transmission with the use of gowns, believed to be caused by decreased adherence of other infection control measures related to the overuse of gowns. 23 Another explanation for the lack of benefit from gowns and masks in RSV transmission may be from failure to protect the eye as a portal of entry. Two studies suggested that wearing eye protection is beneficial. 24, 25 Other studies have evaluated the effectiveness of a variety of measures in combination to prevent health care-associated RSV infection. A combination of cohort nursing and routine use of gowns and gloves significantly reduced RSV transmission compared with either intervention alone. 26 An intervention consisting of education, hand washing, consistent use of gowns and gloves, isolation or cohorting patients, restriction of visitors, and cohort nursing was associated with a 39% reduction in health care-associated RSV. 27 Transmission of RSV in a special care nursery ended after instituting cohort nursing; active surveillance; patient cohorting; a strict policy limiting visitation in the winter; construction of segregate areas; and the use of gown, gloves, and masks with all patient contact. 28 A similar intervention that included isolation or cohorting infected infants, hand washing, use of gowns, cohort nursing, isolation of asymptomatic high-risk infants, and limitation of visitors seemed to be effective in reducing transmission among infants from 45% in the previous year to 19%. 11 In general, multicomponent infection control measures have shown significantly lower rates of nosocomial RSV infections, although effectiveness of specific components remains unclear. 10 In addition to standard precautions, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends contact precautions for infected children and immunocompromised adults to prevent health care-associated RSV (Tables 1 and 2 ). 29 Some institutions use contact precautions for all RSV-infected patients. Contact precautions should continue for the duration of illness but may be extended for immunocompromised patients because of prolonged viral shedding. Additional interventions to prevent health care-associated RSV include cohort nursing and the exclusion from the hospital of ill HCP and visitors. Rapid RSV antigen screening has also been proposed to prevent health care-associated RSV. Rapid screening of symptomatic children on admission resulted in a greater than 50% decrease in the proportion of RSV infections that were health care-associated. 30 Screening of all pediatric admissions, regardless of the presence of symptoms, with cohorting of infected patients reduced the incidence of health care-associated RSV from 7.2 to less than 1 per 1000 patientdays. 31 However, rapid antigen detection is an insensitive method for diagnosing RSV infection in adults. 32 Palivizumab is a humanized mouse IgG monoclonal antibody that is effective in preventing hospitalizations caused by RSV infections, 33 and the use of palivizumab as prophylaxis for susceptible infants to control outbreaks in neonatal intensive care units has been described. 7, 34 The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that palivizumab be administered to the following groups of patients: infants younger than 12 months of age and born before 29 weeks gestation at the beginning of RSV season, preterm infants with chronic lung disease of prematurity who are born before 32 weeks gestation during their first year of life, and infants younger than 12 months of age with hemodynamically significant congestive heart disease. 35 There are currently no guidelines for more generalized use in controlling outbreaks of health care-associated RSV infections.",27.417876788733366,12.99632005698014

Immediate strategies are needed to reduce family caregivers' exposures to infectious agents. One strategy would be to simply restrict family members' access to the wards. However, this would be difficult because of health care workers' unwillingness or inability to provide patient care and because of the psychologic support needed and expected by patients from family caregivers. 8, 9 A possible short-term strategy would be to engage family caregivers in interventions to prevent hospital-acquired infections. 17 In a community-based intervention in Bangladesh, improved understanding of germ theory contributed to high acceptability of hygiene practices including hand hygiene. 18 Considering family caregivers' perspectives on contagious disease transmission and prevention, a health education intervention that uses culturally appropriate messages based on awareness of infections and the importance of hand hygiene could be developed. Such interventions would need to be simple enough for health care workers to implement them daily in the setting of high turnover rates of patients and family caregivers. Pilot interventions in some public tertiary care hospitals in Bangladesh could explore the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of such an approach. However, even when family caregivers are highly motivated, poor hospital infrastructure, including lack of water and handwashing stations, may be barriers to handwashing practices. In settings where handwashing stations with running water and soap are unavailable, use of hand sanitizer could be one alternative for cleaning hands. Hand sanitizer has been found to be effective in killing viruses and bacteria and has the added advantage that it does not require water. 19 However, family caregivers in Bangladesh may be unfamiliar with this cleansing agent and would require training on its use. In a low-income country like Bangladesh where the annual total per capita spending on health is $12 per person per year, 20 an additional training expense and cost of the hand sanitizer (US $2.5 per 200 mL; Square Toiletries Ltd, Dhaka, Bangladesh) could be cost prohibitive.

Airborne transmission is thought to potentially play a role in some settings, accounting for spread that has occurred in some apartment buildings in Asia. 3, 4 The first person who was diagnosed with SARS in Toronto had recently traveled to Hong Kong. The unfortunate woman died from the infection, and several of her family members developed the illness through household contact. In turn, these infected family members transmitted the infection to ED health care workers and patients before the implementation of isolation precautions. While the disease has been transmitted in the community, most of those infected are health care workers who were infected in patient care settings. 5 The first patient died on March 5, 2003.

The HPA has taken a substantial role in overseeing the surveillance and strategic direction of infection control in National Health Service (NHS) trusts. The HPA website describes its function as 'to protect the community (or any part of the community) against infectious diseases and other dangers to health.' The HPA acknowledges that 'decision makers must balance individual freedom against the common good, fear for personal safety against the duty to treat the sick, and short term economic losses against the wider implications of the potential spread of serious diseases', but it says little about the principles to be used in balancing these requirements. More detailed guidelines have been produced by the US Public Health Leadership Society, by other recent reports, and by a number of books, some of which have proposed a change in the definition and emphasis of public health. 9e12 Many of the actions available to public health professionals are also used in hospitals. These include surveillance, education, isolation of individuals, cohorting, treatment of infectious individuals, vaccination, and actions to contain risks associated with food, water, and airborne transmission of agents of infection.

SARS patients often require hospitalization because of the severity of their illness; those with less severe illness are sometimes hospitalized to ensure that strict isolation procedures are followed. In other settings, patients have been managed in residential settings after evaluation of their suitability for this purpose. Because the possibility of airborne transmission cannot be excluded, patients who require hospitalization should preferably be admitted to an airborne infection isolation room or specially adapted SARS unit or ward where they can be treated safely and appropriately.

The most effective mitigation strategies to prepare for the consequences of an outbreak would be to plan for the home quarantine of patients, establish public information strategies to reduce public concern, close affected facilities until conditions permit their safe reopening, plan for a coordinated information and command and control center, and have preestablished protocols and procedures in place to protect the health of health care workers and first responders. 24 Vaccination is an essential component of hospital and community mitigation planning. During the fall of 2002, the U.S. government requested that all states prepare for a smallpox attack. The preparations called for each state to present plans to vaccinate all persons within the state, within a 10-day period, starting with health care workers. 25 Each facility and community needs to look at the risk of a disease, the effect of vaccination on health care workers, and the ability to maintain continuity of care. One outcome of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic was that several organizations, including the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA), the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC), and the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) recommended that health care workers be mandated to receive yearly influenza vaccinations, which helps to minimize the risk that they will transmit influenza to high-and low-risk patients and bring influenza home to their families. If properly informed and vaccinated, health care workers could respond and treat patients without risk to themselves or their families. The availability of a vaccine and the ability to mass-vaccinate the majority of the population should be considered in all community response plans.

This indicates that curbing the travel of symptomatic individuals alone during an epidemic is an insufficient public health strategy to control the spread of a chikungunya epidemic. In fact, Fig. 4 demonstrates that the ability of these individuals to travel or not has little impact on the peak disease incidence. While other measures of epidemic severity could have been adopted (e.g. cumulative incidence, epidemic duration), the peak incidence reflects the point at which the demand on health services would be at its highest and is an important quantity to consider when assessing the effectiveness of disease control strategies. Any intervention aimed at restricting the travel of overt clinical cases would also require detailed contact tracing of symptomatic individuals in an effort to identify exposed and asymptomatic individuals. The isolation of such individuals could be implemented to limit exposure to mosquitoes. Such strategies are actively implemented in chikungunya affected countries such as Singapore and Brunei (Ho et al., 2011; Liew and Yung, 2012) . Contact tracing and isolation of cases is considered an effective and easily implemented public health measure for newly emerging pathogens when the number of cases is low.

For example, the filtered particulates in health care settings are mainly infectious biologic aerosols, rather than nonbiologic aerosols. These biologic aerosols present unique challenges to ensure that the respirator does not contribute to disease transmission. Furthermore, current methods of testing respirators may not represent how respirators are used in health care. For example, a controlled environment, such as a hospital, does not have the levels of airborne dust and particulate matter typically seen at a manufacturing plant. Any respirator designed specifically for HCP should focus on diminishing infection from exposures to biologic hazards as its primary goal and focus less on particulate load capacity or other enhancing features, such as exhalation valves that could potentially contaminate the surgical field and are not compatible with many health care settings.

This risk assessment highlights the need for Singapore to stay vigilant and to continue enhancing core public health capacities to detect and respond to MERS coronavirus.",25.937452980317133,12.604722386552005

When facing an outbreak, a range of strategies can be implemented to control its magnitude. Their effect will depend on the epidemiology of the infectious agent, the host population dynamics, and the scale of the epidemic. Interventions may achieve a reduction in transmissibility by affecting one, or any combination, of the components of R 0 : the contact rate, the probability that a contact leads to infection and the infectious period. Therefore, if the values of the components that an intervention acts upon and R 0 are known, the effectiveness of an intervention at reducing these components required to prevent the spread of infection can be obtained.

Simulation models for HAIs have also become more complex in terms of the settings being modeled. Earlier studies generally modeled a single ward (usually an ICU) or a simplified hospital lacking of any further ward structure whereas more recent studies were likely to incorporate different types of wards (ICUs and general wards), as well as consider the transmission across health facilities (eg, mainly between hospitals), and the community. Future studies could investigate interactions with LTCFs, other types of health care facilities, and the community to provide a more realistic estimate of HAI incidence and prevalence, and the effectiveness of IPC policies. Pediatric settings were rarely considered although pediatric patients have higher rates of viral lower respiratory tract infections and bloodstream infections than adults, especially those younger than 2 years of age and those demanding care in neonatal ICUs and pediatric ICUs. 95 As the most popular transmission routes of infections in health care settings are via the transiently colonized hands of HCWs and/or contaminated medical equipment and the environment, modeling interactions between patient and HCW has dominated this field of research, followed by the environmental reservoir for transmission although to a much lesser extent. Simulation modeling studies have hardly considered direct HCW-to-HCW contact or interactions between visitors/caregivers and patients. Visitors and/or family caregivers can play a very important role in infection transmission in a health facility, especially in settings such as pediatric or geriatric health facilities where patients often need extra care. In many cultures including Asian countries and LMICs, having visitors and caregivers on a regular basis is common practice and sometimes encouraged owing to a considerable shortage of staff and a need to reduce medical costs to patients. 56 Because visitors and caregivers are also more mobile than patients, they are both highly susceptible to contracting infections and potentially able to transmit pathogens to various locations inside and outside as the hospital. 78 When to use which simulation modeling methodology",37.17818890805168,15.643076004368991

Physicians have been encouraged to routinely culture skin lesions to determine if community-acquired MRSA is the cause, and in geographic areas where community-acquired MRSA are relatively common, empirical therapy of such infections with clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (co-trimoxazole), doxycycline or minocycline, or linezolid is becoming common. If empiric clindamycin is administered, testing community-acquired MRSA isolates for inducible clindamycin resistance by using the ""D-test"" is recommended. 19 By contrast with the Netherlands and some other parts of northern Europe, no standard set of measures has been adopted in all health-care facilities in the USA for controlling transmission of MRSA. Measures recommended by the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America for controlling health-care-associated MRSA include the use of screening cultures to detect colonised patients, placing patients in private rooms or cohorting patients, wearing gloves for room entry, gowns for substantial contact with patients or their environment, and hand hygiene before and after patient contact. 20 However, there is considerable debate among experts in the USA about whether or not the use of screening cultures to detect patients at high risk of MRSA is necessary or practical in all health-care settings. Given the considerable body of evidence that screening cultures, when combined with contact precautions, are beneficial and cost-effective, [20] [21] [22] it is disconcerting that a recent survey of infectious disease consultants found that only 50% of 463 respondents favoured the use of screening cultures to detect multidrug-resistant pathogens, and only 30% worked in facilities where screening cultures were routinely done. 23 The costs of surveillance cultures, potential logistic problems that may result from an increased number of patients requiring isolation, and lack of controlled trials demonstrating the efficacy of screening cultures are often cited as concerns by those who do not use screening cultures. Further studies are necessary to establish the relative efficacy of control measures such as screening cultures, cohort nursing, increased staffing levels, and improved hand hygiene adherence rates in controlling transmission of MRSA in health-care facilities. 24 At present, there is no consensus regarding which measures are most appropriate for reducing transmission of community-acquired MRSA in community settings and for preventing the spread of these strains in health-care facilities.",31.681745704813405,12.520158888778349

First, the transmission patterns of HAIs in LMICs require further studies because they are likely to be dramatically different from those in HICs owing to many factors such as poor infrastructure, insufficient environmental hygiene conditions, different staff cohorting, shortage of HCWs, the knowledge and compliance of HCWs to IPC measures, overcrowded health care facilities, absence of comprehensive IPC guidelines and policies, lack of procedure, and different antibiotic prescribing and referral patterns. Second, pediatric hospitals and other types of health care setting-like LTCFs, as well as interactions between settings were not extensively investigated. Furthermore, understanding of patient sharing and referring networks among health care facilities driven by operational and financial alliances needs to be improved. Third, the number of studies adopting hybrid simulation models are still limited, possibly because of the unavailability of clear guidelines and frameworks for hybrid model development. Because it is argued that most, if not all, real-world problems tackled with simulation modeling cannot be solved by SD, DES or ABM alone but require a combination of 2 or all of them, a hybrid model resulting from this combination expectedly offers different perspectives of a problem and generate more insights, which will provide better understanding and greater support for decision-making. 100 The use of simulation modeling for economic analysis of different IPC measures and strategies has increased but is still relatively scarce. The application of this methodology to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of various IPC strategies is promising in a sense that it can appropriately guide and prioritize the allocation of limited resources and funds. Additionally, an understanding of other kinds of interactions in the health care setting apart from interactions between doctors and/or nurses and patients is insufficient. Last, the evaluation of clinical and cost effectiveness was only conducted for a number of commonly used interventions like hand hygiene, isolation, and screening, further investigation on other IPC measures and a combination of different strategies is imperative to determine best practice in various health care settings.

Specifically, CDC makes recommendations for ambulatory care settings that include dental offices. Challenges may exist when adapting Transmission-Based Precautions to dental offices rather than to inpatient facilities. For example, dental office staff members may not be able to identify patients with infections immediately, patients frequently remain in common waiting areas for prolonged periods and treatment rooms may be turned around quickly with limited cleaning. 8 Transmission-Based Precautions were mentioned in CDC's 2003 infection control guidelines for dental health care settings, 1 but not to any great extent. The same is true for dental infection control textbooks and journal articles; the main focus generally is on Standard Precautions. This may be because patients usually do not seek routine dental outpatient care when they are acutely ill with diseases that require Transmission-Based Precautions. 1 Nonetheless, a general understanding of precautions for diseases transmitted via all routes is important, because some dental health care personnel (DHCP) are hospital based or work part time in hospital settings, patients infected with these diseases might seek urgent treatment at outpatient dental offices, and DHCP might become infected with these diseases. 1 Also, recently, several diseases requiring precautions beyond Standard Precautions (for example, MRSA or 2009 H1N1 influenza) have received extensive media coverage, and some dental professionals have inquired why there were not specific infection control recommendations to cover these conditions in ambulatory care dental settings.",33.151105845651855,16.096078312038024

During the outbreak of SARS, use of masks in the general population in Hong Kong was high enough to observe an effect on all respiratory infections Lo et al., 2005) , and face mask use did prevent SARS infections in health care workers . Medical masks have been widely used for 50 years, and respirators were later specifically designed for respiratory protection . Bischoff, Reid, Russell, and Peters (2011) found that N95 respirators provided improved protection compared to medical masks (surgical masks). In addition, that study also described the equal importance of wearing goggles to enhance eye protection. For other diseases that are mainly transmitted through aerosols, such as measles, chickenpox, and other viruses, the surgical mask is not adequate in providing protection against viruses transmitted through aerosols, and filter was needed within the face mask. Nevertheless, there are different opinions regarding the efficacy of face mask for personal isolation and protection. Although Smith et al. (2016) have showed the efficacy of N95 respirators and surgical masks in protecting healthcare workers against acute respiratory infection in a meta-analysis, the study also reported that there was no significant difference between N95 respirators and surgical masks in preventing the transmission of acute respiratory infection for the protection of healthcare workers. Large-scale randomized controlled trials are likely needed to evaluate the efficacy of N95 respirators in the prevention of acute respiratory infection. In addition, reuse of facemasks and respirators is widespread globally, but for its safety, the researchers have inconsistent views and lack clinical evidence (MacIntyre and Chughtai et al., 2015; Loeb et al., 2009) . We previously reviewed the use of face masks during the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic (Cowling, Zhou, Ip, Leung, Aiello, 2010) , and found that there is some evidence to support the wearing of masks or respirators during illness to protect others from being infected, and more studies in controlled settings and studies of natural infections in healthcare and community settings are needed to better define the effectiveness of faces masks and respirators in preventing influenza virus transmission.",29.582071230367966,13.648782596930516

In medicine, it is the interaction between the care provider and the patient that leads to the most ethical issues. In this interaction, medical ethics seeks to protect the autonomy of the patient. In public health, however, most ethical issues arise from the interaction between an agencysuch as a city health departmentand the population it is serving. A public health agency is often protecting some people within a population from others. For example, it may need to isolate an infectious person in order to prevent transmission to others.

Therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend contact and airborne precautions for any initial suspected case of avian influenza in a human. In late October 2006, the CDC released an updated interim guidance on the use of masks and respirators in the health care setting (Table 3 ). In certain high risk procedures, additional protection with an N-95 particulate respirator may be considered given the likelihood of generating aerosol particles that may enhance transmission (Table  4 ). Respiratory protection should be worn along with an impermeable gown, face shield, and gloves. Initial cases should be placed in a negative pressure isolation room with 6-12 air changes per hour. Hand hygiene with antibacterial soap or alcohol based washless gel should be standard, with appropriate basins at each patient room. Seasonal vaccination of all health care workers should be preformed and emphasized to reduce spread. Visitors and family members should be strictly monitored and limited to reduce the likelihood of spread. Finally, antiviral chemoprophylaxis should be available to any health care workers with exposure to an infected individual. Any symptomatic worker should be taken off duty and workplace surveillance should occur.

Immediate strategies are needed to reduce family caregivers' exposures to infectious agents. One strategy would be to simply restrict family members' access to the wards. However, this would be difficult because of health care workers' unwillingness or inability to provide patient care and because of the psychologic support needed and expected by patients from family caregivers. 8, 9 A possible short-term strategy would be to engage family caregivers in interventions to prevent hospital-acquired infections. 17 In a community-based intervention in Bangladesh, improved understanding of germ theory contributed to high acceptability of hygiene practices including hand hygiene. 18 Considering family caregivers' perspectives on contagious disease transmission and prevention, a health education intervention that uses culturally appropriate messages based on awareness of infections and the importance of hand hygiene could be developed. Such interventions would need to be simple enough for health care workers to implement them daily in the setting of high turnover rates of patients and family caregivers. Pilot interventions in some public tertiary care hospitals in Bangladesh could explore the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of such an approach. However, even when family caregivers are highly motivated, poor hospital infrastructure, including lack of water and handwashing stations, may be barriers to handwashing practices. In settings where handwashing stations with running water and soap are unavailable, use of hand sanitizer could be one alternative for cleaning hands. Hand sanitizer has been found to be effective in killing viruses and bacteria and has the added advantage that it does not require water. 19 However, family caregivers in Bangladesh may be unfamiliar with this cleansing agent and would require training on its use.

Would intensive care treatment offer any benefit to patients with Ebola infection? At the time of a UK national policy meeting in late 2014, many felt that interventions such as mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy would pose a risk to staff without making any difference to the patient's eventual death. There were a few dissenting opinions, including those expressed by staff at the Royal Free Hospital. Not long after the UK meeting, a report was published of successful ventilation and dialysis of a patient in the USA, suggesting that the policy of not offering advanced treatment in the UK was unnecessarily nihilistic. 11 On this background, one of the biggest worries for doctors, nurses, and other workers travelling to assist in West Africa was whether we would be repatriated to the UK if we contracted the disease we were treating. It was clear that although in our tented facility in the jungle south of Freetown we were able to provide a higher level of care than that available elsewhere in Sierra Leone, we did not have the equipment for respiratory or renal support. 12 One of the factors in whether health-care workers volunteer is probably how they think they will be treated if they develop an infection that has a 70% patient fatality rate in Africa but a 95% survival rate in Europe or the USA. One could argue on ethical grounds that volunteers who were encouraged to travel to West Africa by the NHS to assist in the epidemic should be supported to the full extent possible by the UK, including evacuation for care in a specialist unit.

Use of effective chemoprophylaxis requires that the infectious agent be susceptible to the antimicrobial drug used. As a primary prevention strategy, it may be used before or after exposure to prevent infection. Examples of chemoprophylaxis in the postexposure setting include erythromycin after exposure to pertussis; rifampin after N. meningitidis; amantadine, rimantadine, zanamir, or oseltamivir after influenza A virus; and zidovudine after HIV exposure. Use of antiretroviral drugs by HIV-infected pregnant women has been shown to substantially reduce the risk of perinatal HIV infection. 128 Prophylaxis against surgical wound infections with broad-spectrum coverage before surgery and prophylaxis of neonates against ophthalmia neonatorum are examples of chemoprophylaxis used in the hospital setting. In such situations, chemoprophylaxis is origin, socioeconomic status, and geographic location. For example, persons born outside the United States are at increased risk for infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and for being chronic carriers of infections such as hepatitis B. Screening programs targeted to these populations, with subsequent interventions such as isoniazid prophylaxis for persons with M. tuberculosis infection or immunization of susceptible household contacts of HBV carriers, can serve as important community-based strategies to prevent infectious disease occurrence. [115] [116] [117] Another example of defining risk at the community level is assessing behavior that increases the risk for specific diseases, such as injection drug use as a risk behavior for acquiring HIV or HCV infection. Education and drug treatment programs targeted to this population can serve as an important disease prevention and control strategy. Finally, assessing the population of species-specific mosquitoes and viability of local breeding sites can provide a risk assessment of the likelihood of vector-borne disease transmission (e.g., West Nile virus infection). 118, 119 In developing control programs, the feasibility of a strategy also needs to be assessed. Feasibility is dependent on the sociodemographic factors of the population involved. For example, high immunization rates can clearly prevent the occurrence of infectious diseases. In the United States, immunizations should be readily available; however, in the late 1980s, numerous large outbreaks of measles occurred in U.S. inner-city populations because of low immunization rates. 120 A variety of sociodemographic factors contributed to these low rates, such as inadequate access to medical care and other barriers to immunization. Until such barriers are removed and control strategies are developed to specifically target at-risk populations, adequate control of vaccinepreventable diseases in the United States cannot be accomplished. 121 Cost and availability of resources also need to be considered when developing control strategies. Adequate water treatment facilities and distribution systems in developing countries would do much to eliminate the spread of cholera. However, in many countries, resources to build and develop such facilities are not available. Consequently, control strategies need to be focused on simpler, less expensive methods, such as boiling water or improving water storage in the home.",29.80673651493175,12.710380975492836

Investigators must understand the local context regarding available healthcare-seeking behaviours, as well as barriers to care.

Children with severe disease might not make it to a referral hospital if they have insufficient funds or resources for further transportation from a health post or centre. Lastly, the cost of health care at the referral facility might impede the child from receiving appropriate care. As with any community-based trial, there is rarely a universal approach.

[80] [81] [82] [83] [84] Accepting an inability to quantify the absolute risk of pathogen acquisition directly from health care workers' hands, there is good circumstantial evidence that such transmission accounts for a substantial proportion of HAP transmission. It has become widely accepted that hand hygiene, as noted by Palamore and Henderson, is ""critically important for the prevention of HAIs."" 85(p8) In response, many health care organizations have undertaken extensive, resource-intensive efforts to improve hand hygiene compliance. 86 Despite extensive translational research and strong support from accrediting institutions over the past 10 years, the enthusiasm for quickly reaping substantial benefits from optimizing hand hygiene practice has been tempered by the realization that acceptance inertia, psychological barriers, suboptimal application of technique, and, most particularly, the pressures of providing direct patient care have had an adverse impact on the effectiveness of this intervention. 87 These issues, along with the challenges of performing hand hygiene as recommended by the World Health Organization ""five moments"" construct while caring for acutely ill patients and the fact that 10% to 60% of patient zone surfaces contain HAPs, make it likely that pathogen-contaminated environmental surfaces will negate some of the benefits of optimized hand hygiene practice. 11, 43, 88 Given that patient zone surfaces not contaminated by HAPs cannot be a source of pathogen transmission even in the absence of hand hygiene, further consideration must be given to viewing both environmental hygiene and hand hygiene as interdependent interventions. When viewed in this manner, it becomes evident that the mandates and challenges of these 2 interventions represent an inverse continuum (Fig. 5) . For example, in the ICU setting, where hand hygiene often becomes logistically challenging and glove use without hand hygiene is frequent, there would be a particularly strong mandate to optimize hygienic cleaning. In contrast, in ambulatory settings, where there are few intrinsic barriers to hand hygiene, enhanced hygienic cleaning practices would not be strongly mandated. In this context, the specific elements of hygienic practice can be characterized along a complexity gradient (Fig. 6) . By relating these constructs to the various settings (Fig. 7) , interventions can be defined along the continuum outlined to provide a framework for analyzing and prioritizing the relative cost/benefit of different levels of complementary hygienic practices (see Fig. 7 ). By characterizing intrinsic patient/personnel risk and setting modifiers, a particular site can be moved up or down diagonally along the range of settings. For example, if an immunologically compromised person was in an ambulatory care setting, it would Optimizing Health Care Environmental Hygiene Carling be reasonable to consider moving to a higher level of hygienic cleaning intervention than otherwise is warranted. Similarly if the patient population in a long-term care setting required only minimal assistance, it would be reasonable to move down the intervention continuum toward noninpatient health care settings. Once the particular features of a setting are defined in this manner, the constructs can be used to develop programmatic interventions that maximize the components of health care hygienic practice for the best cost/benefit to improving patient/personnel safety.",28.65813958657246,12.138563567443304

Objectives: To study the prevalence and turnover of ABU in a population of elderly people, ages 80 and over, living in a noninstitutional community setting. Methods: Design: A longitudinal cohort study. Setting: The catchment area of a primary health care center in a Swedish middle-sized town. Participants: Every resident in the area age 80 and over was invited and of those 74%, 294 women and 138 men, participated. Measurements: At baseline and after 6 and 18 months a urine specimen was cultured and if positive, the culture was repeated within two weeks to confirm ABU.

Prehospital protocols should direct potential SARS cases to the hospitals best able to evaluate and treat these cases. Other factors to consider in forming protocols include: availability of isolation rooms in the ED and hospital, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) capabilities, diversion contingency plans, inventories and supply of PPE and medications, periodic interdepartmental tabletop exercises, regular review of the hospital disaster plan, crowd and media control, security, notification of public health and government officials, and new laboratory capabilities as they become available.

Such uncertainty and unpredictability of pandemic outbreak of infectious disease from its clinical presentation, infectious causes, epidemiological features, fast transmission pattern, seriousness of public health impact, novelty, scale, implication for international public health, and underprepared health facilities to address the pandemic outbreak of COVID-19 have considerably high potential for psychological fear contagion as well and often result in prevalent multitude of psychological problems such as fear, anxiety, stigma, prejudice, marginalization towards the disease and its relation of all people ranging from healthy to at-risk individuals to care-workers (Mak et al., 2010) . Mass quarantine could cause a sense of collective hysteria, fear, and anxiety in health workers working in hospitals, inpatient and outpatient care, large tertiary care centers, community based hospitals, primary care settings, nursing homes, assisted living facilities and all isolation units.

With the advent of COVID-19 in Pakistan, medical workers have been under physical and psychological pressure including high risk of infection, inadequate equipment for safety from contagion, isolation, exhaustion, and lack of contact with family. The severity is causing further mental health problems which not only effect medical workers' decision making ability but could also have long term detrimental effect on their overall well-being. The unremitting stress medical health-care workers is experiencing could trigger psychological issues of anxiety, fear, panic attacks, posttraumatic stress symptoms, psychological distress, stigma and avoidance of contact, depressive tendencies, sleep disturbances, helplessness, interpersonal social isolation from family social support and concern regarding contagion exposure to their friends and family. The sudden role reversal from a J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f healthcare provider to the COVID-19 confirmed or suspected patient potentially lead to sense of frustration, helplessness, and adjustment challenges in healthcare professionals. Fear of labeling, stigmatization and discrimination potentially impede healthcare workers intent to seek counselling and psychotherapeutic interventions (Zheng, 2020) .

In many countries the public health sector is often the first to advocate for dog rabies control, as it is usually responsible for the financial burden, in terms of health care and biologics costs. This sector has to assume responsibility for human rabies deaths following exposures to rabid animals when control strategies in the animal reservoir are not effectively implemented and when PEP is not administered correctly. In addition, the government and the Ministry of Health should supply necessary care and biologics to prevent the occurrence of rabies. Provision of vaccines and RIG needed to prevent rabies deaths is estimated theoretically to be around 200 PEP/100,000 inhabitants (based on figures from a range of poorly resourced countries) [78] , although this is likely to vary depending on the setting. While rabies vaccine costs remain in the range of other public health program expenses supported by national health services in several countries, in the absence of international funding these resources are usually beyond the capacity of most impoverished countries. These life-saving products are absolutely necessary and for obvious ethical reasons the considerable sums required to acquire them cannot be diverted from their emergency use.

Yet, funds initially required to acquire human biologics cannot be diverted to another sector to help increase its capacity to establish effective animal rabies control programs [52, 54, 79, 80] . Any country willing to embark in rabies control initiatives must realize that additional investment will be required in all sectors, and that savings, particularly through reduced demand for PEP, will only occur after several years of implementation.

A significant number isolated themselves within the hospital premises for extended periods of time. An understanding of the risks to themselves and their visiting clients is important for effective practice. Given the possibility that asymptomatic individuals could transmit SARS to others, stringent precautionary and infection control measures must be maintained. Our experience in Hong Kong showed that patients were afraid to contact health care professionals, following media reports of the high prevalence of infection in health care settings. Therefore, proper preventive measures (Table 1) should be taken to ensure that the travel health clinic is safe for patients to visit and that there are no or only minimal risks of infecting patients in the clinic.

In all cases, a prompt public health response is critical to containing a SARS outbreak. This is the case particularly for strategies that do not reduce R to below 1, as the possibility of stochastic fadeout (see figure 2b ) falls drastically if the disease has time to spread beyond the initial few cases. We also considered the impact of implementation delays on the most effective, combined strategy from figure 3a, in scenarios where R 0 equals 2, 3 and 4 (figure 3c). Again, timing is critical, especially for the mosttransmissible case when the effective R after control is greater than 1. In all cases in figure 3b,c, a window of opportunity exists at the beginning of a SARS epidemic when a given control strategy has the greatest chance of success. This critical period is lengthened by more effective control strategies, lower-transmission settings, and, potentially, by a smaller hospital pool (see electronic Appendix A). As implementation is delayed, the probability of containing the epidemic is reduced to levels obtained in the absence of control; for instance if R 0 = 3, the weaker strategies lose their possible impact on containment within a few weeks, and even the highly effective combined strategy must be implemented within two months to show any gains over doing nothing. Note that this result pertains strictly to epidemic containment (as we define it), and is oriented toward minimizing overall morbidity and mortality.

Rapid progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome may follow, but mild and asymptomatic infections have also been described. 32, 33 Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, and acute kidney injury can also occur. 32 Risk factors for severe MERS include age >50 years and comorbid conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, end stage renal disease, chronic lung disease, cancer, or those receiving immunosuppressive therapy. 32 Among confirmed cases reported to WHO up to July 2017, 35% have been fatal. 33a Seroepidemiologic studies indicate that MERS-CoV circulates in dromedary camels in the Middle East and Africa, and direct contact with camels has been described in 33% of primary cases without known exposure to MERS cases or health care settings. 34 The route of transmission from dromedaries to humans is unclear, but contact with infectious bodily secretions and fluids are suspect, and consumption of raw dromedary products has also raised some concern. 32 Person-to-person transmission is primarily described in health care settings, although transmission among household close contacts has been described. 35 All cases of MERS reported outside of the Arabian Peninsula have occurred in returned travelers, or as a result of secondary transmission from a patient with recent travel to the Arabian Peninsula, as was the case for the 2015 health care-associated outbreak in South Korea that resulted in 186 cases and 36 deaths. 32, 36, 37 In this outbreak, delayed MERS diagnoses and inadequate infection control precautions led to multiple generations of infections affecting other patients, visitors, and health care workers. 37, 38 The risk of traveler-initiated health care-associated outbreaks with MERS mirrors the global experience of SARS. Like MERS, the viral agent of SARS is a coronavirus that emerged in southern China in 2002 and subsequently caused over 8000 infections and 774 deaths in more than 20 countries. 38, 39 The reservoir of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is unknown, but some cases appear to have resulted from contact with animals used for human consumption such as civet cats. 40 Although no cases of SARS have been reported since 2004, the potential for reemergence is possible. 39",29.459909545713195,14.277050139076247

A total of 159 cases who did not transmit had a mean time to isolation of 3 days, compared with those with who were isolated after 4-10 days and infected 15-40 secondary cases each. For the prevention and control of SARS within the community in Singapore, the key strategy was to detect persons with suspected or probable SARS as early as possible and isolate them at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. Early identification of SARS cases was achieved in several ways, including active tracing of all contacts within 24 h of notification of a case, mandatory home quarantine enforced through the use of electronic cameras, and intensive education of health care professionals and the public. The effectiveness of these strategies was reflected in the progressive reduction in the time to isolation of cases over the course of the outbreak.

SARS emerged as an outbreak of atypical acute community-acquired pneumonia in late 2002. The epidemic may have started when a bat SARS coronavirus jumped into caged palm civets in a wildlife market and became adapted and amplified to jump from civet to human. Infected chefs and animal handlers transmitted the adapted virus to health-care workers and then the epidemic became amplified into the community. The epidemic was rapidly and globally disseminated when a 'super-spreader' of SARS, who was a medical professor from a teaching hospital in Guangzhou, went to Hong Kong on 21 February 2003. During his stay in hotel M, he transmitted SARS-CoV to other residents, and the secondary cases spread the disease to hospitalized patients in Hong Kong, and to other countries including Vietnam, Singapore, and Canada. Eventually, a total of 8096 patients were infected in over 30 countries among five continents and 774 (9.5%) of them died (Cheng et al., 2007a) . Nosocomial outbreaks were reported in many parts of the world including Toronto, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Kaohsiung, Singapore, and Vietnam during the SARS epidemic. There were a total of 716 secondary and tertiary cases of SARS as a result of the admission of infected index patients. Health-care workers constituted 410 (52.3%) of the secondary and tertiary cases (Cheng et al., 2013) . As there were no known effective antiviral agents or vaccine for the treatment and prevention of SARS, infection control measures and extensive tracing to quarantine the contact person became the most important interventions for SARS control. The longitudinal follow-up of SARS patients revealed that the viral load gradually increased on day 5 after symptom onset and peaked at day 10. Early isolation of source patients can prevent ongoing transmission of SARS in the community. In hospitals, temporary suspension of clinical services in both inpatient and outpatient settings was adopted (Gopalakrishna et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2006; Nishiura et al., 2005; Reynolds et al., 2006) , while home quarantine of health-care workers who had contact with SARS patients was also mandated in some centers (Dwosh et al., 2003) .",28.992670950179292,13.60768544863636

In a mathematical model, a combination of household-based quarantine, isolation of cases outside the household, and targeted prophylactic use was shown to be effective in the prevention of viral transmission [76] . Delays of more than 3 days in contact tracing, case identification, and quarantine adversely affected the effectiveness of isolation [77] . One study estimated the effectiveness of the isolation of symptomatic patients and the tracing and quarantine of contacts [78] . The authors concluded that SARS could be controlled by effective isolation of symptomatic patients [78] . This finding is in contrast to the case of pandemic influenza because of the high level of presymptomatic transmission that does not occur with SARS [78] . In a review of the effectiveness of community quarantine, it was found that this is an effective preventive measure, but quantification of the effect was lacking [79, 80] . The delay in the isolation of patients in the healthcare setting also contributed to the spread of SARS [79] . The Al-Hasa MERS-CoV outbreak and the recent increase of MERS-CoV cases in April-May 2014 also point to inadequate infection control measures [4] (http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/ MERS_CoV_RA_20140424.pdf?ua=1). Prompt identification of patients with SARS and the implementation of infection control measures resulted in the prevention of secondary transmission of SARS [81] . Different strategies may be used for the control of an outbreak in a healthcare setting. A hospital closure is needed to control nosocomial transmission if the outbreak is detected late, or closure early in an outbreak is sufficient to remove exposed persons to a designated location or keeping them in one place [82] . In a study of family members and other visiting patients with SARS, it was shown that the rate of SARS among visitors was lower when they used masks [83] . Thus, prompt identification of cases with subsequent proper isolation in the healthcare setting or community quarantine is a key measure to prevent the spread of emerging respiratory pathogens.",27.081223787330373,10.248120408268743

In other words, despite the rapid spread, increasing death toll, and vigorous preventive activities, close to 40% of the respondents did not practice the target SARS preventive behavior. For some subgroups, the noncompliance rates were even higher. As there are evidences that SARS may emerge again both locally and across countries [1] , there is a need for Hong Kong, as well as other countries, to further enhance the effectiveness of related prevention and intervention measures to contain the disease. Results of this study had significant implications for SARS prevention programs. It is suggested that individuals' perception of their own vulnerability to the disease should be emphasized by highlighting the global outbreak and debilitating health consequences of SARS, which not only affect health care workers, older people, those with chronic illness, or individuals of a particular ethnicity. Public education and media campaigns should be conducted regularly in schools, workplaces, and community settings to disseminate the latest findings of SARS. The public should be made aware that there is no specific treatment and vaccination for this disease; therefore, individuals must take own precautions to prevent contracting the disease. It should also be emphasized that at the individual level, facemask wearing remains one of the most effective ways to prevent contracting and spreading SARS [39] . Indeed, studies have shown that communications that highlight perceived susceptibility and simultaneously increase the perception that a particular health behavior will reduce the health threat are successful in promoting various preventive behaviors [15, 27, 28] . The present study also showed that environmental cues to wear facemasks are very important. Other researchers have argued that environmental manipulation and policies support are crucial to translate individual to collective preventive efforts [8, 9] . Environmental cues can be in the form of signs and posters to remind people to wear facemasks and should be placed in prominent areas in schools, at worksites, and in public places. Advice, recommendation, or encouragement from health care professionals are also useful to increase individuals' likelihood to wear facemasks. Policies that require the wearing of facemasks in certain locations (e.g., inside hospitals) or for those who have respiratory symptoms will also ensure individuals to practice the desired preventive behaviors. Finally, it is also particularly important to target SARS prevention activities at those who are less likely to practice these behaviors, namely, men, single individuals, and the younger age group.",27.7301531048035,12.886691357095577

The hierarchy can be used to guide the development of protocols aimed at protecting health care workers from occupational hazards and exposure. It suggests a ranking of effectiveness with elimination and substitution described as the most effective because they direct removal or replacement of the hazard. This is followed by engineering controls, to isolate people from the hazard, and administration controls, which change the way people work through training or protocol development. PPE is at the bottom of the hierarchy and described as the least effective control. This is not because PPE is ineffective but as a control measure it means the hazard has not been eliminated or replaced, and protection is required. 10 PPE guidelines have been in place in the realm of health careassociated infection and isolation care with little modification for over a decade. 11 Despite this guidance, the lack of standards for design and performance of gowns in particular came to light after the experience of treating patients with EVD in 2014. 12 The Nebraska Biocontainment Unit has described the protocols used for protection of health care workers for EVD care in the literature. 13 The initial standards and procedures set by the hospitals that cared for patients with Ebola in the United States eventually became a guidance resource for managing patients with EVD worldwide. 14 ",27.189359426680262,12.773871755663622

The 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic highlighted this risk.

Infected workers can transmit infections to patients and companions, including in some cases before the worker develops symptoms or continues to work while sick. 1, [7] [8] [9] Prompted by the SARS experience and concern about the possibility of an influenza pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2004 developed new guidelines for HCW and institutional practices to prevent the transmission of respiratory infections, including but not limited to SARS, at the first point of contact with an undiagnosed, symptomatic person. 10 These guidelines include recommendations for visual alerts in waiting areas, respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette procedures for patients including masking and separation of persons with respiratory symptoms, and utilization of standard and droplet infection control precautions by HCWs. 11 The extent to which these recommendations are implemented in practice is not established. Studies of hand hygiene and precautions against bloodborne pathogens in health care settings have consistently found under utilization of recommended practices.

By the end of April, the major SARS epidemics in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Canada had plateaued, and the medical community in Taiwan became complacent since each imported SARS case was quickly identified, and secondary transmission was successfully blocked. Consequently, an unidentified SARS patient who had no travel history abroad, was not diagnosed promptly and that, coupled with a lapse in hospital infection-control practices, triggered a large-scale nosocomial SARS transmission in a municipal hospital in Taipei; this was followed by a series of nosocomial infections in seven hospitals due to the interhospital movement of unrecognised SARS patients.

The capacity of hospitals to deal with the challenge from emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases due to climate change is of great importance to population health. This study aimed to explore the capacity of hospitals in China to deal with such challenges. Methods: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was utilized to gauge information regarding capacity of hospitals to deal with infectious diseases in the context of climate change among 611 clinical professionals whose roles pertained to infectious disease diagnosis, treatment and management in Anhui Province of China. Descriptive analysis and logistic regression analysis were performed on the data. Results: More than 90% of participants believed climate change would have an adverse influence on population health and infectious disease control in China. Most indicated that their hospitals were well prepared for emerging infectious diseases at present, and they considered that logistical support in hospitals (e.g. administrative and maintenance services) should be strengthened for future capacity building. The majority of participants suggested that effective prevention and control measures, more interdisciplinary collaborations, more funding in rural areas for health care, and improved access to facilities enabling online reporting of infectious diseases, were extremely important strategies in building capacity to curb the population health impact of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases due to climate change in China. Conclusions: Clinical professionals recognized that climate change will likely increase the transmission of infectious diseases. Although rural health care and hospitals' logistical support need to be improved, most professionals believed their hospitals to be capable of dealing with emerging diseases. They thought that interdisciplinary and cross-regional collaborations, together with necessary resource support (e.g. improved facilities for rural health care) would be important control strategies.",24.1126469927156,9.445108032225908

This finding supports the importance of hand hygiene as a means of preventing occupationally acquired colonization with S aureus from patients or the contaminated environment. 8, 10, 20, 21 S aureus can survive for up to 5 years on hard surfaces, and no obvious role has yet been attributed to colonized staff. 7 When mixed with hospital dust, S aureus can still survive for >1 year until it is picked up from the environment. 22, 23 Contaminated hands may act as a vector, transmitting the bacteria from a contaminated surface to the HCW's nasopharynx via face touching. High hand hygiene compliance before and after patient contact should reduce the likelihood of transferring pathogens through self-inoculation and in turn prevent inoculation of patients. 10, 24, 25 Pathogens found on stethoscopes have also been recovered from physician's hands. 26 Given the habitual face-touching behavior observed in our study, it is possible that the inoculation of stethoscopes and other contaminated medical equipment may have been the result of inoculation from nose touching to hands and subsequently to the stethoscope. Given the frequency of facetouching behavior observed in this study, clinicians must practice hand hygiene before and after using such equipment to ensure that patient equipment is kept clean prior to use.",34.72499660673387,13.9510916313323

Although not 100% effective, fever screenings can prevent imported cases and partially block secondary transmission within the region. 11 For dengue, we need a robust preemptive strategy for surveillance, which incorporates multiple facets of the transmission cycle. The strategy should include early warning capabilities by identifying imported disease ""hotspots,"" using methodology similar to Gardner and colleagues' network-based regression modeling to estimate the relative risk of imported cases. 12 This could assist an active surveillance strategy in high-risk cities and a fever-screening program in high-risk airports.

Thus, we need to focus on ways to improve healthcare systems to increase coverage of key, life-saving perinatal interventions. The components of such systems include facilities, equipment and supplies, but also involve various healthcare (Table 80 .4). To prevent EONS in lowresource settings, cost-effective interventions must be introduced at the community level, with prevention strategies applied during the antenatal, intrapartum and early neonatal period. It is estimated that implementation of these interventions with coverage of 99% can prevent 41-72% of neonatal deaths globally. The knowledge and implementation of these interventions, however, is lacking in the poorest countries, where they are most needed. The benefits of breast milk in preventing neonatal infections and infection-related neonatal mortality are well established. Early and exclusive breast-feeding should be encouraged in developing country settings, since it is perhaps the most important postnatal intervention to prevent EONS. 48 Hygienic newborn care also needs to be encouraged to prevent infections in the early neonatal period. This includes sanitary disposal of waste, provision of clean water in homes and hand washing by care providers. Appropriate cord and skin care is also essential with recent trials showing the benefit of cord and skin cleansing with chlorhexidine. Similarly, massage of newborns with topical sunflower oil, a traditional practice in some communities, has been shown to produce substantial reductions in hospitalacquired neonatal infections among pre-term infants in randomized controlled trials in developing countries. Kangaroo care by mothers is another intervention that can decrease EONS. Kangaroo care involves skin-to-skin contact between mother and infant in a strict vertical position between a 1. A trained attendant must be present at birth, to recognize and assist a baby who does not breathe and attend an adequate number of cases to maintain skills 2. Training should focus on essential newborn care first 3. Adequate systems should be in place for equipment procurement, cleaning/maintenance, resupply 4. Systems are required for supervision, refresher training and monitoring of skills retention 5. Functional referral systems should exist for postresuscitation care and to follow-up resuscitated newborns. A range of preventive strategies can reduce the burden of neonatal infections in community settings and must be implemented at scale. Preventive strategies can be implemented in all cases and in at-risk populations (Figure 80.10) . However, the key to treating neonatal infections successfully in community settings is the appropriate rapid diagnosis and triage to therapy. The onset of illness and course of progression is much more rapid in newborns, thus both clinical diagnosis, as well as empirical therapy are the mainstay for management of neonatal sepsis. 47 Appropriate strategies are needed for prevention of infections, as well as interventions for the domiciliary care and referral of newborn infants who develop bacterial infections. In several resource-poor situations, where prompt referral to a facility is not possible, health workers may have no alternative but to provide domiciliary care, which entails visiting households to provide care for the treatment of serious neonatal Antenatal care, maternal immunization, nutrition, maternal antibiotic prophylaxis",33.156865545344644,14.85613031971584

This dependence on vector control is due to the frequent lack of access to safe or effective treatment. However, even when treatment exists and is available, it can be costly and complex, especially in later stages of disease progression. Communities impacted by EReNTDs often lack the necessary health care delivery infrastructure to support integrated prevention and treatment approaches that include screening, diagnosis, treatment, and case management, the absence of which can translate into a significant global burden of disease (8, 56) . Hence, encouraging and funding health care institutions, clinics, and community health facilities to engage in surveillance, prevention, and treatment programs may help to reduce the risk and aid in decreasing the incidence of EReNTDs (34, 48) . Specifically, ensuring that clinics in areas of endemicity are adequately stocked with medications that are low-cost and accessible may encourage infected individuals to seek care (60) . Misdiagnosis of infectious diseases may be prevented if programs are initiated to ensure that rural providers (including traditional healers and those who practice ethnomedicine) are capable of identifying early symptoms of infection and have proper training to either treat or refer cases (286, 287) . This can be enhanced if efforts are made to increase accessibility of basic literature and education that aid in making an accurate EReNTD diagnosis (288) . Providing periodic forums for feedback from community health workers may prioritize more cost-efficient primary prevention strategies over strategies related to the clinical management of symptoms (289, 290) .

Communitybased quarantine measures may need to address contingency protocols for placing household pets in quarantine as well as human family members. Among the factors that need to be evaluated are the following: when pets should be quarantined, what type of unprotected animal-human contact should be allowed, what types of outdoor access by pets should be allowed (if any), what infection control measures should be implemented in the household to decrease the risk of pathogen transmission, how pet fecal material should be handled in the household and outdoors and in community settings, and what measures should be taken when and if veterinary care is required.

SARS transmission has been reported or suggested after the intubation of patients, 84 and use of a nebuliser by health-care workers in patients with SARS resulted in a major outbreak of the disease. 85 In a retrospective study among critical-care nurses in Toronto, 86 the probability of a SARS infection was 6% in nurses who assisted during intubation, suctioning, and manipulating the oxygen mask. In the same study, wearing a mask, especially an N95 mask, was deemed protective. 86 A high-fl ow-rate oxygen mask may also result in health-care worker infection, 83 and we have thus suggested that NPPV is preferred to facial mask aerosol therapy if available. Bronchoscopy has also been suggested to increase SARS-associated coronavirus transmission in health-care workers. 71 The aerosolisation of lung pathogens during fl exible endoscopy and hospital-acquired infections during these procedures are both well documented and have led to standard guidelines for fl exible endoscopy. 87 Similar transmissions would probably occur with other respiratory agents, such as avian infl uenza and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. Bronchoscopy, airway suctioning, and other procedure that may induce coughing and expose health-care workers to potentially infected aerosolised respiratory droplets pose an increased risk of transmission of those agents.

As the outbreak grew, attention was paid to use of protective equipment, including respiratory protection, as symptomatic patients were identified. The experiences of HCWs confronted with suspected or confirmed SARS cases revealed an often inadequate and incorrect use of PPE. 5, 6 A fundamental flaw in the preventive process seemed to involve failure to recognize quickly the key signs, symptoms, or risks that might have led to the early implementation of protective equipment. Although there is little research concerning changing HCW behavior when providing care for patients with respiratory illness, there was some evidence from the SARS outbreak that pointed toward the benefits of training programs and availability of adequate PPE. 7 The workplace practices identified as problematic during the SARS epidemic mirror those identified by Jagger et al at the International Healthcare Worker Safety Center of the University of Virginia. Jagger et al's work has focused on injuries and exposures involving blood and body fluid exposures among HCWs. In 2001, as part of the EPINet Surveillance Program, 8 a total of 463 blood-body-fluid exposures were reported from 49 participating health care facilities. Of these exposures, over 13% occurred in the ED. Less than 10% of the exposed HCWs reported wearing appropriate eye protection, and fewer than 20% reported wearing some sort of mask or other facial barrier. 9 Clearly, the need still exists for effective training techniques to promote the use of PPE as a way to minimize such workplace exposures. Traditional infection prevention and control training for HCWs has involved a review of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) bloodborne pathogens training, 10 as outlined in the current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) isolation guidelines, 11 with emphasis on transmission-based precautions. When we conducted an informal telephone interview with infection control professionals (ICPs) from 10 US hospitals chosen at random, results indicated that this type of training involved a classroom setting (80%) and/or written handouts (20%). A pretest and posttest process typically assessed competency. None of the interviewed hospitals reported the consistent inclusion of an observational component in their training or subsequent assessments.",23.810391532657874,10.553672663914577

In particular, the transmission within health-care settings is of major concern due to the potential to cause large outbreaks even outside the Arabian Peninsula. This is exemplified by the large outbreak in the Republic of Korea. Transmissions of MERS-CoV within health-care settings are facilitated by overcrowding, poor compliance with basic infection control measures, unrecognized infections, the superspreader phenomenon, and poor triage systems. The actual contributing factors to the spread of MERS-CoV are yet to be systematically studied, but data to date suggest that viral, host, and environmental factors play a major role. Understanding these factors and the contribution of each factor to the superspreading events would further enhance the control measures of MERS-CoV transmission. The epidemiology of the disease was studied in many aspects and showed propensity for the older and those with underlying medical conditions. There is yet an unexplained low rate of involvement of children. The clinical picture of MERS had been further elucidated to include asymptomatic infections, mild or moderately symptomatic cases, and fatal disease. This heterogeneity in the clinical presentation is similar to other known infectious diseases and might be related to the immune response. MERS-CoV is present in the lower respiratory tract system for a prolonged period of time and at higher concentrations than those of the upper respiratory tract, the urine, and the stool. This finding puts the MERS-CoV dynamics in the same clinical presentation as SARS.

Ebola, SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 all have nonspecific clinical presentations, but each emerged in a specific geographic area, and the epidemiologic links to these regions were key in guiding clinicians to implement proper barrier protections and patient evaluation. This led public health agencies, including the World Health Organization and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to recommend a systematic approach to patients presenting with a relevant exposure and symptoms of an acute respiratory viral infection, such as SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. Early recognition of potential cases was critical in limiting transmission by enabling enhanced prevention and control of infections and preemptive care. Mathematical models developed during the SARS and MERS outbreaks support the effectiveness of such strategies. Identifying patients with potential exposure or symptoms facilitated prompt isolation and, in health care settings, led to additional prevention and case-finding measures. Of note, it triggered health care personnel to use personal protective equipment, patient isolation, and hand hygiene. In the SARS outbreak, these measures prevented transmission of SARS-CoV even without the availability of effective vaccines and therapy. Indeed, these interventions have demonstrated superior efficacy over travel restrictions: Respiratory virus infections were reduced by 46% through hand hygiene, 77%through masks or respirators, and 32% to 33% through gowns and gloves (6) .",31.346139830246152,14.013624128364626

Spatial locations, one attribute of each agent, are treated as spatial stamps of the transmission process in the individual-centric agent-based modeling (Zhong & Bian 2016) . Such representations suffer from a number of drawbacks regarding transmission and control design. First, the importance of locations in understanding disease transmission and control has been missing. For example, antiviral ""ring chemoprophylaxis"" strategies aim to geographically targeted containment via applying a certain distance threshold (e.g., 5 km) by means of prophylaxis to attempt to prevent spread to unaffected regions (Lee et al. 2010) . In fact, infectious disease transmission is the mixing patterns of geographical mobility and social interactions that are much more complicated than a simple distance threshold. Second, the design of control strategies based on individualbased networks (e.g., vaccinate the individual with a large number of contacts) is challenging because it is infeasible to keep track of all social contacts of infections (Cohen, Havlin, & Ben-Avraham 2003; Gómez-Gardenes, Echenique, & Moreno 2006; Holme 2004 ), but the information to estimate population flows among locations based on intra-and inter-community travelers is widely available in the existing census data and travel survey reports (Mao & Bian 2010) .

What does this week mean for the future of infection prevention and patient safety in emerging health care systems? How will infection prevention professionals and organizations participate in shaping future health care systems? 3 Historically, IPC has provided a systematic, unbiased method for identifying infections and infectious risks for patients and health care workers. In 1986, the year of the first ''Infection Control Week,'' most acute care occurred in hospitals, and although hospital IPC programs included ''prevention'' as a function of the program, the emphasis was on surveillance, with most of the program resources devoted to this area. During the 1980s, most health care involving invasive procedures or devices was provided in acute care facilities, HAI rates were not shared with persons or agencies outside of the hospital, and in most cases IPC was performed by designated ICPs, not multidisciplinary teams. At that time, bioterrorism belonged in science fiction, AIDS was an ''emerging disease,'' methicillin-resistant Staphyloccocus aureus was starting to migrate from academic tertiary care centers to mainstream community hospitals, and health care workers practiced using information from specialized disciplines. 4 Health care was evolving from a reliance on structures and processes that were more appropriate for organizations with predictable, discreet knowledge areas to the use of processes for complex adaptive system in which services and departments built on separate and unique knowledge areas were integrated and interactive. This newer environment was also one in which performance improvement was mandated and cost reductions were expected. 5 In 2009, complex, invasive health care procedures and technologies are not limited to acute care facilities, but occur in a variety of settings, including long-term care, ambulatory care, and patient homes. There are also discussions about providing some types of postoperative care at hotels located near surgery centers. IPs are challenged to institute IPC programs in these new practice settings but often lack a sufficient evidence editorial base to support their recommendations. In many nonacute care settings, infection criteria are not established, infections are not investigated, antibiotics are prescribed empirically, and denominators are not standardized. In addition, IPC staff are expected to provide strategies to control emerging biological challenges, such as multidrug-resistant organisms, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and such infections as pandemic influenza. IPs are key leaders in the application of intervention bundles that when instituted with other multidisciplinary health care workers, synergistically produce unexpected and welcome improvements in outcomes for patients with a central vascular line or on a ventilator. Furthermore, today there is a growing awareness that although health care involves complex, sophisticated, highly technical processes and devices, the basics still count, and isolated independent actions can impact other processes and parts within health care systems. There is an appreciation of the fact that successful outcomes require synergy among elements of care, including the mechanical-physical, psychological, social, emotional, and spiritual aspects.",32.777198133641164,13.348836999357529

This means that some of the most vulnerable do not seek health care, with syphilis sufferers left untreated, at risk of major health problems, and a source of its spread. 51, 52 For example, a study carried out in a rural area outside Beijing found that 80% of women with genitourinary symptoms did not attend for health care partly because of fear of the cost and partly because of poor understanding of the importance of the problem. 53 In addition, privatisation has led to varying standards of health care, especially in terms of diagnostics, so that untreated infection continues to spread in the community. 51 ",27.090851006747016,12.329106631124272

In addition, leveraging on the unique ""One Health"" approach to transform health care and health policy and to prioritize collaborative programs can be extended from infectious diseases to maternal and child health and health disparity in the poorest populations in Africa [1, [10] [11] [12] . Secondly, building regional surveillance systems is another way to enhance the local health system. The importance of implementing a local and national ""One Health"" policy and programs holds tremendous prospects, such as co-tackling the epidemiological and environmental challenges, and accelerating in the transition from control to elimination of infectious diseases under China-Africa collaboration [5, 15] . Furthermore, it has potential to revolutionize national health systems, policies and strategic priorities and the patterns in health financing and resources allocation of African countries that require careful understanding of the local context of diverse stressors and drivers [21, 13] .

Thirdly, improving the core capacities of international health regulations is the sustained efforts to improve the human welfare. For example, China's response impacting the global health fund (e.g., malaria, HIV/AIDS, schistosomiasis, Ebola, influenza, TB, hepatitis, etc.) has shown robust global health leadership engagement [1, 2, 3] . The leadership reflected in the strategic mobilization and investment of resources fostering more easily accessible, availability and cost effectiveness of prevention and treatment interventions to resources limited countries including African countries [1] .

Before the Ebola-virus-disease epidemic, the formal public sector was the most common source of care for febrile illness in children (57%), with the most common alternatives being traditional healers (13%) and private pharmacies (8%). 8 The two major avenues for delivering life-saving medicine to patients with malaria-public health facilities and community health workers-have been substantially compromised by the Ebola-virusdisease epidemic. Eff orts to reinforce malaria care delivery in Guinea should be focused on reconnecting health-care workers and health facilities with the communities they serve and whose trust they need to regain. Similarly, community health workers who are currently inactive or have left their unpaid malaria case management duties to be paid Ebola-virus-disease contact tracers should be incentivised and provided the means to continue safely delivering malaria care in the community even as they continue their Ebola-virusdiseases-related activities. These interventions cannot wait until the last case of Ebola virus disease. Already, a substantial number of malaria cases have gone untreated or inappropriately treated. Although subject to much uncertainty, according to the estimations from expert opinion surveys the risk of an untreated and uncomplicated malaria case progressing to severe malaria ranges from 3% to 30% (depending on age and malaria endemicity) and then dying from severe malaria ranges from 45% to 73%. 13 Assuming the estimated 74 000 malaria cases not receiving malaria care at health facilities due to the Ebola-virus-disease epidemic (likely to be an underestimate because of the incompleteness of the weekly surveillance system) received no care or inappropriate care outside the formal health sector, excess malaria deaths are likely to greatly exceed the number of deaths from Ebola virus disease, consistent with fi ndings from recent mathematical models. 14 Moreover, untreated malaria cases are likely to have contributed to an excess number of febrile episodes in the community and a greater number of suspected cases of Ebola virus disease requiring triage and isolation at over-burdened transit centres and Ebola treatment centres where uninfected people might have been exposed to Ebola virus disease.

Since accessibility to health data in China is largely limited to a small group of authorised personnel at the top of the administrative hierarchy, it often requires extensive bargaining and bureaucratic procedures to obtain epidemiological and behavioural indicators that are commonly accessibly in other countries.

If I take this preventive measure now, it will mean that I do not have to blame myself (or get blamed by others) for not having done everything to prevent that incident from happening. This attitude also can be observed in health care. A growing number of preventive screening tests are offered that provide information of the chance of developing some kind of disease. It is often not taken in consideration that the chance of really getting this disease is very small. And it is possible that the measures that are taken to prevent the disease negatively influence lifestyles.

And even if it is explained to people that the chance of having a car accident while driving to the clinic is about as much as that particular risk, still many people decide to go on. Their motivation seems to be: suppose our baby does develop that disease, then we should not forgive ourselves not to have done everything to prevent it. There are signals that this anticipated decision regret has become an attitude in security issues also. But in the field of security governments and other public agencies (such as scientific organizations) are bearers of the attitude more than individual citizens. After 9/11—let it be repeated again—security measures against possible terrorist attacks have been given an enormous priority. It looks as if governments are willing to invest a lot of energy in minimizing the chances of terrorist attacks. They do not want to take the risk that they have not done everything to prevent an assault. This attitude can be based on experience. Officials of the Dutch government were reproached for not having done enough to prevent the murder of film director Theo van Gogh (2004). These reproaches have led to decisions that are directed at minimizing the chance of new attacks. With—in general—societal and political support a good deal of money and a lot of energy are devoted to this topic. It is not farfetched to suppose that this is one of the effects of our common anticipated decision regret.",13.64634828789973,8.23778884965559

While severe illness, particularly in older individuals, is frequent enough to overwhelm a society's ICU capacity (19) , mild unrecognized illness (particularly in younger individuals) contributes to spread (20) , and epidemics may only be recognized when superspreader events occur (21) , often in vulnerable settings like health care facilities (22) . In contrast to SARS (23), the high frequency of mild cases means that strategies which focus on case identification and isolation alone are likely to fail (22) . Control strategies for COVID-19 thus need to balance competing risks: the risks of mortality and health system collapse, on the one hand, against economic risks and attendant hardships (and health consequences) on the other. In this work, we evaluated plausible strategies for attenuating the COVID-19 epidemic in Ontario, Canada. We focussed on ICU resources for two reasons: first, because this component of most health systems represents a scarce resource prone to being saturated; and secondly because such saturation results in abrupt surges in casefatality, as individuals with acute respiratory distress syndrome will die quickly without the .

Without sufficient herd immunity, the Covid-19 epidemic will revert to its original dynamic course as soon as interventions are withdrawn. 3 This resurgence can only be prevented if most countries in the world follow China's example and jointly maintain intensive control for a long time, probably years, until the very last cases have been tracked down and isolated. Furthermore, countries with residual circulating virus would have to be completely isolated to avoid reintroduction. Still, prolonged intensive control could be a means to gain time until the development and large-scale availability of a vaccine. However, the amount of time this will take is unpredictable. An alternative approach is to develop herd immunity through natural infection while keeping the number of cases within the limits of the health care system. Until recently, the UK has advocated this approach, 4 but it was heavily criticized for obvious reasons: it will be practically impossible to perfectly tune actual interventions without exceeding or undershooting health care capacity. Clearly, there is a need for an exit strategy that is predictable and controllable. We believe that we have found such a strategy.",19.37257871678454,9.471396807609436

That is, in successive parts of the country (say provinces or municipal health services catchment areas) all stringent interventions are released, such that the epidemic can rage locally, while maintaining strict control in the remaining parts that wait for their turn. At the same time, Covid-19-related IC admissions should be distributed over the whole country such that the national health care system is not overburdened. After the lift of control in their area, its inhabitants can resume their normal daily activities as before Covid-19. Importantly, individuals most vulnerable to the virus need to be shielded until their area has achieved herd immunity. A further requirement is that their care providers (professionals or possibly family members) are absolutely free of the virus or immune. Obviously, this strategy will require a lot of ambulance transport of severe cases, but this should be feasible in small countries with good infrastructure, such as the Netherlands. Larger countries can consider implementing the strategy in specific geographic regions.

Basically, the overall duration of the strategy is determined by the chosen number of subdivisions of the country, with a higher number leading to a longer overall duration but lower prevalent case numbers. The required number of superclusters will depend most on R0 and the chosen maximum number of prevalent Covid-19 cases (dashed horizontal line in Figure 1) . A minimum condition for implementing this strategy is that there is sufficiently intensive control (now assumed to reduce contact rates on average to 25% of their original level) to avoid outbreaks in locations that have not yet lifted control. Notably, under this condition, isolation of the supercluster lifting control is not strictly necessary. Also, our strategy can start at any moment, which allows the health care system to prepare for the lift of control in the first supercluster. We further show that it is not strictly necessary that all individuals return to their normal daily activities; however, if many maintain their reduced contact behavior until the end of the strategy, this may trigger a substantially larger last peak. The strategy may be optimized by using an adaptive approach where the next moment of lifting control depends on the state of the outbreak in the preceding supercluster, which would also allow us to counter unexpected outcomes related to uncertainties in Covid-19 transmission. In turn, data resulting from local outbreaks will reduce such uncertainties and help to further improve the strategy and the model.",13.19864851389464,7.616454014718013
