A plausible hypothesis is thus that these associations might have turned permanent at the point when conditions drove the partners to an interdependent relationship. An ecological context where infection would be conditional on the joint abilities of a pair of viruses (or of a group of genes) would naturally select for initially multipartite viral forms.

Therefore, Ag NPs will provide useful materials to protect HCWs from the risk of contact infection. To prevent contact infection, HCWs usually wear protective clothing. Pathogenic microbes, which are mainly generated by patients, stay alive on the surfaces of protective clothing. It was necessary to develop an evidence-based protective clothing for HCWs [108] .

The spectrum of different infection outcomes is classified according to results from FeLV antigen (p27) and nucleic acid detection and serology into abortive, regressive, progressive or atypical infections [10] [11] [12] [13] . Detection of the p27 antigen is a parameter for viremia in most cats [14] . In addition, latent non-productive infection, characterized by the absence of viremia and the persistence of the virus in the bone marrow, can be identified in cats following regressive infection [15, 16] . Latent infection is detected by the prolonged cultivation of bone marrow cells in the presence of hydrocortisone [16] and usually resolves within a few months of exposure to FeLV but has been detected in some cats up to 30 months after infection [17] . Although persistently infected cats fail to develop a successful immune response to FeLV and succumb to FeLV-associated diseases, cats with regressive infections (previously also referred to as ""recovered cats"") [18] mount a cellular and humoral immune response to FeLV and overcome viremia usually after a few weeks; however, these cats typically remain provirus-positive for the remainder of their lives [19] . The prevalence of provirus positive and p27-negative cats varies among different investigated populations and has been observed to be as high as 10 % [19, 20] . The clinical importance of the provirus positive status is not completely understood but may contribute to a long-lasting maintenance of protective immunity against FeLV [21] . However, reactivation of the infection with development of FeLV-associated diseases has been documented in many provirus positive cats [11, 15, 16, 22, 23] .",12.588281171773025,7.984298652449203

The viruses are part of the bovine respiratory disease complex and are endemic worldwide. BRSV and BCoV can cause epidemics of respiratory disease and additionally BCoV cause diarrhea in calves and adult cattle (winter dysentery) [1] [2] [3] [4] . The traditional way of handling and preventing these diseases is through metaphylactic antibiotic treatment, use of vaccines, or changes in management to improve calf health in herds [5] . The withinherd prevalence and morbidity of BCoV and BRSV infections are high [6, 7] and once the virus enters a herd, circulation is difficult to mitigate. An additional preventive strategy is therefore to reduce inter-herd transmission of virus. Movement of live animals between herds is an important transmission route [8] . If this risk is under control, the next question concerns the contribution of indirect spread of virus between herds. Indirect spread can occur via e.g. personnel travelling between herds, their clothes or equipment. Important risk factors for indirect spread are the level of virus contamination of relevant surfaces and the infectivity of the viruses. Enveloped respiratory viruses like BCoV and BRSV are generally fragile outside the host [9] . However, as related viruses like human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) and human coronavirus 229E remain infective for several hours on contaminated surfaces like countertops and surgical gloves [10, 11] , there is a potential for indirect transmission. Epidemiological studies also point out the importance of indirect transmission; Ohlson et al. found that lack of boot provision for visitors was a risk factor for infections with both viruses [12] and Toftaker et al. found that a herd's BCoV and BRSV antibody status was influenced by the status of its neighboring herds [8] .",12.513459962017095,10.684283139797413

In particular, M. domestica spp. are the most important fly species at poultry farms [26] with regard to mechanical transmission of >30 different pathogens [13] , for example, bacteria, protozoa, viruses, and parasite oocysts and eggs. Some viruses can be transported to animals by contact with contaminated body surfaces of flies. In the case of the house fly, it has been shown that rotavirus can be mechanically transported by contaminated fly surfaces [21] . House flies frequently defecate while feeding and resting on food surfaces [27] . However, in studies of C. nigribarbis, neither defecation nor vomiting was observed within 24 h after feeding (data not shown). The body surface of the house fly could be contaminated by viruses easier than that of blow flies. This would suggest that the mechanisms of virus transmission by blow flies could be different from those of house flies. Therefore, to evaluate virus transmission mechanisms that are more complex than contact with a contaminated fly surface, blow fly intestinal organs, crop, and gut were analyzed for their possible role in transmission of avian influenza virus. A seasonal consideration is that M. domestica vicina populations are generally highest in the summer in Japan. In fact, no house fly was found around any poultry farm or pigpen in Tamba Town during our survey in March. Therefore, it seems reasonable that winter blow flies may be involved in transmission of winter pathogens, like influenza virus, by maintaining minimum infectious titers.",15.15267055201371,7.930179231750406

MDA-MB-231 and PC-3 cells were allowed to adhere onto plastic that was coated with these ECM components. This cell adhesion assay revealed that MDA-MB-231 as well as PC-3 cells favor the interaction with the ECM component collagen, as the adhesion onto collagen is much higher than onto the uncoated plastic control (Fig 7A) . MDA-MB-231 and PC-3 cells also adhered to fibronectin-coated plastic, but to a much lesser extent compared to the collagen coating. Therefore, we focused on the interaction between these two tumor cell lines and collagen.

Restriction of myeloid cell responses was central to the inhibitory action of CD200R. CD200R signaling limited accumulation of MHC class II-bearing APCs in both the periphery and mucosa thus restricting the ensuing virus-specific CD4 T cell response. CD200R restricted SG-APC responses by limiting virus-induced cellular proliferation. CD200R inhibition of this process has likely evolved to limit responses to harmless antigens that mucosal surfaces are continually exposed to. However our data demonstrate that MCMV benefits from this immune-regulatory pathway to persist within its mammalian host, and MCMV can actively induce CD200 expression during infection.",13.035693847331633,4.974027239399781

The catalytic activity of this class of SODs depends on Zn 2+ and Cu 2+ ions, which are coordinated by six histidine residues and one aspartic residue [27] . These residues are still present in VTG3. VTG1 and VTG2 have lost all Znbinding residues and one of the four histidine residues involved in Cu 2+ binding. Functional studies on the purified yolk-protein complexes of D. magna revealed some residual SOD activity per constituent VTG chain ( 1%, in comparison to the activity of a bovine Cu/Zn SOD) [19] . Because of the great number of VTG loci in the D. pulex genome and the presence of an apparently intact SOD-like domain in VTG3 (for which EST evidence is available), it is difficult to analyze any (residual) detoxifying capacity of VTG1 and VTG2.

The only known disease transmitted only through the airborne route is tuberculosis, as reported by Roy and Milton [1] . Aerosol transmission of other diseases could be preferential or opportunistic [1] . Therefore, it is difficult to assess the importance (or not) of the airborne route in disease transmission. The mode of transmission of some diseases is ambiguous. The evidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) airborne transmission was first assessed by indirect evidences such as modeling and epidemiological studies [2] .

In the air cabin, close contact is more frequent because of the high density of passengers. Fomites contribute less due to the low probability of direct touch between the infected and susceptible passengers. The long-range airborne route is less frequent because a high ventilation rate (25 ACH) is set in the air cabin even though the population density is high.

When susceptible students touch the surfaces, more virus will be transferred from the surfaces to their hands. The intranasal dose of the susceptible students increases. When R sh is very low, it is difficult for the virus to transfer from surfaces to the hands. Although the virus from the hands of the infected student to surfaces increases as R hs increases, the transmission of virus from surfaces to the hands of susceptible students is limited because of small R sh . As R hs increases, more virus is transmitted from the hands of susceptible students to surfaces than from the surfaces to their hands, and the intranasal dose of the susceptible students decreases. In reality, adjustment of R sh and R hs to a specific value can efficiently limit virus transmission via fomites, thus reducing the infection risk, especially in infectious diseases that are transmitted mainly via fomites such as norovirus. From Figure 5c ,d, the respiratory dose gradually decreases as R sh increases and as R hs decreases. In contrast, the intranasal dose gradually increases, thus the total quantity of virus (TCID 50 ) on surfaces decreases. The amount of virus aerosol in the air as a result of resuspension decreases.

Consistent with our experimental observations with the NADCT virus, allowing NA to freely diffuse eliminates directional bias in virus motion in both experiments ( Figure 3C ) and simulations ( Figure 3D ). However, allowing surface-bound sialic acid to diffuse can either enhance or suppress directed motion, depending on the kinetic parameters of HA and NA, the diffusion coefficient of sialic acid (D SA ), and the size of the virus (Appendix). Although our experimental data corresponds to the case where sialic acid is immobilized (D SA~0 ), our simulations predict that polarized IAV bound to slowly-diffusing transmembrane glycoproteins or gel-forming mucins (D SA <0.01 mm 2 /s) will exhibit enhanced directed mobility, likely due to the biased spatial distributions of sialic acid binding partners that are available to HAs distal to the virus's NA-rich pole. In contrast, increasing the rate of sialic acid diffusion further (D SA >0.01 mm 2 /s) is expected to suppress persistent motion, by flattening the sialic acid gradient that is created beneath the virus ( Figure 3E, Video 3) . Finally, we find that increasing the length of the virus in simulations increases the number of HA-sialic acid interactions, reducing virus mobility but increasing directional persistence (Figure 3-figure supplement 6). Thus, the organization of proteins on the viral surface, the size of the virus, and the nature of the receptor to which the virus is bound can each influence the persistence of a virus's motion.",15.10995697633691,3.837152616974647

As the annealing temperature was increased from 500 • C to 700 • C, the coating hardness increased from Hv 362 ± 50 to Hv 1171 ± 144. This result was similar to that of Zhang et al. [11] who demonstrated that in early annealing stages, the deposited coating released residual stress, and the hardness did not increase obviously. However, when the annealing temperature was further increased, the titanium alloy thin-film surface exhibited the effect of oxidation, substantially increasing thin film hardness. Figure 5 displays the Vickers hardness test results of LSTO-treated coatings. The results revealed that TiV coatings had greater hardness than the Ti-V-O 300 kHz and Ti-V-O 500 kHz coatings. By contrast, the Ti-V-O 100 kHz coating (which was subjected to the highest level of laser energy density) exhibited a remarkable increase in hardness (2710.97 ± 136 Hv). Similar results were reported in the study of Montealegre et al. [12] . The results indicated that high laser frequency and scanning speed reduced the hardness of the sample; low laser frequency and scanning speed led to high sample surface temperature increase and quenching to room temperature, thereby increasing the hardness. According to Ryk et al. [13] , the surface COF values of LSTO coatings were lower than those of unannealed samples. The LSTO coating surface exhibited a textured structure with uniform patterns; hence, when a tribological load was applied, the surface served as a microreservoir for the oxides. The oxides stored within the surface structure keep a stable wear process and further improve the surface abrasion resistance. Figure 8 shows that HTA-treated Ti-V-O samples exhibited a lower water contact angle for the sample annealed at higher temperatures. The Ti-V-O coating annealed at 700 • C had the lowest water contract angle. When it was annealed at higher temperature, the surface of the deposited oxide layer had greater roughness, increasing its wettability. Figure 9 shows that the 300 kHz LSTO coating and 500 kHz LSTO coating had greater surface roughness and wettability than did the Ti (uncoated) sample and the TiV deposited sample. However, the Ti-V-O coating treated under a laser frequency of 100 kHz had a high water contact angle of 140 • , considerably reducing surface wettability and forming a superhydrophobic surface. When LSTO increased the surface roughness of the deposited coating, the uniform surface texture of the 100 kHz coating demonstrated the lotus leaf-like effect, achieving superhydrophobic properties. Yang et al. [14] conducted a water contact angle analysis on the striped, netted, and dotted surface of coatings subject to LSTO, and revealed that coatings composed of titanium, stainless steel (AISI 316L), aluminum alloy (A16061), and tungsten carbide also exhibited superhydrophobic surfaces. This result confirmed that surface superhydrophobicity is mainly affected by surface morphology instead of material properties. ",15.019290391189841,7.323949269706056

The study focused on samples from the lower gastrointestinal tract (faecal, rectal and intestinal samples), to identify viruses present in these tissues or excreted in faecal material (Fig 2A; S1 Table) . Due to the size of these bat species and small quantities of faecal material at times available for collection, sample material for certain individuals were limited. All faecal or tissue samples were used sparingly to enable additional analyses. However, priority was given to sample preparation for high throughput sequencing in order to determine the virome composition of the analysed host genus. Therefore, if sample material consisted of very small quantities of faecal or rectal material, these samples were completely used for this step. For high throughput sequencing sample preparation, faecal and rectal samples of all bats were pooled and processed by mechanical homogenization in 400 μl PBS (Lonza) with two stainless-steel beads (Qiagen). A Tissue Lyser II system (Qiagen) was utilized, shaking at 30Hz for 60 seconds. The lysates were cleared by low temperature (4˚C) centrifugation for 10 minutes at 10,000x g.

Co-infection experiments with ca-PEDV are best performed with Vero cells, as they have been shown to be permissive for viral replication in contrast to other cell lines such as PD5, PK 15, and HRT18 cell lines [9] . Specific measurements of primate cytokines in our co-infection model are planned in the future to elucidate the mechanism leading to chlamydial persistence. The Herpes simplex virus (HSV) co-induced Chlamydia trachomatis persistence model [15] has been recently been shown not to be mediated by any known persistence inducer or anti-chlamydial pathway recently [20, 21] . Instead, it was hypothesized by the authors that HSV-2 attachment and/or entry into the host cell is sufficient for stimulating chlamydial persistence, suggesting a potential novel host signaling pathway could be responsible for inducing chlamydial persistence. A very recent publication by the same group showed that HSV replication is not necessary for persistence induction and that chlamydial activity could be recovered after coinfection with UV-inactivated HSV-2.

No significant difference was observed in the distribution of the residual burden that was recovered from glass slides or stainless steel door handles. Even so, the MRSA burden was significantly reduced as compared to control; there was more heterogeneity in the residual burden distribution on the copper handles. Unused copper door handles showed an average 3.2 (±0.6) log reduction compared to glass, while one year used copper handles showed a 2.7 (±0.7) log reduction average, and the three years used copper handles a 1.7 (±1.1) log reduction average. The door handles that were used for three years presented the higher heterogeneity with efficiency ranging from 5.7 log reduction to 0.7 log reduction. ",43.59754616241103,18.902528629473405

Further, presence or absence of DNases, pH and the length of the DNA polymer may affect nucleic acid persistence. There is dearth of information on persistence of virus-vectored vaccine such as recombinant MVA outside the host although persistence in different materials of wild-type viruses commonly employed as vectors is available [163] . Thus, it is often assumed that persistence of GM viruses/vectors is not different from that of the wild-type strains. This ignores the fact that genetic manipulation may have affected some biological properties of the GM virus/vector resulting in a persistence that is different from the corresponding parental virus. An example is where inserted sequences can influence the genome stability of the viral vector, which can result in an improperly packaged, enlarged and unstable genome prone to re-arrangement.",40.60411769086676,16.13032148159638

For the first time, five French long-term care facilities were at 50% fitted with copper alloys door handles and handrails. Related to the environmental bacterial contamination, 1400 samples were carried out on copper and control surfaces over three years after copper installation. In addition, some copper door handles were taken from the different facilities, and their specific activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was tested in vitro. In comparison to control surfaces, copper door handles and handrails revealed significantly lower contamination levels. This difference was observed in the five long-term care facilities and it persists through the three years of the study. High and extreme levels of bacterial contamination were less frequent on copper surfaces. Although, the antibacterial activity of copper surfaces against MRSA was lowered after three years of regular use, it was still significant as compared to inert control surfaces.

The disinfectant inactivated AdV, MNV and vaccinia virus within one minute, making it active against non-enveloped viruses at low level (without enteroviruses and parvoviruses) on carriers, as defined according to DVV Guideline. The activity of the formulation is sufficient for virucidal activity on carriers according to the current version of prEN 16777. Stainless steel carrier methods have shown a good overall reproducibility between different labs [31] , but the results on carriers may be not directly transferable to in-vivo situation. Fingerpad methods may be a better alternative for ABHRs testing under practical conditions, however fingerpad methods seem to lack reproducibility, which may be in part due to the inability of the method to properly distinguish the washing out of virus by mechanical means from virus inactivation by disinfectant. When comparing a mixture of propan-1-ol and propan-2-ol (RF = 2.8) and a hand wash product (RF = 3.0) in the fingerpad test, Tuladhar et al. concluded that washing hands with soap and water is better than using hand rubs based on alcohol for removal of norovirus from hands [47] .

Flies were tipped onto fresh vials of food after 3 days, and after 5 days of acclimatisation at the experimental temperature were infected with DCV. Flies were anesthetized on CO 2 and inoculated using a 0.0125 mm diameter stainless steel needle that was bent to a right angle~0.25mm from the end (Fine Science Tools, CA, USA) [9, 41, 57] . The bent tip of the needle was dipped into the DCV solution (TCID 50 = 6.32×10 9 ) and pricked into the pleural suture on the thorax of the flies. We selected this route of infection as oral inoculation has been shown to lead to stochastic infection outcomes in D. melanogaster [55] . However, once the virus passes through the gut barrier, both oral and pinpricked infections follow a similar course, with both resulting in the same tissues becoming infected with DCV [55] . One vial of inoculated flies was immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen to provide a time point zero sample as a reference to control for relative viral dose. The second vial of flies were placed onto a new vial of fresh cornmeal food and returned to their experimental temperature. After 2 days (+/-1 hour) flies were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. This time point was chosen based on pilot data as infected flies showed little mortality at 2 days post infection, and viral load plateaus from day 2 at 22˚C.

Earlier studies have reported that the epithelial cells of pharyngeal tissues [16, 17, 44] and/or retropharyngeal and submandibular lymph nodes [15, 44] are the predilection site for FMDV persistence in cattle. This consensus is challenged by a recent study that suggests that the DSP and the submandibular and retropharyngeal lymph nodes cannot be definitively concluded to be the principal sites for persistence of FMDV due to inconsistent detection of FMDV RNA in these tissues [22] .

We demonstrate that although LDL contains some apoD and will bind to anti-apoD (D544), the binding was considerably faster if the D544 antibodies were preloaded with apoD. In addition, HDL3 bound both more quickly and with more mass to D544-coated surfaces than did HDL2. As mentioned above, HDL3 has a higher density than HDL2 but is also considerably smaller and carries more apoD. Preloading the surface with purified apoD is the most efficient way to tie down LDL, but HDL3 also yields a high initial speed of LDL binding compared to D544 alone or loaded with HDL2. One explanation for the difference between the quick binding of LDL to apoD-or HDL3-coated surfaces and the slower linear binding of LDL to D544 alone is that, in the latter case, apoD needs to reposition to allow multiple bonds between the surface and LDL. In animal experiments, apoD was shown to be important in protecting against oxidative stress [6, 7, 24] . Interestingly, HDL3 has been reported to be more important than HDL2 for protection against LDL-copper-catalyzed oxidation [35, 36] . The biosensor results obtained here show that HDL3 bound LDL more avidly, supplying a potential explanation for the protection of LDL by HDL3.",14.839550331224565,5.052932788055486

Relevant publications were sought from data banks and repositories of FAO, OIE, WHO, and Google scholars. Substantiated data on HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in poultry in Africa and in humans across the world were mined. HPAI H5N1 affects poultry and human populations, with Egypt having highest human cases (346) globally. Nigeria had a reinfection from 2014 to 2015, with outbreaks in Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Niger, Nigeria, and Burkina Faso throughout 2016 unabated. The persistence of this virus in Africa is attributed to the survivability of HPAIV, ability to evolve other subtypes through genetic reassortment, poor biosecurity compliance at the live bird markets and poultry farms, husbandry methods and multispecies livestock farming, poultry vaccinations, and continuous shedding of HPAIV, transboundary transmission of HPAIV through poultry trades; and transcontinental migratory birds. There is, therefore, the need for African nations to realistically reassess their status, through regular surveillance and be transparent with HPAI H5N1 outbreak data.

When compared to porcine AM, PIM are equally permissive to PRRSV infection [14, 37] . Almost two decades ago, PRRSV-2 antigens and nucleic acids have been demonstrated in PIM both in vitro and in vivo [37] . Examination of cultured PIM infected with PRRSV revealed the accumulation of viral particles in vesicles and the infection induces either PIM apoptosis or cell lysis. The PIM in vitro bactericidal activity is decreased as the in vivo phagocytic activity, measured by pulmonary copper clearance in PRRSV-infected pigs [37] . Recently, AM-like cells have been defined as macrophages phagocytosing blood-borne particles, which is in agreement with the PIM identity [14] . PIM were described as the major producer of PRRSV-1 Lena virus and their infection correlated better with viremia in vivo than AM infection.

Notably, some pathogens exhibited biphasic inactivation, with faster initial inactivation followed by a period of slow inactivation or persistence without measurable decay. When this occurred, we used the average inactivation estimates over the first hour, when decay rates were highest, to parameterize our model. Influenza appears to survive for the shortest amount of time on hands, with an order of magnitude higher inactivation rate than either rhinovirus or norovirus.

Many molecular diagnostic assays are developed based on using thermal cyclers to carry out polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse-transcription PCR for DNA and RNA amplification and detection, respectively. Unfortunately, most commercial thermal cyclers are expensive and need continuous electrical power supply, so they are not suitable for uses in low-resource settings. We have previously reported a low-cost and simple approach to amplify DNA using vacuum insulated stainless steel thermoses food cans, which we have named it thermos thermal cycler or TTC. Here, we describe the use of an improved set up to enable the detection of viral RNA targets by reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR), thus expanding the TTC's ability to identify highly infectious, RNA virus-based diseases in low resource settings. The TTC was successful in demonstrating high-speed and sensitive detection of DNA or RNA targets of sexually transmitted diseases, HIV/AIDS, Ebola hemorrhagic fever, and dengue fever. Our innovative TTC costs less than $200 to build and has a capacity of at least eight tubes. In terms of speed, the TTC's performance exceeded that of commercial thermal cyclers tested.

For example, individual based interventions might focus on reducing fomite touching whereas centralized interventions change the surfaces available for contamination. In general, we found that R 0 for the fomite route was more sensitive to surface properties than to the rate of touching fomites. By extension, interventions that improve surface decontamination may be more effective than hand washing interventions when fomites are the primary transmission route. Specifically, when the proportion of accessible surfaces (λ) was low (such as in an office or subway scenario), touching rates were most important for determining fomite R 0 because surfaces were highly concentrated. However, at higher values of λ, touching rates did not contribute as much to fomite R 0 . Of the four venues considered, the highest values of R 0 for the fomite route occurred in settings like schools and daycares, where both the proportion of accessible surfaces and the touching rates were high leading to frequent exposure to surfaces with somewhat lower concentration of pathogen. Daycares may be an even greater source of risk for pathogens that have higher shedding rates among children. These venues are likely to be of particular interest for infection control efforts as non-pharmaceutical intervention and environmental microbiology studies have indicated that pathogen persistence on school and day care surfaces could be an important source of infections [31, 32] . Additionally, healthcare settings exhibit many features of high contact and high accessible surface venues.

This simple platform can be used in resource-limiting settings where stable or continuous power supply is not guaranteed. Specifically, we demonstrated that our innovative TTC can potentially deliver high-speed and sensitive PCR and RT-PCR for the amplification and detection of infectious diseases such as sexually transmitted diseases (chlamydia/gonorrhea), HIV/AIDS, Ebola hemorrhagic fever, and dengue fever. We also demonstrated that the TTC easily accommodates eight samples simultaneously, and we successfully performed highly multiplexed reactions. By designing the reaction to produce short strands of amplicons (45 bp), we also demonstrated that a 6-s per cycle PCR is feasible without using high concentrations of PCR reagents to speed up the reactions, thus making it one of the fastest and most economical thermal cycling units reported in the literature. In addition, we demonstrated that, when using propylene tubes, the duration of PCR runs can be further shortened by employing an extra room-temperature water bath to rapidly cool the PCR reagents from the denaturation temperature to near the annealing temperature. This simple step can cut 10 s off each PCR cycle without compromising PCR efficiency. Since the volume and PCR tubes we used are typical to lab-based PCR, little assay optimization is needed to run PCR using the TTC. With the advantages we have demonstrated, the TTC system could increase the availability of on-site molecular diagnostics in low-resource settings when coupled with low-cost, endpoint-detection technologies such as nucleic acid lateralflow assay or a smartphone-based fluorescence detector.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the survival of PEDV in 9 different feed ingredients when exposed to 60, 70, 80, and 90°C, as well as the survival on four different surfaces (galvanized steel, stainless steel, aluminum, and plastic). Results: Overall, there were no differences (P > 0.05) in virus survival among the different feed matrices studied when thermally processed at 60 to 90°C for 5, 10, 15, or 30 min. However, the time necessary to achieve a one log reduction in virus concentration was less (P < 0.05) when ingredients were exposed to temperatures from 70°C (3. 7 min), 80°C (2.4 min), and 90°C (2.3 min) compared with 60°C (4.4 min). The maximum inactivation level (3.9 log) was achieved when heating all ingredients at 90°C for 30 min. There were no differences in the amount of time necessary to cause a one log reduction in PEDV concentration among the different surfaces. Conclusions: The results of this study showed that PEDV survival among the 9 feed ingredients evaluated was not different when exposed to thermal treatments for up to 30 min. However, different combinations of temperature and time resulted in achieving a 3 to 4 log reduction of PEDV in all feed ingredients evaluated. Finally, PEDV survival was similar on galvanized steel, stainless steel, aluminum and plastic.",44.28860590022642,16.621591865088973

Fitting the data to a one-phase exponential decay model (Fig. 1B ) estimated the t 1/2 of the virus under these conditions to be around 1.5 h. A similar pattern of rapid loss of infectivity was seen when the household surface samples were tested, with the difference that greater initial losses of infectivity ranging between 20-fold (telephone handset) to nearly 4000-fold (unsealed pine) were seen (Table 4 ).

The only material (other than the control tissue culture dish) for which even low amounts of viable virus could be detected at 9 h was stainless steel.

Parker et al (1944) demonstrated improved survival of influenza viruses in the presence of human mucus [8] ; and in 1962, Buckland demonstrated experimentally that influenza virus was inactivated relatively quickly on glass, probably through desiccation [9] . In 1982, widely cited work by Bean et al showed that both influenza A and B, directly applied to stainless steel surfaces or hard plastic, could survive for 24-48 hours, and be transferred, from there to hands, for 24 hours; survival was much shorter on porous materials such as paper and cotton (8-12 hours) , with transferability to hands for only 15 minutes [10] . In contrast, Thomas et al, recently demonstrated survival of human seasonal A (H1N1) and A (H3N2) on Swiss banknotes for up to three days, increasing to up to eight days when applied with nasopharyngeal secretions from children (17 days if applied at very high concentration). Although viable virus was recovered at each of these time points, it was noted that virus load declined sharply after the first few days; no other materials were tested [11] . Other studies have detected influenza virus on fomites in homes and health and childcare facilities, using RT-PCR to establish the presence of the viral genome [12] [13] [14] . However, data obtained using this technique (even quantitatively) do not distinguish adequately between viable and non-viable virus and are therefore problematic to interpret in the context of practical infection control guidance.

Metallic and non-metallic non-porous materials pose the greatest risk and should be targeted for frequent cleaning if situated in close proximity to patients infected with influenza virus; fortunately the latter are also more conducive to surface cleaning with a wide variety of simple cleaning agents [12] . Whilst our data suggest that the risk of virus transmission might last several hours after deposition, we generated very little data suggesting that appreciable amounts of virus survived much beyond nine hours. This probably means that frequently touched environments such as classrooms, offices and living rooms, which are then left unoccupied overnight, will not contain much viable virus on surfaces by the next morning. Nevertheless, the data still support frequent cleaning of commonly touched items and surfaces throughout the working day, particularly when symptomatic persons are present, for example in physician waiting rooms. In terms of cleaning regimens, one critically important consideration is that survival of virus in high titres for prolonged periods is not necessary for fomite transmission if surfaces are frequently re-inoculated (e.g. by toddlers).

This research has evaluated the contamination of feed mill surfaces, but limited studies have been conducted on PEDV long-term survival after a surface is contaminated. Data from this experiment suggest that PEDV can survive for extended periods of time on all of Different letters in the same column differ at P < 0.05 2 δ is the time of the first log reduction of virus concentration 3 The shape parameter (n) indicates the shape of the curve with a value n > 1 forming shoulders and being convex, n < 1 forming tails and being concave, and n = 1 being linear [21] . In that study, there was a 3.2 log reduction in TGEV after 28 days at room temperature at 80% relative humidity. Another human coronavirus, SARS, has been actively studied for its survival on different material surfaces [21] . This virus has been reported to survive for up to 36 h on stainless steel, but the initial concentration of virus in this study was not reported [22] . In a different experiment, Rabenau et al. (2005) reported a 4-log reduction in SARS virus concentration after 9 days of incubation on a polystyrene surface [23] . Furthermore, SARS virus survived on smooth plastic more than 5 days at room temperature [24] . Results from these previous studies, along with similar examples [25, 26] , indicate that coronaviruses may pose a risk for transmission via contaminated surfaces in the feed mill. Our results showed longer virus survival time (greater than 10 days), which indicates that additional mitigation measures (i.e. proper cleaning and disinfection) need to be implemented to minimize risk of virus transmission on surfaces of feed mills and swine farms. One of the limitations for applying this combined knowledge into practice is the potential experimental methodology concern of adding 1 mL of media containing the virus to feed samples. The addition of liquid media necessarily increases the moisture content of the sample, and this may affect the virus survival. More research is necessary to compare the effect of moisture content and water activity on PEDV survival, and determine the extent that this factor plays in virus inactivation. In the surface experiment, however, the media was allowed to dry, eliminating this factor as a potential limitation. It is highly likely that the amount of virus excreted by an infected pig, and potentially transmitted via feed, would be much greater than the titer used in the present study. In a study that evaluated residual material in a suspected PEDV contaminated feed bin, CT values between 19.5 and 22.2 were determined [16] . When using a calibration curve obtained from the University of Minnesota and published by Alonso et al. (2014) , this amount of virus is equivalent to 8.9 to 9.2 log copies of RNA/g [27] . In this potential scenario, the maximum log reduction (3.9 log) achieved by thermal processing alone, would not be enough to completely inactivate the virus found in the feces of infected animals, and would have the potential to be transmitted via feed during a PEDV outbreak. If this scenario represents the reality, a new approach is needed that is able to achieve a greater reduction. A hurdle approach (combining multiple processing steps) may be needed to achieve the desired virus reduction. The use of eBeam irradiation, antimicrobials, and organic acids has been effective in reducing PEDV concentration in feed [17] . If these treatments are combined with a thermal processing as described in this study, an overall increase on virus inactivation will be expected.",22.19409919387798,9.315482541047983

Immediately (approximately 1 h) after drying, no differences in bacterial numbers were detected between the different materials ( Fig 3B) . Although the CFU numbers of both bacteria dramatically reduced over subsequent days on the dry surfaces, this temperature-dependent trend was unaffected by the type of material surface ( Fig 3C) . Thus, the material itself (vinyl chloride, aluminum, plastic, stainless steel) had no effect on the diminishing bacterial numbers under dry conditions. We also assessed whether the same trend was seen for multidrug-resistant human pathogenic bacteria using ESBL-and NDM-producing E. coli isolated from Hokkaido University Hospital. The CFU assay confirmed increased survival of multidrug-resistant bacteria at lower temperature, as well as increased survival in the presence of S. aureus (Fig 4) . Taken together, we conclude that bacteria favoring a lower temperature for their survival in dry environments is a universal phenomenon, which is unaffected by the surface material or bacterial type.

Interestingly, when mixed with S. aureus, E. coli survived for a longer time at a lower temperature.

Although the trends remained unchanged, adjusting the humidity from 40% to 60% affected the survival of bacteria on dry surfaces. Scanning electron microscopic analysis revealed no morphological differences in these bacteria immediately before or after one day of dry conditions. In addition, ATP assessment, a method used to visualize hightouch surfaces in hospitals, was not effective at monitoring bacterial dynamics.

Assessment with a hand-held infrared sensor showed that the surface temperature on the handrail pipe was controlled to almost body core temperature, although the temperature on the device surface varied from the end to the center of the pipe (range: 30˚C-40˚C) (S4B Fig). A heatmap generated with the high-resolution infrared sensor showed that in contrast to the stainless steel pipe without the heater, the surface temperature on the heated pipe was maintained at body core temperature (Fig 5A) , indicating that it is an effective tool to monitor the influence of temperature on bacterial survival on a dry surface. We monitored the survival of GFP-expressing E. coli (DH5α) spotted onto the handrail surface at regular intervals (1 cm) compared with the GFP signals at equivalent spots on an LB agar plate, and assessed CFU numbers. GFP signals were dramatically decreased on the heated handrail compared with the unheated handrail even 6 h after drying, and the signals were virtually undetectable one day after drying (Fig 5B) . Consistent with this, the CFU numbers on the heated handrail were significantly reduced compared with those on the unheated handrail ( Fig 5C) . In addition, we assessed whether the warming handrail could work on other bacteria. The results indicated that the prolonged survival of bacteria (E. faecalis, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii, and S. marcescens) as well as E. coli, was significantly prohibited, although no effective elimination of the spore-forming bacterium (B. subtilis) was detected (Fig 6) . We also confirmed that the yeast-like fungus (C. albicans) failed to survive immediately (within 6 h) after drying on the device (S5 Fig).

These pili are formed of subunits that assemble into a long coil-shaped rod, which is tipped by adhesive molecules that can stick to body surfaces. The current hypothesis is that the pili act as shock absorbers: when the bladder empties, the pili's coil-like structure can unwind into a flexible straight fiber.

The results shown in Tables 2-3 suggest a way to address the problem. In the case of PEDV and SARS-CoV, the PID levels of both N-and M-proteins are quite moderate. In PEDV and TGEV, the differences in the transmission behavior and the levels of shell disorder suggest that special attention should be paid to the PID peculiarities of the M-protein. A sign of persistence of SARS-CoV and some specific strains of PEDV (see Tables 2-3) can be found in the relatively low PID levels of their M-proteins (∼8%), especially when compared to viruses such as TGEV (∼14%) and HCoV-229E (∼23%).",14.99883558701993,8.460058303902867

In the process of separating the wards, vents were installed in only one of the wards. Because of this construction lapse, the index patient's ward was not mechanically ventilated, and only natural ventilation was provided through the window. It is possible that the droplets produced by coughing and sneezing by the index patient accumulated in the ward at a high concentration due to lack of ventilation.

On the one hand, the recovered viral particles were in suspension together with disinfectants for a very short period of time (less than 30 s) before gel filtration (duration of 1min), and on the other hand the incubation of viral particles in suspension in presence of a disinfectant (Aseptanios AD or Aseptanios Oxy+) for 30 s resulted in a moderate reduction of infectious titres (1.5 log) only, whereas a longer incubation time (5 min) was needed to obtain a 4 log 10 reduction of the infectious titer (data not shown).",22.14066671247012,11.31595381120994

The Class III BSC provides a primary barrier of protection and a safe, controlled, ABSL-4 or BSL-4 environment in which researchers perform viral pathogen characterization or in vivo experiments. Decontamination of the cabinets must take place between experiments to facilitate safe maintenance and/or repairs and to prevent cross-contamination between subsequent studies. The method of choice for decontamination at the IRF-Frederick is paraformaldehyde gas, as the gas is effective and easy to use in Class III BSCs [12] . All decontamination procedures follow standard operating procedures. Successful decontamination of a Class III BSC is documented from the results of biological indicators that validate agent inactivation ( Figure 3 ). The Class III biosafety cabinet (BSC) is a hermetically sealed stainless steel cabinet containing an ABSL-4 environment under negative pressure (currently in static state for easy viewing) within an ABSL-4 cabinet laboratory. Materials can be introduced into the BSC by staff working in the ABSL-4 cabinet laboratory through an under-cabinet-mounted stainless steel tank containing the disinfectant Micro-Chem Plus ® (commonly referred to as a ""dunk tank"" in ABSL-4 or BSL-4 settings). Because the BSC is built into the wall separating the cabinet laboratory from an ABSL-4 suit laboratory, materials, animals, and viral pathogens can also be moved into the BSC from the ABSL-4 suit laboratory side using a transport cart and a Rapid Transfer Port (RTP). The contents within the BSC can be manipulated from the outside by researchers wearing various types of synthetic rubber gloves, specifically neoprene/chlorosulphonated polyethylene. Contents, excluding infectious samples, are removed from the BSC after sterilization through a double-door autoclave or disinfection via the dunk tank. Figure 2 .

Class III BSC paraformaldehyde gas decontamination setup. After an experiment, a researcher connects a decontamination machine to the BSC through designated external ports on top of the glove box. From a paraformaldehyde gas generator (Certek, Durham, NC, USA), the gas is pumped into the BSC and decontaminates the BSC after an appropriate contact time (i.e., 6 h). The gas is then neutralized by ammonium bicarbonate for an additional 6 h (12 h total decontamination).

Plastic or steel surfaces were inoculated with 10 6 TCID 50 of MERS-CoV at different temperature and relative humidity (RH) and virus recovery was attempted in cell culture. At high ambient temperature (30°C) and low RH (30 %) MERS-CoV remained viable for 24 h [150] . By comparison, a well known and efficently transmitted respiratory virus, influenza A virus, could not be recovered in culture beyond four hours under any conditions [150] . Aerosol experiments found MERS-CoV viability only decreased 7 % at low RH at 20°C. In comparison, influenza A virus decreased by 95 % [150] . MERS-CoV survival is inferior to that previously demonstrated for SARS-CoV [152] . For context, pathogenic bacteria can remain viable and airborne for 45 min in a coughed aerosol and can spread 4 m. MERS-CoV's ability to remain viable over long time periods gives it the capacity to thoroughly contaminate a room's surfaces when occupied by an infected and symptomatic patient [153] . Whether MERS-CoV can remain adrift and infectious for extended periods (truly airborne) remains unknown. Such findings expand our understanding of the possibilities for droplets to transmit respiratory viruses in many settings, including hospital waiting rooms, emergency departments, treatment rooms, open intensive care facilities and private patient rooms.

Similar rates (between 11.1% and 39.6%) were found in other PCR based studies [10, 11, 13, 14] . Sensitive RT-PCR assays make it possible to identify a large spectrum of viral agents, but an identified virus may be concerned with persistence of a virus after a recently afflicted RTI. RhV and BcV may persist in the upper airways for a long duration. Up to two months of persistence has been shown in nasopharynx [14] [15] [16] [17] . AdV shedding with the faeces may persist for a long time after an acute infection [18] ; however, extended shedding of AdV in the nasopharynx was not documented. For this reason, this persistence also may not occur in the nasopharynx. However, identification of two or more viruses in a patient may be due to prolonged viral shedding or asymptomatic persistence of viruses and further work would be needed to clarify this situation. Identification of the viral genome quantitively may be helpful in explaining coinfections. Evidence pertaining to the severity of coinfections compared to single viral infections is conflicting. In our study, coinfections were not more severe than single infections. The presence of coinfections was not associated with extended duration of fever. The severity of coinfection may depend on the viruses involved. In contrast with some previous studies [4, 19, 20] , coinfections were not more severe than single infections in this study.

They introduce a framework to classify different protection measures and highlight the inter relationship between different protection measures and their impact on overall building vulnerability and resilience to bioterror attack. Recently, the Federal Highway Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation, has developed a learning tool to inform transportation agencies about plans and responses in biohazard events. The tool contains detailed information about potential biohazard agents, events, release scenarios in different modes of transport, existing guidelines and analytical tools framing emergency response to biohazard events in different transport modes and identified various information system technologies to enhance preparedness and response actions (FHWA, 2015) . Preventing, mitigating, monitoring and responding to biological threats in transport infrastructure is a complex task and requires a multidisciplinary alliance to design and implement appropriate protection measures which must be informed by venue and scenario rather than supply driven.

Spring pressure held the sample cup closed until manually opened at the desired depth. Once opened, the manure flowed into the sample cup and then manually closed. The sample cup was retrieved and transferred the sample to a disposable sample jar for subsampling into vials. Manure samples were collected from two locations at a time before the samplers were brought back to shore for cleaning prior to the next set of samples being collected.

Study of MNoV strains that differ in persistence has begun to identify viral and host correlates of persistent infection. MNoV strain CW3 is cleared whereas strain CR6 persists in wild type mice [10, 13] . We recently discovered that persistent intestinal CR6 infection is cleared by IFN-λ-stimulated innate responses with no requirement for an adaptive immune response [14, 15] . IFN-λ is closely related to type I IFN, but with more specialized roles at epithelial surfaces [16] .

It has been well documented that high-touch surfaces are major reservoirs for MRSA in hospital environments. Of all hospital surfaces, bedside rails in wards occupied by MRSA patients have been identified as the site most frequently contaminated with MRSA [14] .

CTI has been used as a risk factor in the study of other infectious and non-infectious diseases [57] . Some studies have shown that at local scales, the slope of the terrain (a component of CTI) was significantly correlated with reservoir species dominance [58] . CTI is a function of both the slope and the upstream contributing area per unit width orthogonal to the flow direction.

This is consistent with the association of RSV infection with the rainy season reported in studies elsewhere in the tropics 15, 18, 19 . The explanation for this consistent association is unclear. It could be directly related to climatic factors, such as increased humidity, or reflect changes in social behaviour which may enhance transmission 8, 19 . Recently, Paynter reported that the wet conditions of the tropical rainy season may encourage contact transmission of this virus by increasing the amount of virus on surfaces and by increasing virus survival in droplets on surfaces 20 . However, other patterns of RSV seasonality in tropical areas have been described. There were peaks of RSV-associated hospitalization observed during cool periods from 2011 to 2014 in Bangladesh 21 .

BRSV can be isolated from asymptomatic animals and can persist for several months [6] . Thus, one possibility is the existence of persistently infected calves, which might start shedding the virus under specific conditions [24, 25] . Therefore, latent infection among herds might occur, providing a possible explanation for the occurrence of outbreaks among relatively isolated calves. However, some reports have suggested that subclinical infection in cattle is not a plausible mechanism for the persistence of BRSV in dairy herds [26] .On the other hand, clinically ill animals are believed to be the most likely sources of infection, and therefore, the most likely explanation for recurrent infections is the reintroduction of the virus into the herd before the occurrence of a new outbreak.

All of the animal food-contact surfaces and most of the non-animal foodcontact surfaces were qPCR positive when swabbed after the contaminated animal food was manufactured and remained qPCR positive after multiple batches of animal food were mixed and conveyed. Therefore, it seems that the proposed mitigation technique (feed batch sequencing) did not mitigate environmental PEDV contamination. Additionally, detectible PEDV seemed to persist on some animal food-contact surfaces, such as plastic and rubber conveyors, more than others such as metal. Previous studies have investigated the survivability of virus on inanimate surfaces and determined viral persistence in the environment can be affected by several factors including surface type [19] [20] [21] . Additionally, different surface types can have different characteristics such electrostatic, hydrophobic or ionic strength which may impact virus detectability on these surfaces [22, 23] . For example, it has been reported that electrostatic forces impact virus attachment to lettuce [24] . Therefore, it is possible that physical properties contributed to the persistence of PEDV on animal food-contact surfaces sampled in the current study. This is interesting because most animal food manufacturing equipment have been designed for electrical efficiency and physical cleanout, but not sanitization. For example, plastic conveyer buckets are preferred not only because they are light and more energy efficient, but they are also safer for workers due to elimination of sparking that is a concern with sheeted metal buckets [25] .",25.83534241325859,12.92280694457413

The importance of an environmental factor in viral persistence has been shown in an experiment that monitored AIV isolation rates before and after days that the market was disinfected [8] . However, whether this environmental persistence adds to transmission has not been determined empirically. Theoretically, indirect transmission via an environmental reservoir could contribute to the overall force of infection within rLBMs by providing a sustained source of AIV (i.e., by providing a transmission link between birds even if they do not occupy the market at the same time) [9] . Indirect transmission can occur through a variety of routes, including viruses in drinking water, in feces on the ground or on surfaces in cages. All of these routes rely on three main processes: shedding rates into/on a particular environmental feature, decay rates of the virus in it, and contact of susceptible birds with it. Intuitively, one would predict that indirect transmission would be most significant when shedding rates are high, decay rates are low and contact rates are high.",15.829502237586837,11.229046653173398

Because the potential for viral contamination in animal food is not well characterized, the objectives of this study were to 1) observe the magnitude of virus contamination in an animal food manufacturing facility, and 2) investigate a proposed method, feed sequencing, to decrease virus decontamination on animal food-contact surfaces. A U.S. virulent PEDV isolate was used to inoculate 50 kg swine feed, which was mixed, conveyed, and discharged into bags using pilot-scale feed manufacturing equipment. Surfaces were swabbed and analyzed for the presence of PEDV RNA by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Environmental swabs indicated complete contamination of animal food-contact surfaces (0/40 vs. 48/48, positive baseline samples/total baseline samples, positive subsequent samples/total subsequent samples, respectively; P < 0.05) and near complete contamination of non-animal food-contact surfaces (0/24 vs. 16/18, positive baseline samples/total baseline samples, positive subsequent samples/total subsequent samples, respectively; P < 0.05).

However, employing DNA as a basis for vaccination also implicates some disadvantages. A concern in this context is the long-term persistence of DNA plasmids upon injection. Indeed, DNA persistence was shown in various preclinical studies that demonstrated the presence of plasmid DNA for up to 2 years upon IM injection with low but detectable expression and immunogenicity in a mouse model (88) . According to the FDA, DNA persistence is not generally evident at ectopic sites in biodistribution and persistence studies, but remains detectable at the injection sites for periods exceeding 60 days 8 . Especially in the context of this long-term persistence, the presence of foreign genetic information in the nucleus of transfected cells poses the additional risk of genomic integration into the host's chromosomes and the resulting threat of mutagenesis and oncogenesis. Despite negative results in several studies focusing on detection of DNA integration events upon IM injection in small animal models, genomic integration events were detectable following electroporation in mice (89, 90) demonstrating that integration represents a small risk that nevertheless needs to be considered in systems with enhanced DNA uptake. The FDA recommends integration studies to be included whenever plasmid DNA exceeding 30,000 copies per µg of host DNA persists in any tissue by study termination. The WHO advises integration studies as part of the preclinical safety program of DNA vaccines 9 . In addition, injection of bacterial DNA, sensed by the presence of unmethylated CpG motifs, has been associated with safety concerns, such as the generation of antibodies against the injected DNA. However, no anti-DNA antibodies have been detectable in mice, rats, rabbits or non-human primates (90) . Potential expression of the antibiotic resistance marker in vaccinated organisms has likewise raised safety concerns that are met by the replacement of these markers in next generation DNA vaccines. Lastly, expression of cytokines or co-stimulatory molecules that are used to enhance DNA immunogenicity might lead to unintended adverse effects upon cytokine expression and release such as generalized immune suppression, chronic inflammation or autoimmunity. The WHO recommends monitoring the persistence of a cytokine expressing plasmid as well as appropriate preclinical models, such as animal models responsive to the respective human cytokine to ensure vaccine safety.",10.85357710439694,4.348888634284896

A merge of the two crystal structures highlighting sites under positive selection revealed analogous amino acid positions especially evident on the extended helical spine of the proteins. 4/11 sites in cGAS are located within the spine while 5/36 sites are located along the OAS1 spine as identified by PAML. Close examination of the structures ( Fig  3C) suggests that three of these sites are analogous based upon the amino acid backbones and the directionality of the side chains: 1) Ser163/Ser11, 2) Asp177/Cys25, and 3) Thr181/Met28 (human amino acid cGAS/amino acid OAS1). Alignment of the cGAS and OAS1 amino acid sequences (Fig 3D) corresponding to the helices of the spine indicate that Ser163/Ser11 is an analogous position. Although the sequence alignment implies that Asp177/Cys25 and Thr181/ Met28 may not be shared positions, the structure indicates otherwise. Permutation tests simulating co-occurrence of three analogous sites under positive selection in the helical spine suggest that such a pattern of overlap is unlikely to arise by chance (p<0.001) (see Methods and Materials, S1 Dataset). Therefore, comparing the location of sites under selection on the merged crystal structures identified distinct and overlapping surfaces under positive selection between cGAS and OAS1.",9.601358960383363,2.0758047378158864

However, UV disinfection also tends to be more expensive than chlorination, especially for building the required infrastructure. UV treatment involves exposure of wastewater to a UV-C light source (described in more detail in Section 7.2), usually a UV lamp enclosed in a quartz sleeve within a stainless steel pipe or suspended in a concrete channel (Gadgil, Kazakevicius, & Drescher, 2002) . UV is particularly effective against bacteria and enteric protozoans (Giardia and Cryptosporidium) but some viruses, in particular adenovirus, have high UV resistance (Hijnen, Beerendonk, & Medema, 2006) . A combination of UV and chlorination can be particularly effective, using suitable doses of chlorine for virus inactivation and UV for Cryptosporidium inactivation, allowing the most costeffective use of each treatment technology. Other disinfection methods have also been developed and tested. Ozone has been proven to be effective against viruses, protozoan cysts, and helminth eggs (Paraskeva & Graham, 2002) and peracetic acid has also been considered a strong disinfectant because of its effective bactericidal, fungicidal, sporicidal, and virucidal properties (Kitis, 2004) .

This study concluded that survival of FCV varied with fomite type. FCV was still infectious for up to 3 days on telephone buttons and receivers, for 1 or 2 days on computer mouse, and for 8-12 h on keyboard keys and brass. Mattison et al.

MNV infectivity on stainless steel rapidly decreased by more than 2 log, and a complete loss of infectivity was reported at day 30 (Takahashi et al. 2011 ) . Additionally, they also showed that the presence of food residues increased the survival of MNV, whereas only 1.4 log reduction of infectivity was reported at day 30. D'Souza et al.

( 2013 ) examined the effect of low and high relative humidity on fomite-to-fi nger transfer effi ciency of poliovirus from several common fomites, showing that transfer effi ciencies were greater under high relative humidity for both porous and nonporous surfaces. Gloves also may serve as a source of virus second transmission, enteric viruses could be transferred in an infectious state from gloves to other surfaces or food and vice versa (Verhaelen et al. 2013 ).",44.61728803703481,17.22441781497253

Drying times range from 15 min to overnight at ambient conditions with volumes ranging from 5 μl to 100 μl. Drying time impacts the recovery efficiencies of surface sampling methods, and generally, the longer a virus is on a surface, the harder it is to recover the virus from the surface. Mattison et al. (2007) tested recovery of FCV from stainless steel surfaces using vortexing at 30 min post inoculation versus immediate recovery after inoculation of 3.0 × 10 5 FCV in 10 μl. The difference in recovery between elution immediately following and after 30 min of drying was 33 and 11%, respectively-a three-fold difference. While this review is focused on FCS and not food, the authors did note that the difference between viral recovery from lettuce and stainless steel may be due to viruses being more influenced by the effects of air drying when on a flat nonporous surface. Park et al. (2015) observed a reduction in the recovery efficiency of hNoV GII.4 from stainless steel and toilet representative surfaces as a function of drying time. On stainless steel surfaces using macrofoam swabs, the recovery efficiency was 43.5% ± 21.4% without drying, 25.7% ± 10.6% at 1 h, 18.2% to 25.7% ≤ 24 h, and 10.0% ± 2.3% after 48 h (Park et al., 2015) . Based on the evidence presented above, there is a need for uniformity among studies and standardization in drying time and inoculum amount in order to properly evaluate virus recovery and surface sampling methods.",40.07300636549087,16.85235471410306

Examples of nonporous surfaces are ceramic, glass, acrylic, and stainless steel, and examples of porous surfaces include carpets, lettuce, deli meats, wood, latex, and fruits. Surface type has been shown to have some effect on surface sampling recovery efficiencies (Table 1) . Tung-Thompson et al. (2017) swabbed foods (cheese, apple, green pepper, tomato) and hard surfaces (stainless steel and ceramic) with wipes that were inoculated with 10 μl of varying PCR-units (PCRU)/ml of hNoV GII.4. The study obtained a mean range recovery efficiency of 74% to approximately 100% for all surfaces except for cheese, which was significantly different from the other surfaces with 29% to 69% recovery for high inoculum levels (10 4 to 10 6 PCRU) and no detection at low inoculum levels (10 2 to 10 3 PCRU) (Tung-Thompson et al., 2017) . The authors were not able to determine if the lipid content of the cheese contributed to the possible absorption and recovery of the virus samples even though a previous study suggested this possibility for hNoVs (Fumian et al., 2009; Tung-Thompson et al., 2017) .",37.167718905403426,14.930907917388254

(2016) evaluated three different swabs (i.e. cotton, foamed cotton, and polyester) and two elution buffers (i.e. direct lysis or alkaline TGBE − pH 9.5) for recovery of hNoV GII.7 and mengovirus from 100 cm 2 laminated wooden surfaces. The authors found a significantly better virus recovery using polyester swabs with the direct lysis in comparison to other combinations tested; however, recovery efficiencies were ≤13% for all combinations. Ibfelt and others (2016) suggested their low recovery rates may be due to the size of the surface or differences in experimental design in comparison to other swab studies. Furthermore, Julian et al. (2011) also recommended the use of polyester swabs pre-moistened in either Ringer's or 0.85% saline solution for MS2 recovery from plastic and stainless steel surfaces following evaluation of three tools (cotton swab, polyester swab, and antistatic cloth) and four elution buffers (saline, Ringer's solution, viral transport media, and acid/base). Based on a meta-analysis of MS2 surface sampling, the authors noted that polyester swabs obtained significantly higher positive MS2 rates in comparison to rayon and cotton (Julian et al., 2011 ). Conversely, De Keuckelaere et al. (2014 found cotton and polyester swabs to not be significantly different in their recovery efficiencies of hNoVs GI.4 and GII.4 from nitrile gloves, polyethylene, or neoprene rubber surfaces. Park et al. (2015) reported a similar result when evaluating the recovery efficiencies of four swab types (macrofoam, rayon, cotton, and polyester). The authors applied the different swabs for recovery of hNoV GII.4 from stainless steel and toilet representative surfaces and found that rayon, cotton, and polyester were not significantly different. However, macrofoam swabs obtained significantly higher recovery efficiencies of hNoV GII.4 in comparison to the other three swabs after 8 h of drying on a given surface (Park et al., 2015) . Additionally, some studies found other tools and methods such as biowipes and cell scraper-aspiration methods to be potentially more efficient for enteric virus recovery from surfaces in comparison to cotton and/or polyester swabs. These studies are further examined in Sections 3.2.2 and 3.2.3 (De Keuckelaere et al., 2014; Taku et al., 2002) .",32.53689256621691,14.463540607289994

The studies summarized in Table 1 use different surrogates, initial drying times, and elution buffers making it difficult to adequately compare the studies. Fallahi and Mattison (2011) recovered 37% of MNV-1 from stainless steel after a 20 min drying time using a repeated pipetting method with EBSS eluent. Mattison et al. (2007) recovered 11% of FCV from stainless steel after a 30 min drying time by vortexing for 30 s in EBSS eluent. Arthur and Gibson (2015) obtained recovery efficiencies of 10% and 30% for TuV from acrylic and stainless steel surfaces, respectively, after a drying time of 1 h using a cell scraping techniques. The cell scraping technique was confirmed as possible with TuV and has also been evaluated using FCV previously (Taku et al., 2002) . Taku et al. (2002) found consistently better mean virus efficiencies for FCV using 50 mM glycine (pH 6.5) from stainless steel surfaces in comparison to 50 mM glycine (pH 9.5) and Modified Eagle's medium (pH 7.2) using the scraping-aspiration method. The mean FCV recovery efficiencies for the scraping-aspiration method from stainless steel were reported to be 42% (glycine pH 6.5), 28% (glycine pH 9.5), and 10% (Modified Eagle's medium). The authors suggested the modified Eagle's medium complex composition may have played a role in being less efficient than the glycine buffers (Taku et al., 2002) . Taku et al. (2002) added cell scraping to the aspiration method for better recovery efficiencies speculating that cell scraping may facilitate release of virus from surface. In addition, Yeargin et al. (2015) recovered a range of 0.15% (cotton) to 35.22% (glass) for FCV and 0.85% (cotton) to 24.27% (glass) for MNV-1 from three surface types (i.e. polyester, cotton, and glass) using a stomaching/sonication method. The authors also found the recovery efficiencies to be highest for glass and lowest for polyester and cotton for both virus types. The recovery efficiencies were also reported to be significantly different among all surface types for the same virus type while only cotton swab recoveries showed a significant difference between MNV-1 and FCV (Yeargin et al., 2015) . Similar to other techniques, more studies with inclusion of more virus types and standardized drying times are needed to provide information on using these alternative techniques for future persistence and environmental sampling studies.",39.55641253027309,14.165558754469417

For instance, stainless steel is a hydrophilic (contact angle of 58.2°in water, surface energy of 50.3 mJ/m 2 ) and negatively charged surface in which microorganisms have been shown to develop irreversible attachment within one minute potentially making surface recovery more difficult (Mafu et al., 1990; Mafu et al., 1991) . The orientation of a surface could interfere with adequate surface sampling and collection as seen in a study involving vertical and horizontal stainless steel surfaces. Taku et al. (2002) determined that greater recovery efficiency could be obtained by allowing the elution buffer to sit on the surface for 15 min-something that cannot be performed on a vertical surface. The mean recovery for horizontal surfaces and sinks using the cell scraper-aspiration method ranged from 32% to 71% while vertical stainless steel surfaces only obtained a mean recovery of 11% since the buffer was not in contact with the surface long enough to facilitate virus recovery (Taku et al., 2002) . Scherer et al. (2009) suggested physical properties of nonporous and porous could reduce virus recovery via trapping virus particles within the matrix/ crevices or facilitate enhanced virus recovery by smooth/porous surfaces. Mattison et al. (2007) suggested the low mean recovery of feline calicivirus (FCV) from strawberries might be due to its surface texture and how the crevices may shield viruses against environmental conditions. Furthermore, the authors observed a pH change in the elution buffer from 7.2 to 5.5 when strawberries were immersed, which could impact virus recovery by either partial viral inactivation or interference with FCV recovery (Mattison et al., 2007) . Overall, physical and chemical properties of nonporous and porous food and food contact surfaces could impact recovery efficiencies of enteric viruses. This review will focus on surface sampling techniques for enteric viruses from nonporous, inanimate surfaces. (Rönnqvist and Maunula 2016 ). There has not been an in vitro cell culture system for hNoVs available until recently (Ettayebi et al., 2016) , and until reproducible and readily available infectivity assays are developed, surrogates still provide much needed information on infectivity of hNoVs. Multiple surrogates are important for understanding infectivity due to variations in their genetic relatedness to hNoVs and the diversity among hNoV genotypes. Other cultivable viruses utilized in environmental persistence research include Aichi virus A (AiV) and HAV-both known human enteric pathogens (Cannon et al., 2006; Koopmans and Duizer, 2004 , Yeargin et al., 2015Cannon et al., 2006Cannon et al., 2006 Duizer, 2004, Yeargin et al., 2015) . Diversity among hNoV genotypes could impact the recovery efficiency from surfaces; however, studies focus mainly on hNoV GII.4 (Table 1 ). This focus is a result of GII.4 being the pandemic genotype of hNoV and accounting for over 80% of all hNoV outbreaks in the U.S. since 1996 (Glass et al., 2009 ). Surrogates provide essential information on hNoV infectivity in relation to viral persistence on food contact surfaces (FCS), and numerous studies have shown FCV, MNV, and TuV to remain infectious on multiple surfaces for at least 7 days or more (Arthur and Gibson 2015; Fallahi and Mattison 2011; Mattison et al., 2007) .",32.67246126824714,13.41395433438752

Selection of proper materials for fabricating these devices are extremely important as the risks of mismatch or incompatibility between the properties of the biological tissues and the semiconductor-based electronics. For instance, Polyimide13 and Parylene14 are two of the extensively used as the substrates for making such devices. However, the microfabrication cost is high due to the complicated microfabrication procedures and the requirement of clean room facilities when using these materials. As mentioned previously, the degradation and mechanical properties of threads can be easily modified by selected various material composition, hence enable threads to be an excellent candidate for the development of implantable diagnostic devices and smart wearable systems. Mostafalu et al. (2016) reported a thread-based microfluidic sensor for 3D tissue embedding to measure strain, gastric and subcutanceous pH in vitro and in vivo. As shown in Fig. 4(d) , microfluidic channels were formed by the hydrophilic threads embroidered into the hydrophilic woven fabric to transport fluid to the testing zone. Conductive threads functionalized with nanomaterials served as electrodes for the in vitro and in vivo measurement of physiological properties. A smartphone was then connected the sensor via signal processing electronics and wireless communication. They evaluated the performance of this integrated system and the results suggested that it was able to act as a part of human skin or clothing and even be implanted. This method presents a promising pathway to make smart wearable equipment, such as smart bandages, smart sutures for point-of-care diagnostics, surgical implants or other applications. Glavan et al. (2016) developed an electroanalytical device by using stainless steel pins as the electrodes and cotton thread and paper as the liquid support and substrate. A stainless steel pin coated with a graphite and carbon nanotube ink served as the working electrode (WE) while bare stainless steel pins served as the reference and counter electrodes (RE and CE) and with a distance of~2.53 mm away from one another.",32.32510497909241,13.018429992194061

De Keuckelaere et al. (2014) evaluated two swabs (cotton and polyester) along with biowipes (Biomérieux, Lyon, France) composed of a mixture of fibers and microfibers (cotton, polyester, and polyamide fibers) moistened in PBS (pH 8.0) by recovering GI.4 and GII.4 hNoVs from FCS (high-density polyethylene, nitrile gloves, and neoprene rubber). There was no significant difference among any of the three tools evaluated based on recovery efficiency from polyethylene surfaces and nitrile gloves for hNoV GI.4. Meanwhile, the authors found significantly higher recovery efficiencies using biowipes (41.3 ± 12.4%) compared to cotton swabs (13.2 ± 5.2%) on the coarser rubber surface (De Keuckelaere et al., 2014) . The authors also found that the mean recovery efficiency of biowipes for GI.4 from rubber surfaces was higher than using polyester swabs even though no significant difference was observed. For hNoV GII.4, there was no significant difference in recovery observed between all three tools tested on polyethylene surfaces and nitrile gloves even though the biowipes had significantly higher recovery efficiency (56.1 ± 12.5%) on rubber surfaces compared with both polyester (22.5 ± 8.7%) and cotton (16.9 ± 6.6%) swabs (De Keuckelaere et al., 2014). Another study further confirmed the effectiveness of these biowipes in collecting hNoV GII.4 at various inoculum concentrations (10 2 to 10 6 PCRU) from stainless steel and ceramic FCS (Tung-Thompson et al., 2017) . The authors reported a range of mean recovery efficiencies of GII.4 using biowipes (bioMerieux SA, Grenoble, France): 76.8-99.3% (stainless steel) and 42.4-96.6% (ceramic). It should be noted that recovery efficiencies reported by Tung-Thompson et al. (2017) were generally much higher than other studies included in Table 1 .",28.307678424583866,12.926366906507262

A few studies focused on evaluating one swab implement for use in recovering enteric viruses from a variety of surface types and virus inoculum levels. Scherer et al. (2009) evaluated a cotton swab with PBS (pH 7.2) elution buffer for collecting hNoV GII.3 and rotavirus from different FCS (i.e. stainless steel, ceramic, high-density polyethylene, and wooden chopping board) with recovery efficiencies ranging from 10.3 ± 13.0% (wood, 10 4 PCRU) to 51.9 ± 38.5% (ceramic, 10 5 PCRU) for GII.3 and 5.4 ± 1.5% (wood, 10 2 TCID 50 ) to 57.7 ± 25.9% (ceramic, 10 3 T-CID 50 ) for rotavirus. The authors found recoveries for both hNoV and rotavirus to be higher from FCS than food surfaces at both inoculum concentrations (Scherer et al., 2009 ).

Devices for preclinical studies include commercially available technologies for administration of solution and for dry powder aerosol formulations. Intratracheal delivery can be achieved through devices, such as the Penn-Century microsprayer (Gutbier B. et al., 2010; Rosas-Taraco A.G. et al., 2009) , the Micro-Mist nebulizer (Zamora-Avila D. et al., 2009) , or the Aeroprobe nebulizing catheter (Nielsen E.J. et al., 2010) .

Bar chewing, chewing on the water bottle, and self-barbering are all stereotypical behaviors seen in rabbits (Gunn and Morton, 1995; Chu et al., 2004) . In addition, rabbits may engage in ""nose sliding"" against solid surfaces like the cage walls and head swaying (Sohn and Couto, 2012) . Animals that exhibit stereotypies do not make good research animals. Efforts should be made, where possible, to prevent these behaviors through the use of environmental enrichment. Enrichment may be in the form of chew-resistant objects (such as plastic dumbbells and stainless steel rattles) and food treats (Poggiagliolmi et al., 2011). As a prey species, rabbits benefit from the inclusion of a hut in the cage or at least a visual barrier into which they may retreat when psychologically stressed (Baumans, 2005) . Breeding females should always have access to a nest box to allow for the necessary expression of normal nesting behavior (Baumans, 2005) . ",34.00570798714758,16.116313400665227

Thus, the antiviral activity of two types of viruses with different surface structures, H1N1 influenza A virus (A/PR8/H1N1) and bacteriophage Q␤, on the surfaces of solid-state copper or silver compounds was evaluated. Influenza A virus possesses a viral envelope, a cell membrane-like structure that encases its central core, while bacteriophages lack an envelope, instead their surface is composed of protein capsids. These two viral suspensions were inoculated onto glass slides loaded with Cu 2 O and CuO particles. After incubation for specified time periods, the viruses were harvested and the viral titers were evaluated by determining the TCID 50 /mL (Fig. 1a) . The titer of influenza A virus drastically decreased on contact with Cu 2 O particles by over 3 orders of magnitude after 30 min exposure to 2.1 mol copper amount (log 10 (N/N 0 ) = −3.7). By contrast, the CuO-loaded sample showed no reduction (log 10 (N/N 0 ) > −0.01) in influenza A viral titer after 30 min exposure, indicating a significant difference in the antiviral activities of different oxidation states of copper oxide.

For a variety of reasons, including the need to utilize bulky equipment in laboratory spaces, many research institutions maintain both barrier and conventional colonies of mice. These distinctly different populations may be maintained in close proximity in some facilities (occasionally within the same corridor), or they may be housed in separate buildings or on different campuses. When a single facility houses both populations, the movement of people and animals is difficult to fully control, especially during off hours, and unapproved traffic or transfers can allow infectious agents to gain access to mice in barrier rooms. Because infectious agents such as MHV and Sendai virus can be assumed to be transmitted not only by infected mice but also by exposure to contaminated fomites (e.g., bedding particles) or recently contaminated surfaces, it only takes one error in procedure to transmit an infectious agent into a barrier colony. Even when kept physically separate, there will be varying degrees of operational overlap that could cause cross-contamination when factors such as staffing, storage, materials transfer, supervision, and inspection are considered.

Much of the evidence has come from serological data, but these are notoriously diffi cult to interpret because of cross-reacting antibodies to other members of the family from prior infections. Given these limitations, serological evidence of infection of bats with WNV has been reported from a number of countries (reviewed in Sulkin and Allen 1974 ) , but there has only been a single report of virus isolation from a fruit bat, R. leschenaultia , in India (Paul et al. 1970 ) . Interest in a possible role for bats in WNV transmission has increased since the emergence of WNV in North America, but although occasional bats have been found to have antibody to the virus including big brown bats, little brown bats, and Mexican free-tailed bats (Pilipski et al. 2004 ; Davis et al. 2005a ; Bunde et al. 2006 ) , there is no evidence to suggest they are involved in either transmission or persistence of the virus.

However, gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea and vomiting are found at a lower frequency in hepatitis A virus infections (74) . Enteric viruses spread by the fecal-oral route. In many disease outbreaks viral transmission occurs via contaminated surfaces (1, 2). It has been estimated that one single vomiting incident may produce an estimated 30 million viral particles (7, 39, 61) . In addition, at the peak of an enteric virus infection, more than 10 11 virions per gram may be excreted in the stool (2, 6, 7, 59, 61, 77) . Contamination of fomites from enteric viruses can originate from aerosolized vomit or the transfer of vomit and fecal matter from hands to surfaces (7, 59, 61) . Viruses aerosolized from flushing the toilet can remain airborne long enough to contaminate surfaces throughout the bathroom (27) . Enteric viruses have been detected in carpets, curtains, and lockers, which can serve as viral reservoirs (39) .

Nanomaterials are increasingly finding uses in products such as antimicrobial surface coatings and semiconductors. These include spherical, cubic, and needle-like nanoscaled particles (approximately 5À100 nm) and near-nanoscaled devices (up to micrometers) [1] . Properties of nanoparticles, for example, their active surface area, chemical reactivity, and biological activity, can be dramatically different from those of micrometer-sized particles [2] , and indeed the biocidal effectiveness of metallic nanoparticles has been suggested to be due to both their size and their high surface-to-volume ratio. These characteristics should allow them to closely interact with microbial membranes, and thus elicit an antimicrobial effect that is not solely due to the release of metal ions [3] . Metallic and other nanoparticles are now being combined with polymers and other base materials and coated onto surfaces which may have a variety of potential antimicrobial applications within the oral cavity [4, 5] .",14.42545627857589,7.148787299363516

Certain viruses such lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) clone 13, which establishes a chronic infection in mice, are relatively insensitive to IFN-I and can replicate in pDCs as well as classical DCs (cDC) [19] [20] [21] [22] . There is also evidence that chronically stimulated pDCs become hypofunctional, which may contribute to the persistence of virus infections [23, 24] . Thus, the impact of pDC on antiviral defense may also vary depending on the tropism of the virus for pDCs and the duration of pDC activation.",17.836536714767497,6.580669613448062

Viruses are obligate parasites; therefore, the level of viral infectivity on a fomite can only decrease over time (5, 69) . Several studies have demonstrated that viruses can remain infective on surfaces for different time periods (1, 2, 9, 13, 33, 48, 64, 68) . The length of time a virus remains viable depends on a number of complex variables (Fig. 2 ). In general, UV exposure and pH have minimal effects on viral survival in indoor environments. Viral survival may increase or decrease with the number of microbes present on a surface. Increasing amounts of microbes can protect viruses from desiccation and disinfection, but deleterious effects may also result from microbial proteases and fungal enzymes (67, 69) . Typically, viral presence on fomites may decrease with surface cleanliness and increase with surface usage (66) . However, some cleaning products or disinfectants are ineffective against viruses and can result in viral spread or cross-contamination of surfaces (8) . Easily measured and predictable factors that influence viral survival on surfaces include fomite properties, initial viral titer, virus strain, temperature, humidity, and suspending medium (66, 69) .",18.620826074902592,6.235514867602321

However, controlling temperature to such a precise degree proves to be challenging in RLS, given the lack of stable electricity supply. Therefore, isothermal amplification is more often used than PCR for performing NAT at the POC to eliminate rapid cycling of heating and cooling and to reduce/eliminate power consumption associated with thermal cycling. For isothermal amplification, a chemical heating approach has been developed [64, 65] . In this approach, an exothermic reaction of calcium oxide and water was used to generate heat ( Figure 2B ), while engineered phase change materials were used to buffer the temperature to approximately 65 °C for isothermal amplification of HIV by RT-LAMP [65] .

This loss of infectivity confirms the study of Songer (1967) who showed the rapid inactivation of the mengovirus due to the RH% between 40 and 60% measured in this study during the 25 min of aerosolization. Goyal et al. (2011) did not detect any infectious virus in used ventilation filters from two large public buildings but they were able to detect viruses by PCR. Farnsworth et al. (2006) showed the difficulty of detecting the persistence of viruses in AHUs since most viruses present on AHU filters are deactivated within a day. The study of Vasickova et al. (2010) focused on the inactivation rate of viruses on different supports. The review of Gerba (2013) revealed different inactivations between viruses. They pointed out differences in inactivation between enveloped and nonenveloped respiratory viruses. For example, they found that the inactivation rate was 0.25 log 10 . h -1 for rhinovirus and 0.625 log 10 h -1 for the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). They concluded that non-enveloped respiratory viruses can survive longer than enveloped viruses. This shows the importance of using mengovirus in this study, which is a model of non-enveloped rhinoviruses. The WHO review about the potential transmission of Avian Influenza (H5N1) through Water and Sewage (2017b) reports that, in general, virus half-lives are of the order of hours. The literature states that the virus support, for example, here the filter samples, can play a role in reducing infectivity. The WHO report on the stability and resistance of the SARS coronavirus (2017a) indicates that the persistence of this virus on wood and cotton cloth is only 12 h. Other studies like Sizun et al. (2000) have proved that human coronavirus can persist for only 3-6 h on sterile sponges while the study of Hall et al. (1980) pointed out that RSV can persist for 2.5 h on cloth gowns and 1 h on paper towels.",16.75116817929349,7.904318677110478

Clinically used variations of DES currently feature controlled drug release from polymers that coat the metal stent skeleton. Twenty-eight days following their deployment, overlapping Taxus and Cypher DES each had more eosinophils associated with them compared to their respective overlapping BMS controls in rabbit iliac artery. 14 These DES are composed of different drugs and nonerodible polymers, but the same metals (316L stainless steel), suggesting that drugs and/or polymers may ultimately attract eosinophils to stent insertion sites. John and colleagues found that a critical amount of polymer may selectively incite eosinophil recruitment in rabbit iliac artery. Cypher was associated with significantly more luminal eosinophils than a polymer-free sirolimuseluting stent, a polymer-free sirolimuseestradiol-eluting stent, or a BMS, but only when each stent platform was overlapped upon itself (i.e., one stent on top of another of the same kind) in the vessel. 15 Eosinophil recruitment following DES implantation in rabbits appears not to be specific to this species, since eosinophil accumulation was observed around Cypher stent struts, followed by less infiltration near both Taxus and BM stents, in porcine coronary arteries. 16 Table 13 .12.1 provides a summary of studies citing the occurrence of eosinophil infiltration in response to a variety of catheter-based revascularization interventions, including purely balloon-mediated, or plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA), and BMS or DES implantation.

Part 1: A deadly viral epidemic begins,"Transmission in respiratory secretions by droplets is the principal mechanism of spread of the new disease that would come to be known as SARS. Furthermore, early work has shown that the SARS virus, now termed the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is also present in faeces, urine and possibly saliva of infectious persons. The causative agent from any of those origins is capable of persisting on surfaces. The persistence on surfaces is particularly worrying because inadvertent self-inoculation into eyes and nose after touching such contaminated surfaces seems to have been a major feature of spread in Hong Kong. 10 Nevertheless, it can be suggested that despite the unsuspected features of the new disease, the universal infection control measures in the dental hospital would have prevented a transmission should a contact attended for dental care during the 11-day period. With hindsight, the routine gloving, gowning and eye-protection measures taken by all staff involved in patient treatment followed by the discarding of all In keeping with an approach of a critical appraisal following events however, it can be suggested it would have been better if the measure of wearing eye protection had been more forcefully emphasised. Subsequently it would be learned that tragically some healthcare workers had been infected with SARS possibly by splashes of infected secretions from patients. 10 But the real lesson from this period is that the transmission nature of the deadly new disease and the arrival of the disease itself were quite unexpected. Future newly emerging diseases will probably have yet different features again. Therefore in future infection control measures in the dental surgery should be evaluated from the point of view of a wider range of possible routes of infection and pathogen behaviours.

The long persistence of SARS-CoV in the postmortem lung tissue indicated the failure of the drugs, including ribavirin, that had been used. The persistence of H5N1 in postmortem lung is also generally longer than human influenza virus. This is probably due to the lack of crossing reacting antibodies in the human host, unlike human influenza virus subtypes. The occasional report of the resistance of H5N1 virus to oseltamivir is a cause for concern [34] . The persistence of the virus also highlights the importance of precautions against infection during postmortem examination despite death after long clinical illness. Another key issue in the management of both SARS and H5N1 is to control or downgrade the inflammatory response in the DAD.

Some organisms resist environmental degradation better than others. M. tuberculosis is a hardy organism with a thick cell wall, and can survive for long periods in the environment. 111 Measles and VZV are both lipid enveloped and are sensitive to changes in temperature, relative humidity (RH) and UV radiation. 124 Viruses without a lipid envelope generally survive longer at high RH (>50%), e.g. poliovirus, 6,120 but lipid-enveloped viruses survive longer in low RH (<50%), e.g. influenza, 6, 110 Lassa fever virus 125 126 Influenza has been shown to survive for 24e48 h on hard, non-porous surfaces such as stainless steel and plastic, but for less than 8e12 h on cloth, paper and tissues. 127 In addition, influenza virus survived for up to 5 min on hands, and could be transferred to hands from these non-porous surfaces for 24 h and from tissues for 15 min. 127 More recently, it has been shown that SARS-CoV can survive in alkaline diarrhoea stools for up to four days, and remain infectious in respiratory specimens for more than seven days at room temperature. 128 Similarities with other viruses of nosocomial importance, i.e. other RNA, lipidenveloped, respiratory viruses such as influenza, suggest that such organisms can survive for long enough in aerosols to cause disease, especially when associated with biological fluids such as mucus, faeces and blood.

In 1990, Li (1990) firstly published a review of MBR and introduced MBR to China (Li, 1990) . Fan et al. (1998) later used MBR to treat petrochemical wastewater. In 1999, Zheng et al. (2003) conducted a pilot test of MBR to treat textile wastewater and laid a foundation for the commercial applications of MBR in China (Zheng et al., 2003) . The study of sidestream MBRs was dominant before 2001 while submerged MBRs were more popular since 2001 because of its lower operational cost. Since 2003, a modified sidestream MBR (also called as airlift external circulation MBR), replacing the recirculation pump by H-type recycling pipe, has been well studied for the treatment of toilet wastewater and municipal wastewater (Fan et al., 2006; Li et al., 2007; Fan et al., 2005) . Another innovative submerged anaerobic membrane bioreactor (SAMBR) was developed in 2004. The membrane fouling was controlled by recirculating the biogas and inducing the mixed liquor turbulence (Wang et al., 2008) . Since 2004, many efforts have been dedicated to the study of this SAMBR for the treatment of high-strength alcoholdistillery wastewater. In order for broader applications of MBR, selfforming dynamic membrane bioreactor (SFDMBR), a process even without manufactured membrane, has been proposed, with cheap coarse pore-sized materials such as Dacron mesh, stainless steel mesh, glass fiber, nonwovens, etc., employed as filtration media (Fan and Huang, 2002; Wu et al., 2005; Chu et al., 2008; Yuan et al., 2010) . In general, among these studies submerged MBRs were mostly utilized for municipal wastewater treatment while the sidestream MBRs were commonly applied for particular industrial wastewater treatment. The objectives of research on MBR may lie in two aspects: utilization and optimization. Research on the utilization of MBR includes the exploration of new functions, pragmatization, scaling up and operation maintenance. The optimization aims at higher operational efficiency better performance for target pollutants removal, lower constructional and operational cost and lower energy consumption during operation. While the scientific research and studies in China are progressing continuously, the much more prominent phenomenon since commercial applications of MBR started in China is the remarkably growth in a short period.

First, with the expansion of the futures market and the increasing prominence of the financial property of copper, the copper spot price has gradually become linked to futures pricing. Therefore, the international copper pricing mechanism should not only be established based on demand and supply fundamentals but also take financial factors into account. Second, given the development of financialization in the copper market, policymakers should construct a pre-warning mechanism for the copper spot price to effectively identify the adverse effects of financial shocks on the international copper market. Third, countries that are greatly affected by the copper price should improve their copper strategic reserve systems to curb excessive fluctuations of market price and ease the negative influence on their national economies. Moreover, governments should promote the diversification of import/export channels and actively seek international cooperation. Additionally, governments should develop and improve the copper futures market to limit copper price risk more efficiently and make the copper market more stable. Fourth, considering the effect of the U.S. dollar on copper bubble-type behaviors, market participants should focus on copper price fluctuations, which can help alleviate the negative influence of dollar depreciation.

The data are sourced from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Explosive behaviors in multiple bubbles can be examined within the selected sample period because the dataset contains supply disruption events, speculative booms and crises, with the international copper market experiencing drastic oscillations. At the end of 1987, massive eruptions of mineral strikes in Peru and the disruption of production in key copper-producing countries such as Chile engendered a sharp decline in worldwide inventory in the international copper market (Todorova et al., 2014) . From the early 2000s, accelerated demand growth in developed countries, in conjunction with rapid industrialization and urbanization in Asia, caused a continuous, strong upsurge in the international copper price (Pauliuk et al., 2013; Rossen, 2015) . Moreover, the global financial crisis in 2008 and the European sovereign debt crisis in 2011 triggered panics of collapse in the worldwide economy because of financial contagion, contributing to a sharp price crash in the global copper market. The low interest rates and quantitative easing policies implemented by the Federal Reserve after the economic recession in 2008 generated upward pressure on the copper price (Baffes and Savescu, 2014) . In addition, the emergence of new financial market participants such as index-based investment funds and speculators has also amplified the variability of the global copper price (Humphreys, 2010) . All these changes may lead to furious price fluctuations, implying the possible existence of copper bubbles. As displayed by Fig. 1 , the copper price has experienced significant fluctuations since the 1980s. After decreasing steadily but slowly from 1980 to 1986, the copper price rose sharply to peak at almost $3500 per ton in 1988 and then fell back due to increased supply. Subsequently, it fluctuated moderately until the end of 2003 within a range of $1377 to $3076 per ton. By 2004, the copper price started on a dramatic upward trend, ultimately rising to a primary peak in May 2006 and to a secondary peak in July 2007. After a temporary decline, it rose sharply again to a record high of $8714 per ton in April 2008, increasing over 250%. Then, as the global financial crisis unfolded, the international copper price plunged substantially to as low as $3105 per ton at the end of 2008. With the re-emergence of sharp upward tendency, copper price skyrocketed to an even higher peak at nearly $9900 per ton in February 2011, which exceeded the level reached in 2008. Subsequently, the copper price returned to a continuous decreasing process again with the characteristic of high volatility. Given the violent fluctuations, it is considered that the copper price is likely to contain multiple bubble episodes.",13.129468631022482,4.696508655891476

Nevertheless, in the context of the commodity financialization, the key role of excessive speculation in pushing price above the level justified by market fundamentals has been highlighted in the copper market (Behmiri and Manera, 2015) . In addition, the U.S. dollar has been a contributing factor to additional volatility since the international copper price is typically denominated in it (Buncic and Moretto, 2015) . Dutta (2018) indicates that oil shocks significantly impacts metal price fluctuations and that market returns exhibit jump dynamic behavior, which may be a sign of possible crashes. As illustrated by Shao et al. (2013) , the supply and demand fundamentals of copper might be incapable of explaining the drastic price movements, while the non-fundamental factors, such as speculation and appreciation/depreciation in U.S. dollar, also induce excessive fluctuations.

This was unexpected because we hypothesized that axonal damage alone could contribute to the recruitment of inflammatory cells in the left posterior funiculus, ipsilateral to the RCA I injection site, without an increase in virus. Thus, we tested whether the number of virus antigen-positive cells in the left posterior funiculus of infected mice receiving RCA I correlated with perivascular cuffing or demyelination. We found that virus persistence did not correlate with perivascular cuffing (r ϭ 0.59, P ϭ 0.16) or demyelination (r ϭ 0.35, P ϭ 0.44) in the left posterior funiculus of the RCA I-injected group (Figure 6, a and b) . This suggests that there was no association between virus persistence and neuropathology in the left posterior funiculus, which is in accord with our prediction. Thus, virus persistence did not play a major role in induction of neuropathology at the posterior funiculus ipsilateral to the RCA I injection site.

We found significant correlations between virus persistence and perivascular cuffing in some areas (for example, left VREZ in the PBS group; r ϭ 0.83, P Ͻ 0.05; Figure 6c ), whereas other areas showed no significant correlation (data not shown). In most areas in all three groups, virus persistence strongly correlated with perivascular cuffing versus demyelination.

The marginal effect suggests that the likelihood of a price bubble increases by 4.8% for a unit decrease in copper supply. When physical supply decreases and is even lower than demand, the insufficient supply puts upward pressure on the copper price, raising the likelihood of bubble occurrence. Second, we find that an increase in copper demand raises the likelihood of price bubbles, complementing similar findings in commodity market (Figuerola-Ferretti et al., 2015; . Specifically, the expansion of copper demand by 1% increases the likelihood of a price bubble by approximately 10.3%. Considering short-term copper productions are inelastic, increased demand might contribute to large movements in the copper price, which supports explosive behavior (Bosch and Pradkhan, 2015) . Third, the interest rate is confirmed to negatively affect bubble occurrence. Nevertheless, the impact of the interest rate is statistically insignificant. Fourth, the result suggests bubble behavior is more likely to occur when the dollar depreciates. Since the international copper price is typically denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in the dollar's value inevitably result in fluctuations in the copper price and promote mildly explosive price behavior (Chen et al., 2019) . Moreover, the depreciation of the U.S. dollar prompts investors to seek alternative approaches to asset allocation, including commodities, contributing to the rapid influx of funds into the commodity market (Hammoudeh et al., 2013) . The rapid increase of trading capital leads to a surge in the copper price, which promotes the formation of price bubbles. Finally, speculation is demonstrated to exert a positive effect on bubble occurrences. With the financialization of commodity markets, increasingly more financial speculators participate in commodity futures markets. Financial speculators affect price fluctuations and bubble behaviors via noncommercial positions (Chen et al., 2019) . In the case of the expectation of further rises, speculators buy a range of copper futures, leading to increases in noncommercial net long positions (Mayer et al., 2017) . In this context, speculators destabilize market prices by triggering positive feedback trading among trend followers who ignore fundamental information and buy futures as prices rise, which pushes up the international copper price and raises the likelihood of price bubbles (Bosch and Pradkhan, 2015) .",12.844869389467314,3.968349768734481

Thus, antimicrobial therapies fail to kill biofilms most of the time. 27 -30 Furthermore, there are few prevention techniques to control biofilm formation without causing side effects. 31 Some of the most important pathogens involved in HAIs include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Clostridium difficile, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. (VRE), Acinetobacter baumannii and some Enterobacteriaceae strains. 1, 21, 32, 33 To a lesser extent, pathogens such as Candida species, viruses [adenoviruses, noroviruses, rotaviruses, influenza, parainfluenza, hepatitis B viruses and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronaviruses] can also survive on surfaces and medical equipment, although there is little evidence of possible survival. 2,32 -34 Most of these pathogens can survive for months on surfaces. 32, 35 Some examples of the most persistent hospital pathogens are summarized in Table 1 along with some of their characteristics. Some investigations have proposed that Gram-negative bacteria persist longer than Gram-positive bacteria and, although it has been suggested that the type of surface does not influence the period of persistence, it has also been shown that longer persistence may occur on plastic or even on steel. 32, 36 In terms of environmental conditions, lower temperatures (4 -68C) and high humidity (.70%) improved the persistence of several bacteria, fungi and viruses. 32 Moreover, the frequency of contamination has been shown to vary depending on the body sites at which patients are colonized or infected. It was demonstrated that 36% of surfaces sampled in the rooms of patients with MRSA in a wound or urine were contaminated, compared with 6% of surfaces in the rooms of patients infected with MRSA at other body sites. 37 ",19.92650486383496,9.373403330383503

However, this kind of disinfection has some disadvantages: the application of disinfectants requires an exposure time of at least 5-10 min; the chemicals might react with acids; they might lose their activity in contact with organic substances; and some of them can cause skin, eye and respiratory tract irritation. 23 In this context, new disinfection strategies must be developed and their efficiencies must be evaluated in terms of their potential applications in hospital settings. This need for novel control methods has been emphasized by the increased resistance of bacterial species to some disinfectants, mainly as a consequence of biofilm formation. 31 One of these alternative strategies is steam vapour disinfection, which has been evaluated by different groups. Tanner 84 demonstrated a reduction of 7 log 10 in MRSA, VRE and P. aeruginosa (to undetectable values) within 5 s of application of a steam vapour system. Sexton et al. 23 applied a steam vapour system to combat MRSA, total coliform bacteria and C. difficile cells, attaining a 90% reduction in bacterial levels. Hydrogen peroxide vapour (HPV) is also used for decontamination of clinical surfaces and equipment. Otter and French 85 found that vegetative bacteria and spores (6 -7 log 10 cfu) survived on surfaces for .5 weeks, but were inactivated within 90 min of exposure to HPV in a 100 m 3 test room. Initial inocula of M. tuberculosis ( 3 log 10 ) and Geobacillus stearothermophilus (6 log 10 ) were exposed to HPV at 10 locations during room experiments and both microorganisms were inactivated in all locations within 90 min of HPV exposure. 86 Falagas et al. 38 reviewed other studies of disinfection with HPV against MRSA, C. difficile and other pathogens in several sampled hospital locations (including surgical wards, ward side rooms, single isolation rooms, multiple-bed ward bays and bathrooms); complete or almost complete disinfection of the sampled hospital sites was achieved with airborne hydrogen peroxide. HPV appears to have low toxicity and has good compatibility with most inanimate materials. 87 UV light exposure has also been applied for room decontamination. It has been used in air-handling systems and upper-room air-purifying systems to destroy microorganisms and can also inactivate microorganisms on surfaces. 88 UV-C was demonstrated to be effective in eliminating vegetative bacteria on contaminated surfaces (both in the line of sight and behind objects) within 15 min and in eliminating C. difficile spores within 50 min. 89 In other study, a mobile UV-C light unit significantly reduced aerobic colony counts and spores of C. difficile on contaminated surfaces in patient rooms. 88 It was also demonstrated that ceiling-mounted UV germicidal irradiation lamps were effective in reducing the viability of both Bacillus cereus and Bacillus anthracis vegetative cells and spores after a minimum exposure time of 1 h at an intensity as low as 8 mW/cm 2 . 90 Both the HPV and UV light methods have demonstrated good results. However, they require the removal of patients and healthcare personnel from the room, have a high acquisition cost and increase room turnover time. 91 Moreover, they do not replace standard cleaning and disinfection. 92 Bacterial adhesion to stainless steel surfaces (the most commonly used material in industry and hospitals) is one of the major reasons for cross-contamination in many scenarios. 93 Thus, more recently, different strategies for the production of antimicrobial surfaces with the purpose of reducing HAI have been extensively investigated and developed. Researchers have focused on the development of surfaces with antimicrobial coatings in order to inhibit biofilm formation by either killing the bacteria or preventing their adhesion. Bacterial growth control can then occur by three different modes of action: biocide leaching, which involves the release of a cytotoxic compound to kill attached microorganisms; adhesion prevention, which uses a super-hydrophobic Review 2723 JAC Continued Review 2725 JAC covering in order to prevent microbial adhesion; and contact killing, which consists of disruption of cell membranes in contact with the surface. 13 Many of these techniques consist of surface modification by introduction of antimicrobial substances such as antibiotics, metals (such as copper and silver) and antiseptics. 93 -98 These surfaces can be obtained by different methods, including adsorption, ligand -receptor pairing and covalent binding. 94 Surfaces that release antimicrobial products can work quite efficiently, although they eventually become exhausted and the diffusible antimicrobials pose the potential problem of inducing microbial resistance, since the surfaces are continually releasing active compounds to the environment for a long period of time. 55, 99 Alternatively, the design of surfaces that kill microbes on contact and do not release biocides may solve this problem. The covering of surfaces with transient metals, such as copper and silver as mentioned above, is a well-established strategy. Moreover, surfaces that catalytically produce biocides using externally applied chemical, electrical or optical energy are an interesting alternative. 99 An example of biocide leaching is the use of Surfacine, which incorporates an antimicrobial compound (silver iodide) in a surface-immobilized coating (a modified polyhexamethylenebiguanide). 83 This compound interacts with the microorganism by electrostatic attraction, penetrates the cell and finally kills it. 83 Surfaces treated with silver iodide resulted in excellent elimination of VRE at challenge levels of 100 cfu/in 2 for at least 13 days. 11 Furthermore, these surfaces retained the antimicrobial effect even after cleaning. 11 Photocatalytic oxidation on surfaces coated with titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) is also a possible alternative. In the presence of water and oxygen, highly reactive OH 2 radicals generated by TiO 2 and mild UV-A are able to destroy bacteria, thus reducing bacterial contamination. 100 Another example of a product that releases an organic antimicrobial is Microban w , which contains triclosan [5-chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)-phenol] as the antimicrobial agent, making the surface resistant to the growth of microorganisms. 55 This antimicrobial technology can be found in hundreds of consumer, industrial and medical products around the world.",22.03984390677259,9.146885179911415

The bioinorganic chemistry of copper is dominated by 1+ and 2+ oxidation states. Almost all of the copper in humans is bound to either transport proteins (ceruloplasmin and copper-albumin), storage proteins (metallothioneins), or copper-containing enzymes, whereas unbound, free copper is not found in large quantities in the human body. A substantial number of copper metalloenzymes are found in the human body. Copper is essential for the proper functioning of these copper-dependent enzymes, including cytochrome-c oxidase (energy production), superoxide dismutase (antioxidant protection), tyrosinase (pigmentation), dopamine hydroxylase (catecholamine production), lysyl oxidase (collagen and elastin formation), clotting factor V (blood clotting), and ceruloplasmin (antioxidant protection, iron metabolism and copper transport). In addition to its enzymatic roles, copper is used for biological electron transport. The ""blue copper"" proteins (named after their intense blue color arising from a ligand-to-metal charge-transfer absorption band at ∼600 nm) that participate in electron transport include azurin and plastocyanin [6] . Most features of severe copper deficiency can be explained by a failure of one or more of these copper-dependent enzymes. For instance, depigmentation can be explained by a tyrosinase deficiency, and the defects of collagen and elastin causing abnormalities in the connective tissue and vascular system can be explained by a lysyl oxidase deficiency. Copper complexes are currently being investigated for their potential anticancer activity. Moreover, coordination with copper, either prior to administration or in vivo, often enhances the activity of various types of drugs such as antitumor and antiinflammatory agents [86] .",17.829327586312754,8.092570800639075

Effective C/D are critical in preventing transmission of infectious agents between patients or from contaminated environments. To aid in this process, it is desirable that surfaces in animal housing and clinical spaces are cleanable and nonporous. This strategy can be as simple as ensuring that wood surfaces are properly sealed and painted or more complex by eliminating furniture and finishes that are not easily disinfected or, in the worst case, those that are essentially not cleanable by standard C/D methods. Furniture and finishes may include carpeting, upholstery, and unfinished or damaged wood surfaces. In a veterinary hospital, in which fecal material and respiratory or other secretions are abundant, frequently defy containment, are more likely to harbor pathogens, and may represent an HAI risk, cleanliness of treatment/procedures spaces, animal housing, and operating rooms is crucial. This necessity is particularly true in critical care and isolation units, where exacting evaluation of all surfaces, construction materials, and equipment is essential to maximize cleanability, environmental safety, and efficient operation of the area. Such considerations should influence the choice of materials and finishes for all kinds of surfaces (eg, floors, walls, benches and work surfaces, doors and frames); solid, nonporous surface materials that are highly durable and with as few Traverse & Aceto seams as possible are best. For example, in personnel areas, such as nursing stations, seamless, highly cleanable and exceptionally durable poured epoxy floors, although more expensive, are preferable to materials such as vinyl tile. Wherever seams are present, regular maintenance to ensure their integrity or that of other interfaces between surfaces is essential. Block walls should be sealed, with urethane-based paints, for example. Although metal doors and frames are nonporous and may be the ideal, some composites are also suitable. Any wood surfaces must be properly sealed and painted. For all materials, regular inspection and maintenance are a must. To facilitate cleaning, there should be adequate provision of drains. Drains should be connected to the sanitary system, and, to limit future disruption for the conduct of work to replace corroded drains, use of stainless steel drain hubs should be considered to prolong the life of the drain in the face of water, cleaners, disinfectants, and animal urine. The choice of heating and ventilation systems and the location of heaters and air vents are all critical components in facility design. Although this factor may be most obvious for the control of pathogens classically considered to be transmitted via the airborne route, it may be less obvious that organisms normally thought of as fecal-oral can be greatly impacted by heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Impacts can be both in terms of contaminating the system and in terms of the system facilitating pathogen spread via, for example, forced hot air systems that circulate contaminated particulates widely throughout a given space. It is imperative that engineers with knowledge about airborne transmission be involved in the design of HVAC systems for veterinary facilities, particularly isolation units.",28.01936986034712,13.112283165206117

The droplets containing influenza viruses are generated by coughing or sneezing from an infected person. Therefore, aerosols are infectious by the droplets, too. Despite the large-droplets transmission is predominant, but aerosol transmission is not negligible. Influenza viruses can be transmitted through aerosols, and this has been supported by published evidence [18] [19] [20] . Many virus are of spherical shape. H5N1 is of a sphere of 80-120 nm in diameter. The virus with many pins in its surface, H5N1 adsorbs cell of respiratory tract, penetrates membrane of cell and enters the nucleus. It can be imagined that the virus would adsorb on aerosol particles, especially pore-containing particles. We may figure out a pictures as shown in Fig. 5 , a virus adsorbs a coal combustion particle at the position with a pore. With the time the virus may move inside or remain on the surface. Bean et al. [21] reported that the virus could survive for 24-48 h on hard nonporous surfaces such as stainless steel and plastics, and the virus inocula with complete drying on the surfaces survived only in 1.5 h. A suspended particle adsorbs moisture on the surface and pores, forming a good accommodation environment for viruses, and this seems better than an aqueous droplet, which evaporates rapidly and shrinks in size. William et al. [22] measured the amount and size of aerosol particles containing influenza virus that were produced by coughing, and they found that thirty-five percent of the influenza RNA was contained in particles >4 lm in aerodynamic diameter, while 23% was in particles 1-4 lm and 42% in particles <1 lm. These results show that coughing by influenza patients emits aerosol particles containing influenza virus and that much of the viral RNA is contained within particles in the respirable size range. The question of aerosol transmission of influenza virus has received attention by some healthcare facilities. For example, during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, a United States Institute of Medicine (IOM) panel recommended that healthcare workers in close contact with influenza patients wear respirators to avoid infectious aerosols [22] .",21.471168672212627,10.109055430004034

The strong survival ability of SARS-CoV over surfaces of commonly used materials in domestic and working environments have been quantitatively proved by in vitro models. 9 Therefore, the disinfection of the ophthalmic instruments as well as the environmental surfaces in frequent contact with patients are deemed as one of the key infection containment measures. Susceptibility of human coronaviruses 229E and OC43 to chemical disinfection has been demonstrated by biological viral titration assay, 10, 11 whereas similar in vitro data concerning the efficacy of different hospital disinfectant products (US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) registered disinfectants) against this novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is currently lacking. 12 Nevertheless, we can still make use of the available chemical germicides that could inactivate related viruses with similar physical and biochemical properties as the possible SARS agents. The adopted disinfection protocols in our ophthalmic practice are in line with the recommendation by the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention 13 and based on the scientific evidences provided by APIC guidelines. 14 Ophthalmic instruments especially those in direct contact with patients' mucosal membranes like the Goldmann applanation prism tip and Goldmann contact lens require intermediate level of disinfection. 14 They should be immediately and separately disinfected with 2% alkaline glutaraldehyde (Cidex s ) for 20 min at room temperature or 6% hydrogen peroxide after use. 14 Frequent (at least daily) disinfection of the apparatus (slit lamp, binocular indirect ophthalmoscope, etc) with hypochlorite (NaOCl) solution (1000 ppm, 1 in 50 dilution of 5.25 % household bleach, for 2 min) is mandatory. 14 The examination table and slit lamp will be cleaned and disinfected thoroughly before another patient is seen in that environment. Surfaces that cannot be easily cleaned, such as keyboards of desktop computers, should be covered within plastic sheeting, wiped between cases, and changed at the end of the day. If the plastic wraps are grossly soiled with patient's tears or ocular secretion, they should be immediately removed and replaced. Daily cleaning and disinfection of the environmental surfaces (eg, door knobs, phone, lavatory facilities) that have been frequently touched by patients and health-care workers are specifically targeted, in accordance with the recommendations by the CDC. 12, 13 Unless it is otherwise indicated, the consultation waiting time and overall consultation time ought to be maintained at a safe minimum.

The copper resistance is one of the important mechanisms required for bacterial survival in environments and pathogenesis. This work aimed to characterize copper susceptibility, prevalence of copper associated genes and their expression profiles in A. baumannii clinical isolates. The copper associated genes were detected by the PCR assay in 102 clinical isolates of A. baumannii obtained from 3 hospitals in Thailand. The copper susceptibility testing was performed by the agar dilution method. The association of gene patterns and copper resistance was analyzed by using Fisher's exact test. The representative isolate was selected to study the effect of copper on the expressions of copper-related genes by using RT-qPCR. The prevalence of cueR and copR genes among tested strains was 100% (102/102) and 18.63% (19/102) respectively. The copper susceptibility study revealed that strains with high MIC copper (10 mM) were found in 24.51% (25 isolates), while 75.49% (77 isolates) of tested strains have MIC copper lower than 10 mM. We found that all 19 cueR + /copR + strains (100%) were resistant to copper (MIC = 10 mM) while only 6 of 83 (7.23%) of cueR + /copR − strains were copper resistant strains (P < 0.01). We also designed additional primers to detect structural genes of both cue and cop operons in a representative strain, AB 1521. We found that AB 1521 contains two structural genes (genes encoding for copper efflux pump and multi-copper oxidase) of cue operon, while cop operon contains six structural genes (genes encoding for CopB, CopA, CopC, copD, copper efflux pump and hypothetical protein). The results from RT-qPCR showed that all genes of cue operon were up-regulated at the micro-and millimolar levels of copper, while all genes of cop operon were over-expressed only at the millimolar levels of copper. This suggested that cue operon was intrinsic resistance system found in all analyzed strains and the cop operon was associated with copper resistance at the higher concentration of copper. The future study need to conduct in order to confirm the gene functions involved in copper resistance and pathogenesis.

Methods: We recruited 173 laboratory personnel and performed QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test (QFT-G) and tuberculin skin test (TST). Agreement between QFT-G and TST was analyzed, and risk factors for the positivity of each test were assessed. Results: QFT-G was positive in 21.4% of the enrolled laboratory personnel, and TST was positive in 33.3% with a cut-off of 10 mm. The agreement between the two tests was fair (kappa = 0.234; 95% confidence interval = 0.054-0.414). Age and duration of health care profession were significantly associated with positive QFT-G and TST results by univariate analyses. With multivariate logistic regression analyses, household contact to TB patients (P = 0.013), the laboratory sections of microbiology (P = 0.045) and chemistry/immunology (P = 0.014) were significantly associated with positive QFT-G results. Conclusions: Our data shows the high prevalence of LTBI in the laboratory personnel, and emphasizes the importance of LTBI screening for the health care workers. QFT-G seems to be superior to TST for the LTBI screening. T. Panayea, G. Petrikkos, A. Armaganidis, H. Giamarellou (Chaidari, Athens, GR) Objectives: Copper has been shown to have antimicrobial properties and when used on hospital surfaces it minimized environmental contamination by pathogenic bacteria. We investigated the effects of two copper alloys on the survival of VIM and/or KPC-producing multi-drug resistant (MDR) Enterobacteriaceae. Methods: MDR clinical isolates were screened for the production of VIM or KPC carbapenemase using the EDTA-imipenem or the boronic acid-meropenem synergy test, respectively. The genes were confirmed by PCR with specific primers. To assess the antimicrobial properties of copper, coupons (1 cm × 1 cm) of copper alloys (A and B containing Cu99% and Cu63%Zn37%, respectively) were sterilized, inoculated with 20 ml of bacterial suspension (10 8 cfu/ml) and incubated at room temperature for 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 and 24 hours. Then coupons were placed in sterile neutralizing broth (Difco) and vortexed. The broth was serially diluted and quantitatively cultured for recovery of viable bacteria. The lower limit of detection was 2.6 log10 cfu/ml. Stainless steel (C) and polyvinylchloride (D) coupons were used as controls. Mean viable counts (log10 cfu/ml) after incubation at each time interval with each coupon were compared for statistical analysis. Reduction of viable counts by 3 log10 from starting inoculum was characterized as bactericidal activity. Results: Thirteen isolates including K. pneumoniae (7), E. coli (4) and Enterobacter spp. (2) producing either VIM (2), KPC (10) or both (1) were tested. At 3 and 5 hours, mean viable bacterial counts on coupon A decreased by 1.2 and 3.4 log10, respectively while the reduction produced by coupon B at 5 and 6 hours was 2.1 and 3.2 log10, respectively. Controls C and D reduced bacterial counts by 2.1 log10 at 6 and by 2.3 log10 at 24 hours, respectively. A bactericidal effect was detected by coupons A and B at 5 and 6 hours, respectively.

The amount of immunoglobulin that can be immobilized on various plastics is given in Table I11 (Herrmann, 1981) . Increasing the amount of antibody bound to a solid-phase surface should result in increased sensitivity of the EIA. However, it has been noted that increasing the concentration of antibody for coating surfaces beyond 10 kg/ml does not give an increase in immunoassay sensitivity. This is apparently due to desorption of antibody from the plastic surface, and steric hindrance of antibody that is adsorbed. Solid-phase surfaces other than plastic tubes, beads, or particles, such as porous glass (Lynn, 1975) have been used to immobilize antibody. However, the majority of EIA tests for microbial infections use either plastic plates or beads.

Adhesion triggers the expression of a sigma factor that depresses a large number of genes so that bacteria within the biofilm are at least 500 times more tolerable against antimicrobial agents [23] as well as against physical cold plasma [71, 72] . The reason for the unspecific increased tolerance is the production of extracellular substances like polysaccharides, proteins and DNA after attachment to surfaces. A precondition for biofilm formation is the presence of certain amounts of humidity. The biofilm matrix restrains water and nutrients and protects the microorganisms against environmental influences [28, 39] . Because of that, once formed biofilms are an important factor of persistence of microorganisms on surfaces in nature as well as in industrial or medical areas [22, 29, 12] . The persistence on inanimate surfaces is prolonged and depends of the environmental conditions, especially the humidity. Also on hospital surfaces biofilms were demonstrated on a number of objects and surfaces, such as sterile supply buckets, opaque plastic doors, venetian blind cords, and sink rubbers, and it was possible to cultivate viable bacteria. Currently, there is not enough research to elucidate whether presence or absence of biofilm affect the risk of transmission or possibility for crosstransmission. However, multi-drug resistant bacteria may not only be protected within biofilms, which may be the mechanism why they persist within the hospital environment [114] , but may also exchange virulence factors among their own species or to other species present in biofilms as well [29, 43, 109 ].",23.372170808574392,12.550555557937713

The synthesized LBL assemblies are of robust nature, which can effectively perform in severing conditions. The stimulating feature about these materials is that the layer-to-layer attractions are not restricted to electrostatic forces but assemblies can also be formed by hydrogen bonding [6] , covalent bonding [7, 8] , and some hydrophobic interactions [9, 10] as well. LBL assembly methods are very advantageous to organize the surface structures at nanometer scale and to incorporate the desired biomolecules. The versatility of this strategy enables us to launch any kind of charge species such as proteins [11] [12] [13] [14] , polypeptides [15] , DNA [16] , viruses [17] , antibodies [18] , and various other biological compounds in thin films preparation. The introduction of different biological species in LBL assembly generates very sensitive biological receptors having tunable selectivity. The induced functionalities in thin films truly favor the production of biorecognition materials. These materials can also be patterned by fabricating different components such as nanoparticles [19] , nanotubes [20] , and some other nanoplates [21] [22] . This is of course of great interest in designing the biorecognition [23] of thin films at nanoscale [24] , which can be deposited on a suitable transducer to conduct various bioanalyses.",18.81822607847926,8.25975063916551

Later, the use of copper for treating sores and skin infections was well accepted by Greeks and Americans while a similar approach is still functional in many parts of Africa and Asia (Dollwet and Sorenson 1988) . Copper materials combined with metals like cadmium and lead have been considered for sanitary and hygienic purposes since 1980s because of its biocidal activity against a varieties of microbes (Domek et al. 1984; Gould et al. 2009 ). CuNPs are currently gaining enormous interests due its low cost, availability and are considered to be practically more safe for humans (Grass et al. 2011; Longano et al. 2012b ). In addition to this, CuNPs exhibit excellent antimicrobial activity against a varieties of clinically relevant pathogens including bacteria, fungi, and algae while a recent few reports have demonstrated their antimicrobial and catalytic efficacies similar to other metallic nanoparticles, i.e., silver and gold Usman 2013) with intrinsic antimicrobial activities. Nano copper is considered as a potential candidate for new generation of antimicrobials since in trace amounts it is necessary for the execution of several metabolic processes in organisms (Krupanidhi et al. 2008 ) and at the same time it shows bactericidal activity at a relatively higher dose due to membrane disruption, nucleic acid and protein damage (Gant et al. 2007 ) and ROS production (Pelgrift and Friedman 2013; Longano et al. 2012b) .",15.676867719257226,7.267242558317902

A number of publications describing antimicrobial applications of these nanomaterials for targeted drug delivery, antimicrobial coatings, biocidal medical devices and wound dressings have risen exponentially. While most research focused on claiming antimicrobial potential of these nanomaterials have employed either the colloidal state or often conjugated with antibiotics/drugs, the hypotheses of using them as next generation antimicrobial agents has limited clinical relevance. It is worth mentioning that for treating biomaterial associated infections, it is an important concern that a biocidal agent would not only kill the invaded microbes, but it should also prevent further bacterial adhesion and colonization on biomaterial surface. At the same time, antimicrobial agent must also encourage tissue integration at the implant site (Subbiahdoss et al. 2013) . The incorporation of nanomaterials on to some support materials would thus be the most promising approach for developing novel nano-antimicrobial surfaces with multiple functionalities, durability with an enhanced biocidal response against clinical pathogens.

Proteins have been used to formulate commercial adhesives, and sealants, for many years, but initially, animal proteins were used for glues. Protein adhesives are used in antique furniture and old religious texts. These adhesives have excellent flexibility and nonwarp characteristics, as well as permanent and tenacious adhesion. They are watersoluble, easy to clean up, nontoxic, eco-friendly, biodegradable, recyclable and repulpable. Protein adhesives have some limitations, however, such as a lack of specific adhesion on coatings and nonporous surfaces and sensitivity to temperature and humidity changes. The use of plant proteins as adhesives is more recent with soy protein-based adhesives widely used between 1930 and 1960. However, they were completely replaced thereafter by cheaper and stronger synthetic adhesives. Today, soy protein alone, or in combination with animal proteins such as casein, gelatin and blood proteins, is used to produce adhesives that are widely used as glues in paper, book binding, packaging, furniture and wood industries (Frihart 2009; Lambuth 2003) . Generally, protein adhesives have sufficient strength in dry conditions but are susceptible to moisture and mould (Lambuth 2003) . The nature of the protein determines the formulation, mixing and application of the adhesive. The manufacturing steps, however, are common and include grinding dry protein extracts to glue particle sizes (typically with surface areas between 3000 and 6000 cm 2 per gram), sufficiently dispersing the ground proteins in alkaline water for maximum binding efficiency and addition of fungicide (such as sodium orthophenylphenate, sodium pentachlorophenate, copper-8-quinolinate or copper naphthenate) to prevent mould.",10.575792663696909,7.152696374745395

They can be used as coatings for drugs, paper and paper products (such as disposable plates) and disposable laboratory items (such as gloves, gowns and disposable diapers) (Krochta 2002) . Soy proteins are very useful for papermaking and paper coatings. Their film-forming characteristics improve the strength and heat resistance of paper, allowing it to be used at higher production speeds in print applications. Their amphoteric nature (possessing both positive and negative charges) and high water-holding capabilities also improve ink receptivity and printability (Brentin 2014) . For some applications, edibility and biodegradability are two important properties. For example, most of the food and drug coatings manufactured from biomaterials are edible, and this property is determined by its formulation, method of manufacture and modification treatments that were used (Krochta 2002) . The biodegradability of films by microorganisms in composting environments at the end of their life cycle, by naturally occurring microorganisms into water, carbon dioxide, methane, biomass and mineral residues, is an important attribute of many proteinbased bioproducts, as it helps to reduce environmental pollution due to packaging. ASTM International (American Section of the International Association for Testing Materials) standard methods for aerobic compositing (D6400-12) and aerobic biodegradation (D5338) have been developed to measure the biodegradability of materials. In order for a plastic product to be labelled compostable, it must meet the US Standard ASTM D6400 and/or the European Norm EN 13432. Both specifications require that materials be completely biodegraded during composting at a rate similar to other known compostable materials (90% of organic carbon to CO 2 within 180 days) and should not leave visual or toxic residue.",12.504995756840493,6.722459096435234

The physical and chemical properties of the adhesive, the type of adherents and the nature of the surface pretreatments are important factors in glue performance, in the short and long terms. To make initial molecular contact, adhesives have the ability to wet and spread evenly on the surfaces of the materials one wishes to joint. Once that is achieved, intrinsic attractive forces are generated across interfaces through a number of mechanisms including adsorption (occurs when adhesive molecules are attracted to a specific site on a solid surface through weak van der Waals forces or chemisorption through covalent bonding), mechanical interlocking (occurs when the adhesive flows into pores or solidifies around the projections), interdiffusion (occurs when the adhesive dissolves and diffuses into the substrate material) and electrostatic attractions (occur when electrons are transferred across the interface, thus creating positive and negative charges that attract one another).

However, the cytokine's presence is nearly undetectable in sera during chronic infection, although the virus might continue to replicate in cells and, thus, persist in the host. This process is attributable to the negative regulatory circuits of type I IFN synthesis such as activation of suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3) viral inhibition of type I IFN signaling, that is, suppression of the host's innate immune response (Martinez-Sobrido et al., 2009) , persistence of the virus in a specific target tissue, and/or decreased virus amplification efficiency during the state of persistence. However, when DCs from spleens were isolated at 30 days postinfection with LCMV Cl 13, which preferentially infects DCs via a-dystroglycan receptor, type I IFN mRNA was detected in those DCs, suggesting the sustained local production of type I IFN by the infected cells during viral persistence (Hahm et al., 2005; Truong et al., 2009) . Type I IFN was suggested to inhibit DC development, presumably explaining the decreased number of DCs observed during the LCMV Cl 13 persistence (Lee et al., 2009) . However, elevated IFN-b contributes to the upregulation of MHC class I detected in the CNS and the peripheral tissues during LCMV persistence and seemed to continuously display antiviral activity, since the virus titer increased in IFNARdeficient LCMV carrier mice (Truong et al., 2009) . Thus, the precise role of locally produced type I IFN during chronic virus infections needs further investigation.",17.883165173600112,11.27629050662567

However, the nonwoven gown has weak liquid absorption ability. The liquid contaminant may easily drop to the floor or splash to the surrounding environment during movement. More important, an extra force added to the movement, such as by pulling off the isolation gown without unfastening the ties, tearing off the plastic apron, or removing the gown or apron forcefully, spreads droplet contaminants that can splash not only to the surrounding environment but also to nearby patients. Therefore, determining the type of isolation gown to use is important. The present results suggest that double gowns with outer absorbent cotton reduce the spread of contaminants to the environment, whereas inner water repellency gowns can resist contaminants and prevent them from penetrating into underwear and even the skin, providing better protection than a single gown in preventing HCW from coming into contact with patients' blood and body fluids during surgery and other splashing procedures.

The use of flexible film isolators for rearing germ-free animals was first reported by Trexler and Reynolds in 1957. However, due to damage caused to vinyl or polyethylene fabric by heat sterilization, chemical methods of sterilization had to be devised. Peracetic acid in 2% solution, with 0.1% sodium alkylaryl sulfonate was used. The peracetic acid was very corrosive, and materials such as plastics, glass and stainless steel had to be employed in isolator equipment. Both rigid and flexible film isolators utilized rubber gloves attached with ring clamps to manipulate materials and animals within isolator chambers. Plastic film joints were sealed with adhesive tape. Air filters were constructed of stainless steel mesh cylinders covered with glass wool and shrouded with plastic. At SDSU piglet isolators are custom manufactured stainless steel tanks that are four feet long, two feet wide and two feet high (Fig. 6) . Each is divided with three removable partitions providing for four piglet pens suitable for neonatal piglets when all partitions are in place. For studies requiring accommodation of piglets beyond 2 weeks of age, it is recommended that two of the partitions be removed and only two pigs be housed in an isolator. As isolators become soiled over time it is recommended that for experiments lasting 4-6 weeks that piglets be housed four at a time for the first 2 weeks, then transferred to fresh 2-pen isolators every 2 weeks thereafter. Isolators of the type described are not suitable for conventional piglets older than 6 weeks of age although mini-pigs could be held longer. Each pen contains a perforated stainless steel floor insert that raises the pen 2 in. above the base of the isolator unit. The insert is fitted with slotted plastic mat, for piglet comfort, improved traction, and to facilitate waste drainage. A metal feed pan is bolted to either side of each partition. A rigid stainless steel mesh platform used for feed and equipment storage is secured to the top of the isolator pens, and provides a place to hold piglets for treatment. Each isolator unit is mounted on a stainless steel cart fitted with a cylindrical isolator port, an inlet and outlet filter, and a blower unit attached to the inlet filter. A flexible film canopy (Standard Safety Equipment Company, McHenry, IL) fitted with one pair of sleeves on each side is attached with adhesive tape (Vinyl #471; 3 M, St. Paul, MN; Fig. 6A ) to the stainless steel isolator tank, entry port and filters. Rubber gloves (Lab Safety Supply, Inc., Janesville, WI) are fitted to each of the sleeves with a plastic collar and attached with adhesive tape. The canopy rises 24 in. above the isolator and is inflated by the differential pressure between the inlet filter and outlet filter. Attachment of the canopy to the isolator port is near its linear center to allow for attachment of a flexible film cap to each end of the port cylinder. Internal air pressure secures the internal port, but the external port must be secured with adhesive tape. The external cap is fitted with two cylindrical fittings through which aerosolised peracetic acid can be injected with a pressure sprayer as surface sterilizing agent for items such as canned piglet formula or packaged specimens passed into or out of the isolator (sterilization time is 20 min). When not in use, the fittings are plugged with rubber corks to preserve port sterility (Fig. 6B ).",47.46152171391415,20.67613991016506

According to Cox, 18 Stephenson et al, 19 and Ijaz et al, 20 viruses without a lipid envelope (eg, poliovirus) generally survive longer at high RH (.50%), but lipid-enveloped viruses (eg, influenza, Lassa fever virus, human coronavirus [hCV] 229E) survive longer in low RH (,50%). [18] [19] [20] Data on hCV 229E indicate that when airborne, this virus has a survival half-life of about 3 hours at an RH of 80%, 67 hours at an RH of 50%, and 27 hours at an RH of 30% at 20 8C, suggesting that high RH (.80%) is most detrimental to the survival of this coronavirus. Bean et al 21 reported that influenza can survive for 24-48 hours on hard, nonporous surfaces such as stainless steel and plastic, but for less than 8-12 hours on cloth, paper, and tissues. In addition, influenza virus can survive for up to 5 minutes on hands, and can be transferred to hands from these nonporous surfaces for 24 hours and from tissues for 15 minutes. 21 More recently, Lai et al 22 demonstrated that SARS CoV can survive in alkaline diarrhea stools for up to 4 days and can remain infectious in respiratory specimens for more than 7 days at room temperature. Similarities with other viruses of nosocomial importance (eg, other RNA lipid-enveloped respiratory viruses, such as influenza) suggest that such organisms can survive long enough in aerosols to cause disease, especially when associated with biological fluids such as mucus, feces, and blood.

In general, conventional piglets can be maintained a maximum of 6 weeks in the isolators while minipigs can be housed for 8-9 weeks. In comparison with laboratory rodents, the piglets have at least two advantages: large newborns and discontinuity of the breeding. Both save money and labor.

By air sampling, hPIV-1 was isolated from air obtained in only one of 150 infected children at a distance of 60 cm [24] . However, nasal secretions can travel a distance greater than 10 feet to contaminate surrounding fomites [23] . An experimental study demonstrated that hPIV can survive in stainless steel for 10 h [16] . Although the transfer of hPIV-3 from finger to finger or from finger to metal disc did not occur, hPIV-3 could be transferred from contaminated disks to clean hands [25] . Therefore, person-toperson spread by direct hand contact appears to be an unlikely mode of transmission, whereas contaminated surfaces may lead to direct self-inoculation. To date, only these pieces of indirect experimental evidence have supported contaminated surfaces as a mode of hPIV-3 transmission. In this context, the extensive environmental contaminations and prolonged environmental presence of hPIV-3 were clearly demonstrated, and these findings may partially explain why hPIV-3 is easily spread in the haematology ward. In addition, this emphasizes the importance of disinfection of environmental surfaces. It is noteworthy that hPIV-3 infection was documented in one minimally symptomatic healthcare worker who obtained this virus from the hPIV-3-infected patients. Although it is not exactly known whether asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic healthcare workers can transmit hPIV-3, asymptomatic hPIV-3 viral shedding in the nasopharynx among immunocompetent hosts and the previous outbreak reports suggest the potential role of asymptomatic healthy carriers in nosocomial transmission [9, 17, 26] . In our data, we could not carry out universal screening for healthcare workers during the outbreak, thus precluding our ability to define the precise role of none-tominimal symptomatic healthcare workers in nosocomial transmission. However, since the same nursing team cared for the index patients and the latterly infected cases of cluster 1, and one of the nursing team members (patient K in cluster 5) had documented hPIV-3 infection, healthcare workers may have a role in nosocomial transmission.

Regenerative activity appears absent. 2004 ICC is associated with marked hepatic copper overload (Fig. 3.147) . The copper storage has been demonstrated histochemically (by staining tissue sections with orcein for copper-binding protein and using the rhodanine method for copper) and by quantitative techniques such as atomic absorption spectrophotometry. 2000, 2001, 2005, 2006 It is now generally accepted that the copper storage is directly responsible for the histopathological lesions in ICC. The copper accumulates first in periportal hepatocytes and then extends toward the terminal hepatic venules. Orcein stain may also have diagnostic utility. 2007 In 1983 , Tanner et al. 2008 proposed that increased dietary copper (from copper-contaminated milk stored in brass and copper containers) could be of aetiological significance in ICC. Subsequently, O'Neill and Tanner 2009 demonstrated experimentally that copper (but not zinc) is avidly taken up from brass and bound to casein, from which copper is completely removable by picolinate chelation. They concluded that milk is an effective carrier of copper from a brass utensil to the infant enterocyte.

In the early stage of Wilson disease, hepatocellular copper is intracytoplasmic rather than lysosomal and therefore not demonstrable histochemically.",15.31473033490003,7.314879708506438

Available copper in the plasma compartment is bound to albumin or histidine and undergoes reduction to the cuprous form before being transported into hepatocytes by the transmembrane transport hCTR1, encoded by the gene SLC31A1, which appears to span the hepatocellular plasma membrane as a trimer to form a channel. Near the amino terminus, hCTR1 has a copper-binding domain which contains a methionine cluster (MXXXM). 1940, 1941 A second copper transporter, hCTR2, is involved in low-affinity copper uptake by hepatocytes. The action of hCTR1 does not regulate hepatocellular copper homeostasis; however, when copper concentrations are elevated, hCTR1 is degraded. Inside the hepatocyte, little if any copper exists as free copper, apparently because it is a pro-oxidant. Cellular copper toxicity can be prevented by binding to metallothionein and glutathione. Small proteins called 'metallochaperones' mediate delivery of copper to specific sites within the cell. 1942, 1943 CCS1 directs copper to SOD1 in the cytoplasm. Cox17 supplies copper to cytochrome-c oxidase in mitochondria. Sco1 and Sco2 mediate the transfer of copper to subunit II of cytochrome-c oxidase, and other metallochaperones might be involved. ATOX1 transports copper to the Wilson ATPase. ATOX1 has a single CXXC copper-binding motif; it interacts directly with the Wilson ATPase to transfer copper. 1944, 1945 The Wilson ATPase has dual functions: incorporating copper into nascent caeruloplasmin and facilitating biliary excretion of copper. Studies using various model systems have shown that the intracellular location of the Wilson ATPase changes with increased intracellular copper concentration. When intracellular copper concentration is elevated, the Wilson ATPase redistributes to the vicinity of the bile canalicular membrane. 1946 Details of the cellular mechanism of biliary excretion of copper remain unknown. Direct exocytosis into bile of copper from cytoplasmic vesicles in the endosome-lysosome spectrum is an important mechanism. Lysosomal function relating biliary excretion in the Long-Evans Cinnamon (Wilsonian) rat is normal. 1947 Other mechanisms for biliary excretion include a paracellular pathway 1948 and direct transfer of copper bound to glutathione via a bile canalicular transporter. 1949 COMMD1 ('MURR1' renamed, once it became evident that it was part of a family of proteins) is a ubiquitously expressed protein encoded by COMMD1, the gene which may be abnormal in Bedlington terrier hereditary copper toxicosis. The role of COMMD1 in hepatocytes is unclear, but it likely plays a role in the biliary excretion of copper. COMMD1 appears to interact with the Wilson ATPase. 1950 Based on clinical experience, the therapeutic strategy of choice remains chelating agents, particularly D-penicillamine. 1951 In the Long-Evans Cinnamon rat, the drug dissolves copper-rich granules in hepatic lysosomes and prevents the development of fulminant hepatitis. 9 Serious adverse effects may occur with D-penicillamine. Alternatives to D-penicillamine include trientine 1952-1954 and zinc. 1955,1956 Trientine is a chelator with an entirely different structure from that of penicillamine, whereas the mechanism of action of zinc involves competition for copper uptake. It entails induction of enterocyte metallothioneins which have greater affinity for copper than for zinc; consequently, copper taken up by enterocytes is bound and excreted with normal enterocyte turnover. In addition to blocking uptake, this leads to total body depletion of copper by interfering with reabsorption of copper recycled though bile and other fluids",16.362989757298998,6.5141989497779305

For cleanroom application, retention of static charge is benefi cial; whereas in an industrial environment (e.g., the sugar industry) dissipation of static charge is most often required. Several nonwovens are available with a conductive surface to fulfi ll the requirements of static dissipation arising from explosive hazardous applications (Sievert, 2011) . The high resistivity exhibited by the majority of synthetic fi bers makes them a potential source for static build up, which can lead to arcing and explosions. In order to reduce such risks, a range of methods have been employed to increase the conductivity of fi lter media and facilitate the movement of any static build up directly to the ground. Such methods, which have varying degrees of durability, cost, effi ciency, practicality and contamination potential, include the use of epitropic and stainless steel fi ber admixtures, chemical coatings, aluminized coatings, carbon/resin coatings and carbon lines printed on a media. At the time of writing there is a clear market potential for the development of an effi cient, durable, convenient conductive fi ber which can be successfully applied to a wide range of fi ltration applications (Scoble, 2011) .

B, Final excision stage. Initially two longitudinal incisions, approximately 5 mm apart and 15 mm long, are made into the muscle in the direction of the myofibers. A horizontal cut is made 3 to 4 mm below the surface to undermine a piece of muscle. One jaw of the clamp is inserted under the muscle until its tip just exits on the other side. The clamp is lifted several millimeters above the surface of the muscle to ensure that the muscle fibers are tense and then the jaws are clamped. The clamped piece of muscle is excised by cutting at each end adjacent to the clamp as shown above. The muscle sample, still in the clamps, is placed in the fixative, usually 10% BNF, for histopathologic examination and fixed overnight. For fixation for electron microscopic examination, the muscle in the clamp is placed into EM fixative for 1 to 2 hours. For histopathologic examination, the muscle is trimmed by freeing the strip of muscle between the clamps by cutting immediately adjacent to the clamp jaws.

Both samples are desirable for histopathologic examination. For electron microscopy, after fixation for 1 to 2 hours, slivers 0.5 to 1 mm thick are shaved from the outside of the sample. These are cut into pieces 0.2 mm in diameter and 0.5 mm long, with the longer dimension being in the direction of the myofibers. This long sample facilitates embedment so that the fibers are oriented either in cross section or longitudinally. Both sections are required for electron microscopy. C, Pinning strips of muscle onto a rigid surface, such as a piece of tongue depressor before immersion in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, will also minimize fixation artifacts but is not as effective as the clamps shown above. Myofiber diameters, cytoarchitectural changes, and the percentage of abnormal myofibers are most reliably evaluated in transverse sections. Longitudinal sections reveal the length of changes such as segmental necrosis or regeneration or deposition of storage material. Improperly oriented samples, which result in sections that have obliquely oriented myofibers and thus neither longitudinal nor transverse myofibers, are difficult to evaluate. Use of a magnifying glass or dissecting microscope can aid in determining the orientation of myofibers during trimming of muscle before sectioning. Routine stains, such as hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), run the risk of offering the pathologist a ""vast pink wasteland"" for evaluation and are often inadequate for detecting subtle myopathic changes, lesions within intramuscular nerves, or the presence of abnormal stored material. Various special stains, including reticulin, Masson trichrome, von Kossa, lipid (performed on frozen sections of fixed samples), and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) for glycogen, are often invaluable in the evaluation of routinely processed skeletal muscle (E- For many decades, myofiber typing could be done only on frozen sections using the myosin ATPase reaction. Recently, immunohistochemical staining of myosin has been developed for demonstration of myofiber types in formalin-fixed muscle. This is a major advantage because fiber-type staining is often essential for the complete evaluation of muscle. It is most useful in demonstrating preferential involvement of a fiber type and alteration of the fiber-type pattern, the result of denervation and reinnervation.",20.01495799989796,9.30900795807395

In resource-limited settings, with the limitation of access to technology, it is important to adhere to basic concepts of environmental cleaning by the use of a risk stratification matrix to help determine the needed frequency of environmental cleaning/disinfection [14] . Table 1 provides an example of such risk stratification. Data on practice of environmental cleaning/disinfection in resource-limited settings is limited. Notable, a national survey in Thailand Heavy contamination: surfaces and/or equipment that are routinely exposed to copious amount of blood and/or other body fluids (e.g., burn unit, dialysis unit, emergency department). Moderate contamination: surfaces and/or equipment are not routinely, but may become contaminated with blood and/or other body fluids (e.g., patient room, bath room if patient is incontinent). Light contamination: surfaces and/or equipment that are not expose to blood or body fluid. Interpretation of total score (e.g., lounges, office): Hi-touch: surfaces that have frequent contact with hand (e.g., door knobs, bed rails, computer keyboard); Low-touch: surfaces that have minimal contact with hands (e.g., wall, ceiling, mirror). 7: High risk: clean after each case/event/procedure and at least twice per day, clean additionally as required. 4-6: Moderate risk: clean at least once daily, clean additionally as required (e.g., gross soiling). 2-3: Low risk: clean according to a fixed scheduled, clean additionally as required (e.g., gross soiling) [15] revealed that 9 90% of surveyed hospitals (n = 212) reported having implemented an environmental cleaning/disinfection (ECD) protocol. However, only 55.2% (117/212) had an ECD checklist available and 43.4% (92/212) had a mechanism to audit ECD practices. Among hospitals implementing an ECD protocol, high adherence to implemented ECD protocols and to ECD checklists was documented only in 57.1% (109/ 192) and 57.3% (67/117), respectively. Because routine and terminal environmental cleaning by environmental service workers are frequently inadequate [16•] , these data emphasize the need to have mechanisms for monitoring adherence to ECD protocols as well as to ECD checklists. Interestingly, methods used to audit ECD practices include visual inspection of cleanliness (66%), microbiological monitoring (57%), fluorescence marking (14%), and ATP or bioluminescent testing (10%). It is recognized that barriers and challenges for hospitals to effectively implement ECD protocol include staff concerning, inadequate education provided to staff, lack of resource and funding, time constraints, and uncertainty regarding which cleaning and disinfecting products to use. Simple suggestions to reduce environmental-related infection in a resourcelimited setting, if implementable, include (1) all mattresses should be covered with plastic liner that completely encloses the mattress, which makes cleaning easier and eliminates possibility of mattress becoming contaminated with liquids and harboring bacteria;",13.117516110691808,7.61030004086463

The system consisted of two separate spray chambers with separate capillaries, a particle hybrid chamber, positive and negative power supplies, and two syringe pumps. The NP and MWCNT suspensions were transferred using metal taper tips (New Objective, Woburn, MA, USA) and stainless steel tubing (IDEX Health & Science, Oak Harbor, WA, USA), respectively. The tip with an inner diameter of 100 mm was used for the NP suspension. For the MWCNT suspension, tubing with an inner diameter of 150 mm was used to increase the number of MWCNTs transferred and to reduce the likelihood of nozzle blockage by nanotubes of the undesired size. Two separate syringes (Hamilton, Reno, NV, USA) on two individual syringe pumps (KD Scientific, Holliston, MA, USA) were used to drive the two solutions. The pump flow rates were 0.08 mL/h (for the NP solution) and 0.8 mL/h (for the MWCNT suspension). Carrier air was filtered through a HEPA filter and a diffusion dryer at a flow rate of 10 L/min prior to its introduction into the separate spray chambers of the THES. Upon application of positive and negative voltages to the separate capillaries via a DC high-power supply (Korea Switching, Seoul, Republic of Korea), the two suspensions were electrosprayed, and the generated droplets were transported immediately into the hybrid chamber (volume: 892.21 cm 3 ) located directly below the orifice plate. The size of the liquid droplets was further reduced by solvent evaporation. Oppositely charged NPs (positive) and MWCNTs (negative) collided with each other via electric Coulombic attraction, coagulating into single NP/MWCNT nanostructures.

Particularly, detachment from primary minima will occur if the adhesion between the substrate and the primary sphere of the aggregate nearest the substrate or the rough asperity (not only spherical) is eliminated by the repulsion from the main body of the aggregate or the rough particle (not only micro-sized), For example, our study explains why viruses exhibit most conservative transport compared to microbial pathogens in the environments although the classic DLVO model predicts that smaller particles have lower interaction energy barriers and hence are more favored to be irreversibly attached at primary minima. This is because virus surfaces (i.e., capsid) are commonly rough (e.g., spikes on Coronavirus). The surface protrusions not only favor virus attachment, but also facilitate hydrodynamic and chemical detachment of viruses.

Specif-ically, semidifferential electroanalysis was used because this tech nique provides a clear separation of the biogenic amine neurotransmitters, DA and 5-HT. Dopamine and 5-HT were detected with a stearate working electrode (diameter: 175-200 p.m) at oxidation potentials of +0.14---0.015 V and +0.29---0.015 V respectively. The microelectrode was fabricated by pulling the Teflon coat of a stainless steel wire (Medwire Corp., Mt. Ver-non, NY) 500 Ixm over the edge of the stainless steel component of the wire to form a microcavity inside the teflon well. The microcavity was then packed with a graphite-nujol-stearate paste mixture. (2) . After each electrode was fabricated, it was examined for homogeneity of paste distribution under a dissecting microscope at 30 × magnification (Nikon, SMZ-1 with Nikon Transformer Illuminator XN, Garden City, NY). Then, a gas chromatographic and a combustion analysis method for the exact determination of electrode paste composition after paste synthesis can be performed. These methods are also published (3) . A medium exchange technique was performed on each electrode in vitro before surgical insertion and implantation of the electrode in vivo. This procedure consisted of performing a selective preconcentration of the analytes, DA and 5-HT onto the electrode surface in phosphate buffer (0.01 M) pH 7.4, in a closed semidifferential circuit, scanning from -0.2 V to +0.4 V, at 2 nA/V, three separate times on three separate days. This method achieves optimum and stable preconcentration of analytes and improves the selectivity, the efficacy and the sensitivity of the electrode for analytes in electrolyte environments.

Virus reactivation in the CNS in mice devoid of antiviral Ab results in increased demyelination. A protective role of B cells is supported by accumulation of virus specific ASC following T cell mediated clearance. The prominent mechanism of Ab mediated protection appears to reside in its neutralizing activity. Furthermore, humoral immune mediated control does not appear to initiate or enhance the severity of demyelination. Thus, an evolving model of biphasic immune control of viral infection of the CNS has developed with acute clearance and initiation of demyelination being controlled by T cells while viral persistence and possibly repair is regulated by humoral immunity.",18.41030587743998,7.2461443769131915

Biofilms may be responsible for a wide variety of nosocomial infections. Sources of biofilm-related infections can include the surfaces of catheters, medical implants, dental unit water lines or other types of devices, as well as cooling towers, shower heads. The biofilm protects its inhabitants from antimicrobial agents, pH alterations, and confers protection against desiccation. It is possible to encounter desiccation in natural or man-made environments through evaporation, flowing-off or system shutdown. However biofilm-associated bacteria can survive for a while in the absence of water within systems. In this study the survival of heterotrophic bacteria, sulphate reducing bacteria (SRB) and amoeba were evaluated against short time desiccation. Methods: Biofilms were allowed to grow for 30 and 60 days on stainless steel coupons. For the desiccation experiment, coupons were taken out from the reactor and left air-dried. Desiccated cells were rehydrated in 10 ml of sterile phosphate buffer after 6, 24, 48, 72, 96, 168 hours and biofilm were removed from coupons. For enumeration of heterotrophic bacterial count, samples are plated on R2A agar for 10 days at 27°C. Postgate medium B was used for SRB cultures. For amoeba isolation biofilm homogenates were spread on non-nutrient agar plate overlaid with Eschericha coli. Results: After 72 h of desiccation of 30 d old biofilm, SRB growth was seen while no heterotrophic bacterial growth was observed. Whereas on 60 d old biofilm, heterotrophic bacterial growth was observed after 96 h, however SRB growth was seen after 168 h. No significant differences were found between zero time and 24 h counts regarding heterotrophic bacteria. Discussion: Heterotrophic bacteria are located at the biofilmwater interface; whereas anaerobic bacteria niched in the deeper layers of the biofilm. The ability of some pathogenic bacteria to survive within the cysts of amoebas is suggested as a possible mechanism by which the organism evades disinfection and spreads to colonize new environments. Bacterial resistance to desiccation has been reported frequently, but the maximal tolerance of microorganisms in the air-dried state is still unknown. The study showed that diurnal absence of water could not affect biofilm-associated microorganisms significantly.",15.692115478264917,7.138338470848073

The brain is considered a unique organ, with different and sometimes absent expression of the MHC-encoded cell surface molecules that normally bind and present antigenic peptides on the surfaces of peripheral cells for recognition (binding) by the antigen-specific T cell receptors. CD8 + CTLs mediate their antiviral effects by recognizing viral peptides presented by class I MHC molecules on the surfaces of infected target cells, whereas class II molecules present antigen to CD4 ''helper'' T cells. Engagement of the T cell receptor (TCR) with the peptide-loaded MHC leads to perforation of the target cell membrane, delivery of cytolytic granules and lysis of the infected cell. In most tissues, the loss of infected cells is accompanied by enhanced uninfected cell division to replenish the cell population. However, this may not be an optimal strategy for clearance of all viral infections in the CNS (Patterson et al., 2002a,b) , lest vital neuronal functions get compromised. To limit immune cell entry into the CNS and restrict T cell-neuron interactions, multiple anatomic and biochemical barriers exist within the brain, including the BBB, limited lymphatic drainage and the paucity of class I MHC on resident brain cells. Nevertheless, activated T lymphocytes patrol the CNS parenchyma (Hickey et al., 1991) and are recruited even more into the brain after infection by many neurotropic viruses (Binder and Griffin, 2001) . While non-specific T cell trafficking into the CNS may be antigen independent, the persistence of virus-specific T cells and their antiviral functions in the brain definitely depends on MHC restricted antigen recognition (Bergmann et al., 2006) .",14.976892011349626,6.016530422811537

Enveloped viruses such as parainfluenza virus or F6 have a very low survival on hands 100e103 and this appears to be the case for influenza A virus as well. 104, 105 For inanimate surfaces, porosity is a major factor influencing inactivation rates. At 35e40% RH, typical for indoor environments, influenza A virus survives for more than 24e48 h on stainless steel and plastic surfaces, but drops to undetectable levels after 8e12 h on porous surfaces such as paper tissue, pajamas or paper. 105 Transfer of viable influenza A virus from paper tissue to hands was only possible for 15 min, but transfer from stainless steel to hands for 24 h. The first-order inactivation rates of viruses on porous surfaces are approximately 24 day À1 and 2.9 day À1 on stainless steel; the latter value is an order of magnitude lower than the value reported for glass surfaces. 83 After the transfer to hands from both surface types, viable virus fell to low titers within 5 min; firstorder inactivation rates on hands range from 1300 to 2100 day À1 ; high spontaneous decay of influenza A virus on skin was also found in another study. 106 On Swiss banknotes influenza A viruses of the subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 have very low inactivation rates. 107 H1N1 shows a low inactivation rate of approximately 0.05 day À1 . The surprising finding is that influenza A/Moscow/10/99 (H3N2) showed no significant inactivation whatsoever after 10 days. Nasal mucus has a strong survival enhancing effect, probably mediated in part through stabilization by proteins and salts. 43 This might explain why influenza A virus can be detected on a wide range of fomites in homes and day care centers. 108 The type of metal can strongly affect inactivation rates. Influenza A remains viable for more than 24 h on stainless steel surfaces, but no more than 6 h on copper; the respective inactivation rates are 1.4 day À1 and 33.2 day À1 . 109 This study was performed at 22 C and 50e60% RH. The value for stainless steel is close to the value reported above. Influenza A virus on surfaces is RH sensitive as well; virus deposited and dried on glass slides shows the same pattern of RH sensitivity as in the airborne state. 83 The claim that avian influenza virus of the type H13N7 survives better on non-porous than on porous surfaces 110 is based on maximum detection times (which will depend on initial titer), not on inactivation or survival rates. Some of the calculated inactivation rates do not support the claim made by the authors. The first-order inactivation rate constants are, for example, 1.69 day À1 on steel, 1.32 day À1 on tiles, 0.58 day À1 on cotton fabric and 1.0 day À1 on feathers; the RH in which the experiments were conducted is not reported.",54.19787791663269,21.764312564858304

Infected cells can spread viruses directly into the surrounding air (primary aerosolization) or to fluids and surfaces, which can become sources for airborne transmission (secondary aerosolization). Secondary aerosolization can occur for any virus, predominantly when air displacements or movements around contaminated surfaces or fluids disperse the viruses into the air. It can also occur by liquid splashes, which can aerosolize viruses in liquids or on surfaces. In fact, almost any kind of disturbance of infected organisms or materials, even the bursting of foam in seawater, can produce airborne, virus-laden particles (Aller et al., 2005) . Virus-laden particles are a complex mixture of various components (salts, proteins, and other organic and inorganic matter, including virus particles). The size of the viral particle itself does not rule the airborne particle size. The influence of viruses alone on the granulometric distribution of aerosols is likely negligible compared to that of the remainder of the aerosol.

It is generally accepted today that bovine-like CoVs are host-range variants of BCoV, which is crossing the interspecies barriers on a regular basis. Transmission of BCoV variants from cattle to other ruminants and vice versa allows persistence of the infection in nature, recurrent emergence of epidemics and continuous evolution of the virus. Wild ruminants, in particular, are not confined to discrete geographic regions and are always moving to seek new pastures, to escape from predators, and to find mates. Human activities, includingbut not restricted todeforestation, over-hunting and game farming, also force wild animals to change habitats.

Several studies have indicated that complement activation on material surfaces is initiated through the CP [29, 68] . The concept of exploiting those complement-regulatory effects on foreign surfaces has been reported. Engberg et al. have used streptococcal M protein-derived peptides to specifically recruit human C4BP to substrate surfaces, thereby reducing complement activation via the CP and suggesting that RCA-binding peptides may be promising regulators of complement activation on the surface [69] . The AP C3 convertase is of major importance because of its ability to amplify the reaction on the surface [33, 70, 71] . Therefore, it is critical to regulate the AP C3 convertase in order to avoid complement attack. The mobilization of factor H to the surface of materials and cells offers a possible approach to regulating complement systems through the AP that has been explored using purified, covalently immobilized factor H to regulate complement activation [72, 73] . Another approach has been the use of factor H-binding peptides, which can specifically recruit factor H from the plasma of the host. Various peptides with high affinity for various domains of human factor H were created, and one of these peptides (5C6) recruited factor H without interfering with its regulatory function, since it bound to a region of this regulator that does not interact with the C3 convertase [74] . By immobilizing 5C6 onto materials, factor H can be specifically recruited from the host blood onto the surface, thereby mimicking the host surface and protecting the host cells from attack by complement [75, 76] . Moreover, it is also possible to co-immobilize 5C6 with apyrase, which is autoregulatory against thromboinflammation. This surface modification with 5C6 and apyrase can be applied to both substrates (artificial materials) and cells [62] .",15.096677626492086,3.898929867011831

Important variables that influence perpetuation differ in small (<1,000 individuals) and large (>10,000) populations: in small populations, two important variables are persistence in individuals, and turnover of the population, while in large populations important variables are transmissibility, generation time, and seasonality. In small populations, viruses such as poliovirus that cause acute infections cannot readily be perpetuated, in contrast to viruses such as hepatitis B virus, that cause persistent infections. However, small animal populations can turnover significantly each year, permitting the perpetuation of some viruses that cause acute infections. Large populations of humans are necessary for the perpetuation of acute viruses; for instance, measles required a population of 500,000 for perpetuation in the pre-measles vaccine era. Furthermore, if an acute virus, such as poliovirus, exhibits marked seasonality in large populations, then it may disappear during the seasonal trough, even in the presence of a large number of susceptible persons. Eradication is the converse of perpetuation and can be used as a definitive approach to the control of a viral disease, as in the instance of smallpox.

The early pioneers were convinced that the security of GF systems could be best achieved when rigid components were used that could withstand impact and be less vulnerable to breakage. Stainless-steel cylinder-shaped GF isolators bolted and gasketed together were the most commonly used system in the United States at the LOBUND Laboratory, the National Institutes of Health, and Walter Reed Army Institute for Research. In Sweden, at the Karolinska Institutet, Gustafsson (1948) developed rectangular rigid steel isolators with glass tops maximizing the visibility inside. These units could be totally introduced into a steam autoclave for sterilization. In both the Reyniers cylindrical tank and the Gustafsson isolator, neoprene sleeves and gloves were used for manipulation constituting a potential weakness, since they were subject to tear or puncture. Miyakawa (1968) in Japan operated remote mechanical arms and hands from outside a small sterile room similar to the equipment sometimes seen in radiation research laboratories. Even though there are very fine research reports from this period, the cost of equipment and its inefficient utilization of space limited the number of workers in the field. Also, the complexity of the fabrication and construction added further to discourage interested scientists. It was not until Trexler developed the low-cost, lightweight, flexible film isolator that GF research came within the budgetary and technical reach of the research community in general. In 1957, a standard flexible film 1.5 Â 0.6 Â 0.6 m isolator complete with filtration, transfer port, exhaust trap, and flexible sleeves and gloves bore a price of $300e$400 compared to $5000 for a typical stainless-steel tank-type isolator. Thus technological advances produced a system that has proved to be equally or more secure, light in weight to permit use in tiers, and made of clear plastic to allow complete visibility. An extension of the flexible film technology brought forth a lightweight, disposable, flexible film shipping unit (Trexler and Reynold, 1957) weighing 5e6 kg compared to earlier units weighing 70e80 kg and which required a battery-operated blower system. Thus both rearing and research units, plus shipping units, were readily obtainable to those interested in using and transporting GF and GN animals.",28.128851059991224,10.443413530907367

Others have reported detection of coronavirus genomic RNA on various surfaces in hospitals and dwellings. 6, 7 Taken together, these findings seem counterintuitive because enveloped viruses are more susceptible to environmental stresses, such as radiation, temperature, and relative humidity, than nonenveloped viruses, mostly because of the lipidic nature of their envelopes. 8 Our study of CoV-229E VR-740 survival indicates that the virus is not fully inactivated for at least 7 days after deposition on different environmental surfaces at ambient temperature (24°C) and relative humidity conditions (approximately 50%) typical of our university's classrooms. This is significant given that the minimum infective dose of respiratory viruses can be very low. 9 Given that the frequently touched surfaces in the classroom were cleaned every morning, isolation of CoV-229E on several days during the sampling period suggests frequent redeposition of the virus on those surfaces or an ineffective daily cleaning regimen. Of all the surfaces tested in the classroom, isolation of infectious CoV-229E from the doorknob is probably of greatest significance because it is always used, and the knob was thoroughly swabbed at each sampling. From a public health perspective, a better choice might be brass instead of stainless steel doorknobs because brass has been reported to be deleterious for CoV-229E; however, quick inactivation on brass may not occur for other viruses. 10 Alcohol ethoxylates, the principal component of the cleaning solution used on the surfaces of the classroom of this study, reduced genomic loads of common respiratory viruses on toys in day care nurseries. Although the effect on virus viability was not investigated in the later study, a decrease in genomic loads of adeno-, rhino-, and respiratory syncytial viruses was reported, but the load of coronavirus, the most prevalent virus group detected on toys, remained unchanged before and after the alcohol ethoxylate intervention. 11 Although a new COV 229E strain was confirmed by sequencing of 1 isolate, and it is tempting to infer 1 person was the source, it is possible that the same virus strain was circulating among the students and that the viruses we detected over many days emanated from various persons. A broader study might include linking the virus to the person(s) shedding the virus. Also, further study on the effects of commonly used cleaning and disinfecting solutions on CoV-229E viability are warranted. Finally, air sampling studies would be an important adjunct; in our study, an inhalation risk was also likely caused by aerosols containing CoV 229E.",24.16588699040757,10.537879005335583

Toxicity results from chronic accumulation in the liver from the ingestion of excess copper in relation to molybdenum or sulfate in the diet. In sheep, a copper-to-molybdenum ratio greater than 10:1 leads to the accumulation of excess copper. The most common sources of excess copper in sheep and goats are trace mineral mixtures and feeds formulated for cattle or horses. Clinical signs often are absent during the chronic accumulation phase. Onset of acute disease is related to the sudden release of copper from the liver in large amounts. Stress usually precipitates this acute phase. Acute release of copper and subsequent high blood copper concentrations cause an acute hemolytic crisis, resulting in anemia, hemoglobinuria, and acute renal failure. Existing hepatic disease (such as that caused by liver flukes) may predispose animals to this condition. Some breeds (e.g., Merino sheep) seem to be prone to copper absorption and storage problems, whereas others (e.g., pygmy goats) tend to be more resistant and prone to deficiency (see Chapter 2).",17.015068790933796,8.334242983229416

For copper nanoparticles embedded in an inert, Teflon (polytetrafluoroethylene)-like matrix, Cioffi et al. (2005b) demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity in vitro as a result of ion release. It is suggested that in such an experimental situation a bacterial growth medium facilitates the release of metallic ions, possibly as a consequence of a reaction with the nutrient media constituents. A greater release of copper ions into a liquid medium could well be due to the presence of an oxide layer on the copper nanoparticles and reaction with chloride ions in the medium. The copper-fluoropolymer (Cu-CFx) nano-composite films in this study were deposited by dual ion-beam sputtering, a technique to deposit different polymeric and inorganic materials in a very controlled manner. Analysis of the layers revealed that the inorganic Cu(II) nanoparticles were evenly dispersed in the branched fluoropolymer matrix. Through the use of electrochemical atomic absorption spectroscopy, copper release kinetics in solutions was measured. A correlation was shown between the chemical composition (copper loading) of the material surface, the concentration of copper ions released into the microbial culture broths, and the bioactivity of the Cu-CFx coating. The Cu-CFx layers, used as coatings, were shown to inhibit the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the bacterial species E. coli, S. aureus and Listeria spp. Such use of Cu-CFx coatings, which allow variable metal loading, demonstrate good stability upon storage and microbial inhibitory activity, is being explored in a variety of applied fields, including food chemistry and biomedicine.",19.74422529235282,7.139811757679328

These viruses account for considerable human morbidity and mortality worldwide. Increasing and substantial evidence of viral persistence in humans, which includes the isolation of RNA by RT-PCR and infectious virus by culture, continues to be reported. Viral persistence can also be established in vitro in various human, animal, arachnid, and insect cell lines in culture. Although some research has focused on the potential roles of defective virus particles, evasion of the immune response through the manipulation of autophagy and/or apoptosis, the precise mechanism of flavivirus persistence is still not well understood. We propose additional research for further understanding of how viral persistence is established in different systems. Avenues for additional studies include determining whether the multifunctional flavivirus protein NS5 has a role in viral persistence, the development of relevant animal models of viral persistence, and investigating the host responses that allow vector-borne flavivirus replication without detrimental effects on infected cells. Such studies might shed more light on the viral-host relationships and could be used to unravel the mechanisms for establishment of persistence.",13.786727589876858,5.790216862662625

Appropriate management consists of supportive therapy for the acute renal failure and anemia and attempts to lower liver copper stores. Fluid therapy for the acute renal failure (see Chapter 3) is of clinical benefit, and a blood transfusion may be needed if the PCV drops precipitously. Ammonium tetrathiomolybdate (1.7 mg/kg IV or 3.4 mg/kg SC on alternate days for three treatments) is the most economical agent for treatment in acute cases. In valuable animals, oral d-penicillamine (26 to 50 mg/kg twice daily or 52 mg/kg once daily for 6 days) increases urinary copper excretion. Trientine is used in human beings but has shown variable results in sheep. Treatment of the remainder of the flock should include the oral administration of ammonium molybdate (50 to 500 mg/head/day) and sodium thiosulfate (300 to 1000 mg/head/day) for 3 weeks. Stress should be minimized, so keepers and clinicians should delay routine maintenance procedures such as deworming and hoof trimming until after treatment. When applicable, spraying a combination of ammonium molybdate and sodium sufate onto harvested forages low or deficient in copper to approximate the required therapeutic amount will decrease the stress required in daily oral dosing of chemicals. Allowing free access to grazing of forages high in sulfur (greater than 0.5% sulfur), if available, for all surviving ambulatory animals also may help to minimize death losses in a flock or herd. Overzealous attempts to clear excessive hepatic copper stores may potentially lead to deficiency, excessively stress the animal, and can be costly, thus should be avoided. The offending source of copper should be eliminated. Caution should be taken in such cases to remove ionophores from the diet, because these agents may contribute to copper absorption. 19 Prevention Avoiding high dietary copper (more than 10 ppm), a high copper-to-molybdenum ratio (greater than 10:1) in the feed, use of copper-containing foot baths, and other sources of copper is crucial. Including supplemental molybdenum in the diet to lower the copper-tomolybdenum ratio to 6:1 to 8:1 is beneficial. Addition of up to 2 to 6 ppm of molybdenum may be required in many instances.",13.087988499618545,5.70925749971066

We disinfected surfaces contaminated with H1N1 influenza viruses using hydrogen peroxide (HP) vapor at concentrations below 100 ppm and triethylene glycol (TEG)-saturated air containing 2 ppm of TEG at 258C. MethodsInfluenza viruses in aqueous suspensions were deposited on stainless-steel coupons, allowed to dry at ambient conditions, and then exposed for up to 15 minutes to 10 to 90 ppm of HP vapor or TEG-saturated air. Virus assays were done on the solution used to wash the viruses from these coupons and from coupons treated similarly but without exposure to HP or TEG vapor. Results: After 2.5 minutes, exposure to 10-ppm HP vapor resulted in 99% inactivation. For air saturated with TEG at 25 to 298C, the disinfection rate was about 1.3 log 10 reductions per hour, about 16 times faster than the measured natural inactivation rate under ambient conditions. Conclusions: Vapor concentrations of 10 ppm HP or 2 ppm TEG can provide effective surface disinfection. At these low concentrations, the potential for damage to even the avionics of an airplane would be expected to be minimal. At a TEG vapor concentration of 2 ppm, there are essentially no health risks to people.",22.228388547814877,10.900453412503945

It does not include experimental variability arising from replication of the experiment at a different time under the same set of operating conditions. Based on 10 9 FFUs/mL for the influenza virus suspension in a single-use packet and 50% recovery of viruses from control slides, the theoretical limit of detection in terms of the number of log 10 reductions that could be detected by the aforementioned method was calculated to be 7.4. This calculation is based on the assumption that a single FFU detected from any of the 3 coupons exposed at a specific test condition corresponds to the limit of detection. Figure 1 shows the number of log 10 reductions based on eq (5) versus exposure time for experiments in which influenza viruses deposited on stainless steel coupons were exposed at approximately 258C and 58% to 65% RH to relatively low concentrations of HP vapor. In this figure, error bars correspond to 6 1 SD based on eq (6) . Even at a HP vapor concentration as low as 10 ppm, about a 2-log 10 reduction was observed after 2.5 minutes of exposure. But the number of log 10 reductions did not increase with increases in either exposure time or HP vapor concentration as much as would be predicted based on a linear relationship. If a HP vapor concentration of 10 ppm and an exposure time of 2.5 minutes were taken as the base, then increasing exposure time by a factor of 6 or increasing concentration by a factor of 9 added only an extra 1.6 log 10 and 1.3 log 10 reduction, respectively. For 15 minutes of exposure time, the highest measured disinfection rate was a 4.7 log 10 reduction at a HP vapor concentration of 90 ppm. An additional experiment, not shown in Figure 1 , in which influenza viruses were exposed at a HP vapor concentration of 57 ppm for 60 minutes resulted in a 5.6 log 10 reduction.

However, in this initial paper no separation results were presented. Typical chromatography columns in commercial non-microfabricated systems use packed particle supports, but confining particles such as derivatized silica beads to precise locations within microfluidic devices can be a challenge. 83 Other supports like high-aspect-ratio pillars 153 and monolithic columns have also been used in microfluidic devices. 114, 115 A reversedphase butylmethacrylate monolith was fabricated in COC microchips for high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of peptides and proteins ( Figure 18 ).

Because of their biocompatibility and mechanical properties, titanium and titanium-based alloys are one of the most popular materials for medical applications including bone and joint replacements, dental implants, and cardiovascular devices. Since titanium spontaneously generates a surface layer of TiO 2 when exposed to oxygen-containing environments (such as air or aqueous media), its biocompatibility is dominated by the interaction of cells, tissues, biological fluids, and the oxide layer instead of the metal itself [106] . This phenomenon has been widely recognized and it has motivated recent studies of the interaction of various proteins and TiO 2 [107, 108] . Among other proteins, BSA has been extensively studied. BSA is a globular protein with an isoelectric point (IEP) of 4.5-5.0, approximate molecular dimensions of 4 × 4 × 14 nm, and a molecular weight of 66.5 kDa [109] . Because BSA generally undergoes significant structural changes upon adsorption to solid surfaces, it has been considered to be a ""soft"" protein [10, 11] . Besides its abundance in physiological fluids (such as blood plasma) and physiological functions attributed to albumin (control of osmotic pressure, buffer, and transport), BSA has been also considered a model protein for various biomedically related studies [110] [111] [112] . For these reasons, the mechanisms that regulate the adsorption of albumin to nanostructured TiO 2 surfaces were selected for further analysis in this chapter.

For these experiments, the TiO 2 -coated substrates were prepared using dip-coating techniques [92] [93] [94] and characterized by ellipsometry and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The thickness of the deposited TiO 2 films was between 1.5 and 3.5 nm. The ellipsometric data were modeled by three uniaxial layers (Si, bulk; SiO 2 d = 2.5 ± 0.5 nm; and TiO 2 ) with the optical axis parallel to the silicon wafer substrate. As shown in Figures 2.6 and 2 .7 , the agreement between the data generated by the optical model, the experimental data, and the topography of the nanostructured TiO 2 thin films (determined by AFM) was good. As shown in Figures 2.8 and 2 .9 , both the adsorbed amount and the adsorption rate of BSA to nanostructured TiO 2 increased as a function of the protein concentration in the 0.001-0.1 mg/mL range.",22.185317497008,8.621846598237537

Thus there may be absolute primary deficiency, or conditioned secondary deficiency, brought about by reduced absorption from the gut, reduced availability in tissues, or enhanced excretion. The interactive roles in copper metabolism of soil and dietary molybdenum, sulfate, iron, and zinc are important. Molybdenum is a prime antagonist for copper and, in the presence of adequate sulfate, limits the capacity to absorb copper from the gut and the capacity to store absorbed copper in the liver. This antagonism is unique to ruminants and is provided by the formation in the rumen of thiomolybdates, a series of anions in which sulfur progressively substitutes for oxygen in the molybdate ion. Copper complexed to thiomolybdate forms insoluble complexes that are poorly absorbed; this is primarily an effect of maximally substituted tetrathiomolybdate; lesser substituted thiomolybdates may be absorbed and be responsible for reducing copper availability at the local tissue level.",15.284509002168656,7.531484332332898

Both the interior and exterior surfaces of many viruses have been shown to be amenable to chemical modifications. [88] [89] [90] Some common groups that can be functionalized include lysine, aspartic/glutamic acid, cysteine, and tyrosine residues, which lend themselves to standard bioconjugation reactions involving Nhydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester conjugation, carbodiimide activation, Michael addition, and azo coupling chemistries. Some alternatives to these natural amino acids include replacing methionine residues with homopropargyl glycine (HPG) or azidohomoalanine (AHA) residues to add alkyne or azide functionalities, respectively. 71 Another interesting method utilizes mutant tRNA synthetases to attach unnatural amino acids to amber suppressor tRNAs for incorporation of these amino acids at amber stop codon sites. 72, 91 Among the amino acids incorporated in this way are O-methyltyrosine, pazidophenylalanine, p-acetylphenylalanine, p-benzoylphenylalanine, 3-(2-naphthyl)alanine, and p-aminophenylalanine (pAF). p-azidophenylalanine and pAF are particularly noteworthy due to providing azide and amine groups, respectively, for selective coupling reactions. As can be noted, incorporation of azide and alkyne groups is an especially widespread strategy. These conjugation handles allow for copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC), an efficient and biocompatible procedure that has found great versatility. [92] [93] [94] [95] [96] Reaction without copper catalysis can also be achieved by utilizing cyclooctyne derivatives, which lower the activation barrier due to the ring strain. 97 Additional reaction handles that have been utilized include aldehydes and ketones for hydrazone or oxime condensation reactions. 88, [98] [99] [100] Selective formation of aldehydes or ketones is possible, where pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-mediated transamination specific for the N-terminus leads to in situ oxidation of the N-terminal amine. 101 The formed ketone or an aldehyde group can then be used to form stable oxime linkages with alkoxyamines.

MERS-CoV survival is inferior to that previously demonstrated by SARS-CoV (Chan et al., 2011) however for context, pathogenic bacteria can remain viable for 45 min in a coughed aerosol and can spread 4 m, thus MERS-CoV's ability to remain viable over long time periods gives it the capacity to thoroughly contaminate a room occupied by an infected and symptomatic patient (Knibbs et al., 2014) . Such findings expand our understanding of the risks associated with bioaerosols for transmission of respiratory viruses in many settings, including hospital waiting rooms, emergency departments, treatment rooms, open intensive care facilities and private patient rooms.

The nature of these persistent, restricted infections remains unclear. One possibility is that individual cells are infected for long periods of time, though most results could also be explained by a dynamic persistence in which infection of an individual cell has a given half-life and that with time viral material is eliminated, with or without cell loss. Infection of new cells could be initiated at a slow rate, possibly in some cases by spread between cells without formation of virus particles, as has been described for measles virus (Lawrence et al, 2000) . Whether there is gradual cell loss remains unclear, as careful measurements have not been done. The extent of neuronal loss in the brains of mice infected with scrapie was not appreciated until precise quantitation was done (Jeffrey et al, 1995) . So the extent of cell loss with time remains unclear as does the nature of persistence, which could be static, that is, fixed within individual cells, or dynamic, with movement between cells. In these restricted infections, replication at some level is blocked. This could be a permanent or a temporary block and it could vary between cell types or individual cells. A temporary block could result from inhibitory factors, for example interferons, and remain until these drop below an effective level. There is, for example, evidence of interferonactivated responses in measles virus-infected areas of SSPE brains (Schneider-Schaulies et al, 1999) . Alternatively, cellular factors could be required for productive replication, perhaps produced rarely in response to cell activation. A situation in which infection is generally restricted but occasionally productive could occur. Restricted infection could also result from infection of cells with specific virus genotypes that have lost the ability to undergo productive infection in specific cell types. The genotypes of JCV, measles, and MHV that persist in the brain are different to the original infecting viruses. It is generally not clear whether these genetic changes are required to establish persistence or are a consequence of persistence. The latter seems most likely.",10.935004384479898,6.266956477271211

For example, stronger protein attachment, such as gold-coated glass surface [37] or reactive surfaces with bifunctional cross-linkers [2] can retain the proteins firmly on the surface with covalent cross-linking, but may decrease their activity due to steric hindrance or disruption of proper folding; however, these surfaces will allow detection methods such as Surface Plasmon Resonance or mass spectrometry to study the dynamics of biochemical reactions on these proteins [21] . In addition, we found that amino-silane-coated glass slides provide the highest signal-to-noise ratio in kinase studies [25] .",12.528050412086237,5.186294286719616

The antibodies responsible for humoral immunity and lymphocytes responsible for cell-mediated immunity are predominantly in the bloodstream and tissues; they are typically not found on the mucosal surfaces. Therefore, although lymphocytes assist in preventing systemic invasion through the mucosal surface, they are often not effective at controlling infection on the mucosal surface. Even in the lungs and the mammary gland, where IgG and lymphocytes are found in relative abundance, they are not able to function as effectively in mucosal tissues. Adaptive immune protection on mucosal surfaces is caused in large part by sIgA, cytotoxic T cells, and gd T cells. The route of vaccine administration is important when attempting to induce mucosal immunity. To induce sIgA production at mucosal surfaces, it is best for the vaccine to enter the body via a mucosal surface. This is accomplished by administering the vaccine to mucosal surfaces by aerosolizing the vaccine so the animal inhales it (intranasal vaccination) or by feeding the vaccine to the animal (oral vaccination). Parenteral vaccines can generate mucosal responses that produce mucosal sIgA. 53 Work in our laboratory has demonstrated mucosal immunity following parenteral vaccination in the face of maternal immunity, which generated bovine respiratory syncytial virus-specific mucosal IgA that protected against bovine respiratory syncytial virus disease. 54 Intranasal vaccines have been used because of the high concentration of lymphoid tissue in the NALT, 42 the induction of a rapid interferon response, 55 the induction of immunity against bovine respiratory disease pathogens, 28 and the lack of interference from maternal antibodies. 56 Induction of the NALT also has implications for induction of other mucosal sites as a result of the common mucosal response (see Figs. 13 and  14) . 28, 42 The main portal of entry for oral vaccines is the lymphoid tissue in the NALT. Timing seems to be critical for immunization of GALT, like Peyers patches in the GIT. Administration of modified live virus vaccine within the first 24 hours after birth would be at risk of neutralization and inactivation by the colostral maternal antibody. Numerous studies have shown that rotavirus-coronavirus modified live virus vaccines studies fail to protect in the presence of maternal antibodies (Geoff Smith, personal communication, 2018). Once animals are 1 to 2 days of age or older, the harsh pH and proteolytic environment of GIT affect antigenicity of vaccines intended to induce GALT.",10.782836220714891,4.538097309538429

Accordingly, such an interpretation seems compatible with the present findings. Since TTV is non-cultivable, environmental longevity has been assessed only through DNA persistence. On surfaces where effective disinfection procedures have been applied (as confirmed by a very low bacterial load), detected TTV could have been inactivated, and its presence indicative only of previous contamination. Moreover, although the antibacterial action of the disinfectant used (1000e5000 ppm of chlorine) has been clearly established as per guidelines for hospital surfaces (5 log 10 reduction), no such data are available for its effect on viruses. This is the case for virion inactivation and degradation of nucleic acids, so that any possible effects on PCR reaction are unknown. 24 In the air, which is not routinely disinfected (as indicated by the mean bacterial counts), TTV could presumably remain viable and possibly lead to airborne transmission. Where the air is filtered, as in sterile rooms, the presence of TTV DNA could indicate that air filters fail to retain the virus. However, the actual significance of its presence cannot be clearly understood without an evaluation of virus viability. Some experimental data (not shown) on TTV DNA persistence on artificially contaminated surfaces following different disinfection procedures have shown that after 2 h treatment with 2.9 ppm chlorine, 64.6% of the initial genome copies were still present. Virus infectivity remained indeterminable because TTV cannot be cultured.

Offices with fewer HPIV1 positive surfaces may use disinfectants that degrade viral RNA (i.e., chlorine-or peroxide-based disinfectants) or may clean surfaces more frequently and thus removing the virus from the surface. In contrast an increase in surface contamination may also occur if the office is being cleaned with inefficient sanitizers or disinfectants, which can spread viruses and cross-contaminate clean surfaces (Barker et al. 2004) .

The initial adhesion of bacteria is dependent on the wettability of the substratum. NAC was shown to bind to stainless steel, increasing the wettability of the surface. Moreover, NAC decreased bacterial adhesion and even detached bacteria that were adhering to stainless steel surfaces. Growth of various bacteria, as monocultures or in a multispecies community, was inhibited at different concentrations of NAC. No detectable degradation of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) by NAC was found, showing that NAC reduced the production of EPS, in most bacteria tested, even at concentrations at which growth was not affected.

Flores et al. (2013) studied the ability of citrate-capped silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) to stop the formation of bacterial biofilms by S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. These are clinically important gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. They used two different approaches. The first approach involved the dispersal of AgNPs to study the bactericidal effect on planktonic bacteria, whereas the second approach was to adsorb AgNPs on a titanium substrate to test their bactericidal effect on sessile bacteria. Planktonic P. aeruginosa was found to be more susceptible to nanoparticles than was S. aureus, which can be attributed to their different cell wall structures. Similar results were obtained for the sessile species. The results also revealed that performance was improved by using titanium-based implants, even at very low concentrations. Hussein et al. (2013) produced chitosan (a biopolymer), by extracting the exoskeletons of crustaceans found in seafood waste. It was 85.2% deacetylated and had an average molecular weight of 109 kDa. Chitosan was derivatized, forming 2-N,N-diethylbenzene ammonium chloride N-oxoethyl chitosan, called compound I, and 12-ammonium chloride N-oxododecan chitosan, ecofriendly inhibitors of carbon steel corrosion in low-pH media. The results demonstrated that compound I was the more efficient corrosion inhibitor. Comparing the antibacterial activity of chitosan and its derivatives indicated that chitosan (compound II) was more effective than its derivatives against several bacteria: C. albicans, E. coli, E. faecalis, and S. aureus. Yuan et al. (2012) attempted to reduce biocorrosion by sulfate-reducing bacteria. This approach involved a combination of surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization and in situ chemical oxidative graft polymerization techniques. Stainless steel was tethered with a poly(4-vinylaniline)-polyaniline (PVAn-PANI) bilayer layer coating. This method involved three steps: in the first step, a trichlorosilane coupling agent was immobilized on the stainless steel surface, providing sulfonyl halide groups for the ATRP of PVAn; in the second step, PANI was grafted onto the PVAn in situ; in the third step, the PVAn-PANI bilayer reduced bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation on the stainless steel surface, as showed by electrochemical test results, confirming that their anticorrosion and antibacterial properties were suitable for severe environments. Hakkinen et al. (2004) has reported electrochemical microbial antifouling technology for the prevention of biofilm and inorganic deposits on stainless steel surfaces. This is based on polarization of the steel surface. A preventive current is passed from an electrode to the (metal) surface to be protected through an electrolyte, leading to oxidation and reduction reactions. These reactions temporarily change the pH of the metal surface. This creates conditions that prevent microbial attachment. Several UPM mills are running full-scale microbial antifouling technology systems successfully.",32.39900598969645,12.645214857819727

Biofilm removal by 25 ppm (effective substances 5-25 ppm) of oxidizing biocides (bromochloro-5,5-dimethylhydantoin, 2,2-dibromo-2-cyanoacetamide, peracetic acid) increased to 70% when combined with cathodically weighted pulsed polarization. Using a novel instrument that allows real-time detection of reactive oxygen species, these researchers showed that the polarization program is effective in antifouling generated reactive oxygen species in a pulsed manner on the steel surface. They suggested that the observed added value of oxidative biocides combined with polarization depended on reactive oxygen species.

Examples such as BVDV, human im-munodeficiency virus, herpes simplex virus or hepatitis B virus show that viruses can persist in host organisms for very long periods of time. However, the molecular basis of persistence is largely unknown and is additionally complicated by the fact that various mechanisms seem to operate in different cell virus systems (reviewed in Holland, 1990; Oldstone, 1991; Ahmed et al., 1996) . Persistently infected cell cultures represent a valuable tool to study the mechanisms of viral persistence and the molecular evolution of viruses and cells (de la Torre et al., 1985 (de la Torre et al., , 1988 . The latter aspect is especially interesting in the case of single-stranded RNA viruses which lack proofreading and postreplicative error correction mechanisms and are believed to have a high mutation rate (Lai, 1992; Domingo et al., 1996) .

The increased negative charge of the particle surfaces increases the electrostatic potential energy barrier and reduces contact with the surfaces because the bacteria are negatively charged. To be effective, the amount of dispersant must be sufficient to overpower any coagulants that may be present (e.g., aluminum sulfate, high-density cationic polymers). There are some problems with the use of dispersants. These products effectively mobilize solids but they can cause clogging in downstream and down-gradient locations; therefore, this potential must be considered when designing an appropriate application that will not lead to an uncontrolled accumulation of dispersed materials in a paper production system. Particularly cationic retention aids tend to be deactivated by dispersants. However, in some cases, dispersants have helped papermakers overcome specific deposit problems (Hubbe et al., 2006) . Under some circumstances, slime deposits may be responsible for up to 70% of all breakages, blockages, and pump failures in pulp and papers mills (Safade, 1988) .",13.336708309062555,7.0086645490257755

As previously explained, once an outbreak has occurred on a breeding farm, PEDV virus could persist easily when successive litters of pigs, after losing their lactogenic protection at weaning, become a susceptible target for infection. In fact, persistence for a virus such as PEDV would be almost as a ""natural"" feature similar to the endemic character observed with other porcine enzootic enteric viruses such as swine rotaviruses, swine enteroviruses and others. TGEV cannot serve as an example here because, in Europe, it has largely been eliminated from the swine population due to the emergence, in the early eighties, of the closely related porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV). PRCV is a TGEV deletion mutant which has acquired respiratory tropism and shows an epidemiological advantage of rapid aerogenic spreading while causing a protective immunity to TGEV.

In contrast, when the metal centers become divalent, such as in copper(II) or zinc(II), the triazole groups are additionally bound to the metal ions ( Fig. 7) to enable pentacoordination. Interconversion between the two coordination environments entails a notable angle change at both triazole rings, which is reminiscent of a wing-flapping movement similar to that of birds. The mechanistic scenario is different for both modes of actuation. When zinc(II) is added to [ [4] Cu 2 (9) (10) 2 ] 2+ , it has to displace the copper(I), which means that all four N ? copper(I) bonds have to break on the way to [ [5] Zn 2 (9)(10) 2 ] 4+ .

Some ingested copper is bound to the copper transport protein, metallothionein. This portion is lost in the feces. Unbound copper is absorbed from the intestine and enters the portal circulation, where it is bound to albumin and another copper transport protein, transcuprein. Copper is then transported to the liver. Within hepatocytes, copper is bound to cytosolic metallothionein and stored in lysosomes. Copper can then undergo two fates: it can be excreted in bile or bound to the copper transport protein ceruloplasmin for transport to peripheral tissues. Of these steps, the most important step that regulates copper homeostasis is biliary excretion. In dogs with abnormal copper storage, copper accumulates within the lysosomes of hepatocytes. While in the lysosomes, copper is innocuous. Once the lysosomal storage capacity is exhausted, copper breaks into the cytoplasm, where it is toxic to the hepatocytes. Excessive hepatic copper can alter hepatic membrane permeability and interfere with normal hepatocyte transport of proteins and triglycerides, and eventually these hepatocytes undergo cellular lysis and necrosis. This can result in massive release of copper from damaged hepatocytes, which when taken up in the circulation can lead to a hemolytic crisis.",15.89608550033822,7.7076829759940395

It resists the formation of trihalomethanes and is nonreactive with ammonia, thereby avoiding the formation of chloramines. Jeng and Woodworth (1990) investigated and determined the sporicidal efficacy of CD gas, the relationship between fumigant concentration and exposure time, and the influence of humidity. Recently, a systematic investigation involving quantitative experiments of laboratory-scale decontamination of building material surfaces (carpet, ceiling tile, cinder block, painted wallboard, unpainted wood, and painted I-beam steel) was initiated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) in collaboration with the US Army, Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (US EPA, 2008) . Another systematic investigation studied the log reduction in viable spore numbers by CD gas under the given technology operation parameters and environmental conditions, and with different types of building materials (Rogers et al., 2004) . Further, recent work by Rastogi et al. (2009; has confirmed that viable spores on indoor building surfaces can be significantly reduced using CD gas. They tested the method by measuring spore recoveries from five porous materials and one nonporous building material. CD gas as a disinfectant has been successfully applied to decontaminate isolators (Czarneski and Lorcheim, 2005) , hospitals (Luftman et al., 2006) , and buildings (Wood and Martin, 2009) , and is approved by the US National Sanitation Foundation International as a sterilant for the decontamination of biological safety cabinets. Although biosafety laboratories are areas in which decontamination using CD gas could be frequently applied, detailed information on the use and efficacy of such treatments applied to laboratory material surfaces is lacking. Therefore, the main objectives of this study were to determine the sporicidal efficacy of CD gas and the effect on sporicidal efficacy of humidification before decontamination. Stainless steel (SS), painted steel (PS), polyvinyl chlorid (PVC), polyurethane (PU), glass (GS), and cotton cloth (CC) were selected as the experimental materials, based on these materials commonly found in laboratory walls, floors, interior equipment, table-boards, glassware, and cloth surfaces. Bacillus subtilis var. niger spores were chosen as the surrogate spores in this paper as Sagripanti et al.

The deposited particles are calculated by Eq. (9). The deposition particle number increases slowly from q ¼ 0 to 60 and obviously from q ¼ 60 e90 . When particle diameter d p increase from 3 mm to 7 mm, the particle number at the bend entrance decreases considerably, especially for molybdenum surfaces. With much larger particles in the experimental parameters, this decreased degree would be much higher, especially for large capture velocity surfaces. Take d p ¼ 7 mm for example, the deposited particles in bends are 1.7 times on molybdenum surfaces to those on copper surfaces. Fig. 6 summarizes previous experimental data and predicted particle deposition velocities against particle relaxation time in 90 [11, 12, 16] in 90 bends were collected in the figure. The experimental data from Liu & Agarwal [34] was also presented to compare the deposition velocities in bends with those in straight ducts. It can be seen that predicted deposition velocities in bends are much larger than those in straight ducts by one or two orders of magnitude. Sippola and Nazaroff [16] also drew a similar conclusion when comparing their experimental data in bends with those in their straight ducts. Among the three experiments in bends, result data also change by about one order of magnitude due to different experimental conditions. Simulated particle deposition velocities from s þ p ¼ 1.2 to 32.9 fall within the experimental data [11, 12, 16] . The surface effect on particle deposition velocity can be clearly seen from Fig. 7 . The deposition velocity with copper surface is the lowest. This observation can also be seen in Fig. 5 where deposited particle numbers with different surfaces are presented. The reason of a low deposition velocity with copper surface could be due to the low capture velocity near such surface. Between particle relaxation time s þ p ¼ 1:2 and 6:4, the particle deposition velocity with molybdenum surface is 0.7e1.2 times larger than that of a copper surface. Given more experimental data about particle collision behavior onto different surfaces with a wide particle diameter range, more deposition velocities could be predicted following the proposed method in this work.

These findings are consistent with previous studies of coronavirus disinfection, but this study provides more precise estimates of inactivation on surfaces than have been previously observed with other human coronaviruses, such as 229E. Some previous studies of chemical disinfection of 229E have been limited by cytotoxicity problems that limited the ability to measure infectious virus reduction. 25 Sattar et al 26 found that 70% ethanol reduced human coronavirus 229E dried onto a stainless steel surface by .99.9%. This study shows that the actual reduction is slightly greater than 3-log 10 (3.9 for TGEV and 3.19 for MHV).

Gold is usually used as the electrode material. When an alternating electric field is applied across the quartz crystal between the upper and lower electrodes, a mechanical oscillation of the characteristic frequency (f) is generated in the crystal. This resonant frequency shifts as a function of the additional bound material occurring at the upper surface. For adapting this system to molecular recognition, the metal surface is specifically biofunctionalised with a selective, passivating layer on which the analyte-specific receptor is immobilized. Appropriate flow channels with monitored microfluidics allow controlled introduction of the analyte. Nowadays, commercial QCM integrate user-friendly software for characterising the biomolecular interactions at the surface. A large variety of surface coatings have been proposed, allowing several optimized chemical treatments and biomolecule as the receptor grafting depending on the aimed interactions. Apart from the standard gold material, which is the most commonly used sensor surface because Au is chemically inert and easy to modify in different ways, we can find in product catalogues (Q Sense) electrode materials such as silicon dioxide whose main advantage is the ability to form lipid bilayers which act as a platform for further immobilisation of molecules; stainless steel surfaces used for studies of biofilm formation; titanium-coated surfaces mainly used for implant research; metals and oxides (aluminium trioxide, platinum, tantalum, tantalum nitride, tungsten, copper, chromium, iridium, iron, silicon carbide, iron carbide, silver and cobalt); and more recently commercially available polymers (polysterene, PMMA) deposited by spin coating.",32.967241747156336,16.464826649468584

In suspension, HCoV-229E gradually lost its infectivity completely while SARS-CoV retained its infectivity for up to 9 days; in the dried state, persistence times were 24 h versus 6 days. Thermal inactivation at 56 • C was highly effective in the absence of protein. Duan et al.

Irradiation of UV for 60 min on the virus in culture medium resulted in the destruction of viral infectivity at an undetectable level. One article in China's Science and Technology Daily on June 4, 2003 states that SARS-CoV in feces or urine could be inactivated within a few minutes by 500-1000 mg/L of chlorine or peracetic acid, while the virus could also be killed with ultraviolet radiation or heating for 30 min (Liu, 2003) . Tsang (2003) reported that SARS-CoV could be inactivated in 75% alcohol, 2% hydroxybenzene solution, 500 mg/L sodium hyperchlorine or detergents for 5 min, which suggests that the virus is sensitive to all sorts of disinfectants. Li J et al. (2003) reported that SARS-CoV could also be inactivated more than 5 log 10 units within 60 s in 80% solution of a compound disinfectant comprising 1700-1900 mg/L of chlorhexidine acetate and 1000 mg/Lof nano-zinc oxide.",20.185162877118564,8.05770612684547

In a simple medium where only one protein is present, the entropic factor (Norde 1985; Norde et al. 1986 ) seems to be the driving force for protein adsorption. Entropy is affected by the dehydration of both the surface and the protein, rearrangement of the protein structure and rearrangement of charged groups. The dehydration effect on hydrophobic surfaces can be viewed as the disruption of an ordered ice-like layer of water at the surface of the materials by the incoming protein. This disruption is due to surface-protein hydrophobic interactions that are stronger than the surface-water and protein-water interactions. This leads to an increase in entropy. On hydrophilic surfaces, the driving force is the change in protein structure (Norde et al. 1986 ).",16.71399312379215,7.262465938993184

Involving over 30 participating laboratories in seven countries, pin on disc test were conduced using both alumina and bearing steel (AISI type 52100). Combinations involved the four conditions of ball/disc as follows: steel/steel, ceramic/steel, steel/ceramic, and ceramic/ceramic using one set of sliding conditions (10 N, 0.1 m/s, 10 mm ball diameter, 1 km sliding distance, ambient temperature). From 3 to 5 tests were done for each set of materials and conditions in each laboratory. Wear scar width on the disc did not prove a satisfactory measure for all combinations, but ball scar size data can be compared. For this discussion, a subset of results for steel/steel (known as VAMAS Kit 1) and steel/ceramic (known as VAMAS Kit 3) are presented in Table 4 . Table 5 summarizes the repeatability and reproducibility of the wear data. As in Case Study 3 for erosion data, the within laboratory variation for wear was less than the between laboratory results. One lesson learned here is that for these materials and conditions, measuring the system wear rate by the slope of the displacement versus sliding distance curve has much higher test-to-test variability than simply measuring wear scar diameter after the test. Like the example for cavitation provided in Case Study 1, the choice of sliding wear measurement metric affected the repeatability of the results.",22.861770909682214,9.481651421963528

Repeatability and reproducibility (R/R) reflect the variability from test-to-test in a laboratory and from laboratory-tolaboratory respectively. Five case studies were used to illustrate the insights to be gained and the uses for R/R data. One can summarize the lessons learned from such studies are as follows: 1) Cavitation. In cavitation erosion testing of three metals using ASTM G32, the wear ranking and the test-to-test variability depended on the choice of wear metric used. Maximum erosion rate, for example, ranked materials in a different order of merit than did incubation period, but the incubation period had the highest percent coefficient of variation (CoV) than did other methods of measurement. The lesson here is that metrics used to measure wear can affect the ranking and repeatability of the results. 2) Three-body abrasion. When comparing different procedures for dry sand/rubber wheel abrasion testing of stainless steel using three different procedures in ASTM G65, there was similar CoV despite the fact that the cumulative wear volume differed by a factor of four between the three procedures. One lesson from this is that magnitude of wear produced by different test procedures did not significantly affect the repeatability of the data. Making tests more severe to help discriminate between material behavior can be done without compromising the data repeatability. 3) Solid particle erosion. In solid particle erosion tests (ASTM G76) of two different steels, repeatability was worse when the particle velocity used in testing was increased. For a mild steel (AISI 1020), increasing velocity by a factor of about 2.3 times, increased the wear rate by a factor of about 10 times; however, it only worsened the repeatability of the results by a little more than 2 times. Therefore, increasing test severity does not proportionately decrease repeatability. 4) Dry sliding wearblock-on-ring. When computing wear volume for four duplicate tests of a bronze block on a rotating steel ring based on (i) weight loss, (ii) wear depth, or (iii) scar width, weight loss consistently underestimated the wear volume compared with other methods. The precision was similar for weight loss and scar depth, but scar width had one anomalously high datum that prevented it from otherwise displaying quite good precision and comparing well with volume computed using scar depths. 5) Dry sliding wearpin-on-disc. Measuring cumulative wear continuously by displacement sensors led to much higher variability than simply measuring the pin wear scar after testing. Repeatability in a large number of international pin-on-disc tests using steel/steel and steel/ceramic couples was þ/ À 14% but the reproducibility was as high as þ /À 38%. Therefore, more repetition is needed for dry pin on disc tests to confidently measure the wear of materials. Furthermore, as pointed out in a comprehensive study of multiple pin-on-disc tests, if enough wear rate measurements are made, the wear rates tend to fit a log-normal distribution in their frequency of occurrence. 6) Lubricated wear as a measure of fuel lubricity. The ball-on-cylinder lubricity evaluation (ASTM D5001) test was introduced in the 1960s to measure lubricity of aviation fuels. Concerns of R/R were addressed over years of development and applied to conduct worldwide surveys of fuel lubricity. Effect of test chamber humidity and the preparation of specimens to an optimum roughness helped improve test consistency. Results produced international aviation fuel quality standards.",22.671809150492333,9.078960092664076

The nicotinic acid Noxide leads to dinuclear repeated units of copper(II) to form the 1D chains with relatively larger copper(II) inter-metal separations. Interactions within the paddlewheel moieties of 1-3 were found to be strongly antiferromagnetic, with values typical of copper(II) carboxylates. However, inter-dinuclear interactions between these moieties were too weak to be detected, or non-existent. In the case of 5, in which the coordination of the bridging ligand to the adjacent copper(II) ions is both axial and equatorial, the transmitted interaction is very weakly antiferromagnetic.",17.851216756703806,7.19104586163245

The majority of viruses remain viable for a longer period on non-porous materials (Tiwari et al ., 2006 ; Boone and Gerba, 2007 ; Lamhoujeb et al ., 2008 ) ; however, there are also several exceptions. Astroviruses are able to remain infectious at 4 ° C (RH 90 ± 5%) for 60 days when adsorbed on non-porous and for 90 days on porous surfaces; poliovirus and adenovirus persist also longer on porous (paper and cotton towel) than on non-porous material (aluminium, china, glazed tile, latex and polystyrene). Obviously, the physical properties of the surface may inhibit the recovery of viral particles from surfaces. Viruses can be trapped within the matrix, especially within the porous surface, and thus the results of virus persistence could be misinterpreted. Furthermore, several studies indicate virucidal activity of surfaces such as aluminium or copper.

However, unlike UV and vapor phase oxygen radicals (H 2 O 2 ) that distribute their antimicrobial activity through the atmosphere, this technology requires the microbe come in contact or be in close proximity with the material in order to facilitate its antimicrobial activity. In contrast to UV and HVP, once placed, this no-touch system simply requires that the fugitive microbe come in contact with the surface in order to effect disinfection. Thus, the inactivation or killing of the microbe does not require any user intervention once deployed. One such example of this type of no-touch technology is solid antimicrobial copper. The resident microbial burden associated with the built environment is continuously reduced through the strategic placement of solid copper surfaces onto critical high touch surfaces within the patient care setting [75] . Copper has been used by humans for millennia, first as tools and then as a measure to fight the spread of infectious agents. Metallic copper intrinsically displays a strong antibacterial activity in aquatic systems [2, 38] as well as on dry surfaces [32, 54, 96, 102, 104] . In 2008 the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) registered five families of copper-containing alloys as antimicrobial, establishing that products manufactured from one of these registered alloys can make public health claims wherein the label indication states that the alloys kill greater than 99.9 % of bacteria within 2 h of exposure [87] . It is anticipated that the solid antimicrobial copper surfaces will remain microbiocidal for the life of the product (>10 years). A variety of controlled studies have looked at the antimicrobial activity of copper surfaces against specific human pathogens [54, 63, 92, 98, 102, 104, 105] . In fact solid copper surfaces have been found to be microbicidal to well over 30 bacteria, fungi and viruses. Of the microbes listed in Table 4 .1, five were evaluated in the studies used to grant the public health registration by the United States EPA. The public health claims granted illustrate the robust nature of the antimicrobial activity. Alloys granted registration contain greater than 60 % metallic copper and were found to continuously kill greater than 99.9 % of Gram-negative and Grampositive bacteria within 2 h of exposure even after repeated contamination illustrating how solid copper surfaces will inhibit the buildup of microorganisms between routine cleaning and sanitizing steps.",21.194304709492876,10.621087147494716

For example, the survival of influenza dried on to copper surfaces was considerably shorter than on stainless steel. 40 Several studies have evaluated the capacity for SARS-CoV (and the surrogate TGEV), and influenza virus to survive on materials widely used as personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gowns, gloves, and respirators. 29, 37, 43 For example, TGEV survived on isolation gowns, nitrile and latex gloves, N95 respirators, and scrubs with a <10 2 reduction for >4 h, and was detected on some items after 24 h. 43 One study showed that H1N1 influenza virus dried on to various materials could be transferred to the hands of volunteers for at least 24 h following inoculation on some surfaces, with clear implications for the acquisition of viable viruses on the hands of healthcare personnel during the removal of PPE. 42 A more recent study identified viable pandemic H1N1 influenza after six days on coupons made from N95 respirators. 18 The suspending medium used to dry the viruses on to surfaces is another important factor influencing survival times. 18, 28, 39, 46 For example, adding mucus increased the survival time of influenza dried on bank notes from hours to up to 17 days. 39 A related variable is the mode of deposition of the viruses. Most studies dried a small volume of a known concentration of virus in a cell culture medium. However, several studies have evaluated the use of deposited virus from clinical specimens, which may be more representative of the clinical scenario and tends to result in shorter survival times. 32, 33, 39 In all studies that tested varying temperature and RH, lower temperature and RH favoured the survival of both coronaviruses and influenza. 16e18, 26, 35, 36, 38 Different methods have been applied to detect virus e most often cell culture assays but also RNA detection using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or indirect methods such as fluorescence or haemagglutinin assays. 27, 33, 34, 37, 40 Intact viral RNA appears to remain detectable on surfaces for longer than viruses that retain the ability to infect cells. 32, 33, 42 Since PCR assays only detect a small portion of RNA they cannot be used to replace culture-based methods in determining viability. Experimental factors that have been shown to influence virus viability in vitro are likely to have important implications for virus survival on hospital surfaces. For example, the titre and volume of virus applied to surfaces will be influenced by the type and volume of respiratory secretion, as will the suspending medium. The temperature and RH of the hospital environment is likely to be controlled to comfortable levels, meaning that some of the extremes of temperature and relative humidity tested in vitro may not be so relevant in the field.",23.793527053818725,10.002729158062703

Consequently, items where antimicrobial copper alloys might have been easily incorporated, e.g. grab bars, sinks, faucets, paper dispensers, shelves and towel racks were not present. The further evaluation of antimicrobial copper surfaces is warranted beyond the medical ICU to include, but not be limited to, the effect of inherently antimicrobial materials in Fig. 4 .4 EPA registered antimicrobial cooper alloys used in the fabrication or surfacing of high touch items. Items were fabricated from a variety of EPA registered antimicrobial copper alloys as listed. The criterion used to select an alloy was reflective of the ability of the antimicrobial alloy to be readily fabricated into that particular component and withstand the rigors of healthcare general wards where patients have greater interaction with other objects in the built environment. Similarly, investigations should also be conducted in emergency and recovery rooms, in hospital rehabilitation units, pediatric and neonatal units, dialysis centers, burn units, transplant units and cancer centers with immunecompromised patients. At issue is the central theme that antimicrobial copper surfaces continuously and passively limit the concentration of bacteria within the built environment. Salgado and colleagues were able to demonstrate that infections were correlated with burden. Thus, other healthcare environments that may arguably receive less day-to-day hygienic oversight than hospital patient rooms, such as visiting area, long-term care facilities, long-term rehab centers, outpatient clinics and elder care facilities should also be investigated as they too may directly benefit from the antimicrobial activity of copper.",21.284671580808627,9.828295565253539

In other words, the successful example in large-scale culture Lingzhi by LSF is extraordinary. In the previous review articles, the researchers greatly summarized the published data on submerged fermentation with Lingzhi (Wagner et al. 2003; Sanodiya et al. 2009 ). In this review article, only one report of a large-scale fermentation was described in which Ganoderma tsugae was cultivated in tanks with a volume of 20 m 3 . All other reported studies of LSF with Lingzhi were done only in volumes of 10 L or less. By estimating results generally, half the studies were undertaken in Erlenmeyer flasks and others were in fermentors. However, the best yields reported to date are 22.1 g/L for biomass, 1.71 g/ L for EPS, 2.49 g/L for intercellular polysaccharides (IPS), and 582 mg/L for GA. In recent years, Chinese scientists have reported that they produced G. lucidum 730 mycelia in a 500-L automatic stainless steel fermentor. The results showed that after a fermentation time of 70 h, there was no obvious germination and lock-like concentration on the mycelia wall. There was a little mycelium dissolved with no other bacteria. The consistence of G. lucidum clump is about 30%. EPS and IPS is 3.5 g/L and 4.8 g/L, respectively (Wei et al. 2007a, b) . Other reported studies of fermentation with G. lucidum were carried out in volumes of 10 m 3 with the fermentation liquid 7.5 m 3 , the average production cycle 150 h, and pH reduced from 6.5 to 3.5.

CHURCH 500-1000 cells, or a colony diameter of 5-7 mm, the colonies are picked out using a glass or stainless steel cylinder. These picked colonies are diluted with fresh HAT medium and replated at very low cell density (1-10 cells per dish). This step allows individual clones to grow up from one cell, thus achieving hybrid colonies having a homogeneous chromosome complement. The necessity of the cloning procedure resides in the unexplained phenomenon (for review, see Handmaker, 1973) of selective human chromosome loss in rodent-human hybrids, first observed by Weiss and Green (1967) . This phenomenon is also the cornerstone of human gene mapping. Since this preferential loss of human chromosomes in rodent-human hybrids appears to be random (except for the chromosome retained due to the selection system used), we can isolate cloned hybrid lines having different combinations of human chromosomes against the intact mouse genetic background. The key step in this process is to obtain essentially all the combinations and permutations of human chromosomes in homogeneous clonal hybrid lines. Thus, by examining each line for the presence of particular human chromosomes and gene products, such as human collagen production, the gene products can be associated with specific human chromosomes. Once these lines are isolated, their human chromosome complement remains relatively constant. However, over a long period of time in continuous culture, or if the cells are frozen in liquid nitrogen and rethawed, the human chromosome complement of each hybrid can change, which involves further chromosome elimination. This fact results in the need for constant recloning and monitoring in order to maintain confidence in the genotype of the sep.arate hybrids.",17.464250549587593,8.066422510861898

A reasonable estimate of copper burden can be made from stained sections; however, biochemical determination of copper is more reliable and can be useful to follow the effectiveness of copper chelation therapy. Care should be taken when collecting liver for copper levels, as once the normal lobular architecture is lost because of injury and regenerative nodule formation, copper distribution within the liver becomes heterogeneous. Hepatocytes in regenerative nodules often have relatively low levels of copper, possibly as an adaptation that facilitates their ability to proliferate and form nodules, or as a function of inadequate time for significant copper accumulation in the hepatocytes forming nodules. The intervening areas of parenchymal collapse may contain an abundance of copper.

First, excessive copper intake may occur as a result of contamination of water (naturally occurring or through the use of copper piping or fixtures), pasture or prepared feed; the latter is difficult to avoid when feed mills are preparing rations for different species and is probably partly responsible for the observation that housed sheep are more prone to copper poisoning than animals at pasture. Second, increased copper accumulation occurs as a result of increased availability of dietary copper; this happens when dietary levels of molybdenum are unusually low. Molybdenum, in the presence of sufficient sulfate, forms insoluble complexes with copper in the gut and liver, making the copper biologically inert. Subterranean clover growing on calcareous soils in southern Australia may be relatively deficient in molybdenum, and in these areas, British breeds of sheep are known to be more susceptible than Merinos to chronic copper poisoning. Other hepatotoxins constitute the third environmental factor that predisposes sheep to outbreaks of chronic copper poisoning.

Viruses are obligate parasites; therefore, the level of viral infectivity on a fomite can only decrease over time (5, 69) . Several studies have demonstrated that viruses can remain infective on surfaces for different time periods (1, 2, 9, 13, 33, 48, 64, 68) . The length of time a virus remains viable depends on a number of complex variables (Fig. 2 ). In general, UV exposure and pH have minimal effects on viral survival in indoor environments. Viral survival may increase or decrease with the number of microbes present on a surface. Increasing amounts of microbes can protect viruses from desiccation and disinfection, but deleterious effects may also result from microbial proteases and fungal enzymes (67, 69) . Typically, viral presence on fomites may decrease with surface cleanliness and increase with surface usage (66) . However, some cleaning products or disinfectants are ineffective against viruses and can result in viral spread or cross-contamination of surfaces (8) . Easily measured and predictable factors that influence viral survival on surfaces include fomite properties, initial viral titer, virus strain, temperature, humidity, and suspending medium (66, 69) .",18.49404309135743,6.191140823361514

People who contract influenza are most infectious between the second and third days after infection, and infectivity lasts for around 10 days [27] . Children are much more infectious than adults, and shed virus from just before they develop symptoms until 2 weeks after infection [27, 29] . For influenza control it is very important to investigate viral shedding and resistant viruses [29] . According to Mitamura and colleagues [29] , viral loads are decreased after the start of antiviral agents, but resistant viruses are detected in some patients. Influenza can be spread by direct transmission when an infected person sneezes mucus into the eyes, nose, or mouth of another person; through people inhaling the aerosols produced by infected people with coughing, sneezing, and spitting; and through hand-to-mouth transmission from contaminated surfaces or direct personal contact [30, 31] . The relative importance of airborne, droplet, and contact transmission of influenza A virus and the efficiency of control measures depends on the inactivation of viruses in different environmental media. Weber and colleagues [31] systematically reviewed information on the environmental inactivation of influenza A viruses and modes of transmission. The airborne route is a potentially important transmission pathway for influenza in indoor environments. The importance of droplet transmission has to be reassessed. Contact transmission can be limited by fast inactivation of influenza virus on hands, and is more dependent on behavioral parameters than airborne transmission. However, the potentially large inocula deposited in the environment through sneezing and the protective effect of nasal mucus on virus survival could make contact transmission a key transmission mode. In the airborne route, it has been demonstrated that the inhalation of just one inhalable droplet (0.5-5 lm in diameter) might be enough to cause an infection [31] . Although a single sneeze releases up to 40,000 droplets [32] , most of these droplets are large and will quickly settle out of the air [31] . The influenza virus can also be transmitted by contaminated surfaces. Successful control of a viral disease requires knowledge of the different vectors that could promote its transmission among hosts. Thomas and colleagues [33] assessed the survival of human influenza viruses on banknotes, given that billions of these notes are exchanged daily worldwide. Banknotes were experimentally contaminated with representative influenza virus subtypes at various concentrations, and survival was tested after different time periods. Influenza A viruses tested by cell culture survived up to 3 days when they were inoculated at high concentrations. The same inoculum in the presence of respiratory mucus showed a striking increase in survival time (up to 17 days). B/Hong Kong/335/2001 virus was still infectious after 1 day when it was mixed with respiratory mucus. When nasopharyngeal secretions of naturally infected children were used, influenza virus survived for at least 48 h in one-third of the cases. The investigators concluded that unexpected stability of influenza virus in this nonbiological environment suggests that unusual environmental contamination should be considered in the setting of pandemic preparedness [33] . Bean and colleagues investigated the transmission of influenza viruses via hands and environmental surfaces; the survival of laboratory-grown influenza A and influenza B viruses on various surfaces was studied. Both influenza A and B viruses survived for 24 to 48 hours on hard, nonporous surfaces such as stainless steel and plastic, but survived for less than 8 to 12 hours on cloth, paper, and tissues. Measurable quantities of influenza A virus were transferred from stainless steel surfaces to hands for 24 hours and from tissues to hands for up to 15 minutes. Virus survived on hands for up to 5 minutes after transfer from the environmental surfaces. Their observations suggest that the transmission of virus from donors who are shedding large amounts could occur for 2 to 8 hours via stainless steel surfaces and for a few minutes via paper tissues. The investigators concluded that the transmission of influenza virus via fomites may be possible under conditions of heavy environmental contamination [34] . However, if the virus is present in mucus, the virus can survive for longer periods [31] .",33.74934152304427,15.77574067154282

Ottway and Hawkins (2003) studied 72 cats living long-term (over one month) in shelters. Thirty-six were housed communally with non-familiar conspecifics and 36 in discrete units, either singly or with another one or two previously familiar conspecifics. The mean CSS was higher in communal than in discrete-unit housing, though very high stress scores (more than 5 out of 7) were not recorded in cats housed under either condition. Cats housed communally spent more time hidden, while cats in discrete housing were more likely to play and spent more time resting or sleeping in contact with another cat. They concluded that communal housing may be undesirable in a shelter situation, because of the inappropriate social grouping of unrelated adult cats and inherent instability of the group. Durman (1991) studied the behaviour of cats housed communally in small groups (between four and seven cats) in rooms in a shelter. Newly introduced cats were aggressive towards others, and showed behaviours indicative of high levels of stress (such as vocalizing and attempting to escape). These behaviours had largely disappeared after four days while other behavioural measures (such as sitting underneath a shelf, exploring the room and sitting alertly) changed more slowly, but all had reached equilibrium after two weeks. Some cats, who had been at the shelter for more than a few months, had access to large outdoor pens. The most recently-introduced cats to the group were the most vigilant and aggressive, while those present in the shelter for more than one year were more likely to rest in contact with another cat, to approach other cats, and to initiate rubbing and mutual grooming. While Smith et al. (1994) did not find behaviour patterns indicative of high stress levels in a group of unrelated cats in a shelter, these cats were part of a stable group living together longterm and there was not a constant influx of new cats. Gourkow (2001) examined the effects of four different housing conditions, or treatments, on the behaviour and stress levels of cats in a shelter, and on the outcome for these cats (whether they were adopted, became ill or were euthanised). The first treatment, T1, consisted of a small stainless-steel cage containing food and water bowls, a litter tray and a folded towel as bedding. The second treatment, T2, was the same cage enriched with a wooden shelf and hiding area underneath it. In these first two treatments cats were housed singly. The third treatment, T3, was a walkin cage converted from a dog kennel, where cats were housed in groups of eight. The cage had ten shelves, five hiding areas, bedding and a small chair, as well as food and water bowls and litter trays. The fourth treatment, T4, was the same as T3 except that it contained more furniture items, such as a plastic cat playhouse, toys and a scratching post. Cats in T1 were handled by a number of caretakers, each of whom handled the cat in their own way, whereas cats in the other treatments were handled by only one or two people and in a more consistent manner.",15.41937262305798,5.6083914177737

There have been many descriptions that viruses replicating either in cell culture or in vivo, when given the opportunity, increase their replicative fitness [21, 59, 60]. Fitness increase is the expected response when a virus maintains replicative competence in a new environment, or when it escapes from natural (neutralizing antibodies or cytotoxic T cells) or artificial (antiviral drug) selective pressures (reviewed in different chapters of [12, 13, 16]). In vivo an “arms race” is established between the virus and the host: the virus increases its fitness but it must overcome the multiple physiological responses intended to limit virus replication and to clear the virus from the organism. Successful evasion contributes to viral persistence, as documented with different viral pathogens [6, 8, 13, 15, 49] (Tab. I).",12.579659827560032,7.268585911197906

Independent of breeds groupings and inflammatory activity, mean hepatic copper concentrations in the recent time period were 225 ppm greater than those in the historical time period (P < 0.05). This effect was predominantly due an increase of 386 ppm over time in predisposed breeds (P < 0.001). The mean hepatic copper concentration of 338 ppm in non‐predisposed breeds in recent years was greater than the mean hepatic copper concentration of 271 ppm in non‐predisposed breeds in the historical period, but this trend did not reach significance (P = 0.08). In the recent period, the mean hepatic copper concentration of 519 ppm in predisposed breeds with non‐inflammatory liver histology was greater than the mean hepatic copper concentration of 297 ppm in non‐predisposed breeds with non‐inflammatory liver histology (P < 0.001). This difference was not observed in the historical time period. In both periods, dogs with hepatitis had higher hepatic copper concentrations than those without hepatitis, but this difference was magnified in recent years. In the aggregate, these findings confirm that hepatic copper concentrations have changed over time. The etiology of these changes is unknown, but suggestive of changes in environmental copper exposure. Detailed investigations of potential sources of copper exposure, namely drinking water and diet, are needed to further elucidate a potential environmental etiology. Additional investigations also are needed to determine if these changes are important for all breeds of dog.",13.556350194204423,6.933219944413503

The Base Case model indicates potential targets to reduce the CAPEX, as well as the COGS in the PMP facility. In terms of total equipment cost, a significant portion of the equipment costs (39%) is associated with the lighting, racking, and hydroponic plant growth systems. However, these systems require very little maintenance compared to standard stainless steel bioreactors while providing the same long-term value. In particular, the complexity of cell culture bioreactors and associated process control systems requires a higher level of educated and experienced personnel for operation, troubleshooting, and maintenance. Thus, these capital investments in indoor hydroponic cultivation may result in savings in terms of labor and maintenance costs, and, compared with mammalian cell culture facilities, may expand opportunities for building biomanufacturing facilities in countries with limited infrastructure in biomanufacturing and cGMP operations. Furthermore, the design of the upstream portion of the facility uses rapidly developing technologies such as LED lighting, vertical farming, and hydroponics, all of which are expected to be reduced in cost or allow improved biomass densities for the same price, as new technologies are deployed. It is important to state that within SuperPro Designer® it is difficult to “value engineer” innovative facilities and processes that do not have extensive databases.

Likewise, a sensitivity analysis confirmed that the inclusion of the 0 h experimental data did not alter model 3. Statistical analyses confirmed that the persistence of infective virus from virus-fed fly pools decreased as a function of virus concentration, incubation period postfeeding, and temperature (Table 2). The coefficients for T and I cannot be regarded on their own, because of the significant T:I interaction effect (Table 2). Thus, for a temperature of 15°C, the effect of incubation period is given by the slope βI + 15βT:I, which Table 2 estimates as 0.206 −15·0.0165 = −0.0415. Obviously, the slope is lower for higher temperatures. Similarly, the effect of temperature at an incubation period of 6 h is βT + 6βT:I, which is estimated as 0.0328 − 6·0.0165 = −0.0662. In the same way, the coefficients for S and C must be combined with the corresponding interaction coefficient, to represent the effects of strain and virus concentration, respectively. As examples, the estimated persistence of virus-positive fly pools for each employed AIV subtype fed with a virus concentration of 107.3 ELD50/ml are shown in Fig. 1.

S-layers are capable of interacting with particles and materials of different physiochemical properties, thereby favoring adherence of whole cells to solid surfaces. In contrast, S-layers from thermophilic Bacillaceae did not adsorb charged macromolecules on their surface or inside the pores because this would hinder the transport of nutrients and metabolites (Sára & Sleytr, 1987a; Weigert & Sára, 1995).

Non-spherical viruses are rod-like or elliptical in shape (e.g., tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)). Most viruses are spherical, although different subviral structures can be present. For example, HBV specifically infects human liver cells. The virion is an approximately 42 nm-sized spherical structure termed as the Dane particle 24. Subviral particles of HBV can be found in the patients' plasma. Interestingly, different from the Dane particle, another particle is spherical with an approximate diameter of 22 nm and still another particle is filamentous and lacks genetic materials.

However, human coronavirus 229E, an important pathogenic virus but also a surrogate for MERS coronavirus, which is structurally very similar, was rapidly inactivated on copper alloys. Inactivation results from a combination of direct copper ion attack and reactive oxygen species generation. The latter is particularly important as the copper content decreases, ensuring that rapid inactivation still occurs in alloys with lower percentages of copper. Therefore, incorporation of copper alloys in communal areas could help to reduce infection spread from touching surfaces contaminated with coronaviruses. This is especially important in infectious disease where the infectious dose is low, surface contamination is high, and effective therapies are limited. The mechanism of action of copper is complex and may be enhanced by radical formation but is ultimately nonspecific, ensuring continuous kill and inactivation of a wide range of pathogenic microorganisms with completely different morphologies. Concerns about the biocide resistance, possible concomitant drug resistance, and horizontal gene transfer that have been observed with other biocides (51) can be allayed because of the destruction of viral nucleic acid observed following exposure to copper surfaces. It is not feasible to cover every surface in copper, and many materials in the built environment, including stainless steel, will continue to be used because of resilience, anticorrosion, and other beneficial attributes. Incorporation of even a few copper surfaces may have an impact in effectively reducing transmission of infectious material from a surface to an individual, provided that stringent, regular, and effective cleaning regimens are employed for all surfaces. The use of copper does not serve as an excuse to relax cleaning regimens. However, the choice of cleaning reagents is critical for copper alloys because it is essential to maintain copper ion release for efficacy, so avoidance of chelators is necessary.",38.59627394993853,17.244633144059904

Enveloped respiratory viruses, although more susceptible to environmental stress than nonenveloped viruses, have been shown to persist on surfaces and contaminate more than 50% of surfaces in household and day care centers (35). Animal coronaviruses, including transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), have been shown to retain infectivity for long periods on hard surfaces (36) and for several hours on health care gowns, gloves, and masks (37), but human coronavirus 229E (HuCoV-229E) did not persist for above a few hours on surfaces (38). In contrast, we have observed that a relatively low titer of infectious human coronavirus 229E persisted on 5 surface materials, common to communal and domestic environments, for at least 5 days. Our virus preparation contained a high proportion of lung cell debris to mimic natural contamination in respiratory secretions, which may have protected the virus from desiccation, and a human lung cell line was used for the assay, which may have been more sensitive. The relatively low virus concentration used suggests that higher viral concentrations which can occur in sputum may persist for longer periods. During coronavirus infection, the viral load is highest later in the infection and large numbers of infectious virus which may also contaminate the surrounding environment can be shed as symptoms subside over long periods (4). There is scant information on minimum infectious doses, but for many respiratory viruses, the minimum infectious dose is believed to be low, i.e., just a few virus particles. Coronavirus persistence on surfaces represents a considerable infection risk if contaminated surfaces are touched and infectious virus transferred to the mouth, nasal mucosa, or conjunctiva. Nicas and Best (39) observed that individuals in office environments touched their face an average of 15 times an hour, giving ample opportunities for infection spread. The use of antiviral surfaces in health care and community facilities could help to reduce infection spread in this way. HuCoV-229E was rapidly inactivated on copper surfaces, with the inactivation rate being roughly proportional to the percentage of copper in the alloy. Alloys containing >90% copper inactivated 103 PFU coronavirus in <30 min, and a surface oxidation layer or increased copper ion release on C70600 increased efficacy, which has been observed for this alloy before (27).

However, d-mannitol was minimally protective on copper but protected the virus for the duration of the test on brass. Increasing the concentration of d-mannitol did not prolong survival of infectivity on copper (not shown).

Polymers, such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) (37–55), polycarbonate (PC) (56–63) and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) (64–68) have increasingly been utilized as alternative substrates. New substrates, such as SU-8 (69), cyclic olefin copolymer (COC) (65), Gene Frame® (70), perfluoroalkoxy-modified polytetrafluoroethylene (PFA) (13,71–76), LiNbO3 (77) and 317 stainless steel (78), have also been used in PCR microfluidic devices. Each substrate has different properties and therefore different advantages and disadvantages. The superior thermal conductivity of silicon makes rapid PCR cycling possible. Silicon fabrication processes are well developed, and thus precise and complex chip structures can be achieved (4). However, silicon can be problematic: bare silicon inhibits PCR; its high thermal conductivity requires thermal insulation and therefore results in structural complexity (14,23,25,36,79–81); its opacity limits optical detection; and its electrical conductivity makes it difficult to combine micro PCR with micro capillary electrophoresis (CE) (26,27,31,35,40) on a single silicon chip. Transparent glass is suitable for optical detection. The electro-osmotic-flow (EOF) property of glass allows the integration of PCR and CE on a monolithic chip (26,27,31,35,40). However, the PCR chips made from silicon or glass cannot be disposed due to the high cost of fabrication. The use of polymers as substrates may overcome these disadvantages. PDMS, an inexpensive elastomeric polymer, has emerged as a promising substrate. It exhibits high flexibility, better optical transparency, lower cost of fabrication and better biocompatibility than silicon. The flexibility of the polymers gives rise to the highly integrated PCR chips incorporating PDMS micropumps and/or microvalves (19,20,26,27,31,35,40,46,48,52,53). PDMS adsorbs less PCR sample than other materials and thus can be used to coat glass surfaces to avoid the possible inhibitory effect of glass on PCR (39,50,54). However, the permeability of PDMS can result in diffusional loss of biological sample, and implantation of polyethylene (PE) vapor barrier in the PDMS has been proposed to prevent this fluid loss (53). Air bubbles can be formed on PDMS surface during sample loading due to its hydrophobicity (51).",18.084542129459138,8.049705251959715

However, in some cases, the acute resolution of infection is incomplete and viral persistence results. Herpes simplex virus, Heliothis zea nudivirus 1 (HzNV-1), adenovirus virus and Theiler's virus are hallmark examples of infections that develop lifelong viral persistence by “hiding” from the immune response. In contrast to the many viral translated and induced proteins involved in maintaining persistent infections by direct inhibition of T cell responses and/or by down-regulating antigen recognition molecules [24], [25], some lncRNAs have been shown to be responsible for derailing the immune response to permit viral persistence. Tmevpg1, which is a long intergenic non-coding RNA, controls persistent infection with Theiler's virus by positively regulating IFN-gamma expression; this process is dependent on Stat4 and T-bet, which are the two transcription factors that drive the Th1 differentiation program [26], [27], [28].",12.39570176787299,6.07601892566177

Newer technologies, such as nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) with fluorescent (usually antibody) staining, allows for the specific quantification of labeled vesicles within the overall population of vesicles present, thus allowing for both the detection and enumeration of putative tumor or pathologic EVs in a mixed field of vesicles (eg, such as from serum111 or from urine112).

The fiber-modified Ad virions showed enhanced infection of cells expressing the cognate receptors HER3/ErbB3 and HER4/ErbB4, so the HER3-expressing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells could be transduced by the HRG-modified virus, but not by wild type virus.132 Other studies showed that the fiber-modified Ads had specific tropism to different cancer cells, which may provide a new strategy for Ad based cancer therapy.133,134",7.422402242087119,4.562496416511116

Since the putative mechanism of action of the drug is to lead to mutations in cytosine bases (C > N mutagen by inhibition of CMP incorporation (49)), this dataset provides an ideal test-bed for studying quasi species dynamics of the dengue virus using samples from two time points (Table 3). In particular, an important conclusion of the original study was that despite encouraging results in in vitro studies, the drug did not work as expected in vivo (31). To investigate this aspect further, we compared the frequency of C > N mutations in the placebo group versus the drug group (see ‘Materials and Methods’ section) in dengue virus serotype 1, 2 and 3 (DENV1, DENV2 and DENV3) samples using LoFreq SNV calls (see ‘Materials and Methods’ section). Our results indicate that no significant changes can be seen in this frequency for any serotype (Mann–Whitney test, P-value > 0.3), providing a molecular basis for the in vivo conclusion of this study. Despite this, we do detect other changes in viral intra-host variation, including an increase in the number of SNVs at later time points, as expected (one-sided Mann–Whitney test P-value < 0.007 for DENV1 placebo group), as well as the disappearance of a mutational hotspot in NS3 (see ‘Materials and Methods’ section) at a later time point, possibly due to adaptation to the host’s immune response (Figure 3).

Previous data showed an M1-like role for TAM in the initiation and promotion of tumors with the activation of NF-κB signal pathway 71. In liver tumors, macrophages (known as Kupffer cells) engulf and kill circulating tumor cells in an M1-like manner, and the depletion of Kupffer cells in rats enhances metastasis 72. However, TAM is transformed into M2-like phenotype in the development of tumors, and NF-κB signal pathway is down-regulated 73. During the stage of invasion and migration, TAM is converted into M2 phenotype upon the stimulation of IL-4 secreted by CD4+ T cells and tumor cells, and functions as the key to the gate of invasion of tumor cells 74. Mechanistically, TAM migrates and synthesizes epidermal growth factor (EGF) under the stimulation of colony-stimulating factor (CSF)-1 secreted by tumor cells, in turn activating the migration of tumor cells 75. More interestingly, TAM and tumor cells migrate in lock-step, and both migration and chemotaxis of them could be inhibited by either the EGF or CSF-1 signaling pathways 64. Matrix metalloproteinases 2 and matrix metalloproteinases 9 secreted by TAM could impair the matrix, and help tumor cells escape from the basement membrane, which is another important regulator of invasion of tumor cells 76. In a word, the distinct phenotypes of macrophages regulate the activity of tumor cells in the different stages of tumors, which provide an attractive target for the treatment in the future.",7.05396727339682,1.435778937396307

Running Title: A mathematical model to predict worldwide COVID19 Spread,"Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease was renamed COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO) 1 According to WHO, the virus has spread to 197 countries and territories and infected 372,757 people and caused 16,231 deaths (4.35 % mortality rate). 2 This mortality rate of COVID- 19 varies with the addition of new cases. 3 As compared to other two types of Corona virus Severe Acute Respiratory syndrome (SARS) 4 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) 5 which has mortality rate of 9.6% and 34.45 respectively the COVID-19 current mortality rate is almost 4.14%. The average incubation periods for COVID-19 has been reported 4-5 days with an average time of 14 days 6 7 8 from start symptoms to death which is almost similar to MERS. 9 Since human to human transmission of COVID-19 has been confirmed, respiratory droplets and contact are treated as the main path of its transmission so its patients need to quarantine to reduce its spread. 10 A recent study confirmed the spread of COVID-19 through aerosol droplets as SARS-CoV-2 remained viable in aerosols for 3 hours with little reduction in infectious titre from 10 3.5 to 10 2.7 50% tissue-culture infectious dose (TCID50) per litre of air and its reduction rate has been found similar to SARS-CoV-1, from 10 4.3 to 10 3.5 TCID50 per millilitre. While COVID -19 was found to be more stable on plastic and stainless steel than on copper and cardboard, the viable virus was detected up to 72 hours after application to these surfaces 11 which partly explains it lethality. Another unique characteristic of COVID-19 was that its reoccurrence was reported in an oropharyngeal swab test. 12 Further evolution of COVID-19 has been documented and a second strain of the virus was identified and mutations seen in 149 sites across the strains and the strains have been reclassified as L and S. 13 But this claimed was countered by Maclean et al., 2020 who diffused this information by considering it as miss interpretation of the SARS-CoV-2 data, and highlighted its methodological limitations. 14 Since the outbreak started, the reported number of cases and deaths is increasing exponentially despite precautionary measures worldwide. Real-time data reports and forecasting are essential tools for tackling measures and policy formulations to contain the infection. 15, 16 Epidemiological predictions based on real time data create an opportunity to forecast the geographical spread of diseases and also give estimate for burden of case counts to early want to the public health system and paved path for interventions during a pandemic crisis. Exploiting all available real time data is an important aspect of modern pandemic response and helps to take strategic decisions with evidence based support. 17 A few studies have been reported since the start of COVID-19 to model disease prevalence, spread and forecast its expansion. A modelling study conducted based upon the number of cases exported from Whuan to international locations predicted an epidemic doubling time of 6.4 days. 6 Another model reported by the Imperial College of London estimate the potential total number of corona virus cases in Whuan city by using the total volume of international travel from Wuhan over the last two months. 18 Another model was reported to estimate the total number of cases over Diamond Princess Cruise ship by utilizing the number of positive cases on-board at the cruise ship in Japan. 19 To model outbreak size in Wuhan City by considering the governmental actions, individual behavioural response, zoonotic transmission and the emigration of a large proportion of the population over a short time period was developed and compared with influenza pandemic of UK in 1918. 20 Similarly the risk of importation cases of COVID-19 to Africa from China was estimated based on flight data that originated from China and classified all of Africa into three clusters based on calculated risk. 21 But most of these studies, have used air traffic as a base line for modelling or they consider data from only one city to predict the size of the outbreak and the ability of the country to contain the outbreak. All these different mathematical and statistical models proposed for COVID-19 have different strengths and weaknesses. In particular, some of these model specifications are better than others in distinct scenarios and in distinguishing prediction targets such as different measures of timing or the severity of the COVID-19. Additionally, there is always room for enhancing the efficiency of quantitative analyses and their results to make communication of data interpretation easy to public health concerned authorities.

Nanoparticles adsorb biomolecules in biological fluids due to the high free energy of their surfaces 1 . The importance of the corona layer stems from the fact that it constitutes the actual surface of interaction with biological membranes or ""what the cell sees"" in the in-vivo context 2 . Hundreds of proteins have been identified to confer a distinct biological identity of nanoparticles in different microenvironments depending on their size, chemistry and surface modification (recently reviewed in 3 ). These factors were found to be critical determinants of the biodistribution and pharmacodynamics of nanoparticles. On the other hand, the ability of the surfaces of nanoparticles to partially denature certain corona proteins exposing ""cryptic epitopes"" highlights the role of the protein corona in the toxicology of nanoparticles [4] [5] [6] . The formation of a protein corona is particularly important in the context of nanoparticle interaction with amyloidogenic peptides such as amyloid beta (Aβ42) and islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), which are associated Alzheimer's disease (AD) and diabetes mellitus type 2 disease, respectively. Nanoparticles have been shown to catalyze amyloid formation via binding of amyloidogenic peptides in their corona, thereby increasing local peptide concentration and inducing conformational changes that facilitate fibril growth via a heterogenous nucleation mechanism 7, 8 . This surface-assisted (heterogenous) nucleation has been demonstrated for several nanoparticles with different amyloidogenic peptides including IAPP and Aβ42 9,10 .",10.447278214270387,4.375781401963114

Thus, the personal spaces of these patients overlap in the toilet area, and thus are likely to generate an additive contamination effect, and may explain why the toilet surfaces were particularly likely to be positive. Nevertheless, the duration of a patient's stay in the toilet is brief as only mild-symptomatic patients stayed on this floor. Additionally, the surface material or finish inside the toilets may allow a better transfer during sampling by swabs. In this context, it is known that there is generally a higher surfacetouch transfer rate from smooth to rough surfaces, and most toilet surfaces are made to be smooth . 13 We failed to detect any viruses on non-toilet object surfaces in the patients' rooms, unlike in a 2020 study by Ong et al, 11 who detected 13/15 (87%) positive samples in one patient's room, and 3/5 (60%) in toilet sites, although anteroom and corridor samples were negative.

Basic symptoms resemble the normal flu-like symptoms that can result in cough, cold, headache and body ache. The more severe consequences include acute respiratory tract infections that culminate into pneumonia (WHO report, 2020). In more severe cases, especially old people also develop secondary infections that start affecting other vital organs and in worst cases leading to death of any individuals which can be cured for most infected individuals (Xu et al., 2020) . The fast pace at which it is spreading from human to human contact is the current major reason of worry, and this what we show through a concise mathematical model in this paper. The infections can spread through air (if the infected individual is less than one meter apart from uninfected individuals), mostly through the droplets of infected people since the virus stays alive in droplets on the surfaces for many days. As soon as it gets into the host, it replicates in the body, and the body becomes a reservoir (Rothan and Byrareddy, 2020).",10.903173706544848,7.213456852798357

In the context of the ER, cubic TPMS have been found in response to elevated levels of specific membrane resident proteins such as cytochrome b(5) [56] . When applied to P-Schwartz and D-Schwartz TPMS with prescribed surface average of spontaneous curvature per unit cell [64, 65] , simulation results from our model for minimal surfaces showed that the dimensionless spontaneous curvature qualitatively follows the Gaussian curvature (Fig. 7 , see Supplementary Material Section S3 for details [66] ).

Assuming a similar longevity on FFR surfaces, it is important to develop procedures for the safe and frequent re-use of FFRs without reducing the filtration efficiency. The CDC has recommended many disinfection or sterilization methods, typically involving chemical, radiative, or temperature treatments 31 . In brief, we can summarize the mechanism of disinfection or sterilization of bacteria and viruses as among the following: protein denaturation (alcohols, heat), DNA/RNA disruption (UV, peroxides, oxidizers), cellular disruption (phenolics, chlorides, aldehydes).

Its primary mode of transmission is via respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes. The virus can remain viable for up to three days on plastic and stainless steel or in aerosols for upto 3 hours and is relatively more stable than the known human coronaviruses. It is stable in faeces at room temperature for at least 1-2 days and can be stable in infected patients for up to 4 days. Heat at 56°C kills the SARS coronavirus at around 10000 units per 15 minutes.

Furthermore, the sequence diversity in the virus from the population screening is greater than in the original targeted screening that was focused on people coming home from skiing in the Alps.

These failure mechanisms are broadly classified into three distinct categories (i.e., resistance, 5 persistence, and tolerance), which are characterized by the change in drug concentration and exposure time required to kill bacteria 6 . For example, resistance is characterized by genetic mutations or phenotypic changes which result in bacteria requiring significantly higher concentrations of antibiotic (minimum inhibitory concentration, MIC) to be lethal. By contrast, bacteria exhibiting tolerance or persistence require increased drug exposure time (minimum 10 duration for killing, MDK), with the latter exhibiting a biphasic killing profile (Fig. 1A) . Further, bacteria populations become tolerant through environmental conditions or genetic mutations, whereas persistence is an actively maintained, non-heritable state exhibited by a subpopulation of bacteria.
