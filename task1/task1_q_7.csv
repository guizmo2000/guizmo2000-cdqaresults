Even though PRRS is endemic in North America, recurrent emergence of new PRRS virus (PRRSV) strains results in an epidemiological dynamic that resembles an epidemic condition for the disease (2, 3) . PRRSV epidemics impact the swine industry and commonly require prompt mobilization of resources for diagnostics (i.e., sequencing of the virus), thorough investigations to understand the origin of the emerging PRRSVs, and implementation of effective control measures. Surveillance is an integral part of strategies for control and elimination of PRRSV. There are a number of surveillance activities currently in place in the US; however, because PRRS is not reportable, surveillance strategies vary dramatically according to factors such as region and production system. A few examples of such surveillance activities are ongoing monitoring in breeding herds and gilt development units, and passive surveillance triggered by clinical symptoms.",12.003333892974805,7.983369332843763

As expected, an Asian Zika virus lineage-specific E-based assay 16 did not detect the African lineage despite very high concentrations of viral RNA in the sample. As intended, the new NS1-based assay cross-detected Spondweni virus, as well as Kokobera and Jugra virus. These viruses are predominantly animal-associated 23 and do not circulate in Latin America and hence do not affect people in the current Zika virus outbreak. 14 When we determined the lower limit of detection using the uncRNA, all but two assays showed comparably high analytical sensitivities of around 5-10 Zika virus RNA copies/reaction (Fig. 4 ). An NS2b-based assay recommended by PAHO showed a lower limit of detection of 17 copies/ reaction, 12 whereas an NS3-based assay showed a lower limit of detection of 1373 copies/reaction. 7 To exemplify the impact of technical sensitivity on clinical sensitivity, we extrapolated the lower limits of detection to clinical viral loads. As shown in Table 2 , an assay with a lower limit of detection of 5-10 copies/reaction has a clinical detection limit of about 1000 copies/ mL, whereas an assay with a lower limit of detection of 1000 copies/reaction has a clinical detection limit of about 10000 copies/mL.

Therefore, the search for rapid, informative and reliable diagnostic methods is becoming urgent as ever.

Could high throughput sequencing (HTS) become the future gold standard in molecular diagnostics of viral infections? Compared to conventional clinical tests, HTS is universal and more precise at profiling pathogens. Nevertheless, it has not yet been widely accepted as a diagnostic tool, owing primarily to its high cost and the complexity of sample preparation and data analysis. Those obstacles must be tackled to integrate HTS into daily clinical practice. For this, three objectives are to be achieved: (1) designing and assessing universal protocols for library preparation, (2) assembling purpose-specific pipelines, and (3) building computational infrastructure to suit the needs and financial abilities of modern healthcare centers. Data harvested with HTS could not only augment diagnostics and help to choose the correct therapy, but also facilitate research in epidemiology, genetics and virology.

For the OpenMP approach, we tuned for the number of threads and the scheduling strategy (static, dynamic, and guided). We found that using 16 threads and a static scheduling of work sharing among the threads provided 7 times relative speedup (see Fig. 1a, b) . Finally, for the hybrid MPI-OpenMP approach, we used 4 processes (or nodes) and 16 threads. For comparison purpose, we experimented with a varying number of sequence lengths. Figure 2a , illustrates the execution times for different implementations where we can see that our OpenMP implementation outperforms all the other approaches and is almost 2 times faster than the best sequential version. However, the MPI approach provides poor results due to the increased amount of communication and synchronization overhead caused by m scatter and gather operations (blocking in nature). The hybrid MPI-OpenMP approach performs the worst. As in the hybrid approach, the number of scatter and gather operations is the same as the MPI approach, and it also adds synchronization overheads of the OpenMP, and therefore this implementation provides the worst result. This observation indicates that distributed memory implementation is discouraged for the LCS algorithm. In order to validate our results, we also experimented with the real-DNA sequence data (see Table 1 ). From Fig. 2b , we can see that even for the real data the OpenMP implementation is having at-least 2 times speedup from the best sequential version.

The overall effect of gene selection is the maintenance of efficient gene expression; however, selection pressure from previous translation processes, also known as the translation elongation rate, or certain subsequent protein products could also contribute to this selection process. Previous studies have shown that both conditions occur in different species. In many viruses such as bovine coronavirus or Zika [10, 37] , protein products are not contributing factors, whereas in plants like Zea mays [38] the effects of proteins products are significant. In our study, we investigated factors such as nucleotide content, expression levels, amino acid composition, protein length, hydrophobicity, and aromaticity to evaluate their relationships with codon selection. Of these factors, only protein length had selective effects on codon usage; however, the effects of protein length were strictly determined by CDS length and overall, attributable to the translation elongation rate.

This is true with MDI/spacer adoption because, despite strong research evidence that MDI/spacer can produce results equivalent to nebulisers, adoption of MDI/spacers for the treatment of mild and moderate asthma has been slow. Building upon the findings of key articles in the field [16, 17] , we studied the natural evolution of diffusion patterns of MDI/spacers for the treatment of mild to moderate asthma in children in nine PEDs. Through this research, we developed new knowledge about the social and political nature (i.e., in terms of resource allocation and presence of champions) of the adoption process as well as complexity in terms of the number of factors and levels that innovation adoption demands. Clinical treatment and management of children's asthma exacerbations are engrained decisions and behaviours that are shaped by factors at the individual practitioner, department, and institutional levels. Adding to this complexity, parental perceptions and expectations weighed heavily into healthcare professionals' decision making processes and the overall adoption process. Generally speaking, the findings make important contributions to the complexity of innovation adoption processes on two fronts. First, awareness or knowledge of the innovation is not enough to change practitioner behaviour. Rather, of note, most practitioners knew of the merit of MDI/spacer use, however, this knowledge was not enough to independently propel successful adoption because of the magnitude of other unit level barriers. Second, there were no 'magic bullets' or patterns of barriers and/or facilitators that consistently led to adoption success at each of the adopter/ adopting sites. Rather, the unit/departmental barriers and facilitators interacted and interplayed with historical, contextual, and cultural values at each site. Our findings represent important knowledge for EDs preparing to implement MDI/spacers for asthma treatment, and potentially other innovation adoption decisions that are based upon strong research evidence. This study demonstrates the value of assessing the unit-specific barriers and facilitators prior to planned implementation change initiatives in order to tailor implementation strategies.",13.374346399004798,6.874098660840033

The number of genetically modified plants has been growing in recent years despite the intense discussion about the benefits or damage that these organisms may have on humans and ecosystems. The detection of a GMO is carried out by targeting the genetic elements (promotors, protein-coding regions or terminators) that have been introduced artificially in the genome of the transgenic organism in order to improve a particular trait [242] . A curated list of transgenic reference sequences has been recently made available and is expected to facilitate the development of methods for testing GMOs and the implementation of regulatory policies [243] . The labelling and traceability of GMOs are important issues that are highly regulated. If the content exceeds a certain threshold, the product must be labeled accordingly. The most commonly used DNA-based methodology for GMO testing is PCR, although other techniques have been proposed [244] [245] [246] . The quantification of DNA targets is usually done by real-time PCR, where the copy number of the transgenic element detected is correlated to a common plant marker, allowing the determination of the GMO proportion in the sample [247, 248] . The correct detection of genetically modified materials is of forensic relevance not only due to strict legislation regarding the labelling of food products but also due to the type of materials from which DNA has to be extracted. For example, transgenic constructs have to be identified in DNA extracted from products like corn germ, flour, pasta, corn flakes, cookies, baked products, sugars derived from corn starch, soy cream or milk (liquid or lyophilized), tofu, meat products, lecithin, and even oil. Although most of the currently available GMOs are plants, the picture is expected to change soon. The first genetically modified animal (AquAdvantage salmon) is on the verge of being approved for human consumption in different countries [249] . New methods are being developed to detect the genetically modified salmon in food products [250, 251] . Strong legislation is expected to regulate the presence of this transgenic animal in foods and environmental samples [252, 253] and, consequently, reliable and sensitive methods for its detection will be required by regulatory and scientific agencies worldwide [245, 254] .",12.332789012585652,6.63054833419929

Substantial autochthonous circulation in Italy, Iran and South Korea has been reported by now, while there is increasing evidence that subclinical infections occur and people may be infectious before symptoms appear [8] [9] [10] . These developments indicate that the window of opportunity to contain and eradicate is rapidly narrowing. [11] . Therefore, it is needless to state that for each phase in the control and mitigation of a novel emerging pathogen, adequate laboratory preparedness and response are crucial. The readiness survey that we performed served the important purpose of mapping the initial response capacities in Europe and identifying barriers to diagnostic implementation. Therefore, we maintain that the urgent implementation and monitoring of diagnostic capacities and capabilities for SARS-CoV-2 in Europe is proportional to the containment and expected mitigation phase of the global public health response and is critical for care of local patients. The implementation of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics does not replace nor exclude diagnostic capacity for other respiratory viruses. Moreover, it explicitly does not disregard the importance of other seasonal respiratory pathogens for public and patient health. This is clearly illustrated by the authors themselves, who indicate that they have tested thousands of samples of patients suspected of respiratory viral disease not only for common respiratory pathogens but also for SARS-CoV-2. The fact that Colson et al. found a wide range of seasonal respiratory viruses indeed underlines the impact of such pathogens.

The presence of these modified risk factors may alert physicians to avoid secondary hospital exposures, such as blood products transfusions, excessive fluid administration, infusion of potentially toxic drugs, high tidal volume mechanical ventilation, and gastric aspiration. Implementation of ventilator associated pneumonia prevention bundles decreases the incidence of VAP and can lower the incidence of ARDS [17] . Implementation of automated ARDS electronic screening in USA hospitals such as ""ASSIST"" (electronic alert from laboratory when the arterial blood gas analysis shows hypoxemia and the radiology department when chest X-ray shows bilateral pulmonary infiltrates) to identify intubated patients with ARDS in medical and surgical ICUs showed a sensitivity of 97.6% (95% CI, 96.8-98.4%) and specificity of 96.8% (95% CI, 96.8-98.4%) when compared to a manual screening algorithm that had a sensitivity of 57.1% (95% CI, 54.5-59.8%) and specificity of 99.7% (95% CI, 99.4-100%) in 1270 ICU patients over a 21-week period during enrollment in ARDSNet trials [23] . The results of this study indicated the advantages of having an in-hospital automated screening of ARDS over manual screening.

Correlation of our findings with enterocyte function and integrity could provide more insight into the possible mechanisms of translocation and should be considered for future studies. Arguably, bacterial findings based solely on positive bacterial cultures could lack sensitivity and be an underestimation of episodes with blood-borne bacterial findings. Broad spectrum PCR targeting conserved bacterial genes like the 16 s rDNA could improve bacterial diagnostics once the inherent difficulties with cross-contamination and false positivity have been resolved. [32] Regardless, PCR diagnostics is a viable option to circumvent this limitation and should be considered for future studies. In this study, we have chosen to follow conventional clinical bacteriological routines in order to obtain the current clinical picture. Given the transient nature of circulating endotoxins and sCD14, care had been taken to ensure samples were obtained within a 72 hr window within which, no sampling bias was observed. Additional information with regards to mucositis grading was unfortunately unavailable in this study and should be considered for inclusion in future studies as a measure of mucosal damage. Further, it would have been desirable to perform longitudinal studies in order to determine if there were correlations between endotoxin concentrations and progression to severe infection or, even septic conditions. Unfortunately, this was not possible with the current study but should be considered in other studies with the same patient cohort. In this cross-sectional study, our findings suggest that in the absence of microbiological findings, microbial translocation could contribute to febrile episodes in an adult neutropaenic cohort. This not only adds to the repertoire of potential causes of fever, it also indicates the urgency for suitable biomarkers to distinguish between drug and tumour related fevers (DTRF) and fevers of infectious causes.

Factors that can limit the rate of detection include a high rate of subclinical cases, long incubation periods, and poor detection tools. The detection period can also be lengthened by the absence of active surveillance activities or lack of declaration in cases of clinical suspicion. For cow-calf systems or for dry dairy cows, farmers may easily miss some moderate clinical signs on some animals and not identify cases until clinical signs have become severe.

Although not presented here, individual countries and Ministries can be profiled to help identify potential vulnerable hot-spots that warrant technical cooperation from neighboring countries and international agencies. Regional and country-specific profiles allow comparisons with the countries responses to the annual IHR Core Capacity Implementation Survey. In 2013, 97% of the countries within the Americas region reported coordination within government for the detection and response to zoonotic events, and 97% had functional mechanisms for collaboration between animal and human health units such as intersectoral surveillance units and laboratories [22] . These compare with the results of the present survey where Ministries were asked to rank the relationship with their counterparts. None of the Ministries ranked their collaboration with the other Ministry as non-existent. In fact, the majority of Ministries ranked the collaboration as very or overall productive (69%). Yet, many Ministries suggested improvements through regular meetings, formalized MoUs, and data sharing. The latter entails a highly evolved relationship and well developed processes between parties and is uncommon, as reported by Vrbova et al. [23] who found that only 19% of the surveillance systems for emerging zoonoses considered both human and animal data. On a related topic, albeit less demanding of sophisticated structures and processes to support useful data sharing, the 2013 IHR Core Capacity Implementation survey reported that 80% of countries in the Americas had a timely and systematic exchange of information between the animal and human sectors [22] . Because so few MAgs have a dedicated zoonoses group (20%), the collection and sharing of data beneficial to both parties is likely to remain a challenge. For emerging zoonoses, given the low proportion of respondents that replied that they had an MoU with their counterpart (Fig 6) , opportunities to improve this specific capacity appear possible. This is likely to hold true only for those zoonoses that have both a significant public health and an economic impact (e.g. BSE, AI). For other conditions, MoH may not perceive much benefit in establishing an MoU with MAgs, due to the little involvement of the latter in the control of zoonoses, e.g leptospirosis.",12.059888094861991,6.665755446324637

Most acute RTIs in children are caused by respiratory viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus (ADV), rhinovirus (RV) and influenza viruses. In addition to viruses, atypical pathogens are major causes of pediatric RTIs. One of the most common atypical pathogens is Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae), accounting for 10-40% of hospitalized children with community-acquired pneumonia [2, 3] . In addition to M. pneumoniae, the incidence of pertussis in China has significantly increased since 2010.

The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of dietary zinc oxide supplementation on vaccination and challenge infection with PRRSV. Findings: The clinical course of PRRS and the success of vaccination with an experimental inactivated vaccine were compared between animals receiving a conventional diet (50 ppm Zn, control group) and diets supplemented with Zn oxide (ZnO) at final Zn concentrations of 150 or 2,500 ppm. Pigs receiving higher dietary Zn levels showed a tendency towards higher neutralizing antibody levels after infection, while dietary Zn levels did not substantially influence the number of antiviral IFN-gamma secreting cells (IFN-gamma-SC) or percentages of blood immune cell subsets after infection. Finally, feeding higher dietary Zn levels reduced neither clinical symptoms nor viral loads.

There are no cardiovascular drugs that have a wider range of indications than βblockers, making them a critical drug class for the management of cardiovascular disease. The availability of uses for β-blockers also suggests that the activation of β-ARs, or the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), plays an essential function in most cardiovascular diseases. The fact that β 1 -AR selective antagonists are equivalent to non-selective blockers in essentially all situations provides additional evidence that β 1 -ARs are the more important β-receptors with respect to cardiovascular disease. The development of a large number of rational inhibitors that have the ability to modulate the activity of such receptors has been a major goal for the pharmaceutical industries to improve the clinical treatment of various disease including hypertension, heart failure and asthma [12] .

GO terms are organized in structures called directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), which differ from hierarchies in that a 'child' (more specialized term) can have many 'parents' (less specialized terms). As part of these graphs, each component is given a GOid (unique identifier), and is associated with a GO definition.

A general consensus is that all sources of data should be embraced to improve epidemic preparedness. As a disease transmission is inherently governed by individual-level responses, pathogen dynamics within infected hosts posit high potentials to inform population-level phenomena. We propose a multiscale approach showing that individual dynamics were able to reproduce population-level observations. Methods: Using experimental data, we formulated mathematical models of pathogen infection dynamics from which we simulated mechanistically its transmission parameters. The models were then embedded in our implementation of an age-specific contact network that allows to express individual differences relevant to the transmission processes. This approach is illustrated with an example of Ebola virus (EBOV).",13.90962492232519,6.894293301122875

This reaction can be postulated as representing one of the fundamental injurious responses of the lung. However, the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying DAD are still mostly unknown, especially in humans. Most experimental studies have been conducted with animals exposed to toxins, lipopolysaccharide, and so forth, and these reactions cannot be directly extrapolated to human lung since lung reactions occurring in mice and rats do not resemble exactly those encountered in human lung. Another limitation for studying DAD in human lung is the rarity of those diseases. It is very difficult, virtually impossible, to gather large numbers of patients/samples of DADassociated lung diseases during their acute exacerbations without international collaboration involving several specialities. It can be argued that the study of DAD-associated lung diseases is even more difficult than that of IIPs or other types of relatively rare lung diseases, because DAD is confined to unpredictable periods of various diseases.

Substantial autochthonous circulation in Italy, Iran and South Korea has been reported by now, while there is increasing evidence that subclinical infections occur and people may be infectious before symptoms appear [8] [9] [10] . These developments indicate that the window of opportunity to contain and eradicate is rapidly narrowing. [11] . Therefore, it is needless to state that for each phase in the control and mitigation of a novel emerging pathogen, adequate laboratory preparedness and response are crucial. The readiness survey that we performed served the important purpose of mapping the initial response capacities in Europe and identifying barriers to diagnostic implementation. Therefore, we maintain that the urgent implementation and monitoring of diagnostic capacities and capabilities for SARS-CoV-2 in Europe is proportional to the containment and expected mitigation phase of the global public health response and is critical for care of local patients. The implementation of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics does not replace nor exclude diagnostic capacity for other respiratory viruses. Moreover, it explicitly does not disregard the importance of other seasonal respiratory pathogens for public and patient health. This is clearly illustrated by the authors themselves, who indicate that they have tested thousands of samples of patients suspected of respiratory viral disease not only for common respiratory pathogens but also for SARS-CoV-2. The fact that Colson et al. found a wide range of seasonal respiratory viruses indeed underlines the impact of such pathogens. Furthermore, it clearly shows that diagnosis of respiratory viruses cannot be done syndrome-based and supports the need for the availability of diagnostics for a panel of pathogens including SARS-CoV-2.",13.386541816717038,6.616513064100323

There were few differences between children with definite bacterial pneumonia, and those with presumed viral pneumonia, and other pneumonias which were neither definite bacterial nor presumed viral. CRP, WCC and ANC were higher in definite bacterial pneumonia and the CRP had value for distinguishing these from presumed viral and other pneumonias. The combination of high CRP with either fever ≥38.0°C or with absence of rhinorrhoea increased the specificity and PPV compared to elevated CRP alone with little loss in sensitivity, suggesting that combining biomarkers with clinical features is of diagnostic value. Timely identification of pneumonia aetiology could improve clinical management including decisions about the use of antibiotics.

While the use of molecular diagnostic assays for detection of influenza virus infection at hospital and associated commercial laboratories increased modestly since 2006-2007, the availability of influenza molecular diagnostics for clinical care at hospitals was still limited; only 26% of hospital laboratories reported availability of molecular diagnostic assays. Laboratory diagnostics for respiratory viruses other than influenza and RSV were uncommonly available. Also, a minority of hospitals included in our survey had policies in place to systematically test patients with acute respiratory infections (ARI) seen in the ED with influenza diagnostics during influenza season. As the number and type of commercially available laboratory diagnostics for respiratory pathogens evolve, an updated survey is warranted. We showed that in most (67%) hospitals included in FluSurv-NET, a U.S. population-based surveillance network involving 15 states, RIDT was the clinician's primary or only option for influenza diagnostic testing. RIDTs are easy to use and have rapid turnaround time for results. However, RIDTs have been shown to have suboptimal sensitivity (40-70%) compared to RT-PCR or viral culture. [10] [11] [12] [13] Several studies suggest that healthcare providers are more likely to prescribe antiviral drugs with a positive RIDTs. 13, 14 Therefore, a falsenegative result may affect clinicians' decision to provide appropriate treatment and infection control among patients with influenza. Given the suboptimal sensitivity of RIDT, patient management should not depend upon a positive RIDT result. If patient management depends upon a diagnosis (or rule out) of influenza, additional confirmatory test with a more sensitive assay is warranted and the initiation of antiviral treatment and implementation of infection control should be started empirically and not delayed while awaiting confirmation. 15 In our survey, only 31% of laboratories had protocols for confirmatory testing with a more sensitive assay following a negative rapid test result. This may reflect the limited usefulness of receiving testing results late in clinical care. Also, in our survey, the laboratories confirming RIDT test results reflects shipment of specimens to state public health laboratories as part of FluSurv-NET surveillance, in addition to clinician practice.

Additional bodies of evidence support the notion that much of the toxicity associated with use of the adenovirus is also eliminated by this modification. Despite all these favorable attributes, very few if any of these chemically modified viruses are under consideration for clinical use.

Disruptive innovations occur when advances in technologies or processes create markets in existing industries. This differs from sustaining innovations, where existing practices are incrementally improved to meet the demands of existing customers; in contrast, newly introduced innovations with disruptive potential (typically unrefined, simple, and affordable in character) target lower-end market needs or create entirely new market segments. As sustaining innovations improve disrupting technologies or processes, these new innovations will meet increasingly greater needs, capture greater market share, and eventually reshape the industry. Christensen uses the example of increasingly smaller disk sizes in the hard disk drive industry, the introduction of hydraulic technology in the mechanical excavator industry, and the rise of minimills in the steel industry to demonstrate the impact of disruptive innovations (8) .

Early diagnostic bronchoscopy is now recommended over empiric treatment in HCT recipients with evidence of specific pulmonary processes [23] and is likely to have higher yield when clinical suspicion of infection is high [24] . This shift in practice is illustrated by the increasing proportion of lung biopsy recipients who underwent an antecedent bronchoscopy with BAL in the late cohort compared with the early cohort.

Additionally, cost of single analysis can be much lower than 100 Euro, but it usually requires a large number of analysis for maximum flow cell filling.

Nonetheless, the association with cancer appears to be very prominent, considering the aberrantly high levels of KPNA2 observed across cancers of diverse origin. Importantly, the altered expression pattern is associated with adverse patient characteristics. This spurs the idea that KPNA2 may hold a role in carcinogenesis. This idea is supported by the cellular studies of KPNA2 which have indicated that the protein may play a role in the malignant transformation of cells. The association with adverse cancer characteristics establishes KPNA2 as a potentially relevant therapeutic target. However, targeting of the protein will be complicated by the great number of conventional cellular processes which are also associated with KPNA2. Instead, utilization as a cancer biomarker may well be the first clinical implementation of KPNA2. Considering the results described here, obtained in a variety of cancer forms, this vision appears promising. Further prospective clinical studies are required to fully demonstrate the biomarker potential of KPNA2, and, in fact, KPNA2 is part of a Fig. 1 .

The technologies employed have included genetically based trait selections, such as screens of activation-tagged libraries of over-expressed genes, the testing of candidate gene leads developed through literaturegenerated hypotheses, through transcript and metabolite profiling experiments and/or through bioinformatic analyses, and native trait selection based on the incorporation of favorable alleles from diverse germplasm sources. For transgenic crop development, candidate genes are typically first tested in model plants. Gene shuffling technologies can be applied to screen for variation that can further improve trait functionality. Leads are transformed into elite germplasm and tested using surrogate screens in greenhouses. The transgenic plants are further assessed in managed and production field environments for reproducibility of the desired phenotype, for the absence of unwanted pleiotropic effects, and for yield potential. Alternatively, association mapping, linkage mapping and positional cloning technologies are employed to identify native genes that can be bred into elite lines, using molecular markers to introgress the trait of interest without unwanted surrounding genetic material; such products are non-transgenic. Products often combine transgenic and native traits. Robust intellectual property protection throughout the discovery and development processes is necessary to ensure that costs can later be recovered through trait premiums. To be competitive in the market, products need to carry multiple traits to confer tolerance to an ever-evolving array of pests and to abiotic stress factors, which has necessitated the development of trait stacking technologies. The use of molecular markers and doubled haploids in conjunction with contra-seasonal seed production accelerates trait integration and breeding timelines. For transgenic crops, field and laboratory data are assembled into complex regulatory dossiers for government approval processes. Finally, extensive field efficacy and multi-location breeding trials must be conducted to ensure that products meet performance standards. ",14.444909430784621,8.415098909571691

Usage of different spray-drying conditions or lapses in the consistency of the processes could potentially lead to an incomplete viral inactivation and further work needs to be done to understand and perhaps improve the quality assurance of the processes utilized by the SDPP industry.

The first step in combating these pathogens is to get a timely and accurate diagnosis at an affordable cost. Many kinds of diagnostics have been developed, such as pathogen culture, biochemical tests and serological tests, to help detect and fight against the causative agents of diseases. However, these diagnostic tests are generally unsatisfactory because they are not particularly sensitive and specific and are unable to deliver speedy results.

Because of this assumption, most researchers have evaluated selected supply chain process improvement (Zhang, 2001) . Although the escalation of medical cost has been the number one issue in healthcare for the last four decades, most researchers have not considered reorganizing processes using RFID technology in hospital supply chains. RFID is a recent innovative technology that has been applied in logistics and manufacturing and is likely to be among the most exciting and fastest-growing technologies in terms of scope application (Heinrich, 2005; Gaukler and Seifert, 2007) . Healthcare providers must maintain distribution and inventory systems similar to those in the manufacturing industry.

As was the case with the SARS protocol, this process can be daunting. Focusing an organization's finite resources to assure that appropriate attention is paid to the most critical and potentially riskiest care processes is a challenge for most organizations. A variety of tools exist to guide the objective prioritization of what may ultimately be a very long list of critical issues that must be addressed. The failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) is a powerful risk assessment tool that is used proactively, both to assess complex processes to identify potential vulnerabilities before errors occur as well as to guide development of interventions to mitigate identified risks. 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 28, 29, 30 Historically, FMEA has been used in the engineering environment to assess high risk processes associated with power generation in the commercial nuclear power industry; in aviation to assess the acceptability of aircraft designs; and in the automotive industry to establish manufacturing requirements for cars and trucks. 16, 19, 22 DeRosier and colleagues at the Veteran's Administration's Center for Patient Safety are credited with moving the techniques of FMEA to the bedside, applying the concept of prospective risk analysis to health care processes. 31, 32 In 2002, the use of FMEA in health care further expanded with the issuance of a Joint Commission requirement that all health care organizations seeking accreditation conduct at least one proactive risk assessment on a high-risk clinical process every 18 months. 33 Clinical care practitioners as well as clinical research professionals can use FMEAs to identify risk and to avert adverse events, errors and other system failures in a variety of health care settings. 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 30 In a complex care environment such as that of the NIH Clinical Center, where risk is compounded by the interplay of clinical medicine and clinical research, the FMEA is a useful tool to guide risk mitigation by identifying critical risk points in clinical care and clinical research processes. In the case of the SARS protocol described above, the FMEA was used as a compass to guide the work of the team charged with facilitating the implementation of the protocol. As mentioned previously, some investigators complained publicly about the prospect of the elective admission of highly infectious patients into an environment that housed patients with impaired host defenses. In discussions with both the practitioners who were adamantly opposed to admitting SARS patients and the investigators who supported the protocol implementation, one issue heightened the collective community's anxiety more than any other issue discusseddthe safe transfer of the patients throughout the NIH Clinical Center. Practitioners, even those not enamored of the idea of admitting SARS patients, generally were comfortable that safe care could be delivered to the patient once the patient was safely ensconced in a functioning isolation room; however, the perceived risk that an inadvertent exposure might easily occur while transporting the patient in the hospital was paralyzing to most practitioners. Not only would an exposure have a potentially catastrophic effect on a patient's health and well-being, but such an exposure could compromise the integrity of several research protocols (including the protocols in which the SARS patients were participating) and could pose a significant risk to the community.",14.580215331017072,7.912116114929004

Due to the lack of standardized reference material and the absence of international accrediting bodies, different programs for quality control in clinical virology, such as the Quality Control for Molecular Diagnostics (QCMD) (URL: <http://www.qcmd.org/>), have been established. This activity was supported by the European Commission and endorsed by the European Society for Clinical Virology (ESCV) and the European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Disease (ESCMID). The QCMD is an independent, non-profit organization that designs, develops and provides QC materials and proficiency programs for an increasing number of viral targets. However, the number of currently available internationally accepted controls and standardized QC reagents is limited and restricted mainly to blood-borne viruses, such as HIV-1, HBV, and HCV. Certification and accreditation of diagnostic laboratories are becoming increasingly important in order to document the expertise and quality of work. Widely accepted criteria for quality assurance and the certification of clinical laboratories include the ISO standards 9001 and 15189. According to these guidelines it is necessary ''to apply other methods to calibrate the measuring systems and to participate in inter-laboratory comparison programs or alternative mechanisms that can assure the quality of analytical procedures''. Examples of such collaborative efforts in Europe supported by the European Commission include Concerted Actions focusing on the standardization and clinical implementation of different diagnostic approaches.

Objectives: Provide evidence on the effect of implementation of rapid molecular diagnostics for viruses on use of in-hospital isolation facilities, oseltamivir and antibiotic usage, and other clinical outcomes in immunocompromised patients. Study design: A before-after study during two consecutive respiratory viral seasons, including immunocompromised adult patients presenting at a tertiary care emergency department with clinical suspicion of RTI. During the first season (2016/2017), respiratory viruses were detected using inhouse real-time PCR. The second season (2017/2018), we implemented a diagnostic flowchart including a rapid molecular test for 15 respiratory viruses (FilmArray®). We assessed the effect of this implementation on need for isolation, antivirals and empirical antibiotics. Results: We included 192 immunocompromised adult patients during the first and 378 during the second season.

Other studies have focused on immunocompetent patients, which make former results less applicable in tertiary care centers with a large proportion of immunocompromised patients. Furthermore, with our non-randomized design in which the implementation of the rapid diagnostics for respiratory viruses during the second season was not 100%, we provide a truthful reflection of daily practice. Our study also has several limitations. First, given the before-after design of the study, outcomes can be biased due to residual confounders. However, we thoroughly adjusted our analyses for differences at baseline using a liberal p-value to select confounding factors and differences in viral pathogens for certain clinical outcomes. We thereby reduced the effect of confounders more thoroughly than former before-after studies on rapid molecular testing [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] 41] . Second, differences between the two seasons might also have been affected by trends in time not resulting from the diagnostic intervention per se. Adjustment for any possible trends in time with an interrupted time series analysis would have been appropriate. However, due to the short timeframe in this study and a limited number of patients per time point, this analysis was not feasible [44] . Also, we tried to maximize the potential effect of rapid testing by accompanying the implementation of this assay with specific instructions for the ED, by which we limited the possibility to distinguish the effect of the instructions and the rapid test as a sole intervention. Finally, our study was a single center study and clinical outcomes as antibiotic and antiviral prescriptions might be influenced by local protocols and guidelines, making results potentially less generalizable to other settings.",11.376383775202497,7.471451792920453

Considering the weakness of health care systems and financial status in RLS, point-of-care (POC) diagnostic technologies are preferred to aid timely diagnosis and treatment of patients in primary care settings, as they can rapidly provide laboratory evidence without reference to sophisticated laboratory infrastructure and well-trained operators [12, 13] .

Here, we summarized the technical challenges that are confronted during assay development and reviewed new research approaches that may provide viable solutions to developing quality-assured POC diagnostics. Because of the unavailability of systematic reports on POC diagnostics from industry perspectives, we limited our literature search to POC diagnostics for infectious diseases in PubMed and Web of Science.",15.108454624773888,8.668475361651819

Non-neuronal cells and tissues such as fibroblasts, lymphoblasts, and muscle biopsies can be explored for RNA expression biomarker discovery. Nucleic acids can be identified in most bodily fluids, including blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and have been adopted for use as diagnostic biomarkers for diseases (Xiang et al., 2003; Li et al., 2004) .

Specifically, there has been an exponential growth of near-POC or POC developments based on PCR and isothermal amplification technologies for diagnosis of infectious diseases in the last years. Because of their competitive advantages, isothermal technologies are likely to become reference chemistries for future POC applications and could gradually displace PCR-based solutions. Diverse isothermalbased technologies are tacking technical challenges at the micro-scale and finding their way to market. Low sample volume handling, low concentration of target, complex signal amplification due to Table 2 . low concentration, target instability and compatibility and integration of the various device subsystems have been identified as major hurdles for the development of POC assays. It appears that LAMP has reached a higher degree of maturity than other isothermal techniques to overcome such hurdles, according to the number of related developments and products. However, technical potentialities of LAMP or any other competing chemistries do not automatically guarantee their future adoption. In addition to further validation in clinical labs to obtain solid results, a range of cultural, organizational, economic and regulatory barriers may undermine successful deployment of diagnostics at the point of care, either isothermal or based on other technologies. One of the main challenges for effective implementation in the upcoming years will be to gain a positive perception from end users and healthcare providers. Since rapid diagnosis by POC assays alleviates patient anxiety and eliminates return visits for results, it appears that delivery of diagnosis on site will be well accepted by end users.

More than 250 known foodborne diseases affect one-third of the world population, and some segments of the population, particularly the very young, the elderly, pregnant women, and immunocompromised individuals, are an a heightened risk, pointing toward the relevance of these conditions for medicine and public health. Foodborne illnesses can be transmitted through vectors, fomites, contaminated food products, directly by person-to-person contact, from animals, or through the airborne route. As an additional layer of complexity in transmission at the level of populations, in what became known as the ""20/80 rule,"" for most infectious disease outbreaks that have been studied, a minority of hosts was found to be responsible for most transmission events.",14.131321737284289,6.826532405803788

Although discussion of clinical trial implementation is beyond the scope of this chapter, it is clear that the protection of human subjects and scientific integrity of the trial design and documentation are the overarching goals of any clinical research protocol. The clinical trial protocol must document the processes that will be used to ensure that these goals are attained. Conscientious supervision of clinical trial activities is a shared responsibility of the investigators, the IRB, the sponsor, the CRO, the DCC, the safety oversight committee, and all other partners who are participating in the trial. While meticulous attention to detail and strict protocol compliance are essential, the entire study team must be flexible and prepared to respond in a timely fashion to unexpected findings. Novel approaches to the development of vaccines for biodefense and emerging and neglected diseases will continue to evolve and will require ongoing reconsideration of the ethical and regulatory principles and practices that guide the conduct of clinical trials.

Microarray detection is a good method, but requires complex procedures for multiple virus detection. Methods: We developed a novel PCR assay, the microar- ray-in-a-tube system, which integrates multiple PCR processes and DNA microarrays for multiple virus de- tection. A 5 ؋ 5 oligonucleotide microarray for detecting 4 respiratory tract viruses (severe acute respiratory syn- drome-associated coronavirus, influenza A virus, influ- enza B virus, and enterovirus) with inner controls was arranged on the inner surface of a specially designed Eppendorf cap with a flat, optically transparent window. Results: We were able to perform all detection processes in the encapsulated system without opening the cap. The 4 viruses were successfully amplified by one-step reverse transcription-PCR in the encapsulated tube. After the PCR process, the microarray-in-a-tube was inverted, and the fluorescence-labeled PCR products were directly hybridized on the microarray. Hybridiza- tion signals were obtained with an ordinary fluorescent microscope. The sensitivity of the system for virus detection reached 10 2 copies/L. With the help of inner controls, the system provided reliable results without false negatives and false positives.

It was thus suggested that PI should, therefore, not be pursued without adequate public consultation as well as the introduction of active surveillance. The latter must involve the follow-up of large cohorts of transfusion recipients. Many surveillance systems currently in place are voluntary and passive in approach. Surveillance of potential complications arising from 28 WEBERT ET AL the widespread introduction of PI technology must be active and must also have regulatory oversight. In addition, such surveillance must be long term, following recipients for many years. There was considerable discussion around the level of informed consent necessary for postmarketing surveillance. It was pointed out that precedents exist in some countries, such as Canada, where active surveillance for severe adverse reactions to vaccinations is carried out without the requirement for specific informed consent. Another ethical consideration raised concerned the approach to be taken in the event that universal implementation of PI technologies is not feasible. Ideally, a universal approach to implementation of PI should be pursued; however, with the limitations of currently proposed PI technology, a universal approach to PI of all blood components would probably not be possible at this time. For example, obstacles to the PI of RBCs remain substantial. Under these circumstances, implementation of PI technology would likely result in 2 levels of safety for the different blood components, and the attendant needs to continue to perform microbiological screening of RBC components. If universal implementation of PI for all blood components were not possible, the ethical considerations of selective implementation of PI technology would have to be addressed, including issues relating to varying the levels of the safety of blood products and the need for explicit informed consent by the patient receiving the PI products. For example, would it be appropriate to offer PI-treated products to the pediatric population exclusively, similar to the approach taken in the United Kingdom with the transfusion of MB-treated plasma to persons younger than 16 years? Similar concerns could arise during the crossover from the existing inventory to a PI inventory. Moreover, if significant differences were known to exist between PI and non-PI products, this could become an important element of informed consent for transfusion. It was also pointed out that policy makers must retain flexibility in making decisions with respect to the appropriate allocation of limited resources if a universal approach to PI is not attainable.",14.126042914539147,6.142540587238818

The immune system operates under a dynamic mix of maintenance processes, pro-immune functions, and tolerogenic functions. The balance between these functions is dictated by how antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells (DCs), encounter antigens and integrate inflammatory or regulatory signals present in the local microenvironment. For example, during infection or inflammatory disease, DCs detect antigen in the presence of inflammatory or danger signals, which drives the expansion of effector T cells (T EFF ) and triggers antibody responses. In contrast, during tolerance, detection of antigen in the presence of a regulatory environment can lead to the expansion of regulatory T cells (T REGS ), the induction of anergic T cells (T AN ), or the deletion of T cells.

It is diffi cult to argue against the overall benefi cial outcomes of a program encompassing several measures, all aimed to reduce ABT, improve clinical outcomes, and reduce costs. Nevertheless, although the effects of single measures are mostly known, we cannot really anticipate the effect of a complex of measures, possibly being addictive, synergistic, or even paradoxically counteracting.

First anti-infectious plasma potein concentrates were the ""standard IgG"" preparations. They were produced by the cold-ethanol fractionation methods and did not make an exception to the above: noninfectious severe AEs occurred while infectious AEs were rarely reported. Indeed, prior to the introduction of mass screening for infection markers of plasma donations, inadvertent transmission of HIV to recipients of factor VIII and factor IX concentrates did occur, while IgG concentrates obtained from the same plasma pool did rarely transmit HIV (Morgenthaler 2001) . Rare transmissions were restricted to products not exposed to low pH. The very few incidences of HIV and some incidences of HCV transmission by IgG concentrates in the early 1990s, together with many cases of coagulation factor concentrates transmitted viral disease, clearly demonstrated the need to establish standardized measures to render plasma products pathogen safe. In the second half of the 1990s, authorities shifted regulatory emphasis from a scientific review of the processes to a focus on compliance to current good manufacturing practice (cGMP). The focus on cGMP compliance was applied to all aspects of plasma fractionation and the clinical use of plasma products. Court injunctions and warning letters were the consequences of this paradigm shift by authorities. This in turn resulted in a paradigm shift how the modern plasma industry operates (Steinhardt 1998) .",10.57757832925319,6.337603827439544

For example, producers and sellers of hand sanitizers or other products that improve hygiene practices could complement government efforts by advertising the benefits of their products, especially when government's health budgets are small as in the case of many developing countries.

Therefore, diminishing the immunogenicity of therapeutic proteins without hindering their function may improve clinical outcomes [72] . Epitope mapping and evaluation of the potential for immunogenicity on an ""immunogenicity scale"" is one approach; the same tools can be used to identify clusters of epitopes for removal. As described previously, reduction in T cell epitope content has been associated with reduced immunogenicity. This can be accomplished by substitution of key amino acids in the T cell epitope sequences which abrogate binding to HLA and thereby attenuate epitope potential to trigger a T cell response. Altered T cell epitopes no longer bind to HLA. Therefore, uncovering the immunogenic regions and specific amino acid residues involved in binding to HLA can allow protein therapeutics developers to abrogate T-dependent antibody responses, reducing the immunogenicity of their candidate drug. Such epitope-modifications are easily evaluated in vitro and in vivo prior to release of the protein therapeutic for clinical development.

Treatment options seem to be more optimistic for Gram-positive pathogens (including C. difficile), for which the pipeline is more promising; however, the recently launched anti-MRSA agents have not been extensively investigated in critically ill populations. In the field of Gram-negative MDR infections there is great concern about the therapeutic future, as only a handful of the upcoming agents will address the unmet medical needs. Associations of beta-lactams with beta-lactamase inhibitors seem promising against Gram-negative MDR pathogens, but their real clinical utility will be known only after results of large clinical trials are available. Currently, the most effective approach is the PK/PD optimization of the available antibiotics, particularly given the increasing awareness of the pharmacokinetic alterations that occur in the critically ill patient. Combination treatments seem to be important, at least in the empirical phase of treatment, to ensure adequate coverage of the patient and improve clinical outcome. However, randomized clinical trials are urgently needed to define the possible benefit from combinations in various settings. Most importantly, infection control measures and prompt diagnostics are the cornerstones to prevent further transmission of MDR and XDR pathogens in healthcare settings and to optimize early antimicrobial treatment.

Furthermore, the implementation of pathogen inactivation technology for blood/plasma-derived products has further reduced the risk of transmission of both known and emerging pathogens, although results can be variable according to the methods used [9, 10] . However, it is important to note that patient risk is highly dependent on the circumstances under which blood products are collected, handled and used. In general, clinicians assess the level of risk associated with the use of blood/ plasma-derived products by evaluating factors such as patient characteristics (e.g. age, immune status, geographical location, lifestyle) and the nature of the pathogen (e.g. physical characteristics, level of virulence, chronicity of infection, prevalence).

These data are novel in the pediatric population and are congruous with surveillance data from neutropenic and nonneutropenic adults [38, 39] . However, as only 10% of samples originated from patients with suspected IPA, patient-specific factors such as antifungal pretreatment, immune reconstitution, alloreactive inflammation, and impaired mucociliary clearance remain crucial in determining which child might develop IPA [16] . While this study was not powered to assess performance characteristics of this assay for IPA, pan-fungal and Aspergillus-specific PCR have demonstrated 76%-79% sensitivity and 93%-95% specificity for probable/proven IPA [14, [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] .

Importantly, for all nucleic acid-based tests, measurable Aspergillus yield varies among species and according to life stage, cell wall characteristics, and hydrophobicity [57] . Therefore, any future clinical mNGS assay will need to be benchmarked against numerous Aspergillus species as well as other medically relevant fungi in order to have the broadest utility. Consistent with emerging data in pediatrics, we also detected herpesviruses such as CMV and HHV-6 in low abundance among many children in the cohort [58, 59] . Interestingly, a number of typically nonpathogenic viruses such as Torquetenovirus and KI Polyomavirus were present in more than half of the cohort.

Because of the human origin of the starting material and the pooling of 10 000 to 50 000 donations required for industrial processing, the major risk associated to plasma products is the transmission of blood-borne infectious agents. A complete set of measures-and, most particularly, the use of dedicated viral inactivation and removal treatments-has been implemented throughout the production chain of fractionated plasma products over the last 20 years to ensure optimal safety, in particular, and not exclusively, against HIV, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus.

There is a unique polarization and distribution of the GA in processes of a subset of type I astrocytes. Thus, a subpopulation of type I astrocytes exhibit a polarized cell process similar to the axons and dendrites in neurons. These astrocytic processes contain elements of the GA as dendrites do. However, unlike the polarized nature of neuronal processes, which may be recognized with a Nissl stain and do not require organelle specific stains, the recognition of the polarized nature of astrocytic processes requires immunohistochemical staining for the GA. Additional support for the existence of polarity in astrocytic processes is derived from the report of specific distribution of sodium ion channels in astrocytic processes. Astrocyte processes forming the glial limitans and surrounding blood vessels display reduced immunoreactivity for a sodium channel specific protein, compared to longitudinally oriented or perinodal astrocytic processes, while focal regions of the glial limitans exhibit robust immunostaining [5] . The finding of increased density of potassium ion channals in the endfeet of astrocytic processes [56] provides further support for the possibility that astrocytic processes are actively involved in specialized functions. The subset of astrocytes with a polarized process may be involved in specialized secretory functions requiring rapid exchange of secretory products with the environment adjacent to this specialized cell process. It has been suggested that the GA plays a major role in cell motility [38] , and that polarization of the GA in motile cells serves as a steering mechanism in the direction of cell migration [37] . Therefore type I astrocytes with polarized GA may belong to a subpopulation of astrocytes that are motile and capable of migration in response to injury. Taken together the above evidence strongly suggests that the polarization of the GA in certain cells is not a random and insignificant phenomenon. However, the functional significance of the polarization of the GA in astrocytes remains to be investigated. The differential expression of GA in processes in the two distinct astrocytic types further emphasizes the hypothesis that functional, anatomical, and morphological differences separate these two cells which express the same intermediate filaments (GFAP). Furthermore it provides further evidence of the heterogeneity that exists among type I astrocytes.",10.738524053793135,7.103783652191702

The displayed antigens are then used for the detection of the target antibody, with the yeast cells as fluorescent labels. Multiplex immunoassay can be readily realized by using yeast cells expressing different intracellular fluorescent proteins to display different antigens. The implementation of this YSD-based immunoassay on the microfluidic platform eliminates the need for the bulky, complex and expensive flow cytometer. To improve the detection sensitivity and to eliminate the need for pumping, a functionalized micro pillar array (MPA) is incorporated in the microfluidic chip, resulting in a detection limit of 5 ng/mL (or 1 ng in terms of amount) and enhanced compatibility with practical applications such as clinical biopsy.

Second, the currently stated UK NPfIT vision is that all ICU subsystems, including networked monitoring, telemetry and audit systems, will eventually be integrated into NPfIT, with control over equipment selection and data collection handed to the regional private sector consortia and to national audit bodies. Clinician engagement and choice may not feature highly on the agenda, and there are clear concerns over the future of independent research and audit. Finally, clinicians from other countries would be well advised to follow such developments because the UK is not unique in its desire to radically modernize and standardize health IT, starting with a drive toward electronic patient records.

The term ""thromboinflammation"" refers to adverse inflammatory and thrombotic crosstalk-reactions, which are initiated and propagated by the different constituents of the innante immune system, which ultimately may result in thrombosis and/or chronic inflammation. Thromboinflammation is triggered by biomaterials, which lack the physiological inhibitors present on autologous cells, as well as by therapeutic cells in contact with blood. If uncontrolled, these adverse reactions may cause damage to an implant, a graft, and/or the recipient. Therefore, control of thromboinflammation is a major hurdle to overcome in order to improve results in a number of treatments using biomaterials and transplantation of cells and/or whole organs. Targeting the surface of biomaterials and the surface for therapeutic cells and solid organs with specific inhibitors is a promising approach to decrease thromboinflammation and thereby improve clinical outcome.",16.475790410504565,7.649536515517074

As was the case with the SARS protocol, this process can be daunting. Focusing an organization's finite resources to assure that attention is paid to the most critical and potentially riskiest care processes is a challenge for most organizations. A variety of tools exist to guide the objective prioritization of what may ultimately be a very long list of critical issues that must be addressed. FMEA is a powerful risk assessment tool that provides a systems-based, human-factors-focused, and objective methodology for identifying and prioritizing risk, with the ultimate aim of reducing patient harm and enhancing clinical research. 19,21e28 Historically, FMEA has been used in the engineering environment to assess high-risk processes associated with power generation in the commercial nuclear power industry; in aviation to assess the acceptability of aircraft designs; and in the automotive industry to establish manufacturing requirements for cars and trucks. 19, 22, 24 DeRosier and colleagues at the Veteran's Administration's Center for Patient Safety are credited with moving the techniques of FMEA to the bedside, applying the concept of prospective risk analysis to health-care processes. 29, 30 In 2002, the use of FMEA in health care further expanded with the issuance of a Joint Commission requirement that all health-care organizations seeking accreditation conduct at least one proactive risk assessment on a high-risk clinical process every 18 months. 31 Clinical care practitioners as well as clinical research professionals can use FMEAs to identify risk and to avert adverse events, errors, and other system failures in a variety of health-care settings. 19, 20, 22, 23, 27, 28 In a complex care environment, where risk is compounded by the interplay of clinical medicine and clinical research, FMEA is a useful tool to guide risk mitigation by identifying critical risk points in clinical care and clinical research processes. In 2016, investigators at the National Institute of Mental Health initiated a clinical research protocol at the NIH CC to study the neurobiology of suicide and to identify risk factors for short and long-term suicidality. One of the study phases involved admitting actively suicidal patients. In response to this research protocol, the NIH CC set in motion a rigorous risk mitigation initiative. An interdisciplinary team comprised of patient safety professionals, research investigators, nurses, social workers, and hospital leadership used FMEA to evaluate potential risk points throughout the clinical research and patient care processes. The analysis was facilitated using QI Path, an FMEA software package. The team segregated the research protocol into three overarching care delivery processes as well as several subprocesses for analysis as illustrated in Fig. 36.1 .",13.531345975496189,7.358754388724005

Given new and emerging analytical technologies and data mining algorithms, the urine peptidome has become a rich resource for the discovery of naturally occurring peptide biomarkers. For pediatric diseases, urine is expected to become one of the most useful body fluids in clinical proteomics for diagnosis and risk-stratification. Mass spectrometry-based urinary protein and peptide profiling has led to the discovery of highly informative biomarkers for both urogenital and non-urogenital diseases [43] . At the current time, urine proteomics have been applied primarily to diseases affecting the kidney and urinary tract. Our focus on changes in urine that reflect systemic inflammation is novel and potentially of broad use [18] . One of our long-term goals is to use urine biomarkers to develop clinical tests that are non-invasive and feasible for frequent sampling and determination.

Technological advancements in the manufacturing processes of microfluidic components have opened new pathways for a broad variety of technical applications (Erickson and Li 2004) . Especially chemical and biochemical analysis as well as medical diagnostics, where often only tiny sample amounts are available, strongly benefit from small system volumes and substantially faster analysis times enabled by microfluidic technologies (Burns and Ramshaw 2001; Lai et al. 2004; Nguyen and Wereley 2002) . The application of microfluidic systems improved handling and analysis times of DNA sequence tests (Paege et al. 2001; Srinivasan et al. 2004; Wang 2000) and led to improved detection systems for viruses like SARS (Zhou et al. 2004) . Recently, microfluidic systems also became interesting for chemical production processes. In particular the possibility to precisely define and control the physical boundary conditions inside micro channels with a huge surface to volume ratio leads to more efficient production processes with much less by-products. Due to the strongly increasing interest in microfluidic devices there is a growing demand for new diagnostic tools for the analysis of flow structures, mixture formation and reaction behavior directly inside the micro channels. In particular non-intrusive measurement techniques which do not influence the flow and reaction processes in the channels are badly needed.

Serious Gram-positive infections are becoming increasingly difficult to treat because of the escalating incidence of multidrug-resistant pathogens, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In order to improve clinical outcomes and to select the most appropriate therapy, it is essential to consider pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters, such as PD targets and their relation to dosing and the use of PK parameters as measures of exposure.

These might be effective irrespective of the biological or serological type of virus, and might be free of the local adverse effects of interferons. We have recently investigated two of these. One was a muramyl dipeptide derivative which protected mice and guinea pigs when given in small doses intranasally prior to large doses of influenza viruses. However, when given in the maximum acceptable dose to volunteers it did not improve the clinical or laboratory parameters of experimental influenza, even though the strain used was partly attenuated and the dose given was not large . A thioguanosine derivative has been found which protects mice against coronavirus infection by enhancing their resistance (rather than by a direct antiviral effect) and this has also been studied in volunteers using colds induced by a coronavirus; analysis indicates that either it was given in too low a dose, or that it does not enhance the primate response in the same way as that of the rodent (Higgins et al., 1991) . In this field we are at a similar stage to that of work on interferons between 1957 and 1973 -we know that there are attractive theoretical possibilities but we do not know whether any such method can be made to work in man or what the 'benchmarks' for the properties of a candidate drug should be.",12.334059990649859,7.052690948070987

The classic method, referred to as high-temperature, short-time (HTST), involves heating to 71.7 C (161 F) for 15 to 20 seconds, and extends the refrigerated shelf life to 2 to 3 weeks. The introduction of ultrapasteurized milk, which involves heating milk to a temperature of 135 C (275 F) for a minimum of 1 second, has increased refrigerated stored life to 2 to 3 months. When ultrapasteurization is coupled with sterile handling and container technology, a shelf life of 6 to 9 months can be achieved, even without refrigeration. A third technology, referred to as extended shelf life (ESL), processes HTST milk through a microbial filtration step that further increases the useful shelf life of the product, although a lack of established standards for its production results in variable shelf life among products labeled as ESL.",16.393758589157365,7.042284823402877

Some of the phenotypes of MDPL, such as lipodystrophy, have been linked to diabetes and insulin resistance (Vatier et al., 2013) . Although there has been no direct investigation of functional relationships, studies of changing gene expression in a rat model of diabetes progression identified a decrease in POLD1 expression at the onset of hyperglycemia (Zhou et al., 2011) . Polδ activity can be promoted by activity of glycolytic enzymes including lactate dehydrogenase and 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (Popanda et al., 1998) . The POLD1 R648Q mutation identified in Novikoff rat hepatoma cells and described above as linked to defects in repair also modulated the stimulation of the Polδ by lactate dehydrogenase (Popanda et al., 1998) . This is interesting, as the processes of glycolysis are altered in diabetes and in tumor development, a number of glycolytic enzymes have been identified at the replication fork, and depletion of specific proteins that mediate glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle resulted in impairment of DNA synthesis (Konieczna et al., 2015a (Konieczna et al., , 2015b .

The first live vaccines licensed in 1948 were formulated with strains now designated as virulent that produced disease in younger birds and were only applicable for use in chickens at least four-week old and needed to be applied with a wing-web application (Goldhaft, 1980) . During this time several laboratories were investigating NDV strains that could be used as a live vaccine with acceptable levels of post-vaccinal clinical disease symptoms. Within two years, two NDV strains of low virulence (B1 and LaSota) isolated from chickens from the USA were also licensed for use (Goldhaft, 1980; Hitchner, 1975) . Shortly after these products were available for individual bird administration, mass application techniques deemed necessary for larger commercial settings were investigated and implemented despite varying responses, because of uneven coverage in flocks and less than an optimal percentage of seroconverting birds (Lancaster, 1966) . Since the earliest implementation of live ND vaccination, the transfer of antibodies to offspring that can even partially neutralize the live ND vaccines, was known to be a complication. It was also evident that even the vaccines formulated with the more virulent vaccine strains would not provide lifelong immunity and that additional vaccinations would be necessary in layers and breeders.

Viruses previously restricted to one host species or geographic region can now appear in unexpected locations, confounding clinicians who are unprepared to recognize new syndromes or to detect new pathogens with their existing diagnostic tests.

High-level priority areas are first identified, after which an agreement on specific activities is decided. It is also crucial to first map out the baseline knowledge gaps and then to develop a strategic plan to address those deficiencies. This also requires an assessment of capacity needs that can support these activities.

Endotypes represent disease presentations characterised by distinct functional or pathobiological mechanisms.

This inherent disease heterogeneity and its geographic variability are recognised as a major barriers to success in clinical trials and questions remain over how to better stratify patients for targeted therapy to improve clinical outcomes [1, 6] .

IMCI guidelines were developed using existing clinical evidence and expert opinion to standardize healthcare provider training and care delivery in resourcelimited settings. 49 The IMCI guidelines are designed to identify children in need of care by presenting signs and symptoms, and they do not require diagnostic tests that are likely unavailable in most austere settings. Studies evaluating training and implementation of IMCI guidelines have shown a substantial impact on improved management and survival related to childhood pneumonia and other common illnesses. [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] For example, a cluster randomized trial in Kenya evaluating the efficacy of a multi-faceted quality improvement intervention for the management of severely ill children resulted in improved quality of clinical care when compared with a less comprehensive approach. 50 Similarly, in a pediatric outpatient and emergency unit in Malawi, directed trainings based on IMCI to improve triage and emergency care resulted in streamlined healthcare delivery and a 10% decrease in pediatric in-hospital mortality. 51 Modifications of IMCI have also been shown to improve pneumonia outcomes when implemented in the community setting. [55] [56] [57] Moreover, economic analyses have found IMCI protocolized care to be cost effective and comparable to preventive interventions such as routine childhood pneumococcal conjugate immunization. 58 It is important to highlight that clinical management guidelines may have only modest effects on important outcomes in resource-limited settings for several reasons, including an incomplete evidence base and numerous challenges to implementation. 59 Further, some studies have shown limited or no effects of knowledge translation activities, such as clinical guideline implementation. 60, 61 Nevertheless, even modest treatment effects on a high burden disease can have a massive impact when widely implemented.

Similarly, products that are less often purchased, such as furniture and home appliances, have fewer records of ratings; therefore, the chances of being recommended are often lower. This research attempts to analyze customers' purchasing behaviors based on product features from transaction records and product feature databases. Customers' preferences toward particular features of products are analyzed and then rules of customer interest profiles are thus drawn in order to recommend customers products that have potential attraction with customers. The advantage of this research is its ability of recommending to customers brand new products or rarely purchased products as long as they fit customer interest profiles; a deduction which traditional market basket analysis and collaborative filtering methods are unable to do.

The approach comprises identification of problems and goals, monitoring of problems, functional behavioral analyses, basic and applied skills acquisition, generalization of skills, and relapse prevention. Evaluation of the approach involves clinical studies at both the individual level and group level and there are promising results at both short-term and long-term follow-up.

This of course is exciting, but also daunting, for researchers as they seek to advance the field. The ASSURED criteria will provide ongoing guidance to the development of relevant tools, but of course it is important to recognize that each design feature should be considered in the context of the intended POC environment. In other words, the intended application of an ideal diagnostic device must be considered from the outset of design. When cost is not the main limiting factor to deployment, ultrarapid, self-contained disposable cassettes may be ideal. However in well-established but poor urban environments, other factors such as time or convenience may be less of a constraint on design in favor of being able to provide clinical-grade results. There may even be a future for applications where even sensitivity or specificity can be sacrificed in favor of strategies in which multiplexed detection and low cost provide redundancy for diagnosis of complex disease (e.g., paper-based gene expression profiling; [158] ). The key is that without a final set of applications and target population in mind, the complete design space available to build practical portable diagnostics may not be recognized ( Fig. 6.1) . Similarly, as developers of POC diagnostics we must also be held to account on implementation, including a workflow from sample through to answer. Steps toward implementation must follow technology development; otherwise our efforts become only an academic exercise, which must not happen. Unfortunately, the literature is replete with reports of incremental advances that have not been demonstrated with real samples and/or under real-field conditions. While the reasons for this are complex, future leaders in the field, and those who will see their designs catch the attention of the funders, will be the ones who take the time (and risk) to push the limits of their technology and iterate until their design criteria are met. This may require a series of studies and vertical integration of our laboratory efforts, but the responsibility is on us to demonstrate the value of our work at point of care.",13.513111724985666,6.056060813950062

In addition, proper validation and standardization of such tests are still required, without which regulatory approvals for testing and commercialization are hardly obtainable. Nevertheless, the suitability of rapid diagnostic tests demonstrated by the validation processes must be complemented with additional figures of merit for implementation in routine diagnosis. Dengue virus is difficult to cultivate and propagate in laboratory, probably due to its wide geographic serotypic and genotypic variability, which has been a major obstacle towards the development and implementation of rapid diagnostic tests for dengue infections. There is still a long way to run from in-the-bench schemes and prototypes to fully developed, commercially attractive biosensing devices, whose wider utilization is still shadowed by well-established and well-performing laboratory assays. Unfortunately, the experimental prerogative for using well-defined, pure synthetic samples has often hindered detailed studies and conclusions about the effect of potentially interfering substances. Cold-chain has supported massive and adequate delivery of rapid diagnostic tests to clinical settings and end-users in remote tropical regions, but is handicapped by frequent irregular power supply in such regions and by the huge costs associated to transportation. Despite all these challenges, rapid diagnostic tests must be considered valuable alternatives rather than competitors to laboratory-based analytical devices and methodologies, even if some loss of sensitivity or selectivity must be accepted in the point-of-care testing. In fact, rapid screening of large amounts of samples may speed up proper decision making by the clinician, while conventional lab-based bioanalytical techniques can be used afterwards for confirmation and better characterization of the infecting pathogen. Reusable diagnostic tests must be avoided when dealing with infectious pathogens, thus explaining the growing interest in the development of chip-based disposable tests. It has been consensual that an efficient rapid diagnostic test for dengue disease should be a multiplexed device for detection and identification of all four dengue serotypes. Future developments and advances in fundamental and engineering sciences will certainly enrich the whole pool of knowledge about rapid diagnostic tests and will also improve micro-and nanofabrication processes for their mass production at an increasing cost-effective basis as well.",11.831208184708471,7.906353327008347

For instance, for the detection and quantification of HCV, we have the International Unit (with an assumption -where are the published data -that it is similar for all genotypes), copies, genome equivalents or SuperQuant copies. One would suggest that by implementing an international standard, using a consensus nomenclature, life in diagnostic clinical virology would become much more clear. It is particularly irritating that the conversion factor from international unit to copy or genome equivalent varies somewhere between 2.4 and 5.2 (determined for genotype 1). It is also intriguing that the implementation of an international unit and its use is accepted for HCV, while for the description of quantitative results in the field of HIV-1 diagnostics, this is absolutely not the case. Data presented by quality control in molecular diagnostics (QCMD) which provides external quality control programmes, indicate that in these QC schemes, 88% of the participants in 2002 have presented their results of HCV-quantification in IU, while for HIV-1 this was done by none of the participants. Why is this not surprising to us? Simply because there is in general a limited acceptance of these standards, and it seems to depend on the viral target involved.

The introduction of molecular diagnostics into routine clinical diagnostic virology is proceeding rapidly, and it will ultimately replace or reduce the use of virus culture techniques. The implementation of automated extraction and detection methods, combined with an extensive quality control programme, should ultimately convince both clinicians and virologists that molecular diagnostics is important in clinical virology.

Transshipment can also be achieved under the vendor managed inventory (VMI) system, in which the vendor has the authority to conduct transshipment between buyers. The advantage of transshipment is twofold. First, under uncertain demands, transshipment between buyers can improve the customer service level, and it is popular in many industries, such as automobile and consumer goods (refer to Anupindi et al., 2001) . In this case, transshipments transpire between a buyer with excess inventory and another with excess demand. To the best of our knowledge, most of existing studies on transshipment are motivated by this consideration. Second, under the transshipment policy, the vendor may improve the utilization ratio of the buyers' warehouse capacities by keeping products that exceed one buyer's warehouse capacity at other buyers' warehouses for a time.

The development of molecular beacons and other fluorescent probes (such as the TaqMan® probe that is produced by Roche Molecular Systems, Inc.) has made real-time monitoring of PCR amplification and quantification of nucleic acids in clinical specimens possible 21 . Beacons are hairpinshaped oligonucleotide probes that have a fluorophore that emits photons and is closely associated with a quencher, which absorbs the photons. In the presence of a complementary strand of DNA, the hairpin structure unfolds and fluorescence is emitted, and this can be measured to determine the amount of DNA that is present. Multiple targets can be monitored 22 using fluorophores with different emission spectra. This technology, which is highly sensitive, is commercially available as the TaqMan ® (Applied Biosystems; Perkin-Elmer Corp.) and LightCycler ® (Roche Diagnostics Corp.) systems. The advantages of real-time PCR are the rapidity of the assay (30-40 min), the ability to quantify and identify PCR products directly without the use of agarose gels, and the fact that contamination of the nucleic acids can be limited. Kits are available for the detection and quantification of DNA and RNA in clinical samples, and the technique has been specifically developed to enable the follow-up of patients with HIV and hepatitis C infections (Amplitech AME Bioscience; Bayer Diagnostics; Roche Diagnostics). Microscopy. Microscopy techniques have evolved with respect to three factors: the nature of the signal, the user-friendliness of the equipment, and the digitalization and computerized processing of the image. Electron microscopes -which were once complicated instruments that were only used in research -have been simplified and are now increasingly being used in clinical microbiology laboratories. They are useful for the rapid screening of routine clinical samples, such as stool samples, and also for detecting viruses in tissue cultures. With negative staining, a viral pathogen can be identified within 10 minutes of the arrival of a clinical or tissue-culture specimen in an electronmicroscopy laboratory 43 . Electron microscopy was used to rapidly identify Bacillus anthracis during the recent anthrax letters attack in the United States 43 and also to identify the genus (Coronavirus) of the SARS virus.

","Routine implementation in high‐income countries where endemic disease and exposure are rare is likely to continue to be debated on the basis of cost and benefit. Advances in adoption are likely to result when these processes can serve low‐income nations with significant blood safety concerns with affordable products made with high quality and low cost. Questions about implementation with patients who are most vulnerable and thus may benefit the most from these methods need to be asked. Such groups may include those receiving chronic transfusion support or pediatric patients where cost–benefit and risk–benefit calculations are likely to have their most favorable outcomes.143 Providing products to regions with high endemic disease rates can greatly improve cost–benefit analyses but will require partnerships with nongovernmental organizations and longer‐term considerations of sustainability in these environments when supplementation of costs is no longer feasible.144

However, more rapid testing for respiratory viruses might improve the impact on clinical outcomes as results are available before any initial treatment or management is established by the treating physician. To our knowledge, this is the first review to specifically assess the clinical impact of rapid molecular tests, and not rapid antigen tests, without a restriction in the detection of influenza virus and RSV [45, 46]. The included studies, even the high-quality randomized studies [1, 20, 21, 24, 25], show heterogeneous results. The location of the rapid test, which was at the point of care in only 3 studies, may affect turnaround times and thereby clinical outcomes. Apart from other differences in design, and in analysis and power, differences in the implementation strategy might partially explain these discrepancies. First, education and training of personnel and physicians on the implemented rapid test, its diagnostic accuracy, and its potential effects on clinical outcomes may contribute to its effect on clinical outcomes [33]. Second, a combination of a rapid test and a result-based guideline on subsequent clinical management options might have more impact than a stand-alone diagnostic test, even though the 2 studies describing the implementation of a diagnostic bundle did not show any significant effects of their implementation, which might be partially explained by limited adherence to these guidelines [20, 21]. A complicating factor therein is that identification of a viral pathogen from a respiratory tract sample may not necessarily attribute causation [2]. Third, a combination of a rapid test and another diagnostic as procalcitonin [21, 30] or other biomarker-based assays [47] may increase the persuasiveness of the rapid viral test on whether there is a bacterial or viral causative pathogen. However, current evidence for the effect of the combination of respiratory viral testing and procalcitonin on clinical outcomes is disappointing [21].",11.896711683867359,5.516669151990905

An important example is the challenge of distinguishing between flavivirus infections, notably in the setting of the recent Zika virus outbreak 11 . Unbiased analysis of anti-viral antibodies using a robust algorithm that comprehensively considers potential cross-reactivity will dramatically improve the clinical utility of antibody analyses. Single time-point testing of IgG reactivity is difficult to interpret in the context of an ongoing or recent infection, as these antibodies may be due to long lived plasma cells induced by a historic infection. Quantifying an individual's change in IgG specificities over time, however, may provide clearer evidence of an evolving immune response. Similarly, comparing IgG specificities across distinct physiological compartments may provide evidence of an organ-specific infection (e.g., blood versus cerebrospinal fluid in the setting of encephalitis). Such pairwise VirScan comparisons would be particularly problematic for our previous analytical approach, because (i) a low number (but high proportion) of changing peptides may be observed during response to a single infection, and (ii) ongoing antibody responses may be more associated with broadly cross-reactive antibodies 12 . We have therefore developed the AVARDA algorithm using pairwise VirScan data generated longitudinally from patients with viral encephalitis. The predictions of the algorithm were found to agree with clinical nucleic acid or serology testing in most cases. In addition, utilizing VirScan/AVARDA analysis in conjunction with traditional nucleic acid testing resulted in a 62.5% increase in the diagnosis of viral encephalitis. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of AVARDA for epidemiological investigations by determining childhood infections acquired in the setting of a longitudinal cohort study.",10.96636951536938,9.062894376117503

Bacterial infection is the leading cause of death in children globally. Clinical algorithms to identify children who are likely to benefit from antimicrobial treatment remain suboptimal. Biomarkers that accurately identify serious bacterial infection (SBI) could improve diagnosis and clinical management. Lipocalin 2 (LCN2) and neutrophil collagenase (MMP-8) are neutrophil-derived biomarkers associated with bacterial infection. Methods: We evaluated LCN2 and MMP-8 as candidate biomarkers in 40 healthy controls and 151 febrile children categorised confirmed SBI, probable SBI, or viral infection. The diagnostic performance of LCN2 and MMP-8 to predict SBI was estimated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and compared to the performance of C-reactive protein (CRP). Results. Plasma LCN2 and MMP-8 concentration were predictive of SBI. The AUROC (95% CI) for LCN2, MMP8 and CRP to predict SBI was 0.88 (0.82-0.94); 0.80 (0.72-0.87) and 0.89 (0.84-0.94), respectively. The diagnostic performance of LCN2 in combination with CRP was significantly superior to either marker alone: AUROC 0.92 (95% CI: 0.88-0.96). Conclusion. LCN2 is a sensitive and specific predictor of SBI in children which could be used to improve clinical management and antimicrobial stewardship. LCN2 should be further evaluated in prospective clinical studies.",12.893328086060748,7.832897555264694

Degradation of PACA particles releases cyanoacrylic acid and the corresponding alkyl alcohol, i.e. ethyl-butyl alcohol, butanol, or octanol [55]. It has been indicated that the alkyl chain length dictates the PACA particle degradation rate [18, 55] . POCA particles were shown to have the slowest in vitro degradation rate, yet they exert the highest cytotoxicity ( [11] and data from this study). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that either the degradation rate is faster when the particles are in contact with the cellular surface than in the absence of cells, and/or the liberated degradation products of the three particle types exert highly different cellular cytotoxicities. In line with this, the hydrophobicity of the released alkyl alcohols is different. The highly hydrophobic octanol will most likely insert into the lipid bilayer and affect membrane properties to a much higher extent than the hydrophilic butanol.",6.902950999168149,5.01590189830428

According to the quantitative data, we observed relatively good completeness of IDSR monthly reports compared to timeliness. Timeliness is a general problem to countries implementing IDSR system across Africa, and this makes the public health authorities unable to take quick action and respond to the suspected health events [12, 25] . Facility level IDSR reports may not be sufficiently timely to pick up the outbreaks from community. The strengthened community level surveillance and verbal autopsy to detect unusual deaths can be a good approach to detect lower level health events and provide timely response [26] . In Malawi, a pilot study conducted in Lilongwe District in Central Region showed that mobile technologies had good opportunities to improve timeliness of HMIS reports [27] . However, concerning the different purposes of HMIS and IDSR system, a more integrated electronic IDSR system is essential for the health authorities to correspond the diverse demands. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/363713 doi: bioRxiv preprint African health ministries are quickly adopting mHealth solutions to improve disease surveillance and health programmes. Tanzania piloted an IDSR reporting system using SMS function and regular phones for report in 2011 [28] and further expanded it to be the national strategy for diseases surveillance using Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) technology linked with DHIS2 for the immediate reporting for IDSR [29] [30] [31] . Zambia tried to use DHIS2 mobile to enhance its malaria surveillance in Lusaka district and to improve case management and reporting [32] . Other mobile technologies including smartphone applications, patient monitoring devices, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), as well as laptops and tablets PCs connected with network service were piloted and implemented in various African countries [33] . Countries and development partners are eager to apply the mobile technology to capture real-time field data for surveillance and case management at the community level health care system [30, [34] [35] [36] [37] . However, notable issues were documented including technical, financial, infrastructural challenges, data security and medical supports during the design and implementation process of mHealth surveillance in sub-Saharan Africa countries [33] . Considering the complexity of public health works and needs of integration services at the community level [38] , the utilization of mobile technologies requires more rigorous studies to evaluate such innovations for programme implementation to become sustainable and scalable [39] .",6.362180148720495,3.3890696260391806
