Theoretically, meticulous provision of contact precautions (hand washing, the use of gloves and a gown along with protection against mucus membrane (eyes, nose, and mouth) exposure, and proper donning and doffing of all personal protective equipment (PPE)) should be sufficient to prevent nosocomial EBOV transmission. In nonclimate-controlled West African Ebola treatment facilities (Fig. 1) , the heat and humidity prevent optimal functioning of medical masks and some duckbill N-95 respirators (humidity and sweat cause them to sag and collapse). Tight fitting goggles often fog, reducing visibility. Face shields afford improved visibility but must provide sufficient coverage without risk of splash-related facial exposure. Half-sphere, semi-rigid respirators tend to be more resistant to moisture-related collapse and deformation. However, concern about the high mortality of EVD has led to IPC and PPE choices in the field that sometimes do not follow traditional infection control recommendations or guidance from international technical organizations. This has often resulted in PPE that cannot be safely tolerated by healthcare personnel for more than 45-60 min due to excessive heat and humidity [21] , risking syncope, potentially dangerous behaviour (e.g., adjusting fogged facial protection with soiled gloves), and inability to safely perform tasks such as insertion of intravenous catheters. In West Africa, Ebola virus transmission likely also occurs among healthcare personnel during informal healthcare provision in the community to patients or colleagues, without appropriate infection prevention and control practice [22, 23] . Nosocomial EBOV transmission in Spain [24, 25] and the USA [26] similarly reinforces the importance of rigorous Ebola IPC practices and healthcare personnel training, irrespective of the healthcare system [27, 28] .

Furthermore, in the past decade, internship period in internal medicine has been reduced for medical students whose major is psychiatry in many medical schools in order to extend their training in mental health. All these factors could limit their clinical competence to control the potential transmission of COVID-19 in psychiatric hospitals. In addition, the lack of community-based mental health services has led to an over-reliance on psychiatric services provided by large psychiatric hospitals [10, 11] . For the vast majority of patients with serious mental illness, they can only access appropriate mental health care in hospital settings, which are mostly located in city areas. Therefore, they are more prone to exposure to infectious diseases such as the COVID-19, unless the psychiatric hospitals themselves implement stringent measures of infection control similar to general hospitals. Clearly, preventive measures such as the provision of adequate medical supplies and protective equipment, public education on the risks of COVID-19 for hospital staff and patients, and restricting family visits to hospitals, are essential to reduce the likelihood of disease transmission in major psychiatric hospitals. Moreover, all people including patients' families and health care workers need to be advised to wash hands regularly and maintain good personal hygiene. Measurement of body temperature should be performed at least once a day to closely monitor any suspected infectious symptoms. Activities involving group interaction in communal areas should be avoided.

Importantly, cloth a b masks are prone to moisture retention and poor filtration when reused [130] . As suggested by a randomized controlled trial, they should not replace surgical masks in high-risk situations [131] . One striking challenge during the most recent Ebola virus disease epidemic was the shortage of personal protective equipment faced by healthcare workers caring for diseased patients in West Africa, as global fears of a disease spread rose and resource-rich countries filled their stocks with protective body suits.

Participants at all meetings understood that healthcare workers cannot completely sacrifice their and their family members' health and well-being as they fulfill their public health duties during an emergency response. Participants at the African meeting felt that healthcare workers have the right to stop working if they feel they are not wellprotected. Factors discussed included the challenges related to the displacement of health workers during post-election conflict, traditional or cultural practices that may increase the risk of disease spread (eg, hugging or handshaking), and conflicts between senior officials and frontline healthcare workers regarding access to resources. They felt that frontline health workers should have first priority. A complicating factor in many African countries is the presence of large numbers of health-care-related NGOs from a variety of countries. What obligations would they have in a pandemic? If the workers or the organizations were to leave the country to attend to the needs of their home country or their families, the African country could lose a sizable proportion of its health workforce. And yet host governments have little authority to demand their assistance. Socio-economic factors were predominant in stories told by participants at the Asian meeting. For example, during SARS outbreak, some private hospitals in one country were only admitting patients who could pay, while some suspected patients did not go to hospitals because they could not pay the inpatient care that could exceed $250 per day in a country where per capita annual income is less than $3000. Some countries reported lack of personal protective equipment, such as face masks, for healthcare workers; or differences in the degree of protection offered according to position (eg, physicians offered more protection than nurses). Participants reported that some healthcare workers refused to treat suspected cases, because either they did not have protective equipment and/ or because they were concerned for their own safety and the safety of their loved ones to whom they would return after work. The participants agreed that healthcare facilities and governments had an ethical obligation to adequately and equitably provide personal protective equipment to their employees. In addition, participants felt that education of the employees about transmission control and, in some instances, additional incentives such as hazard pay, can help overcome the hesitancy of healthcare workers to remain on duty during a pandemic surge in cases. Participants at the Latin American and Eastern Mediterranean meetings also discussed the roles of healthcare workers during influenza pandemic. Participants at both meetings recognized the important responsibilities healthcare workers have to treat patients regardless of the risk to themselves, but also noted that governments have responsibilities to protect healthcare workers.

Every pandemic plan should address the question of whether practitioners are obligated to treat patients with a highly contagious disease, thus putting themselves and their families, acquaintances, or anyone else they contact at risk. For example, research publications have mentioned the high transmissibility to nurses and frontline physicians in Southeast Asia during the SARS outbreak [37, 38] . Wenzel et al. report that about 50% of those who died from SARS were healthcare workers who had come in contact with infected patients in hospitals [38] . Chua et al. recorded that fear and anxiety-induced psychiatric morbidity was a major problem among healthcare workers involved in SARS treatment [39] . Drawing from these experiences, others have warned that an influenza pandemic will impose similar foreseeable risks to physicians and other healthcare workers [40] . This raises an ethical dilemma about the extent of the professional duty of caregivers during a pandemic versus the limits to health risk to themselves and to their families that healthcare workers need accept [41] . It may be argued that if provided with the appropriate equipment or supplies necessary to treat, practitioners should be obligated to treat someone with any illness. The NISPPI mentions procuring and distributing protective clothing, masks, aprons, and gloves. This is laudable; however, being prepared requires not only that health workers are aware that they have masks that they can use during a pandemic but also that they have the requisite training on how to use personal protective equipment safely and effectively. Indeed, it is required of planners to acknowledge limitations of various proposed actions or interventions (both pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical) [42] .

Numerous studies have been published, establishing evidence and opinion-based guides for emergency physicians, who are at the front line. Although many have established pathways for dealing with patient screening, testing, prognosis and disposition, I would like to discuss the management of the crashing patients in need of ventilation who we ought to be prepared for the most. As of now, it is essential to contain a crashing suspected/confirmed COVID-19 patient within the confines of a negative isolation chamber due to a high risk of aerosolization, with strict adherence to personal protective equipment (PPE), exclusively comprising of N95 or preferably a powered air purifying respirator (PAPR) (1). Most experienced staff should look after the patient, in order to minimize contamination to few personnel only. Since conventional methods of Non-invasive mechanical ventilation (CPAP/BiPAP) are inadvisable due to aerosol generation, it is suggested to secure a definitive airway with extreme precaution (2) . Pre-oxygenation can be performed with a Bag Valve Mask device with positive end expiratory valve and a viral filter, if available. It is recommended to form a good facemask seal with both hands, while making sure not to deliver any positive breaths (2) . Induction and relaxant medications should be administered at a maximum dose in order to prevent cough or gag reflex during the procedure (3). A video laryngoscope should be used so as to avoid having the operator position their face close to the patient. The most senior physician should at-tempt maintaining the airway, in order to maximally ensure first pass intubation success; however, in a failed airway scenario, attempts should be made to establish a surgical airway immediately. The endotracheal tube (ETT) should be positioned at a predetermined depth and secured properly. Avoid auscultation attempts to prevent instrument contamination, and look for bilateral chest rise or end tidal capnography waveform. If available, a viral filter should be connected to the adapter of the ETT, and another should be placed at the exhalation port of the ventilator (2) . A plastic transparent sheet can be placed over the patientâȂŹs head and chest to prevent droplet spread (4). All contaminated instruments should be placed in a transparent bag for immediate disposal and/or decontamination.

First, the use of facemasks among health care providers on different social occasions and in media appearances was crucial for the construction of this new social norm and for normalizing the use of facemasks, because of their social power. Health care professionals, as a social institution, allowed them to exercise social control with respect to facemask use in the community, which motivated the participants to use a facemask during the SARS outbreak. Second, the participants used facemasks as a form of symbolic support for health care providers. Because facemasks were perceived as a tool for infection prevention, using a facemask did not simply prevent the participants from becoming infected, but by so doing, it also implied a show of support for health care providers in an attempt to reduce their workload and the burden on the health care system. Using a facemask was akin to a symbolic declaration that they were committed to reducing the burden on the health care system by preventing themselves from becoming infected.

Unfortunately, under-resourced African regions not only suffer from a critically low ratio of health-care workers to total population, but also lack essential personal protective equipment (PPE) (for example, gloves, gowns, face masks) to practice standard infection control measures. They also often lack the infrastructure and local capacity necessary to effectively trace contacts and isolate infectious individuals. Consequently, it is not surprising that Ebola outbreaks have been amplified in health care settings [24, 25, 79, 80] including the ongoing epidemic in West Africa. Indeed, a total of 375 health care workers have developed EVD as of 23 September 2014 [81] . Fortunately, past experience also indicates that early and drastic enhancement of infection control measures in health care settings can substantially reduce the size and geographic scope of Ebola outbreaks [82, 83] . For instance, Figure 8 shows that the rising trend in infected health care workers during the1995 Ebola outbreak in Congo rapidly declined following the implementation of control interventions.

The most frequently observed problem was suboptimal hand hygiene, followed by personal protective equipment (PPE), and cleaning and disinfection. Investigation for the GAS outbreak in the study by Nanduri et al. [37] revealed that hand hygiene compliance among employees was 14-25%. Additionally, poor hand hygiene became a more critical factor that facilitated the transmission of acute gastroenteritis, particularly in LTCFs having close living conditions with frequent close contact between the staff and dependent residents [31] . Issues related to PPE had been addressed including inappropriate use of glove and improper storage of PPE [20, 24, 30, 31, 34, 37] . There were reports indicating the potential to cross-contamination by not-changing gloves between residents or by storage of PPE in the room of the index case [31, 34] . Breaches in disinfection and cleaning of the environment and equipment were associated with many outbreaks, most of them were GAS [20, 37, 38] or hepatitis B and C outbreaks [28, 30] . Three reports of GAS outbreaks found lapses in wound care practice such as inconsistent cleaning and disinfection [20, 37, 38] . The outbreaks of MDROs and hepatitis B reported device related issues including sharing of a device and inappropriate use of reusable devices [15, 18, 21, 34] . Hepatitis B and C outbreaks commonly reported that lapses during podiatry care and point-of-care testing procedures (blood glucose test and international normalized ratio monitoring) caused the transmission of bloodborne pathogens among residents [18, 19, 21, 28, 30] . The lapses included the sharing of contaminated equipment, improper disinfection, and poor hand hygiene adherence.",46.49494300455512,19.623278784351857

Most of the studies regarding this issue were on outbreaks of GAS, gastroenteritis, and hepatitis B and C virus, and they found a failure to adhere to proper disinfection and cleaning principles. First of all, the outbreaks of GAS and hepatitis B and C were linked with breaches in specific procedures. GAS outbreaks were usually relevant to wound care and hepatitis B and C to point-of-care testing. With the aforementioned hand hygiene, disinfection and cleaning were basic infection control practices that are included in standard precautions. The standard precautions consist of hand hygiene, environmental cleaning, reprocessing and disinfection of care equipment, waste and linen management, the prevention of needle stick injuries, and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), if necessary [11] . The practice of standard precautions is the imperative basic approach for IPC that was applied to all residents assuming they had the potential for pathogen transmission [11] . Standard precautions are necessary practice, especially in LTCFs where the systems for diagnostic tests are poor and active surveillance is not generally done. Tailored ongoing education with multimodal strategies for HCWs would ensure that basic infection control principles and standard precautions are integrated into daily practice such as point-ofcare testing [69] . As a result, a reduction in threats of outbreaks can be guaranteed, as well as the safety and health of persons residing or working in LTCFs. Meanwhile, the studies on the outbreaks of gastroenteritis reported that there were lapses in decontaminating environment. Environmental contamination may have a critical role in the spread of these outbreaks. Importantly, norovirus and C. difficile that are capable of surviving in the environment for long periods of time require more consideration in environmental disinfection [70, 71] . For norovirus, the CDC has recommended more frequent cleaning and disinfection of rooms and high-touch surfaces with a hypo-chlorite (1000-5000 ppm) or other proper disinfectant [72] . The most effective control method for C. difficile was reported as disinfection and cleaning of rooms and high-touch surfaces with a chlorine-based solution (5000 ppm) [70, 71] .",40.669776497117034,16.66151609643397

In addition, HCWs may use personal protective equipment (PPE) or rigorous hand hygiene (HH) measures, decreasing the probability of cross infection. However, HCW adherence rates to HH protocols are generally low, varying from 40% to 60%. 20 Moreover, HCWs are likely not using PPE and HH measures when interacting with one another. Our model also approximates the scenario in which infection is spread only via large droplets, not allowing for cross infection via aerosolized virus. 21 Our model assumes a given infection rate (ie, probability of infection per unit time) based on influenza, but this rate can be varied up or down for infectious agents that are more or less likely to cause infection in a given period of time, for example, measles or the coronavirus associated with Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome.

Legrand et al. [31] developed a structured transmission model to describe Ebola epidemics with contributions to the force of infection from the community, funerals and healthcare settings. The most distinctive feature of this model is that transmission during burial rituals is modeled by accounting for the duration of the burial and the intensity of transmission with infectious bodies. This model is comprised by six epidemiologically relevant states and thirteen parameters. The model was calibrated to data of the Ebola outbreaks in the Republic of Congo in 1995 and Uganda in 2000 by fitting three transmission rate parameters, one for each transmission setting and one parameter to quantify the effectiveness of interventions. The full model can be applied to the West African epidemic particularly for Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia where burial practices involve the touching of bodies of the deceased [59] . But this feature is believed to be less influential in transmission in the context of Nigeria where a limited outbreak developed. To illustrate the effects of control interventions during Ebola outbreaks, here we only account for transmission in the community and in healthcare settings by adjusting baseline transmission rates, diagnostic rates and enhancement of infection-control measures (for example, strict use of protective equipment by healthcare workers and effective isolation of infectious individuals) (see for example, [27, 28, 42, 43, 60, 61] ).

Outbreaks within health care facilities have been associated with low clinical suspicion and delayed recognition, leading to unsuspected secondary transmission.

As a result, there is renewed interest in prevention of airborne disease transmission in health care facilities. Research has led to the development of useful methods for the prediction of various aspects of airborne disease transmission. Physical modeling of, and experiments on, aerosol transport have revealed mechanisms for dispersion, heat, and mass transfer of aerosols in different size regimes from submicrometer to millimeter. Many detailed infection models such as Wells-Riley model (1) and dose-response model (e.g., (5) to (9)) have been suggested for prediction of the spread of airborne disease in health care facilities. The current state of research has also shown that important sources for airborne pathogens including human activity (expiratory, resuspension, and shedding) and building microbial ecology (indoor environment and HVAC components). The viability and infectivity response of various airborne pathogens to environmental conditions, such as temperature and relative humidity, have also been understood and quantified in considerable depth. For example, animal tests, culture methods, molecular methods, and plaque assay methods have been used to measure pathogen viability and infectivity decay rates for many different classes of microbes although all these techniques suffer from substantial shortcomings. The effect of different ventilation strategies (mixing, displacement, and natural) on air exchange rates and the spread of aerosols has also been studied. For example, mixing type ventilation can achieve sufficient dilution of contaminated air to reduce the infection rate. A displacement ventilation strategy, if implemented successfully, helps segregate contaminated from noncontaminated air, thus reducing the infection risk. Under ideal conditions, natural ventilation has been shown to exhibit very high air exchange rates (and thus dilution) that reduce the airborne infection risk. In addition, various building codes have implemented preventive measures to reduce the airborne infection risk. For example, high efficiency filtration and high air exchange rates are mandated for critical care units (surgery and protective environment rooms), and exhaust outlets are recommended to be installed close to contaminant sources.",34.98415098230834,15.094223663948757

In Japan, primary care is the frontline against emerging infectious diseases in communities. Although the importance of pandemic preparedness in primary care has been highlighted previously, few studies have thus far investigated the preparedness among primary care practices (PCPs) or differences in the preparedness of different institutional settings. We examined PCP preparedness and response to the 2009 influenza pandemic in Japan, and explored the role of a pandemic preparedness plan during the pandemic. Methods: We used a survey questionnaire to assess how well individual PCPs in Okinawa, Japan, were prepared for the 2009 influenza pandemic. The questionnaire was mailed to all eligible PCPs (N = 465) in Okinawa, regardless of their institutional setting. In addition, we assessed the differences in the preparedness of clinics and hospitals and determined whether the national preparedness plan affected individual preparedness and response. Data were analyzed using descriptive and logistic regression analyses. Results: A total of 174 (37.4%) PCPs responded to our survey. In general, high-level personal protective equipment (PPE) such as N95 masks (45.4%), gowns (30.5%), and eye protection (21.3%) was stocked at a low rate. Clinic-based PCPs were significantly less prepared than hospital-based PCPs to provide N95 masks (OR 0.34), gowns (OR 0.15), and eye protection (OR 0.18). In addition, only 32.8% of PCPs adopted an adequate business continuity plan (BCP). After controlling for institutional setting, reading the national preparedness plan was significantly associated with establishment of a BCP (OR 5.86), and with knowledge of how to transfer a swab specimen to a local medical laboratory (OR 5.60). Conclusions: With regard to PPE availability, PCPs (especially clinic-based PCPs) were not adequately prepared for the influenza pandemic.

However, rectal swabs from pigs in the medium biosecurity (MB) and high biosecurity (HB) groups were negative during the 10 consecutive days of movements and remained negative through 24 days post movement (dpm) when the first trial was terminated. Viral RNA was detected at 1 dpm through 3 dpm from the personal protective equipment (PPE) of LB personnel. In addition, at 1 dpm, 2 hair/face swabs from MB personnel were positive; however, transmission of virus was not detected. All swabs of fomite from the HB study personnel were negative. Conclusions: These results indicate that indirect PEDV transmission through contaminated PPE occurs rapidly (within 24 h) under modeled conditions. Biosecurity procedures such as changing PPE, washing exposed skin areas, or taking a shower are recommended for pig production systems and appear to be an effective option for lowering the risk of PEDV transmission between groups of pigs.",41.86606554946515,15.974314017757022

During the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, many health care workers contracted Ebola, some fatally. However, no members of the Chinese Anti-Ebola medical team, deployed to provide vital medical care in Liberia were infected. This study aims to understand how this zero infection rate was achieved. Methods: Data was collected through 15 in-depth interviews with participants from the People's Liberation Army of China medical team which operated the Chinese Ebola Treatment Center from October 2014 to January 2015 in Liberia. Data were analysed using systematic framework analysis. Results: This study found numerous bio-psycho-socio-behavioural risk factors that directly or indirectly threatened the health of the medical team working in the Chinese Ebola Treatment Center. These factors included social and emotional stress caused by: (1) the disruption of family and social networks; (2) adapting to a different culture; (3) and anxiety over social and political unrest in Liberia. Exposure to Ebola from patients and local co-workers, and the incorrect use of personal protective equipment due to fatigue was another major risk factor. Other risk factors identified were: (1) shortage of supplies; (2) lack of trained health personnel; (3) exposure to contaminated food and water; (4) and long working hours. Comprehensive efforts were taken throughout the mission to mitigate these factors. Every measure was taken to prevent the medical team's exposure to the Ebola virus, and to provide the medical team with safe, comfortable working and living environments. There were many challenges in maintaining the health safety of the team, such as the limited capability of the emergency command system (the standardized approach to the command, control, and coordination of an emergency response), and the lack of comprehensive international protocols for dealing with emerging infectious disease pandemics. Conclusions: The comprehensive and multidisciplinary measures employed to protect the health of the medical team proved successful even in Liberia's resource-limited setting. The global health community can learn valuable lessons from this experience which could improve the safety of health care workers in future emergencies. These lessons include: establishing capable command systems; implementing effective coordination mechanisms; providing adequate equipment; providing training for medical teams; investing in the development of global health professionals; and improving research on ways to protect health care workers.",37.86186563208578,15.34391191335725

The majority of participants believed that providing care for local patients, and training local HCWs substantially increased their risk of infection. Participants stated that there was incorrect use of PPE due to fatigue, further increasing the risk of infection. The medical team hired local HCWs to help in the ETC. Six participants thought that working alongside local HCWs would increase their risk of infection, since local HCWs might carry infectious diseases into the ETC after contact with infected families or community members. However, one participant argued that local HCWs might reduce the risk of infection because they could communicate with patients easily, help the CMMT to communicate with patients, and ensure adherence to medical protocols.

Investigations of the initial phase of this epidemic, as well as previous outbreaks, have highlighted the potential role of within-hospital transmission before or shortly after Ebola is identified as the causative agent [37, 38] . Here we found that hospitalisation, defined broadly as anything from visiting a clinic to admission to an ETU, reduced transmission risk, showing that prompt hospitalisation may be an effective intervention as long as appropriate control measures are applied. However, hospitalisation did not eliminate transmission risk, indicating that improvements in infection control are needed in many health care settings. It should be noted that the meaning of date of hospitalisation may be different among cases, depending on how many and which types of facilities they visited in the course of their disease, and furthermore that there is potential for misclassification in the recording or interpretation of information on hospitalisation. In particular, while the health care facility of first admission was commonly reported, patient transfers to other facilities may not have always been recorded. Thus, there may be ambiguity about the type of health care facility a case was in at a particular time. Such missing information reduces our ability to resolve differences between types of facilities in their effectiveness at implementing case isolation, which could lead to underestimation of differences between facility types in isolation effectiveness. However, our results are broadly consistent with analyses of the outbreak in Conakry [29] . Half of reported non-funeral exposures where the matched contact was eventually hospitalised occurred after the reported date of hospitalisation. These results underscore the importance of further improving infection control in all health care facilities, but particularly in non-ETUs. However, in contexts where hospital bed capacity is insufficient or infection control in health care settings is imperfect, greater consideration might be given to measures to reduce within-family exposure-for example, via education and/or providing a home protection kit with hand disinfectant, protective equipment, and clear guidance for those caring for sick family members.",53.71461503512951,20.723631231810174

The concept and definition of aerosols is also discussed, as is the concept of large droplet transmission, and airborne transmission which is meant by most authors to be synonymous with aerosol transmission, although some use the term to mean either large droplet or aerosol transmission. However, these terms are often used confusingly when discussing specific infection control interventions for individual pathogens that are accepted to be mostly transmitted by the airborne (aerosol) route (e.g. tuberculosis, measles and chickenpox). It is therefore important to clarify such terminology, where a particular intervention, like the type of personal protective equipment (PPE) to be used, is deemed adequate to intervene for this potential mode of transmission, i.e. at an N95 rather than surgical mask level requirement. With this in mind, this review considers the commonly used term of 'aerosol transmission' in the context of some infectious agents that are well-recognized to be transmissible via the airborne route.

Official recommendations emphasize that screening is an opportunity for 'risk communication' in which travellers can be instructed how to proceed responsibly if symptoms develop at the destination (World Health Organization, 2020d). Alongside increased general surveillance/alertness in healthcare settings, such measures could help reduce the risk of local transmission and superspreading, but their quantitative effectiveness is unknown. Once limited local transmission has begun, arrival screening could still have merit as a means to restrict the number of parallel chains of transmission present in a country. Once there is generalized spread which has outpaced contact tracing, departure screening to prevent export of cases to new areas will be more valuable than arrival screening to identify additional incoming cases. Altogether, screening should not be viewed as a definitive barrier to case importation, but used alongside on-the-ground response strategies that help reduce the probability that any single imported case spreads to cause a self-sustaining local epidemic.

In general, numerous LPMs are widely distributed in urban areas that might facilitate avian-tohuman and subsequent human-to-human transmissions of novel influenza viruses, unlike poultry farms, which are more frequently located in rural areas. Such geographical differences between the urban and rural areas affected the awareness of AI in Turkey [37] and in China [38] . In the past, closure of LPMs has been implemented after the confirmation of severe or fatal human cases of H5N1 and H7N9 [39] . However, the virus may still reemerge after temporary closure. Therefore, market shutdown is not the most effective long-term measure, especially as the stakeholders are not likely to support it. The most likely approaches are: (1) weekly and monthly off-market days (such as Mondays and Chinese festivals in Taiwan) for cleaning and interrupting viral transmission, (2) banning the slaughter of live poultry, (3) practicing PPM, and (4) receiving influenza vaccines. In fact, the LPMWs with lower education in this study did adopt the latter three prevention measures less frequently. On the other hand, more highly educated participants believed that the outbreaks of AI in China would affect Taiwanese, and thus supported the ban on slaughtering live poultry in markets. A ban on slaughtering live poultry in the market, first proposed in Hong Kong [40] , has been implemented by the revised food commerce law [40] . In 2008, a woman in Beijing without prior contact with live birds was infected with AIVs after purchasing live poultry in a traditional market [12] , implying that LPMs are one of the sources of AIV infection. Furthermore, most of the severe human H7N9 cases in 2013-2014 also acquired their infections through contact with poultry or visiting wet markets [10] . Although the Taiwan government initiated the implementation of the policy to ban slaughtering live poultry in LPMs on April 1st, 2008 (e.g., after the H5N2 outbreak in Kaohsiung with controversial answers on viral pathogenicity), this was postponed, then reinstated on May 17, 2013 due to the occurrence of the first imported H7N9 case in Taiwan. In this study, lesseducated, high-risk groups had lower RAP. Therefore, enhancing surveillance of AIVs in avian hosts as well as humans in LPMs [26] , timely epidemiologic data analyses and prompt risk communication with evidencebased data support, focusing on changing the minds of lower-educated, high-risk groups, will be very helpful to quickly control novel influenza viruses, thus minimizing the occurrence of potential pandemics. The data within the percentages of community residents related to the sources or channels of information served as the reference group in this PPMs are particularly useful for reducing the risk of acquiring or transmitting emerging respiratory infections before the availability of commercial vaccines [41] . Education is the most cost-effective approach to deliver the correct knowledge and ways to prevent AIV infections and future epidemics. Highly educated persons who had better access to the information on AI from television, newspapers and the internet in this study had higher risk perception of AI, similar to the findings in China [16] and Afghanistan [42] . Most importantly, strict compliance with personal protective equipment (PPE) requirements must be reinforced to manage the outbreaks of AI, regardless of the pathogenicity of the virus [43, 44] . Incomplete use of PPE was also associated with conjunctivitis and influenza-like illness after the 2006 outbreak of LPAI H7N3 in Norfolk, England [21] . Generally, compliance with most PPE requirements tends to be suboptimal for the highly exposed groups [45] . Similarly, Taiwanese LPM-workers generally feel that wearing PPE is uncomfortable, and they have not gotten used to it. The low risk perception accompanying such poor PPE usage needs to be guided with solid examples to finally achieve behavioral change. Our study subjects who had higher risk perception of AI and who were more aware about the government's new policy had more motivation to use self-protection for preventing AIVs. Therefore, it is necessary to improve public awareness about the government's prevention policy and also educate different target groups with various approaches, based on educational levels, job duties, and residential areas.",33.35910003512601,13.339912590338042

Although the methodologies and results of the included studies differed, overall the evidence from the 10 included studies was of very low quality according to GRADE. In general, limitations in design and imprecision are issues in all studies that led to the very low rating. Furthermore, all of the included studies evaluated the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV and may not be generalizable to other acute respiratory pathogens, including influenza virus. As well, with the exception of tracheal intubation, there were a limited number of studies identified for each procedure, which limits the confidence for an individual observation. In addition, there is difficulty in identifying the specific part of a given procedure, which may be complex and involve several manoeuvres that impart the greatest risk of transmission. There are likely differences which exist related to the degree of infectious aerosol generation associated with various procedures and the actual risk of transmission. We also acknowledge that the findings presented may have been influenced by direct and indirect contact transmission even though this route of transmission should have been minimized with the use of personal protective equipment. We were unable to exclude noncompliance with the use masks, gloves, and gowns during the procedures which were performed, but consider it unlikely that health care workers would use no precautions.

Four studies included less than 100 patients. The number of HCWs included in the studies, who were exposed to the aerosol generating procedures, was small, ranging from 2 to 120. The sample size of the studies could potentially bias estimates of effects and limit statistical power. Related to this, the number of events was small in a number of studies. As noted in the results, for a number of potentially aerosol generating procedures (bronchoscopy, [27] non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, [26] manipulation of BiPAP mask, [27] and insertion of nasogastric tube [27] ) point estimates suggested an increased risk, but confidence intervals were wide and were not statistically significant. Not all HCWs caring for SARS patients were included in the studies, since there were some HCWs who refused to participate in the interview process as outlined in the individual studies. HCWs' recall might be imperfect, thus generating recall bias if some were more complete or more accurate than others.

In contrast, in the more sparsely populated rural settings, such as the Southern region, controlled outbreaks are likely when case ascertainment is high even in the absence of any behavioural interventions (see Fig  11) . In these rural settings, behavioural interventions can greatly increase the likelihood of controlling outbreaks even when case ascertainment is very low, and the synergistic effects of reducing transmission in the community and also from dead bodies can avoid uncontrolled outbreaks altogether.

In fact, it is almost an annual occurrence during the calving season, despite ever-increasing hygiene measures and student education about zoonoses. Anecdotally, the attitude of veterinary students at Massey University towards zoonotic infections is changing. Previously, being affected by enteritis was seen almost as a rite of passage, whereas now students are more concerned with preventing infection. A variety of strategies have been implemented to reduce human cases of cryptosporidiosis including: demonstrations in class on the correct use of personal protective equipment (PPE), provision of case studies and personal stories of students who have experienced cryptosporidiosis which emphasise how unpleasant the symptoms can be, increased signage in the large animal hospital about the risks of zoonotic disease, more hand and boot-washing stations provided in the large animal hospital, and more hand sanitisers mounted within the veterinary teaching hospital. Most recently, gates have been installed in the farm animal corridor of the large animal hospital to further limit access to the patients, and sets of boots and waterproof bib-over-trousers that stay within the large animal hospital have been provided rather than students using their own PPE and attempting to disinfect it. All of these strategies can be implemented to minimise zoonotic transmission throughout veterinary education but are particularly important in the control of cryptosporidiosis due to the low infectious dose, the resistance of oocysts in the environment, and the risk of indirect contact with infectious material. The provision of keyboard covers in student computer laboratories has also been considered as a means of limiting transmission, but these would need to be regularly wiped down, as would door handles and other surfaces, so most effort has gone into preventing the movement of infectious material from the large animal hospital. Another approach to safeguard student health would be to limit the involvement that veterinary students have with sick calves, however, this approach must be balanced with the value of clinical experience in producing practice-ready new graduates.",44.21135569099245,16.837031351221402

These additional interventions include the use of household protection kits, designed to reduce transmission in the community; improvements in infection control protocols in health care settings that reduce transmission among health care workers; and the impact of rapid diagnostic kits in Ebola treatment centers, which reduce the time to isolation for infectious individuals seeking hospitalization. Increasing awareness and education of the population about the disease could have also yielded further reductions in case incidence by reducing the size of the at-risk susceptible population (Fig. 3) [27] . Nevertheless, some of these effects could have been indirectly captured implicitly by the time-dependent safe burial rate parameter in their model. Importantly, prior models of EVD transmission [23, 28, 29] and the model by Drake and colleagues have not incorporated spatial heterogeneity in the transmission dynamics. In particular, the EVD epidemic in West Africa can be characterized as a set of asynchronous local (e.g., Figure 5 . Epidemic growth in two populations characterized by two different underlying contact networks. Random mixing leads to a rapidly disseminating infectious disease that spreads exponentially fast. By contrast, disease spread is significantly slower in a highly clustered contact network because the contacts of recently infected individuals are likely to be already infected by other infectious individuals. The contact networks are shown for illustration and are composed of a set of nodes (individuals) denoted by red dots while blue lines (links) between nodes denote static contacts.

The model explicitly accounts for the hospitalization rate-the fraction of infectious individuals in the community seeking hospitalization (estimated in this study at 60%). However, the number of effectively isolated infectious individuals is constrained by the number of available beds in treatment centers-which are assumed in this study to operate at twice their regular capacity. It is important to note that the number of beds available to treat EVD patients was severely limited in Liberia prior to mid August 2014 ( Fig. 1 in [26] ). Moreover, the rate of safe burials that reduces the force of infection is included in their model as an increasing function of time. The model was calibrated by tuning six parameters to fit the trajectories of the number of reported cases in the community and among health care workers during the period 4 July to 2 September 2014 for a total of four infection generations during which the effective reproduction number was estimated to decline on average from about 2.8 to 1.4.

This suggests the benefit of risk communication messages that strategically heighten and then utilise public concern when a pandemic has or is likely to occur to increase compliance behaviours. For example, risk communication strategies could selectively target sub-population for whom risk beliefs are particularly low; in the current study these groups are urban populations and populations with good self-rated health. However, some authors have cautioned that increasing the risk perception of the population through such strategies risks societal estrangement and may frighten health care workers, first responders, and those who would have contact with the public in the event of a pandemic [26] . When consensus is reached regarding the optimal level of risk perception required for specific populations to elicit appropriate protective responses, the results of this study may be useful to guide which population groups these artificially inflating or deflating risk communication messages should be targeted.",23.60145490108225,10.793087063813235

While the occupational setting for wildlife work inevitably involves some risks that are difficult to control, such as the behavior or disease status of captured wild animals, possible applications of the hierarchy of controls model to wildlife surveillance work could include modifications in equipment or practices to decrease risks of animal bites or scratches during animal capture and/or restraint (Slate et al. 2009 ). Additionally, modifications to PPE designed for a laboratory environment may be necessary for those working in the field and could be a helpful measure to ensure effectiveness and compliance for wildlife workers. The recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa is a prime example of this, where health care workers reported difficulty wearing the recommended PPE for over 40 min due to heat and humidity, which ultimately led to an effort by a number of agencies to develop improved PPE for use in the field (NIOSH 2015) .

They can be used to prevent transmission in both health-care and non-health-care settings, regardless of whether infection is suspected or confirmed.

One of the main risks of contamination is contact with an infected patient, repatriated with the disease, be it already declared or not. Healthcare workers are particularly at risk of contamination [11] . To date, no aerosol transmission has been documented, nor transmission following healthy skin exposure. After contamination through human liquids (including saliva, blood, vomit, urine, etc.), the virus spreads in the organism and replicates itself at a high rate [1] . This leads to virus particles in the blood that can be as high as 10 7 plaque-forming unit/mL. The risk of transmission is very high, particularly for the medical teams. One of the goals when receiving an infected patient is to guarantee the best level of protection for healthcare providers. The risk of contamination for laboratory personnel is low thanks to laboratory procedures. To date, 4 accidents during laboratory work with Ebola virus have been reported: 1 case was fatal, 1 case was symptomatic and survived and in 2 cases there was no evidence that the accident resulted in infection and the patients survived [11] . Thus, one can assume the same level of risk for health team members.

[2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Minimizing the risk of disease acquisition is based on 6 key recommended practices: (1) proper training of HCP at initiation of health care practice and annually (eg, infection control practices and sharp injury prevention); (2) immunity to vaccine-preventable diseases 2,6,8-11 ; (3) evaluation of HCP who were exposed to communicable diseases for receipt of PEP 2,12-14 ; (4) adherence to standard precautions when providing patient care, 15 especially the performance of appropriate hand hygiene before and after patient care [16] [17] [18] ; (5) rapid institution of appropriate isolation precautions for patients with a known or suspected communicable disease 15,19,20 ; and (6) proper use of personal protective equipment, such as masks, N95 respirators, eye protection, and gowns when caring for patients with potentially communicable diseases. 15, 21 Prevention of laboratory-acquired infection requires adherence to recommended administrative protocols (eg, no eating, drinking, or smoking in areas where microbiologic or pathologic samples are processed), engineering controls (eg, containment hoods), personal protective equipment (eg, N95 masks when culturing Mycobacterium tuberculosis), and appropriate immunizations. 22, 23 DEFINITIONS HCP refers to all paid and unpaid persons providing services in health care settings who have the potential for exposure to patients and/or infectious materials, including body substances, contaminated medical supplies and equipment, contaminated environmental surfaces, or contaminated air. These HCP may include but are not limited to those listed in Box 1. In general, HCP who have regular or frequent contact with patients, body fluids, or specimens have a higher risk of acquiring or transmitting infections than do HCP who have only brief contact with patients and their environment (eg, beds, food trays, and medical equipment). All HCP who work within the confines of a health care facility, however should be covered by the occupational health service (OHS) and receive appropriate screening and pre-exposure prophylaxis even if they do not provide direct patient care because they frequently interact with HCP providing direct care and are, therefore, at risk for acquiring or transmitting infectious pathogens.",43.36279498893848,16.385983572906163

The aim of this act was to reduce occupational hazards in the workplace and prevent work-related morbidity and mortality. This Act created administrative offices at the central administration, regional provincial administration, and local government administration levels. The responsibility of these varied levels of administrators was to promote safe and hygienic working conditions in order to prevent physical and mental work-related conditions. It also required healthcare facilities to provide proper personal protective equipment (PPE) to all employees. This Act also identified the obligation of the employee to cooperate with the employer in the promotion and implementation of occupational health and safety regulations. 10 According to the Occupational Safety, Health, and Environment Act, hospitals in Thailand must implement occupational health and safety programs for HCWs. However, the Bureau of Occupational and Environmental Diseases in the Ministry of Public Health has also developed a manual for risk assessment and management for health workers in hospital settings. 11 This manual identifies occupational hazards including psychosocial hazards and physical hazards. It recommends activities to improve working conditions and to prevent the hazards and their adverse outcomes. The recommended activities include annual walkthrough surveys, environmental risk assessment and management, and surveillance for occupational hazards, vaccinations, occupational diseases, and injuries. The manual emphasizes health promotion in the workplace, ongoing worker training programs, and accessibility to PPE. 11 Although occupational health and safety regulations in Thailand cover all hospitals, the financial resources and trained personnel allotted to health and safety in the hospital vary significantly among Thai hospitals. 12 In the past, compliance with Thai laws and regulations was not always required in government-sponsored organizations. Since the Occupational Safety, Health, and Environment Act of 2011, both private and government supported hospitals are required to follow regulations designed to prevent occupational illness and injuries. However, due to a lack of resources, there are different levels of compliance with the legislative mandate. Most hospitals do not have safety officers.

The few cases which have occurred are characterized by non-compliance with appropriate precautions, including use of eyewear, or uncontrolled situations characterized by multiple opportunities for extensive contamination and staff exposure prior to the intubation event. Preliminary analysis of transmission in emergency rooms and other hospital areas does support a concern that any procedure which creates aerosols -high flow nasal oxygen, medications, noninvasive positive pressure respiration -facilitates transmission. Not surprisingly, health care workers with the greatest risk of infection acquisition before personal protective equipment was used routinely were those with greatest exposure to patients in time and proximity. 11 The most widely publicized Toronto transmission episode, where most cases of health care work illness acquisition despite apparent infection control precautions occurred, 5 provided opportunities for transmission over several hours, and both intubators and non-intubators became infected.

The health care environment differs greatly from many other settings that require the usage of respiratory protection. The next generation of devices used should thoroughly reflect this difference. For example, the filtered particulates in health care settings are mainly infectious biologic aerosols, rather than nonbiologic aerosols. These biologic aerosols present unique challenges to ensure that the respirator does not contribute to disease transmission. Furthermore, current methods of testing respirators may not represent how respirators are used in health care. For example, a controlled environment, such as a hospital, does not have the levels of airborne dust and particulate matter typically seen at a manufacturing plant. Any respirator designed specifically for HCP should focus on diminishing infection from exposures to biologic hazards as its primary goal and focus less on particulate load capacity or other enhancing features, such as exhalation valves that could potentially contaminate the surgical field and are not compatible with many health care settings. With approximately 13 million HCP in the United States, many of whom will need to use respiratory protection during public health emergencies, the market for health care respirators should be large enough to warrant devices meeting their unique needs.",39.97323432501433,16.72990007229345

However, on the surface of rubber gloves, the virus can maintain its infectivity for the relatively long time of 24 h. Accordingly, healthcare professionals should renew/replace personal protective equipment if they have been exposed to droplets from patients with influenza [26, 27] ; however, in practice, personal protective equipment cannot be replaced for each patient. For example, during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) panademic, personal protective equipment could not be replaced for each patient for the simple reason that there was a shortage in the supply of such equipment and clothing [28] . However, our findings suggest that caring for patients without an renewal or replacement of protective equipment may be responsible for cross-infection of influenza virus and, therefore, that a frequent replacement of personal protective equipment for each patient would prevent cross-infection. Since we have shown that the influenza virus maintains infectivity for at least 8 h on almost all surfaces, the disposal of personal protective equipment to prevent cross-infection after possible exposure to influenza virus is an important healthcare procedure. This study has a number of limitations. First, the experiments were only conducted at one specific temperature and 55% relative humidity. This experiment should be conducted under various conditions of low temperatures and low humidity, such as those found during winter when an influenza pandemic is likely to break out. The second limitation is that our experiments did not assess the time course of changes in virus infectivity between 8 and 24 h. Therefore, the possibility cannot be ruled out that infectivity was lost in \24 h. The third limitation is that our experiments used a laboratorygrown influenza A virus, while a previous study conducted to assess the infectivity of the influenza virus showed that influenza virus mixed with human mucus maintained its infectivity on the surfaces of banknotes up to 17 days [29] . On the basis of this latter finding, we hope to investigate the infectivity of dried influenza virus or droplets mixed with mucus on the surfaces of personal protective equipment. Since the amount of virus in droplets emitted from patients with influenza has not been reported in the literature, it is unknown whether the amount of virus in such droplets is equivalent to that in the virus solution used in our experiments. This issue remains to be elucidated in future studies. Further studies involving a larger number of samples are required to assess the validity of this study.",50.49360373258341,19.855976072191314

Thus, generation of aerosol should be reduced to a minimum during the care of patients with SARS so that transmission of the Coronavirus can be prevented. The size of aerosols considered to carry particles in a hospital environment is 0.3 to 0.5 µm, 28 and filters used to trap particles in the plume generated by laser therapy are 0.22 µm. 29 For health care workers taking care of patients with SARS, one piece of personal protective equipment is the N95 mask, which will filter 95% of particles 0.1 to 0.3 µm. 30 The effort to reduce the spread of disease through direct contact or droplet contact in hospitals managing these patients involved generating, implementing, and enforcing a series of guidelines. 31 These included the identification and reporting of affected patients, dissemination of information to the public, enforcement of infection control measures, development of diagnostic tests, evaluation of therapeutic regimens, and the coordination of clinical services. These measures are primarily directed at tracing and isolating the contact of patients as soon as possible before they spread the virus further. 32 The various measures used to prevent transmission of infection by direct contact include the use of gloves, surgical masks, gowns, goggles, N95 masks, face shields, and total body coverings such as Barrier Man suits.

Simulation models for HAIs have also become more complex in terms of the settings being modeled. Earlier studies generally modeled a single ward (usually an ICU) or a simplified hospital lacking of any further ward structure whereas more recent studies were likely to incorporate different types of wards (ICUs and general wards), as well as consider the transmission across health facilities (eg, mainly between hospitals), and the community. Future studies could investigate interactions with LTCFs, other types of health care facilities, and the community to provide a more realistic estimate of HAI incidence and prevalence, and the effectiveness of IPC policies. Pediatric settings were rarely considered although pediatric patients have higher rates of viral lower respiratory tract infections and bloodstream infections than adults, especially those younger than 2 years of age and those demanding care in neonatal ICUs and pediatric ICUs. 95 As the most popular transmission routes of infections in health care settings are via the transiently colonized hands of HCWs and/or contaminated medical equipment and the environment, modeling interactions between patient and HCW has dominated this field of research, followed by the environmental reservoir for transmission although to a much lesser extent. Simulation modeling studies have hardly considered direct HCW-to-HCW contact or interactions between visitors/caregivers and patients. Visitors and/or family caregivers can play a very important role in infection transmission in a health facility, especially in settings such as pediatric or geriatric health facilities where patients often need extra care. In many cultures including Asian countries and LMICs, having visitors and caregivers on a regular basis is common practice and sometimes encouraged owing to a considerable shortage of staff and a need to reduce medical costs to patients. 56 Because visitors and caregivers are also more mobile than patients, they are both highly susceptible to contracting infections and potentially able to transmit pathogens to various locations inside and outside as the hospital. 78 When to use which simulation modeling methodology",42.1152779776381,15.459827751379141

For example, DHCP routinely wear gloves, protective eyewear, masks and gowns because they frequently are exposed to blood and blood-contaminated saliva during dental procedures, and OSHA requires them to wear personal protective equipment (PPE).

Affected patients suffer from severe, copious diarrhoea and vomiting, with infectious virus particles in all body fluids. A significant minority of patients suffer gastrointestinal haemorrhage. Most patients are coagulopathic, oozing from venepuncture or vascular access sites. Early in the disease, patients have very high levels of virus in their blood, sweat, and urine. Patients often develop delirium, probably because of encephalitis, and are restless, pulling at lines and tubes or even attempting to wander off. There is a major risk of cross-infection, which means that patients suspected of having Ebola must be kept apart to reduce the risk of those whose symptoms are a result of malaria or gastroenteritis becoming infected in the process of being screened. 3 4 Contact with the patient risks transmission of the disease, meaning that every interaction, no matter how trivial, requires a laborious process of donning personal protective equipment followed by an even more involved decontamination drill. Needle stick injuries are an ever-present and very real risk, owing to the limited tactile feedback and reduced visibility provided by even the best protective equipment. Even without any recognized breach of personal protective equipment or needle stick injury, some clinicians contracted Ebola. 5 In addition to the fear and stigma associated with Ebola in the West African population, the standard of care provided in West Africa has been very variable, affected by the low number of staff available in the early stages of the outbreak, but also by the imperative to protect staff from infection, sometimes at the risk of not providing effective treatment to patients. Some treatment centres gave i.v. fluids to only a very small proportion of patients because of a policy of reducing the risk from needle sticks by not cannulating patients, instead relying only on oral rehydration solution, although this may have changed as more staff became available. 6 This strategy is problematic in patients who are profoundly dehydrated, hypokalaemic, and often unable to take any oral fluids for many days because of severe nausea and vomiting. 7 There were suggestions that it should be possible to provide much better treatment, 8 and most of the European, National Health Service (NHS), and military clinicians I helped to train felt that not to carry out basic laboratory tests and provide i.v. fluid and electrolyte replacement was unacceptable.

Would intensive care treatment offer any benefit to patients with Ebola infection? At the time of a UK national policy meeting in late 2014, many felt that interventions such as mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy would pose a risk to staff without making any difference to the patient's eventual death. There were a few dissenting opinions, including those expressed by staff at the Royal Free Hospital. Not long after the UK meeting, a report was published of successful ventilation and dialysis of a patient in the USA, suggesting that the policy of not offering advanced treatment in the UK was unnecessarily nihilistic. 11 On this background, one of the biggest worries for doctors, nurses, and other workers travelling to assist in West Africa was whether we would be repatriated to the UK if we contracted the disease we were treating. It was clear that although in our tented facility in the jungle south of Freetown we were able to provide a higher level of care than that available elsewhere in Sierra Leone, we did not have the equipment for respiratory or renal support. 12 One of the factors in whether health-care workers volunteer is probably how they think they will be treated if they develop an infection that has a 70% patient fatality rate in Africa but a 95% survival rate in Europe or the USA. One could argue on ethical grounds that volunteers who were encouraged to travel to West Africa by the NHS to assist in the epidemic should be supported to the full extent possible by the UK, including evacuation for care in a specialist unit. By the end of the outbreak, two UK civilian nurses and one military nurse had contracted Ebola infection in the course of their work.

The SARS epidemic increased the profile of IC and OH and directed public attention to infectious disease transmission in healthcare facilities. Protection from infectious diseases was put 'under the spotlight', and HCWs became more motivated to request advice on appropriate use of personal protective equipment and isolation policies. Subsequent inquiries that identified gaps in IC and OH resources and further refinement of policies and procedures post-SARS should have improved the status quo. 18e21 It was hypothesised by the investigators that three years after the SARS outbreak, IC and OH programmes would be well-resourced and no differences would be found between resources available for these programmes in selected Toronto facilities compared with those in the GVR. The results of this study do not support this hypothesis. IC and OH resources, in the GVR in particular, had fewer staff than those in Toronto. On average, British Columbia hospitals had approximately half the IC staff available when compared with the Toronto hospitals that housed SARS patients and far below the benchmarks set by SENIC and the Public Health Agency of Canada. 4, 22 Unfortunately there has been no benchmark setting for OH resources in Canadian hospitals. This study found a significant difference in the OH resources available in the Ontario hospitals surveyed as compared to the British Columbia hospitals. Three times as many occupational health nurses were found in Ontario hospitals. The reasons for this large difference are unknown but this is an area where further investigation is needed, particularly as several studies have shown the costeffectiveness of injury prevention programmes and employee education. 23 Personal protective equipment was generally available at all facilities, but it was noted during the independent observational assessment that protective eyewear was not readily available to staff members in the majority of clinical areas in GVR hospitals surveyed. This is a concern as the use of protective eyewear is recommended as part of the personal protective equipment that should be donned when providing care to patients with a communicable disease capable of being transmitted by droplets or during procedures where there is a generation of aerosolised droplets. The routine use of eye protection may not have been adopted into the routine practice of HCWs in British Columbia as it has been in Ontario. During the SARS outbreak in 2003, IC directives included the use of eye protection as part of the personal protective equipment to be worn during providing care to a patient with febrile respiratory illness. In British Columbia, use of protective eyewear was recommended but, because only four SARS cases occurred, HCWs may not be aware of the recommendations. As was noted in the Results section, even though other personal protective equipment (gloves, gowns and respirators) are available, there is no indication that there is compliance with their use among HCWs or if they are used correctly.

Beginning with the recognition of the first SARS case, the Taiwan Department of Health (DOH) formed a SARS advisory committee and implemented a framework for SARS control, including isolation of suspected and probable SARS patients, use of personal protective equipment for health care workers and visitors, and quarantine of contacts of known SARS patients [3] . During the period from March 14 to April 21, 2003 , only 28 probable SARS cases were reported. In early April, the WHO changed Taiwan's designation from an ""affected area"" to an ""area with limited local transmission"", as a result of Taiwan's success in SARS control during this period. However, on April 22, 2003, the Taiwan DOH was notified of seven cases of SARS among health care workers at a large municipal hospital in Taipei. Beginning in mid-April, unrecognized cases of SARS led to a large nosocomial cluster and subsequent SARS-associated transmission to other hospitals and community settings [2] . In response to the growing SARS epidemic, additional measures were taken to limit nosocomial and community transmission of SARS, including more widespread use of quarantine, building negativepressure isolation rooms, aggressive airport and border surveillance, and intensive infection-control training for health care workers. As of July 9, 2003, a total of 671 probable SARS cases had been reported in Taiwan.

Guidelines reported in 2007 regarding the prevention of infectious agent transmission in healthcare settings, discuss transmission-based precautions dependent upon the specific disease, as well as type and duration of precautions recommended for selected infections (Siegel et al. 2007 ). If the virus can be transmitted through bodily fluids, healthcare workers have to be able to assess the risk of exposure by considering the injury type, the bodily fluid involved, the risk for transmission of blood-borne viruses and then test the source patient to determine if blood-borne viruses are present. Although these precautions were recommended to reduce the risk of exposure to blood-borne diseases for healthcare workers, these practices can be applied to prevent exposure in any occupational environment that poses a risk. Exposure Control Plans also need to be executed to ensure the workers have accurate information regarding potential exposures. CDC has also implemented engineering controls and personal protective equipment resources to help reduce exposure to blood-borne infectious diseases, such as viral hepatitis and HIV (CDC 2016b). HIV is transmitted by exposure to infected bodily fluids and is diagnosed through serological testing, as well as detection of the virus through RT-PCR assays. The CDC recommends that all individuals in a healthcare setting aged 13-64 years be tested for HIV, regardless of the exposure risk (Panneer et al. 2014) . One review reported 57 documented cases of HIV infections transmitted in an United States healthcare environment after having a negative serology at the time of assumed exposure (Mohebati et al. 2010) . HIV is a lentivirus, a subgroup of retroviruses, characterized by long incubation periods. Lentiviruses can integrate large amounts of viral RNA into the DNA of host cells and as a result, lentiviral vectors have become an important research tool as a delivery system for gene therapy strategies. As previously mentioned, workers in biotechnological laboratories or healthcare environments that use these lentiviral vectors are also at risk of viral exposure (Howard et al. 2017) . Individuals who work in laboratories that conduct research on HIV are also susceptible to exposure; however, with the protective measures taken to limit exposure to contaminated blood and other bodily fluids, exposure to HIV has decreased over time, specifically in the United States. From 2005 to 2014, HIV infections in the United States have decreased approximately 19% (CDC 2016f). To reduce the risk of exposure, the CDC recommends following the 2007 guidelines for isolation precautions preventing transmission of infectious agents, such as HIV (Siegel et al. 2007) . Included in these recommendations are proper use of PPE, such as gloves, safety glasses, and gowns to reduce the risk of exposure. In 2013, an update of the United States Public Health Service guidelines for the management of occupational exposures to HIV was released and included recommendations for the management of healthcare workers who had been exposed to HIV (Kuhar et al. 2013) . Administration of antiretroviral drugs to reduce the replication of the virus is also effective following exposure to HIV.",43.15164294627459,18.0921778358569

The estimated R 0 (the number of secondary infections generated by a primary infection in a susceptible population) ranges from 0.42 to 1.5. If this number is less than 1, then transmission is guaranteed to fade away. If greater than 1, there is a risk of an epidemic; but if it is only a little over 1 (i.e. 1-1.5), then transmission may fade away anyway [15] . However, there are a number of caveats. Firstly, R 0 is difficult to estimate [15] . Secondly, coronaviruses rapidly adapt to new hosts and in the process may become more infectious. Thirdly, the existence of mild, perhaps unidentified, cases makes infection control measures less likely to be effective. Approximately 60 % of MERS cases may have been undiagnosed [8] . Fourthly, a significant epidemic will pose a major challenge to intensive care, owing to the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation and high requirement for renal replacement therapy. Non-invasive ventilation does not appear to be useful, except possibly to delay intubation, and may increase disease transmission and risk undue delay in intubation: four patients who received CPAP suffered six cardiac arrests [4]. As the mode of transmission is unknown implement airborne and contact precautions until proved unnecessary [11] . Personal protective equipment against airborne transmission includes a fit-tested FFP2 (or equivalent) face mask. Fit testing is time-consuming and should be carried out in advance of hospital admission of a patient with MERS as the delay between onset of symptoms and ICU admission [2] is very short. Visiting without full personal protective equipment has been associated with nosocomial transmission [11] and visitors should also be fit-tested. ",41.9646145345161,17.300054463196435

A number of difficulties were encountered during the early stages of the MERS-CoV infection outbreak. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention distributed MERS-CoV response guidelines based on those from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization. Unfortunately, the contents of these Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention documents were too general; those working in hospitals needed more detailed guidelines. Thus, the Korean Society for Infectious Disease, the Korean Society for Healthcare-Associated Infection Control and Prevention, and the Korean Association of Infection Control Nurses (KAICN) jointly released more detailed MERS-CoV infection control guidelines. However, each hospital's unique environment made the application of these guidelines complicated on an organization level. Accordingly, KAICN members who were ICNs sought answers to urgent questions about infection control using social networking services and built each individual hospital's manual using shared experiences and ideas. Based on these communication processes and the guidelines of the Korean Society for Infectious Disease, Korean Society for Healthcare-Associated Infection Control and Prevention, and KAICN, ICNs provided information on how to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) and determined the routes of access to the negative pressure rooms. Further, ICNs prepared hospital manuals addressing the screening and isolation of patients, hospital environment cleaning and disinfection, medical waste disposal, laundry management, specimen collection and delivery methods, patient transportation methods, patient admission and discharge, powered air purifying respirator management and cleaning, and the safe disposal of dead patients. Moreover, because standard, contact, and airborne precautions had to be applied to patients infected with MERS-CoV and patients suspected of infection, 11 the use of PPEs increased rapidly in hospitals, and the supply of N95 masks was insufficient. In addition to providing education on the proper methods of donning and doffing PPEs in hospitals, ICNs checked their institutions' PPE inventories and were involved in maintaining sufficient PPE quantities via contact with public health centers and suppliers. Although it was known that MERS-CoV had not undergone mutations that would have made it more transmissible, 7 its infectivity was still much stronger than assumed. Patients with confirmed MERS-CoV infection were isolated in negative pressure rooms, and the health care workers attending these patients accessed the rooms in protective whole-body suits (including a full-length gown, goggles, N95 mask, gloves, shoe covers, and other components) that were labeled ""Level D."" Because most of the health care workers had no experience using Level D PPEs, ICNs provided instruction on how to put on the PPEs, monitor the manner in which the health care workers donned and removed the PPEs, and provided guidance on how to remain free from infection during the donning and doffing processes. Furthermore, ICNs communicated with local public health centers about tasks related to patients with confirmed MERS-CoV, delivered the government's MERS-CoV-related guidelines to hospitals, and implemented the gathering of MERS-CoV infectionrelated data requested by the government.",33.95456293942274,12.7771524148942

Additional information and potentially frequent updates will be posted on that site. State and local health illnesses are almost always caused by known respiratory pathogens, emergency physicians should recognize the risk of novel pathogens and be familiar with current recommendations for evaluating patients who may be infected with emerging pathogens from specific geographic areas. This report of a new coronavirus (now referred to as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, or MERS-CoV) identified in patients in the United Kingdom after travel to the Arabian Peninsula illustrates some important points about identifying infections with novel pathogens and implementing infection control procedures when specific transmission risk may be unknown. The 3 confirmed cases demonstrate that the virus has the capability of human-to-human transmission and coinfection with another pathogen (influenza A). 1 Subsequent clusters of disease confirm that the novel coronavirus can spread from person to person, including from patients to health care workers. Although MERS-CoV has a different genetic sequence than the virus that caused SARS, the implications for emergency medicine are similar. 2 Health care providers, hospital administrators, and global health organizations learned many important lessons during the 2003 SARS outbreak. The subsequent improvement in infection control measures is especially important for the ED in the event of infectious outbreaks with new pathogens. Transmission in the health care setting to a large number of health care workers and other patients was a notable feature of the SARS coronavirus. The greatest risk of transmission was to individuals who had close contact with infected subjects and who were not properly trained in the use of protective equipment. 3 Exposure of health care providers to procedures that aerosolized droplets such as nebulizers, suctioning, and intubation was another source of virus transmission. 4 N95 respirators may offer protection to individuals involved in highrisk procedures. 5 CDC recommendations for respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette evolved during the SARS outbreak. These concepts have since been incorporated into CDC planning documents for SARS and pandemic influenza. Although basic precautions such as hand washing are intended for health care workers associated with direct patient contact, respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette applies to everyone in the hospital setting: providers, patients, and visitors. 6 This concept was developed in response to observations that visitors and patients without diagnoses were contributing to hospital transmission. 3 Recommendations included posted signs in different languages about containment of respiratory secretions, convenient hand sanitizers and tissue receptacles, and sitting at least 3 feet apart if coughing. Screening patients with respiratory symptoms for recent travel, placing a mask, and isolation from others in the waiting room/ ED are important for early detection and prevention. 7 For pathogens that emerge in specified geographic areas, risk assessment is based on where the organism is currently circulating, ie, within the local community, limited geographic areas, or not actively circulating anywhere in the world. 8 If",44.86282150127682,19.856562789900774

A case-control study done early in the outbreak found that N95 masks and hand washing after each patient contact were independently associated with a significantly decreased risk of infection, with adjusted odds ratios of 0.1 and 0.07, respectively (Teleman et al., 2004) . Contact with a patient's nasal secretions before infection control measures were implemented was independently associated with a 22-fold increased risk of infection. Enhanced personal protective measures were progressively instituted in tandem with growing understanding of this novel disease. From March 6, health care workers were employing N95 masks for personal protection when nursing the first index case and her contacts. By the end of week 2, personal protective equipment (PPE) against contact, droplet, and respiratory transmissions had been adopted by health care workers attending to patients in areas involved in SARS screening or treatment (ICU, emergency department, and communicable disease wards). On March 22, Singapore's second largest general hospital, Tan Tock Seng, was designated as the central referral, screening, and treatment center for SARS. The Communicable Disease Centre (which is part of Tan Tock Seng Hospital) is a specialist facility with a national role, staffed by experts in clinical infectious diseases, hospital infection control, and public health. By March 22, N95 masks were required when treating any patient in the hospital. On April 6, the wearing of gloves, gowns, and N95 masks was enforced during contact with all patients in the hospital, with visitors additionally advised for procedures with a risk of splashing. On April 25, goggles were made mandatory for all patient contact. Later, powered air purifying respirators for high-risk or aerosol-generating procedures were also required. With all of these measures in place, no further intra-hospital transmission to health care workers at Tan Tock Seng occurred after March 22.

The UK's response to the outbreak was overseen by the Department of Health, with expertise from Public Health England (PHE), the national Advisory Committee for Dangerous Pathogens (ACDP) and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). It was anticipated that the NHS could encounter a small number of UK HCWs infected with Ebola virus from overseas deployment, or infected travellers entering the UK. 2 Therefore, all acute receiving medical units were advised to plan for safe assessment of individuals returning from West Africa with a febrile illness. 3 There was considerable concern about what constituted the safest combination of PPE for healthcare staff to wear when assessing anyone with a possible diagnosis of EVD. Previous guidance issued by ACDP was based on expert opinion rather than a clear evidence base and did not define the specific ensemble to be used. The urgency for units to establish PPE protocols for frontline HCWs resulted in significant variance in PPE ensembles around the UK, based on local preferences and PPE availability. This issue was also identified in other countries, with variation encountered and differing guidance from bodies such as the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organisation. 4 As part of the legacy of the outbreak and to aid future preparedness, NHS England and PHE launched the High Consequence Infectious Disease (HCID) programme. One of its remits was to develop a unified, national PPE ensemble and donning/doffing protocol, for use when assessing patients with a possible HCID. ACDP Hazard Group 4 pathogens, such as EVD or another transmissible viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF), currently have a more stringent level of PPE advised than airborne pathogens such as Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) or avian influenza. 5, 6 However, the consequence of transmission of all are high, therefore our aim is to have a simple standardised PPE ensemble for all HCIDs. This novel approach will reduce variability in practice, aiming to reduce risk for all HCWs involved in the care of such patients.",44.2084398152679,17.794241924960158

When transmission-based PPE ensembles are not appropriate, HCP must recognize the transmission pathway of the disease and anticipate the exposures to select PPE. Because guidance for this process is extremely limited, we proposed a systematic, risk-based approach to the selection and evaluation of PPE ensembles to protect HCP against infectious diseases. Methods: The approach used in this study included the following 4 steps: (1) job hazard analysis, (2) infectious disease hazard analysis, (3) selection of PPE, and (4) evaluation of selected PPE. Selected PPE should protect HCP from exposure, be usable by HCP, and fit for purpose. Results: The approach was demonstrated for the activity of intubation of a patient with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus. As expected, the approach led to the selection of different ensembles of PPE for these 2 pathogens. Discussion: A systematic risk-based approach to the selection of PPE will help health care facilities and HCP select PPE when transmission-based precautions are not appropriate. Owing to the complexity of PPE ensemble selection and evaluation, a team with expertise in infectious diseases, occupational health, the health care activity, and related disciplines, such as human factors, should be engaged. Conclusions: Participation, documentation, and transparency are necessary to ensure the decisions can be communicated, critiqued, and understood by HCP.",60.245740897702426,23.363981833593584

The extent to which health care workers and institutions use these CDC recommended practices is uncertain. Methods: The study examined health care worker adherence to CDC recommended respiratory infection control practices in primary care clinics and emergency departments of 5 medical centers in King County, Washington, using a self-administered questionnaire. All clinical, allied, and administrative health care workers in study settings were invited to participate: 653 (53%) responded, and 630 were included. Results: The survey revealed important shortcomings in overall personal and institutional use of CDC recommended practices, including deficiencies in posted alerts, patient masking and separation, hand hygiene, personal protective equipment, staff training, and written procedures. Use of recommended measures was generally higher among nursing staff than medical practitioners. Conclusion: This study found significant gaps in adherence to CDC recommendations for the control of respiratory infections in ambulatory care clinical settings. Practical strategies are needed to identify and reduce barriers to implementation of recommended practices for control of respiratory infections. (Am J Infect Control 2008;36:268-75.)

For health care personnel working in close contact with infected patients, OSHA recommended the use of respiratory protection with an N95 or higher rated filter for most situations and higher levels of respiratory protection (supplied-air or powered air-purifying respirator) for procedures likely to generate bioaerosols. 3 During May 2009, the California Department of Public Health issued infection control guidance consistent with OSHA pandemic influenza preparedness recommendations for the use of respiratory protection, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention took a similar position in its July 2009 guidance. 4 On August 5, 2009, a new California occupational standard for the prevention of aerosol transmissible diseases (ATDs) became effective. 5 The new ATD standard, which had been under development for several years by the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA), was designed to make applicable public health guidance for worker protection measures legally enforceable in certain California workplaces where employees are at higher risk of infection, including acute care hospitals.",40.286678391120354,14.860068786241143

Readers should refer to these sources or other detailed reviews before engaging in studies involving macaques or developing institutional programs for the prevention and control of B virus among monkey handlers (Adams, 1995; Holmes et al., 1995) . Briefly, these recommendations emphasize the need for nonhuman primate handlers to conform fully with a written comprehensive personal protective equipment (PPE) program based on a thorough hazard assessment of all work procedures, potential routes of exposure, and potential adverse health outcomes (CDCP, 1998) . Approaches to hazard assessment and the development of occupational health and safety programs for research animal facilities have been reviewed extensively in other sources (Committee on Occupational Health and Safety in Research Animal Facilities, 1997). Protective clothing, including leather gloves or long-sleeved garments for hand and arm protection and protective goggles designe d for splash protection, along with a mask, are considered essential equipment to protect other mucous membranes from exposure to macaque secretions. The use of a face shield is insufficient as the sole method for protection against ocular exposure because droplet splashes to the head may drain into the eyes and infectious materials may enter via the gap along the margins of the shield. Importantly, personal eyeglasses are not considered PPE. The use of latex gloves alone for hand protection should be reserved for the handling of monkeys under full chemical restraint.

Indeed, the WHO identifies the health care workforce as 1 of 6 essential pillars of its health system strengthening initiative. 10 Bloodborne pathogens, which include viruses capable of causing hepatitis or HIV infections continue to threaten health workers in both high-resource areas and in LMICs. 17 In developing countries, 40% to 65% of hepatitis B (HBV) and C virus (HCV) infections in health care workers were attributed to percutaneous occupational exposure. In industrialized countries, such infections rates are lower, with 8% to 27% of infections for HCV attributable to occupation and around 10% for HBV. These lower rates are due to immunization and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). The range of HIV infections related to occupational exposure is estimated at 0.5% to 11%. 18 The likelihood of infection occurring after a percutaneous exposure has been observed to occur in a specific order with HBV infections (18%-30%) > HCV (1.8%) > HIV infections (0.3%) displaying generally a 10-fold difference in infection likelihood between each of these agents. [18] [19] [20] [21] Health workers are at risk for exposure to bloodborne pathogens while performing routine duties involving the use of ""sharps"" such as injection needles and from unsafe sharps disposal. The WHO has many resource guides to protect health workers from exposure to bloodborne viruses, the elements of which include: 1) the use of ""universal or standard"" precautions-a system of work practices and behaviors that minimizes exposure such as prohibition of manual needle recapping after use and safe sharps disposal; 2) availability of hepatitis B immunization for health workers; 3) use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and apparel such as use of gloves; and 4) post-exposure management (including prophylaxis, where appropriate) counseling, and support. 22 ",39.86088628681699,14.454424237601657

Important primary prevention efforts include vaccination, hand hygiene, and use of personal protective equipment. Protection efforts are hindered by a lack of data on modes of transmission of respiratory pathogens such as influenza, on effectiveness of protection provided by different types of equipment, and on how to ensure adherence to safe work practices. 1 Adherence to personal protective equipment generally has been identified as a long-standing problem in the health sector, and most proposed solutions have either had minimal impact or been unsustainable. Adherence to personal protective equipment (such as gloves) to prevent the spread of bloodborne disease is an area that has been well studied. 2 Adherence to facial protective equipment (FPE) (respirators, surgical masks, eye/face protection) to prevent the spread of communicable respiratory illness has only recently become the focus of research. Studies have shown that adherence to FPE was the most problematic of all types of personal protective equipment in health care. [3] [4] [5] Recent survey-based studies of adherence used contextual models that examined the environment within which the person operates. 6 A revised version of the PRECEDE (Predisposing, Reinforcing and Enabling Constructs in Educational Diagnosis and Evaluation) model, 7 Moore et al's theoretical framework 8 was used in a pilot study to examine nurse's adherence to recommended use of FPE and categorized factors influencing adherence as individual, environmental, and organizational. Results from the pilot study suggested that environmental and organizational factors were the most significant predictors of nurse's adherence. 9 We report the results of a larger and more comprehensive study of nurse's adherence to recommended use of FPE to identify determinants of adherence that can be used to implement interventions to improve adherence, reduce illness, and enhance the work and health of nurses.",60.20602431313461,23.732129659709265

Objectives: The purpose of this paper is to propose a PPE calculation system to help hospitals to decide their PPE stockpile. Methods: We searched influenza guidelines from a number of countries and research papers on protective devices and infectious diseases. The PPE calculation system included factors such as the influenza pandemic period, risk classification by health care workers (HCW) type, and the type and number of PPE for a HCW per day. Results: We concluded that 4 sets of PPE (N95 respirators, double gloves, gowns, and goggles) per day should be prepared for HCWs in a high-risk group. Similarly, 2 sets of appropriate PPE, depending on the risk level, are required for medium-and low-risk groups. In addition, 2 surgical masks are required for every worker and inpatient and 1 for each outpatient. The PPE stockpile should be prepared to cover at least an 8-week pandemic. Conclusion: Purchasing a PPE stockpile requires a sizable budget. The PPE calculation system in this paper will hopefully support hospitals in deciding their PPE stockpile.",60.1112237385055,23.16933587430906

Historically, development of PPE strategies has been driven by the paradigm that infectious agents are transmitted by 1 of 3 routes: contact, droplet, or airborne. However, the consideration of self-inoculation in the removal of PPE is emerging as a major potential route of HCP infection. 6 To this end, we reviewed the major routes of Ebola virus transmission and the use of PPE to prevent HCP exposure and infection.",51.151784423520375,19.58428662244039

Because much of the prevalence of mouse rotavirus is due to sporadic outbreaks at individual institutions, a major goal in reducing rotaviral contaminations should be outbreak prevention. This can be effected by careful screening of the health status of incoming mice, and by either autoclaving all feed and bedding immediately before use or by purchasing irradiated feed and disinfecting the external wrapping before use.

These guidelines, which outline specific strategies for prevention and control of influenza in acute care facilities, supplement CDC's 2008 infection control recommendations (4). Despite these strategic references, at least 48 cases of influenza A (H1N1) strain have been reported among health care personnel since the initial outbreak, indicating that compliance with the CDC's recommendations may be lower than desired (5) . Although there is limited and controversial evidence regarding the effectiveness of either surgical or N95 masks in reducing transmission of the influenza virus, studies of occupational exposures during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak suggest that the wearing of either surgical or N95 masks might be protective in the health care setting (6 -10) . A recent study on the use of surgical masks compared to N95 masks by nurses in Canada demonstrated similar rates of laboratory-confirmed influenza infection (11) . Influenza infection control is particularly important in the emergency department (ED) because both index cases and more severe cases are expected to present to the ED, and the phenomenon of ED crowding continues to increase at an alarming rate across the United States (12) .",26.130993928334767,11.919532209672113

High patient volume in acute care limits the ability to place patients suspected of requiring single rooms in these until a diagnosis is confirmed. This creates a potential reservoir of infection for both patients and healthcare workers alike. It has also been shown that health care workers can be reluctant to implement transmission based precautions until a diagnosis is confirmed due to perceived and real imposts on time and resources, plus administrative patient flow pressure. Human factors may lead to a situation where the healthcare workers are cognitively overloaded and as their regular practice may be less than 100%, small breaches can occur that they themselves do not identify as breaches. The 'To Err is Human' report in 2000 identified the gap between what is recommended practice and actual practice [9] . Consistently this gap is identified in the application of transmission based precautions as well as other infection prevention strategies potentially leading to health care acquired infections in patients and health care workers [10] . The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Dr Tom Frieden was recently quoted as saying ''There are 75,000 deaths each year from infections spread in hospitals in the U.S. We know no matter how good our recommendations for hand washing and personal protective equipment are, we have to have a large margin of safety for how they will actually be implemented in the field'' [11] suggesting that the CDC acknowledges that clinicians are not always going to follow IPC guidelines, and this is largely unintentional. Yet, accepting standards that put patients, staff and visitors at risk goes against legal and ethical responsibilities of health care staff. This reinforces the need for practices to be second nature for health care workers to ensure that as the potential for harm increases small errors do not have fatal consequences. The practice of infection prevention and control is not an optional extra for clinical practice and patient management, it is essential to both patient and healthcare worker safety. The ability to recognise infectious conditions and implement the appropriate TBP at all times and not only at times of heightened awareness is therefore particularly relevant in the ED context.",38.09095715877643,13.753195867826847

However, many studies of N95 respirators in the US marketplace have shown them to be associated with overall discomfort 23, 30, [37] [38] [39] ; diminished visual, 17, 38, 40 vocal, 17, 40 or auditory 17 acuity; excessive humidity 30 or heat 30, 39, 40 ; headaches 23 ; facial pressure 30 ; skin irritation or itchiness 23, 28, 38 ; excessive fatigue or exertion 23, 30, [38] [39] [40] ; malodorousness 30,39 ; anxiety or claustrophobia 23 ; and other interferences with occupational duties. 25, 39, 41, 42 In 2007, the IOM published a report, ''Preparing for an Influenza Pandemic: Personal Protective Equipment for Healthcare Workers,'' that described the need to strengthen the design and testing of personal protective equipment. 23 The IOM identified the critical need to conduct research and develop better respiratory protective equipment for HCWs. 23 In an effort to build on the IOM recommendations, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), in collaboration with National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, initiated Better Respiratory Equipment using Advanced Technologies for Healthcare Employees (Project B.R.E.A.T.H.E.), a federal interagency working group charged with developing a set of ideal performance characteristics for respirators in health care. The ultimate goal is to shepherd the development of new respiratory protective equipment for HCWs using a government/academic/ private partnership model. With representatives from 9 federal departments and agencies, this multidisciplinary working group has a broad range of expertise, including pandemic and emergency preparedness, infectious disease medicine and epidemiology, infection control, respirator and personal protective equipment policy and regulation, occupational and environmental medicine, respirator and materials science, and biosecurity. 43 The survey reported in this manuscript was designed to help inform Project B.R.E.A.T.H.E. by elucidating some of the features preferred by HCWs for the next generation of respirators.",43.44493970548612,15.169411733214314

Results: Thirty-one behavioural themes were identified that influenced participants' use of masks and gloves. There were significant differences, namely: more reported enablers of glove use vs more barriers to mask use. Reasons included more positive unit culture towards glove use, and lower perception of risk via facial contamination.

[1] [2] [3] Infection prevention and control in health care settings involves, among other measures, the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), which encompasses all of the specialized equipment worn by HCWs for protection against health and safety hazards, including gloves, eye protection, head and shoe coverings, and respirators/facemasks. 4, 5 In low-resource settings, where the incidence of infectious disease is high and the hospital environmental conditions are often poor, hospitals may rely heavily on PPE to protect staff. The use of facemasks (including medical and cloth masks) and respirators is strongly recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as a standard for transmission-based precaution. 4, 5 But even though this practice is highly recommended, actual policies and practices regarding the use of facemasks and respirators vary. 6 For example, whereas the WHO and CDC have the same policy on the use of facemasks/respirators for seasonal influenza, tuberculosis, and ebola virus infection, 4,7-11 they have different recommendations for pandemic influenza and MERS-CoV. 4, 12, 13 Low-and middle-income countries generally adopt policies and guidelines of the WHO and/ or the CDC. 6 The problem is that low-resource countries might not have the ability or finances to adopt infection control policies and respiratory protection guidelines equivalent to those originating from high-resource countries. Therefore, many nonstandardized practices, such as the extended use and reuse of facemasks, are common in low-resource countries; data on these practices are limited, however. Moreover, cloth masks are commonly used in low-resource countries, they are rarely mentioned in infection control policies and guidelines. 14 The appropriate use of facemasks and respirators is important to provide the desired level of protection; however, it requires knowledge, training, and supervision. Compared with other types of PPE, adherence with facemask and respirator use is traditionally low, despite expert recommendations. 15 During a sustained national/international outbreak of a novel viral respiratory infection, health systems may be overwhelmed and existing infection control plans undermined. In 2011, the Institute of Medicine of the US National Academy of Sciences recommended further research into the effectiveness of facemasks/respirators and the factors affecting individuals' willingness and ability to comply with recommendations regarding PPE use. 16 The present study aimed to examine knowledge, attitudes, risk perceptions, and practices regarding the use of facemasks and respirators and barriers to compliance among hospital-based HCWs in Hanoi, Vietnam.",38.17079973291252,15.075778579958408

Depending on the nature of the event, the type of PPE used will likely be the most protective until the causative agent is defined. Standards for such PPE are well defined by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. In disasters with noncontaminated physical hazards, such as an earthquake with building collapse, PPE should consist of protection for the extremity, head, ears, and eyes. In the prehospital arena, for suspected chemical, contaminated explosive, or unknown contamination scenes, personnel functioning within a ""hot zone"" are likely to be in Level A protection. Level A PPE offers the highest level of protection. It encompasses positive pressure breathing apparatus, SCBA, with a fully encapsulating chemical suit. After the removal of victims and subsequent decontamination, graded ""step-down"" in protection can be made until a level appropriate for definitive protection is attained. For example, initial evaluation of patients with an unknown communicable disease may first be approached with the provider in full highefficiency particulate air (HEPA) respiratory and splash precautions. Once the infectious agent is identified and other potential preventative steps are taken (e.g., vaccination), PPE can be shifted to the appropriate mask and Universal Precautions. Amounts of PPE required to sustain a response is dependent on the durability and lifespan of the equipment (single-use versus multi-use), inter-user transfer of equipment (sharing), and the anticipated number of changes per provider. Durable hazardous materials gear may have longevity of several days into an event, may be able to pass from one worker to another, and is not necessarily disposable after each use. N95 respirators used for smallpox respiratory protection may be usable by a single user over a 12-hour shift but would not be shared and would be disposed of after the shift.

The risk of transfer can be modeled using harmless viruses to obtain quantitative data. To determine whether double-gloving reduces virus transfer to HCWs' hands and clothing during removal of contaminated PPE, we conducted a human challenge study using bacteriophages to compare the frequency and quantity of virus transfer to hands and clothes during PPE removal with single-gloving and double-gloving technique. Methods: Each experiment had a double-gloving phase and a single-gloving phase. Participants donned PPE (ie, contact isolation gown, N95 respirator, eye protection, latex gloves). The gown, respirator, eye protection, and dominant glove were contaminated with bacteriophage. Participants then removed the PPE, and their hands, face, and scrubs were sampled for virus. Results: Transfer of virus to hands during PPE removal was significantly more frequent with singlegloving than with double-gloving. Transfer to scrubs was similar during single-gloving and doublegloving. The amount of virus transfer to hands ranged from 0.15 to 2.5 log 10 most probable number. Significantly more virus was transferred to participants' hands after single-gloving than after doublegloving. Conclusions: Our comparison of double-gloving and single-gloving using a simulation system with MS2 and a most-probable number method suggests that double gloving can reduce the risk of viral contamination of HCWs' hands during PPE removal. If incorporated into practice when full PPE is worn, this practice may reduce the risk of viral contamination of HCWs' hands during PPE removal. The use of double gloves should be explored in larger controlled studies.",51.58292935503293,21.0845443663445

[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] The use of personal protective equipment (PPE) is recommended for optimal protection from cross-infection among patients and other HCWs. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Gloves are not only necessary for contact precautions, but also essential for preventing the transmission of infectious bacteria, viruses, and microorganisms that can spread by direct or indirect contact with an infected person or contaminated environment. [7] [8] [9] Gloves also reduce the transmission risks posed by the presence of excessive wound drainage, fecal incontinence, or other bodily discharges. 10 Despite the recommendations, the risk of health care-associated infection through transmission of microorganisms from contaminated gloves to HCWs' hands remains, however. [11] [12] [13] Pittet et al 14 and Boyce 15 reported finding bacteria from patients on the hands of 30% of HCWs who had worn gloves for each patient contact. Pittet et al 14 found that HCWs who wore gloves during patient contact experienced hand contamination at an average rate of 3 colony-forming units (CFU) per minute of patient care. Bacteria and viruses can be passed to HCWs' hands through gloves or by contamination of hands during glove removal. 12, [16] [17] [18] [19] The possibility of contamination considerably increases the potential risk to HCW's hands, which can become infected by contact with a glove at the time of removal. In addition, because latex gloves are elastic and stretchable, certain areas of a working environment might be contaminated by the stretching motion during glove removal. 20 Thus, unpredictable contamination could stain the clinical environment. Most previous studies have identified hand contamination 9, 21 and the  permeable effect of gloves 22,23 as problematic; however, few studies have explored the possible environmental contamination caused by the stretching  motion during glove removal. Recent studies noted that some HCWs became infected with SARS despite wearing full PPE (gloves, gown, and N95 respirator). 2, 24, 25 This ''through precautions'' transmission might be caused by contamination during the removal of protective clothing. 26, 27 A study examining self-contamination rates in HCWs wearing two personal protective systems found that the anterior neck, forearms, wrists, and hands were the likeliest zones for contamination during removal of protective systems. 28 This points to the importance of properly removing PPE, including gloves, which may minimize self-contamination, contamination of the working environment, and possibly contamination of patients.",42.53445330457573,17.117094748406007

Despite these risks, compliance with protective equipment has remained suboptimal. 1 The safety of emergency department (ED) personnel, often the first to encounter an ill patient, is an important area to target for improvement. The risk factors for those individuals include the emergent nature of the care provided and the unknown circumstances that initially led to the patient's utilization of health care. 2 Despite the emphasis on standard precautions training for health care workers (HCWs), the consistent use of personal protective equipment (PPE) remains poor. 3, 4 Various descriptions and analyses of the 2002-2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak reported lack of basic preemptive infection prevention and control strategies. As the outbreak grew, attention was paid to use of protective equipment, including respiratory protection, as symptomatic patients were identified. The experiences of HCWs confronted with suspected or confirmed SARS cases revealed an often inadequate and incorrect use of PPE. 5, 6 A fundamental flaw in the preventive process seemed to involve failure to recognize quickly the key signs, symptoms, or risks that might have led to the early implementation of protective equipment. Although there is little research concerning changing HCW behavior when providing care for patients with respiratory illness, there was some evidence from the SARS outbreak that pointed toward the benefits of training programs and availability of adequate PPE. 7 The workplace practices identified as problematic during the SARS epidemic mirror those identified by Jagger et al at the International Healthcare Worker Safety Center of the University of Virginia. Jagger et al's work has focused on injuries and exposures involving blood and body fluid exposures among HCWs. In 2001, as part of the EPINet Surveillance Program, 8 a total of 463 blood-body-fluid exposures were reported from 49 participating health care facilities. Of these exposures, over 13% occurred in the ED. Less than 10% of the exposed HCWs reported wearing appropriate eye protection, and fewer than 20% reported wearing some sort of mask or other facial barrier. 9 Clearly, the need still exists for effective training techniques to promote the use of PPE as a way to minimize such workplace exposures. Traditional infection prevention and control training for HCWs has involved a review of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) bloodborne pathogens training, 10 as outlined in the current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) isolation guidelines, 11 with emphasis on transmission-based precautions. When we conducted an informal telephone interview with infection control professionals (ICPs) from 10 US hospitals chosen at random, results indicated that this type of training involved a classroom setting (80%) and/or written handouts (20%). A pretest and posttest process typically assessed competency. None of the interviewed hospitals reported the consistent inclusion of an observational component in their training or subsequent assessments.",54.31650739084073,21.804828971720095

In addition to the benefits above regarding healthcare resource management and provision of emotional support, we expect psychiatry to be essential in helping to prevent and manage the higher levels of depression and worse outcomes that have been observed in patients requiring infectious isolation in hospital settings. 3 Similar to other acutely medically ill patients, those with presentations concerning for COVID-19 are likely to be vulnerable to delirium, agitation, and decompensations of psychosis or mood disorders, necessitating psychiatric evaluation. Psychiatrists will also be needed to assist with capacity evaluations for these patients should they wish to leave against medical advice (AMA). Finally, as our medical colleagues face exhaustion, anxiety, and burnout from the increasing volume of patients and uncertainty regarding healthcare resources, the need for C-L psychiatrists to provide moral support through our liaison role will be critical. This is not the first pandemic we have seen; our mentors tell us the stories of working on the wards during the early cases of HIV/AIDS in the 1980s and the Hong Kong influenza in 1968. It is not surprising that we face similar challenges today, with fear of infection transmission among health care professionals ranging from reasonable concern to panic. During this modern pandemic, some mental health care can and should transition to remote channels. In medical hospitals without psychiatrists on-site, telehealth is clearly preferable over the option of having no psychiatric support. However, where resources allow, we encourage our fellow C-L psychiatrists to stand firm in our role as physicians providing critical in-person care to patients and colleagues who need our care now more than ever. With close attention to following the evolving precautions dictated by infectious disease authorities and hospital leadership, let us model to psychiatry trainees the importance of C-L psychiatry presence in the acute care hospital amidst these challenging times.",43.11966057794969,18.320176123203716

Nevertheless, gender can impact how much of the toxin passes the protective equipment barrier and enters the protected environment. Personal protective equipment, such as gloves or respirators, may not be designed to fit a woman's body; this may result in an increased exposure. Greenberg and Dement [1] identified this problem as a potential confounder in occupational health research and noted that although it was recognized as a problem as early as 1942 [17] , little research has been done to determine the impact of improperly-fitting protective equipment on women's occupational health. A Korean study of three commonly-used respirators found decreased fit factors (indicating less protection) among women compared with men, even after taking differences in facial dimensions into account [18] . In addition, the education on, and use of, protective equipment or other safety training may be impacted by gender. Women are more likely to be employed on a part-time or temporary basis [19, 20] , which may result in fewer opportunities for adequate training in personal protective practices. It also may be more physically demanding for women to wear protective equipment compared with men. Murphy et al [21] reported that compared with men, women experienced a greater increase in percent of VO2 max and rating of perceived exertion while wearing chemical protective clothing (compared with wearing regular clothing) and engaging in continuous activity. This greater increase in energy cost while wearing protective clothing may provide a disincentive to women, especially if it affects a woman's capacity to perform in a male-dominated work environment.",48.99585468380707,21.208539521526994

Although direct contact transmission predominates as the main route of nosocomial transmission for most pathogens, the relevance of long-distance transmission has become a concern in the design of new hospitals. This has led to an increased number of single-bed, negative pressure isolation rooms, as well as greater distances between beds in such new facilities. 25 Since the 2003 SARS outbreaks, the modeling of airflows in health care institutions has been performed in a variety of ways and on different scales by both engineers 7-9,26-29 and physicians. 3, 5, 6, 12, [17] [18] [19] Studies assessing the effectiveness of personal protective equipment, such as masks, have also been performed. 30 With influenza, the relative risk from airborne of contact transmission is still being hotly debated, and even existing infection control guidelines have been questioned in this regard. 16 The airborne route of influenza has been well documented, [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] so why do some guidelines still treat influenza as a short-range rather than a long-range airborne disease? 16 Perhaps the most useful debate has been published by the UK Health Protection Agency's Guidance for Pandemic Influenza that comprehensively summarizes the evidence for the different transmission routes of influenza. It still concludes, however, that influenza is mostly transmitted by large droplets and direct contact. 15 Tellier 16 goes one step further and presents a convincing argument as to why influenza should be considered as a true airborne infection and recommends N95 respirators as the minimum level of personal protective equipment for the purposes of pandemic influenza planning.",47.910394241814274,17.727185935916065

The personal toll on HCWs has been distressing, as they have accounted for sizeable proportions of early cases of SARS and 20% of critically ill SARS cases. 1, 2 The concurrent threat of other emerging severe respiratory pathogens (eg, avian influenza, pandemic influenza, etc) has amplified the concerns of HCWs for adequate personal protective equipment (PPE). These respiratory viral pathogens are thought to be transmitted primarily by direct contact through exposure to large respiratory droplets (.5 mm in diameter) expelled during coughing and sneezing, or by contact with infected surfaces and fomites. [3] [4] [5] Airborne transmission of viral pathogens is also considered to be possible via evaporation of larger droplets that form droplet nuclei (,5 mm in diameter) or by viral attachment to dust particles, either of which allow for prolonged air suspension. 6 A recent investigation that obtained positive air samples in hospital SARS units in Toronto added plausibility to the theory of airborne transmission of SARS. 7 Medical procedures that result in aerosolization and subsequent airborne dissemination of respiratory pathogens (eg, endotracheal intubation, oral suctioning, etc) were identified as placing HCWs at increased risk for SARS infection. 2, 6, 8, 9 The finding that HCWs were infected with SARS during some of these aerosol-generating procedures, despite the use of accepted universal precautions (ie, gowns, caps, gloves, eye protection [eg, face shields, goggles], N95 [or equivalent] filtering facepiece respirators [N95FFR]), resulted in medical specialists, 4,10,11 health care agencies, 12,13 professional societies, 14 and medical institutions 15 promoting the use of powered airpurifying respirators (PAPRs) for HCWs involved in these procedures. Ancillary recommendations included the concurrent use of N95FFR (or equivalent respirators) and goggles with PAPRs, 4, 13, [15] [16] [17] based upon the assumption that this combination of PPE would act in an additive fashion to provide maximal protection 10 (Fig 1) . However, the respiratory protection afforded by the concurrent use of PAPRs with N95FFR (N95FFR/PAPR), as well as any recommendations to the contrary, have not been subjected to scientific scrutiny, as is true for many recommendations regarding the prevention of transmission of SARS-related coronavirus in health care settings. 18 Improper use of PPE can negatively impact the wearer in such areas as personal performance, safety, physical and emotional comfort, communication, and hearing such that it is incumbent upon PPE users and hospital respiratory protection program managers to determine the relative merits of employing additional PPE in novel ways, particularly if the novel aspects of use have not been thoroughly evaluated for effectiveness. Any additional burden imposed on the user must also be carefully considered. This article examines the use of N95FFR/PAPRs in the setting of respiratory pathogens during aerosol-generating medical procedures to encourage a more thorough evaluation of this regimen by professional societies, regulatory bodies, and users of this combination of PPE.",50.821890918754406,20.101774449070295

Recent data from China, by Chang et al, revealed the greatest risk of COVID-19 exposure to health care workers during early stages of the pandemic when testing was not yet widely available. 61 In a JAMA report published from Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan, 29.3% (40 of 138) of COVID-19 infected patients were health care workers who presumably had hospital-acquired infections. 27 Among 493 health care workers caring for hospitalized patients, 10/493 health care workers became infected with COVID-19; all 10 were unprotected health care workers (no mask) caring for patients on medical wards with a low risk of exposure (no known or suspected COVID-19 patients). In contrast, none of the 278 protected health care workers (N95 mask) caring for high risk patients (known or suspected COVID-19) became infected (aOR 464.82; 95% CI: 97.73 to infinite). 62 One study, evaluating health care worker exposure in the care of one COVID-19 positive patient, revealed that none of 41 health care workers (surgical masks only) developed infection despite absence of N95 mask, although studies evaluating health care workers in context of larger cohorts of COVID-19 positive patients are not yet available. 63 The decision to extend the recommendation to lower GI procedures is based on evidence of possible aerosolization during colonoscopy especially during the insertion and removal of instruments through the biopsy channel. 53 and the uncertain risks associated with evidence of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in fecal samples.

Thus, there is an urgent need to reinforce the execution of basic IPC measures at all times in all healthcare facilities. Other pivotal interventions in reducing nosocomial transmission include prompt triaging, staff cohorting, and excluding non-essential staff and visitors.6,15",44.18881173747792,18.32259218430822

In these nations, inadequate provision of medical supplies has compromised the level of infection control in many hospitals. This has, in turn, amplified transmission of the virus in health settings leading to the contamination of an unprecedented number of health professions.47 Additionally, failure of authorities to provide personal protective equipment has caused health workers to go on strike in Liberia and Sierra Leone (in the midst of the outbreak) and inability of national government to address lingering demands of medical doctors, in the case of Nigeria.48,49",49.838673689719975,18.755524760549196

EID outbreaks, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, avian influenza, and Ebola virus disease (EVD), have shaped the course of human history and caused incalculable misery and death (3, 4). This issue was highlighted by the 2014 EVD epidemic crisis in West Africa, a total of 28,646 confirmed cases with 11,323 deaths, which was an explicit example of unpreparedness of the public health system (4). In particular, the risk of acquisition of an EID during the care of a patient is significantly high for health care workers (HCWs) (5). Although the HCWs did their best to control the recent EVD outbreaks, 852 HCWs were diagnosed with Ebola, and 492 of them died (6, 7). The infection incidence among HCWs became 100 times higher than that of the general population (7). To prevent the transmission of EID spread in a workplace, HCWs are advised to wear personal protective equipment (PPE), including face masks, bioprotective suits, and medical gloves, according to the standard infection prevention and control guidance (8, 9). Although these PPE can significantly minimize the pathogen transmission, the risk of infection cannot be entirely eliminated (9). EID pathogens can be effectively captured and intercepted by the relevant protective materials; however, the sustained infection activity of the pathogen could easily cause cross-contamination and postinfection, which might lead to increased risk of pathogen spreading (10, 11). Alternatively, antimicrobial active protective technologies by incorporating biocidal agents into PPE materials could be another strategy to provide promising bioprotection against EID pathogens because direct contact killing is achieved (12, 13). Various biocides, such as triclosan, nisaplin, essential oils, peptide, chitosan, and silver nanoparticles, have recently been incorporated for bioprotective applications (14–18). However, their immediate biocidal effect usually suffers from significant decline due to the irreversible consumption of the biocides (19). More effective, easy-to-use, field-deployable, and durable PPE materials to provide antimicrobial bioprotection from infection source to point-of-use are needed, particularly for the outdoor emergency medical services.",44.160428429279385,18.265050604563733

In line with the health problems related to species migration or introduction in new areas, there is species translocation among continents, often accompanied by the movement of infectious agents, which may lead to unexpected exchanges of genetic material. For example, it seems that in the 1980s, a commensal E. coli of the human intestine acquired an aggravated pathogenic capacity becoming verocytotoxic (E. coli O157:H7), due to an exchange of genetic material with a bacteria from the Shigella genus.",16.23465591960997,8.595984909960109

In the absence of data on SARS-CoV-2, we focused on the sister virus SARS-CoV-1. We propose a two-step disinfection process, which is conservative in the absence of robust evidence on SARS-CoV-2. This disinfection protocol is based on an initial storage of PPE for ≥4 days, followed by ultraviolet light (UVC), dry heat treatment, or chemical disinfection. Importantly, each of the two steps is based on independent disinfection mechanisms, so that our proposed protocol is a multiplicative system, maximising the efficacy of our disinfection process. This method could be rapidly implemented in other healthcare settings, while testing of each method is undertaken, increasing the frontline supply of PPE, and avoiding many of the upstream issues of supply chain disruption currently being faced.",35.946083286852975,16.644117157467175

As the incidence of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is increasing exponentially in the United States and worldwide, healthcare provider demand for these necessities is currently outpacing supply. As such, strategies to safely expand the lifespan of the supply of medical equipment are critically important. In the recent days, weeks, and months, in the midst of the current pandemic, there has been a concerted effort to identify viable ways to conserve Personal Protective Equipment, including sterilization after use. Some hospitals have already begun using UV-C light to sterilize N95 respirators, but many lack the space or equipment to implement existing protocols. In this study, we outline a procedure by which N95 respirators may be sterilized using ultraviolet (UV) radiation in biosafety cabinets (BSCs), a common element of many academic, public health, and hospital laboratories. The primary obstacle to this approach is the possibility the UV radiation levels vary within BSCs. To account for this potential variation in dosing across the base of the BSC, we tested the UV-C radiation in two randomly chosen idle BSCs in our research institute and observed a maximum ratio between the minimum and maximum recorded intensities within a given BSC to be 1.98. Based on these values, we calculated that an N95 mask placed within a BSC with a manufacturer's reported fluence of 100 µW cm −2 should be effectively sanitized for reuse after approximately 15-20 minutes per side. Our results provide support to healthcare organizations looking for alternative methods to extend their reserves of PPE. It is our hope that with an easily implemented strategy, as we have presented here, idle BSCs can be utilized to alleviate the PPE shortage by providing a way to sterilize PPE to allow safe daily re-use. This should be tested on a larger scale, and confirmed in a virology laboratory before adoption, though we contend that in extremis, this method would be preferred compared to re-use without sterilization.",38.796087906233225,16.2794560262711

Based on the simulation results, we recommend the following: (i) decrease the rate of patient encounter per frontline health care worker, e.g., maximum of three encounters per hour in a 12-hour work shift duration; (ii) decrease the interaction time between the frontline health care worker and the patients, e.g., less than 40 minutes for the whole day; (iii) increase the clean and safe space for social distancing, e.g., maximum of 10% crowd density, and if possible, implement compartmentalization of patients; and/or (iv) provide effective protective gears and facilities, e.g., 95% effective, that the frontline health care workers can use during their shift.

However, concerning the different purposes of HMIS and IDSR system, a more integrated electronic IDSR system is essential for the health authorities to correspond the diverse demands. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/363713 doi: bioRxiv preprint African health ministries are quickly adopting mHealth solutions to improve disease surveillance and health programmes. Tanzania piloted an IDSR reporting system using SMS function and regular phones for report in 2011 [28] and further expanded it to be the national strategy for diseases surveillance using Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) technology linked with DHIS2 for the immediate reporting for IDSR [29] [30] [31] . Zambia tried to use DHIS2 mobile to enhance its malaria surveillance in Lusaka district and to improve case management and reporting [32] . Other mobile technologies including smartphone applications, patient monitoring devices, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), as well as laptops and tablets PCs connected with network service were piloted and implemented in various African countries [33] . Countries and development partners are eager to apply the mobile technology to capture real-time field data for surveillance and case management at the community level health care system [30, [34] [35] [36] [37] . However, notable issues were documented including technical, financial, infrastructural challenges, data security and medical supports during the design and implementation process of mHealth surveillance in sub-Saharan Africa countries [33] . Considering the complexity of public health works and needs of integration services at the community level [38] , the utilization of mobile technologies requires more rigorous studies to evaluate such innovations for programme implementation to become sustainable and scalable [39] .",11.603723954303689,9.22070782870081

Basically, the overall duration of the strategy is determined by the chosen number of subdivisions of the country, with a higher number leading to a longer overall duration but lower prevalent case numbers. The required number of superclusters will depend most on R0 and the chosen maximum number of prevalent Covid-19 cases (dashed horizontal line in Figure 1) . A minimum condition for implementing this strategy is that there is sufficiently intensive control (now assumed to reduce contact rates on average to 25% of their original level) to avoid outbreaks in locations that have not yet lifted control. Notably, under this condition, isolation of the supercluster lifting control is not strictly necessary. Also, our strategy can start at any moment, which allows the health care system to prepare for the lift of control in the first supercluster. We further show that it is not strictly necessary that all individuals return to their normal daily activities; however, if many maintain their reduced contact behavior until the end of the strategy, this may trigger a substantially larger last peak. The strategy may be optimized by using an adaptive approach where the next moment of lifting control depends on the state of the outbreak in the preceding supercluster, which would also allow us to counter unexpected outcomes related to uncertainties in Covid-19 transmission. In turn, data resulting from local outbreaks will reduce such uncertainties and help to further improve the strategy and the model.",12.274529246447152,8.216505286877535

Without sufficient herd immunity, the Covid-19 epidemic will revert to its original dynamic course as soon as interventions are withdrawn. 3 This resurgence can only be prevented if most countries in the world follow China's example and jointly maintain intensive control for a long time, probably years, until the very last cases have been tracked down and isolated. Furthermore, countries with residual circulating virus would have to be completely isolated to avoid reintroduction. Still, prolonged intensive control could be a means to gain time until the development and large-scale availability of a vaccine. However, the amount of time this will take is unpredictable. An alternative approach is to develop herd immunity through natural infection while keeping the number of cases within the limits of the health care system. Until recently, the UK has advocated this approach, 4 but it was heavily criticized for obvious reasons: it will be practically impossible to perfectly tune actual interventions without exceeding or undershooting health care capacity. Clearly, there is a need for an exit strategy that is predictable and controllable. We believe that we have found such a strategy.",16.107560813412157,6.581901529426157
