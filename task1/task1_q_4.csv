In this study, we used rabbits to further characterize the transmission potential of MERS-CoV. In line with the presence of MERS-CoV receptor in the rabbit nasal epithelium, high levels of viral RNA were shed from the nose following virus inoculation. However, unlike MERS-CoV-infected dromedaries, these rabbits did not develop clinical manifestations including nasal discharge and did shed only limited amounts of infectious virus from the nose. Consistently, no transmission by contact or airborne routes was observed in rabbits. Our data indicate that despite relatively high viral RNA levels produced, low levels of infectious virus are excreted in the upper respiratory tract of rabbits as compared to dromedary camels, thus resulting in a lack of viral transmission.",16.462652942891097,8.86645926383566

It is the causative agent of equine viral arteritis (EVA) a respiratory, systemic, and reproductive disease of horses [2, 4, 5] . While most naturally acquired EAV infections are clinically inapparent, relatively virulent field strains of EAV periodically emerge around the world giving rise to outbreaks of EVA [6, 7] . The disease is characterized by fever (greater than 41˚C); depression; leukopenia; rhinitis often accompanied by nasal discharge; urticaria; and edema [8] . Abortion is a frequent outcome in naïve pregnant mares and congenital infection in neonatal foals is characterized by severe, fulminating interstitial pneumonia [9] . In the stallion, EAV is shed in semen during the acute phase of the infection and in some individuals, for a short time during the convalescent period until they clear the virus entirely from all body tissues [10] . However, in contrast, EAV establishes long-term persistent infection in 10-70% of infected stallions and these constantly shed virus in their semen for extended periods (years or even life long) [8, 11, 12] . The mechanism of long-term persistence of EAV in the reproductive tract of stallions is not well understood. It has been shown that EAV persistence in sexually intact post-pubertal colts or stallions is testosterone dependent [13, 14] . Persistently infected stallions play an important role in maintenance and perpetuation of the virus in equine populations by transmitting the virus during breeding to naïve susceptible mares and can be responsible for outbreaks of EVA [8, [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . The use of virus-infective frozen or chilled semen for artificial insemination and embryo transfer can increase the risk of spread of EAV [18] .",18.25344542876688,8.631718578691608

However, colonization of the respiratory tract with various pathogens must be taken into account when determining appropriate treatment regimens based on sputum or naso/oropharyngeal swabs. In a study of 340 patients with CAP, culture and RT-PCR were used to compare plasma and respiratory (nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum or tracheal aspirates) samples [33] .

Food-and water associated transmission is also suspected to enhance the spread and emergence of zoonotic viruses (e.g., Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-coronavirus and Nipah virus) and facilitates the occurrence of zoonotic events though the handling of bushmeat (Ebola virus) (Wolfe et al., 2005; European Food Safety Authority, 2014; Mann et al., 2015) .",15.802927592728034,7.602315025296532

Case definitions ranged from inclusive (any single sign of URI such as sneezing, clear or mucopurulent nasal or ocular discharge) to strict (more than one sign of URI, mucopurulent nasal or ocular discharge and/or systemic illness). Theoretically, this could have led to overestimating the URI rate at the shelters with the most inclusive definitions, and underestimating at those shelters that had stricter standards for diagnosis. However, the shelter with the lowest URI rate also had the most inclusive definition, while the stricter definitions were found at shelters with higher URI rates. If anything, this would have led to a dampening of the differences in reported URI rates.

First, we did not find a difference in log fecal oocysts enumerated per gram of fecal dry matter in CFC or IC samples among calves in confinement. Previously, it was thought that homogenization of the CFC sample would result in more accurate oocyst enumeration [25] , but this was not supported by our data. To the contrary, there was greater variation in oocyst enumeration for CFC samples, as is evidenced by the larger standard error bars (Fig 1) . Since these counts are standardized to the fecal dry matter percentage, this would indicate that these differences are attributable to increased water content of the stool sample. It has also been suggested that CFC must be collected and homogenized due to possible diurnal variations in fecal oocyst shedding [25, 26] , but we observed no significant difference in the number of oocysts enumerated in samples collected in the morning or evening. It is important to note that while CFC permits capture of the total fecal output, the entire CFC sample is not analyzed. For both CFC and IC a 200 mg aliquot of stool is homogenized with equal amounts of PBS. After qPCR is performed, oocyst counts are standardized by fecal dry matter percentage. Therefore, our findings indicate that a representative stool sample can be attained via IC and collection of the total fecal output is not necessary in order to attain a representative stool sample for oocyst enumeration via qPCR. The fecal dry matter percentage was significantly lower in CFC samples as compared to IC collected from calves in confinement. This was controlled for in oocyst enumeration by standardizing to the fecal dry matter percentage. The increased water content in CFC samples could be from more severe diarrhea or improved ability to measure water content due to sample homogenization. Alternately, it could be due to urine contamination of the fecal bin which has been previously described or to increased urine production secondary to increased frequency of fluid therapy [25] . Although adult diapers were secured to the calves using Duct Tape (3M, St. Paul, MN) and Elastikon (Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ) diapers did slide out of place with calf movement and exposed the penis. In addition, during the first 4-5 days of confinement, calves were small enough to turn around in the stall, thus there were instances when they defecated in the urine bin, which would falsely lower the fecal dry matter percentage of stool collected from the fecal bin and falsely elevate the volume of urine collected (S1 Fig). If the lower fecal dry matter percentage detected in confinement housing calves is a true finding, indicating that CFC better detects increased water content in the stool, this would indicate that confinement exacerbates severity of diarrhea. This is a possibility, given that calves in confinement housing required significantly more supportive care than calves in box stalls. Calves in confinement housing received an average of 3.5 L of fluid therapy each day, as compared to box stall calves, which only received 0.25 L/day. Thus, confinement housing calves may experience greater volume of fluid elimination due to greater volume of fluid support. However, when comparing IC samples from confinement housing calves to IC samples from box stall calves, there is no significant difference in fecal dry matter percentage. Thus, it is probable that the difference in fecal dry matter percentage between CFC and IC samples for confinement housing calves is at least partially attributable to urine contamination of the fecal bin.",27.246774080884407,10.84648657562552

These variables accounted for the greatest amount of inter-calf variation in total fecal output.

The regression model also suggests that the total fecal output is sensitive to hypercortisolemia.

A previous study has shown that the magnitude of oocyst shedding tracks with the ordinal measures of severity of diarrhea [36] .

With human volunteers, a variety of sample collection methods exist to permit simple, non-invasive collection of CFC. With neonatal calves collection of CFC is a formidable challenge requiring use of confinement housing that severely restricts calf movement and their ability to engage in natural behaviors, such as grooming. Calves may rise or lay down in sternal or lateral recumbancy, but they cannot turn around or ambulate. The use of this degree of confinement is necessary in order to direct the fecal matter expelled by the calf directly into collection pans. Enlarging the confinement system to let the calf ambulate or to allow sufficient space for the calf to turn around would not permit collection of the entire stool sample, especially at the peak of illness when calves may pass stool 1-3 times per hour. This housing system, originally developed for use in the veal industry, is not ideal for calf welfare and may not be acceptable to Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees, particularly those at European institutions. In contrast to CFC, the use of the IC method allows calves to be housed in box stalls where they can move freely.

Association had been documented between cigarette smoking and the development of airway obstruction and symptoms. Background: Sputum eosinophilia is a useful biomarker for corticosteroid response in patients with asthma or chronic cough. However, sputum induction requires specialized personnel and facilities and is not always feasible. Recent evidence suggests a moderate degree of diagnostic utility of less invasive biomarkers, such as blood eosinophils, in predicting sputum eosinophilia in asthma. However, none in the literature has examined the diagnostic utility of blood eosinophils for sputum eosinophilia in patients with non-asthmatic chronic cough. Methods: We examined the datasets of elderly asthma and nonasthmatic chronic cough recruited from previously established cohorts. The inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) elderly subjects (≥65 years old), 2) no current oral or inhaled corticosteroids and 3) no significant comorbidities. Sputum eosinophilia was defined as induced sputum eosinophils≥3%. The diagnostic utility was assessed using receiver operating curve (ROC) analyses for blood eosinophils in predicting sputum eosinophilia. Results: A total of 74 elderly asthma and 75 non-asthmatic chronic cough patients were analyzed. There were no significant difference in their demographic profiles (age, gender and smoking) between two groups. Of them, 59 elderly asthma and 45 non-asthmatic chronic cough patients had sputum eosinophilia. In Spearman tests, the correlations between blood eosinophils% and sputum eosino-phil% were significant in eosinophilic asthma (r=0.577, p<0.001) but not in non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis (r=0.019, p=0.870). In ROC analyses for sputum eosinophilia, blood eosinophils showed a moderate utility (the area under the ROC curve [AUC] 0.838) in asthma, but no utility (AUC 0.489) in non-asthmatic chronic cough. Conclusions: Unlike asthma, blood eosinophils did not have any diagnostic utility for sputum eosinophilia in non-asthmatic chronic cough. These findings could suggest a different pathophysiology in airway eosinophilic inflammation between two entities.",17.731609225012114,10.03427287927075

However, such systems were based on subjective judgment, rather than statistical methods, to weight scores. Data from a pair-matched case-control study on a California calf raising facility was used to develop three novel scoring systems to diagnose BRD in preweaned dairy calves. Disease status was assigned using both clinical signs and diagnostic test results for BRD-associated pathogens. Regression coefficients were used to weight score values. The systems presented use nasal and ocular discharge, rectal temperature, ear and head carriage, coughing, and respiratory quality as predictors. The systems developed in this research utilize fewer severity categories of clinical signs, require less calf handling, and had excellent agreement (Kappa > 0.8) when compared to an earlier scoring system. The first scoring system dichotomized all clinical predictors but required inducing a cough. The second scoring system removed induced cough as a clinical abnormality but required distinguishing between three levels of nasal discharge severity. The third system removed induced cough and forced a dichotomized variable for nasal discharge. The first system presented in this study used the following predictors and assigned values: coughing (induced or spontaneous coughing, 2 points), nasal discharge (any discharge, 3 points), ocular discharge (any discharge, 2 points), ear and head carriage (ear droop or head tilt, 5 points), fever (≥39.2 • C or 102.5 • F, 2 points), and respiratory quality (abnormal respiration, 2 points). Calves were categorized ""BRD positive"" if their total score was ≥4. This system correctly classified 95.4% cases and 88.6% controls.

Since early treatment is the most important factor that prevents treatment failure, recognition at this stage would be preferable. The feasibility of daily measurement of the body temperature in high-risk periods is highly dependent on the housing system and handling facilities. When treatment is based on rectal temperature, thresholds of 40-40.3°C for feedlot cattle and 39.7°C for calves have been suggested [28] . If measurement of the body temperature is not practical, early recognition and the success of treatment relies on good observational skills of the animal keeper. Evaluating calves for treatment using a screening system, such as the calf respiratory scoring chart developed at the University of Wisconsin, which is based on rectal temperature, character of nasal discharge, eye or ear appearance and presence of coughing, has been recommended for dairy calves [68, 76] .

Consequently, we deduce the occurrence of possible cross-species transmission (such as pigs to rodents, pigs to cattle, pigs to fur animals) of PCVs. In most cases of detection or infection in non-porcine animals, the main reason has been ingestion of porcine products or direct contact with pigs (36-39, 45, 47, 51) . Cases of infection of PCVs in ruminants are not well-evaluated, because ruminants hardly ingest porcine products or have rare or no contact with pigs. Due to the wide distribution of PCVs in various types of water samples (79) , there is a high risk of infection in ruminants via PCV-contaminated water. In fact, owing to their wide tissue tropism, PCVs could exist in almost all tissues of pigs and wild boars (80, 81) . Furthermore, PCVs were frequently detected in fecal samples of non-porcine animals (45, 48, 62, 63) . Discharge of PCV-positive fecal matter into water bodies increases the occurrence of PCV contamination. A comprehensive understanding of PCV reservoirs would be invaluable for implementing accurate measures to control the spread of PCVs. ",22.348804174662654,10.000110512555

Many RNA viruses are known to be associated with gastroenteritis; however, the enteric RNA viral community present in healthy humans has not been described. Here, we present a comparative metagenomic analysis of the RNA viruses found in three fecal samples from two healthy human individuals. For this study, uncultured viruses were concentrated by tangential flow filtration, and viral RNA was extracted and cloned into shotgun viral cDNA libraries for sequencing analysis. The vast majority of the 36,769 viral sequences obtained were similar to plant pathogenic RNA viruses. The most abundant fecal virus in this study was pepper mild mottle virus (PMMV), which was found in high concentrations-up to 10 9 virions per gram of dry weight fecal matter. PMMV was also detected in 12 (66.7%) of 18 fecal samples collected from healthy individuals on two continents, indicating that this plant virus is prevalent in the human population. A number of pepper-based foods tested positive for PMMV, suggesting dietary origins for this virus. Intriguingly, the fecal PMMV was infectious to host plants, suggesting that humans might act as a vehicle for the dissemination of certain plant viruses.

Nevertheless, the control process underlying the nasal cycle is not fully understood. Interestingly, we found that there are significant differences in the expression levels of clock genes in nasal mucosa in both human nasal cavities. The expression levels of these clock genes in decongested mucosa were higher than in congested mucosa. These results show that clock genes may possibly be involved in the nasal cycle of congestion and decongestion of the nasal mucosa. Similar findings were also noted in nasal mucosa of rat. It has been demonstrated previously that vessels in nasal mucosa are divided into resistance vessels and capacitance vessels [48] . The resistance vessels are composed of small arteries, veins and arterio-venous anastomosis. Especially, arterio-venous anastomosis, controlled by the autonomic nervous system, regulates nasal mucosa blood flow by alternating smooth muscle tone. In contrast, the major capacitance vessels in nasal mucosa are composed of vascular sinusoid, and its swelling is mainly affected by nasal mucosa blood flow and filling pressure. The volume of blood flow in nasal mucosa affects nasal resistance, and the dilation of vascular sinusoid can result in nasal congestion, contributing to nasal obstruction [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] . The existence of a circadian rhythm in the function of blood vessels has long been recognized. The clock genes are ubiquitously expressed and exhibit rhythmic expression in blood vessels. Cumulative evidence has demonstrated that these 24-h timers exerts a significant influence on the vasculature, whereby disruption of circadian clock components results in vascular stiffness and altered endothelial progenitor cell function [54] . Moreover, mutations of clock genes have been reported to have detrimental effects on the vascular function in mice [55] . Mice deficient in BMAL1 and CLOCK genes showed a reduced vasodilatory response to acetylcholine and had impaired endothelial function [56] . Selective deletion of BMAL1 from smooth muscle attenuated the circadian rhythm of blood pressure [57] . In this respect, we hypothesize that clock genes involved in the control of blood flow may contribute to the regulation of the nasal cycle. More studies are required to evaluate the molecular mechanisms of clock gene functions in cyclical congestion and decongestion of nasal mucosa.",16.564184807230617,6.332677475731924

Use of such a definition requires some form of daily monitoring with either a diary or an electronic device, but allows a complete count of all exacerbation events.

Even living down-wind of a farm field fertilized with animal manure poses a potential risk. A list of major sources and exposure routes of animal-to-people transmission of viruses and bacteria is shown in Figure 2 . Factors influencing the probability of disease transmission involve the proximity and temporal contact with the infectious organism, length of time that the infectious agent is present, virulence of the agent, incubation period, stability of the agent under varying environmental conditions, population density of carrier animals, husbandry practices, and control of wild rodents and insects (31) . The type and maintenance of animal housing also may affect the extent to which individuals working in or around such facilities are exposure to zoonotic viruses and bacteria.

Moreover, in 26 confirmed Ebola cases, 16 samples including saliva, stool, semen, breast milk, tears, nasal blood and a skin swab were positive in Ebola culture and/or RT-PCR [53] . In case of EBOV, all samples including body fluids must be handled applying the WHO recommendations, since they are highly infectious.The recent Ebolavirus outbreak in Serra Leone, Liberia und Guinea with 11,325 deaths initiated several intensive investigations of different patient specimens like blood, urine, sweat, saliva, conjunctival swaps, stool and semen for infectious virus [54, 55] . These became a major interest since transmission routes were not always obvious from previous experience. Moreover, public health measures require clear references, when recovered patients are not infectious anymore and can be released from quarantine. The excretion of EBOV in body fluids from infected or recovered patients create a great risk for person in contact [54, 56] as the Ebola virus RNA was detected in the following body fluids weeks up to several months after infection: saliva, conjunctiva/ tears, stool, vaginal fluid, sweat, urine, amniotic fluid, aqueous humor, cerebrospinal fluid, breast milk, and semen raised many concerns regarding the long term transmissibility of infectious virus causing a recrudesce of an outbreak [56] [57] [58] . Comparing whole-blood with urine specimen's analysis from Ebola patients in a novel diagnostic film-array with RT-PCR shows a reasonable match of 90% for whole blood and 85% for urine [59] . Testing the stability of Ebola virus RNA in human blood and urine under environmental African conditions shows that viral RNA testing from blood samples stored in EDTA buffer is more sensitive [60] . Viral RNA in urine seems less stable compared to blood since urine samples were found positive by RT-PCR by day 10-14 compared to blood until at least day-18. Since the CCHF outbreak in Turkey in 2002, the detection of virus in other body fluids received attention to avoid secondary infections.

Only a few selected publications were considered for this review. Bronchoalveolar and lower respiratory tract fluids were highly positive for MERS-CoV in the two identified cases [124] , while urine samples were only positive on day 13. Stool samples and oro-nasal swabs contained very low MERS-CoV copy number on days 12 and 16, respectively, and no virus was detected in blood. In the beginning of the outbreak the way of transmission was rather unclear. Therefore, the virus replication in the kidney with potential shedding in urine was further investigated [125] . To clarify the different transmission routes a prediction model for oral-fecal and/or oral-saliva transmission routes for MERS-CoV was developed and evaluated [126] .

The birds were observed for clinical signs up to 11 days post-inoculation. At 4 and 7 days post-infection the tracheas of three randomly selected chickens from each group were examined for ciliary activity and presence of IBV. Observations for clinical signs, snicking, wheezing and nasal discharge, of an IBV infection were carried out daily on each group from three days post-infection. Only chickens inoculated with M41-CK showed any clinical signs of an IBV infection. As can be seen from figure 3, M41-CK induced high rates of snicking, which peaked by day 5 post-inoculation, whereas Beau-R and rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 induced a much lower rate of snicking, similar to those observed for the mockinoculated chickens (Fig. 3A) . Similarly, only chickens (11-16%) inoculated with M41-CK showed any nasal discharge three, four and six days post-inoculation (Fig. 3B) . Again, wheezing was only observed in chickens inoculated with M41-CK, in which 90% of the infected chickens demonstrated wheezing by 7 days postinoculation (Fig. 3C) . Analysis of the tracheas isolated from the chickens showed that the mock, Beau-R and rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 infected chickens had .95% ciliary activity whereas the chickens inoculated with M41-CK showed 0% ciliary activity (100% ciliostasis; Fig. 3D ). In summary, our observations of the parameters used to assess pathogenicity demonstrated that rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 was not pathogenic and that it had the characteristics associated with Beau-R rather than M41-CK.",17.255951548916663,7.220764788842099

A mixture of feces, AHP disinfectant, PG, and saline was recollected from the coupon using a 20 mL syringe. This syringe was labeled with the coupon identification number and matched to a single pig for the bioassay bottom of the tub and drained into a bucket to minimize the risk of contaminating the room's floor. Each section of the tub had designated water and feed sources. During the study, each pig was assigned its own bag of feed and feed cup to minimize cross contamination. Previous studies demonstrated that this housing method successfully prevented transmission of PEDV between pigs in a group [12] . Pigs were fed an age appropriate, pelleted, starter diet ad libitum.

On comparing the potential substrates of silkworm with the yeast data [25] , some homologs such as budding proteins (Buds), transcriptional activator Gcns Uba2, and transcript elongation factors (Spts) were identified. In this study, all the components of the multiprotein complex involved in SUMOylation, including SAE1, SAE2, and PIAS, were found to coimmunoprecipitate in the presence of eGFP-BmSUMO and BmUBC9. Furthermore, BmUBC9 and BmSUMO were identified in both eGFP and eGFP-SUMO plus BmUBC9 preparations (data not shown). Some of the homologous proteins identified in this study have been previously reported to be SUMOylated. For example, the endoplasmic reticulum-resident chaperone calreticulin is known to be SUMOylated, and abolishing SUMOylation enhanced calreticulin expression in an X Box binding protein 1 (XBP-1) dependent manner, resulting in increased calreticulin-counteracted endoplasmic reticulum stress [31] . The human transcription factor II D (TFIID) subunits TBP-associated factors 5 (TAF5) and TAF12 are modified by SUMO-1 both in vitro and in vivo, resulting in dynamic regulation of the promoter-binding activity of TFIID [32] . The endoribonuclease Dicer, which cleaves the stem-loop structure from pre-miRNAs, allowing them to dissociate into their mature, 20-22-nucleotide single-stranded form, has also been shown to be SUMOylated [33] . Moreover, as shown in Table 1 , a number of ribosomal proteins and heat shock proteins (HSPs) have been identified as SUMOylation substrates. It is worth mentioning that several ribosomal proteins and HSPs isolated from human sperm have also been found to be SUMOylated [34] . SUMOylation of the human ribosomal protein S3 (rpS3) increases its stability [35] . In addition, HSP27 has been reported to be associated with the SUMOylation system [36] [37] [38] [39] .",10.45578157979324,5.315444976362845

In particular, pepper mild mottle virus (PMMV) was found in two specimens (#N1 and #N5) and was confirmed with RT-PCR (data not shown). The total number of PMMV reads outnumbered the norovirus reads in sample #N5 (Table 1 ). In addition, Kyuri green mottle mosaic virus (KGMMV) was also abundantly detected in sample #N3 (813 KGMMV-specific reads in a total 25,500 reads). KGMMV was also detected after ultracentrifugation (data not shown), suggesting that KGMMV viral particles were present in the human gut. Previously, PMMV was detected at 10 9 virions per gram of dry weight fecal matter, and was detected in 12 (66.7%) of the 18 fecal samples collected from healthy humans [31] . This previous publication also showed that fecal PMMV was infectious to host plants [31] . Therefore, these plant-derived viruses may retain their infectivity in the feces and may even be present in diarrhea. Almost all of the detected viruses, except for the citrus tristeza virus, a member of the Closterovirus group, belong to the Tobamovirus group (Table 1) . It is currently unknown if there is an interaction between these plus-stranded RNA viruses and norovirus. The most abundantly detected PMMV was also found in healthy humans [31] . Although the previous paper [31] reported that there is a lack of evidence to show that active replication of PMMV occurs in human feces, further investigations regarding plant virus replication in the human gut (epithelial cells) seem necessary.",12.27109635419627,5.137805788630674

Most nasal and sinus diseases start with a serous discharge but with persistence of the primary cause can progress to mucoid, mucopurulent, and frankly purulent.

Whether the discharge is initially unilateral or bilateral can help in suggesting the type of disease process. For example, a unilateral discharge could be associated with upper arcade dental disease, nasal foreign body, nasal tumor, or mycotic infection or parasites.

A thorough medical history coupled with typical endoscopic findings are sufficient to diagnose both entities. Signs of sequelae (eg, atrophic pharyngitis) and of complications (eg, septal perforation and saddle nose deformity) may be seen in long-standing cases of both subtypes. 91 The primary (idiopathic) subtype of atrophic rhinitis is defined by nasal mucosal and glandular atrophy. 6 It primarily affects people from areas with warm climates who present with nasal inflammation, dryness, crusting, a sense of severe congestion, and epistaxis. 8, 91 The underlying pathophysiology is unclear but it is either caused by a lack of mucus, thereby facilitating bacterial growth, leading to mucosal colonization (usually with Klebsiella ozaenae, S aureus, Proteus mirabilis, and Escherichia coli 92 ) or, vice versa, microbial colonization may be the primary cause of this condition. In any case, characteristic findings include crusting of nasal mucosa, a foul-smelling nasal discharge, and a reported sense of severe congestion, paradoxically in spite of considerably wide and unobstructed nasal cavities. 8 The secondary subtype has a similar presentation, with the triad of fetor, crusting, and spacious nasal cavities with perceived congestion. 93 However, because this form of atrophic rhinitis is caused by extensive surgical removal of mucus-secreting tissue, trauma, or chronic granulomatous disorders, 6 signs of these underlying causes may be evident on physical examination. Aggressive resection of the turbinates often causes the empty nose syndrome, in which the patient exhibits severe nasal obstruction and inability to sense airflow despite complete nasal patency. 94 ",21.144584180494746,10.665699828220616

These priors had limited impacts on posterior probabilities as shown by sensitivity analysis. Interestingly, there was some discrepancies between experts and for some clinical profiles (posterior densities very different from priors). These discrepancies may reflect several mechanisms inherent to dichotomous scoring system and clinical decision-making. Three of the four profiles where either the expert did not agree or where posterior densities changed from priors densities included increased rectal temperature (≥39.2°C). Although very simple to understand, categorization of a dynamic continuous biologic process has some limitations. For example, a 39.2°C calf with slight nasal discharge and a 40.5°C calf with bilateral purulent nasal discharge would have received the same clinical score. However, most of clinicians would admit that the probability of BRD in these two calves are quite different. The clinical thinking and reasoning is impacted when estimating the risk (best guess) of BRD probability by the spectrum of clinical signs included in a scoring system. This process would indeed influence the predicted probability. This may also explain why some posterior densities where significantly different from prior densities because LCM models considers the information lost in the categorization process.",20.84155330583021,7.823017344212509

The principal fecal sources are livestock and poultry, followed by wildlife and companion animals. 70 Manure from cattle, horses, pigs, and poultry is routinely processed and used as farm and commercial fertilizer. An additional source of agricultural exposure to infectious agents is the use of biosolids (sludge) from municipal waste water treatment plants, 73 where pathogens surviving sewage treatment are a potential health threat. Protozoan cysts can survive in water as long as 180 days; helminth (worm) ova can survive in soil seven years; bacteria and viruses may live up to a year. 74, 75 Additionally, fecally contaminated water from animal feeding operations may leach into surface or ground water. On-farm recycling can also release pathogens into the environment. Manure contains numerous eukaryotes (protozoa), as well as anaerobic, aerobic, and facultatively aerobic bacteria that contribute to the decomposition of manure. 76 For this reason, manure is stored and decomposed as an aerated liquid slurry concentrate. Sludge and lagoon water are removed periodically and applied to farmland. Unprocessed sewage may be carried from lagoons and storage ponds into overland flow or subsurface water. Obviously, the occupational hazards of waste water workers would also be applicable in these situations. Waterborne hazards in the agricultural watershed include protozoa, bacteria, viruses, and helminths. Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia spp. are the protozoal pathogens of primary concern. Of lesser concern are Entamoeba histolytica, Toxoplasma gondii, and Balantidium coli. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] 70 Anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria make up the bulk of the feces.

The measurement of any of these eosinophil proteins may indicate the activity and turnover of the eosinophil granulocyte. Currently, ECP is measured in serum/plasma, but measurements in nasal lavage fluid, sputum, and possibly saliva are interesting alternatives, since ECP in these biological fluids more accurately reflects the local process. The advantages and disadvantages of measuring ECP in various biological fluids will be discussed below, and the current evidence that ECP may be a useful complement to the diagnostic armamentarium for monitoring and characterizing disease activity in the allergic patient. The emerging evidence of the clinical usefulness of urine measurement of EDN as alternative to serum ECP measurement to reflect eosinophil turnover and activity will also be considered. instrument for characterizing and monitoring inflammatory processes in the airways. 11, 48 This has been particularly shown in patients with asthma, chronic obstructive respiratory disease, and cystic fibrosis. In most cases, sputum has to be induced by hypertonic saline and cells in the sputum need to be separated from the supernatant in order to analyze mediators released from inflammatory cells. The relatively time consuming and complicated procedures required to achieve this are probably the main obstacles for a more widespread use of sputum measurement as a clinical tool. An alternative and much simpler procedure is the measurement of specific markers of various cells in whole sputum extracts. The numbers of eosinophil granulocytes in sputum have been estimated using ECP and several publications show that the numbers of eosinophils measured in this way correlate well with disease activity in asthma and are reduced as a consequence of corticosteroid treatment. An interesting alternative to sputum is saliva, since we showed recently that asthmatics have significantly raised levels of ECP in saliva that are reduced by corticosteroid treatment. 49 Still, however, we do not know what the ECP levels in saliva actually reflect, as they may be indicative of either systemic or local eosinophil activity. In addition, the measurements of specific cell markers in nasal lavage fluids or ear secretions have been widely used, and the usefulness of such measurements in the understanding of cellular involvement has been clearly indicated. 50 However, their clinical application is still not established.",16.45115023764777,7.823365768487083

The presence of t-PA mRNA was noted in mucinous cells in the presence of allergic nasal mucosa, whereas it was not detected in mucinous cells of normal nasal mucosa. These results indicated that t-PA produced by mucinous cells is secreted promptly into the nasal cavity during allergic rhinitis. Furthermore, we reported that u-PA expression was noted in normal nasal mucosa, but compared with that in allergic nasal mucosa there was very little of it. In fibrinautography of nasal discharge, u-PA was markedly detected in allergic patients [8] . Akerlund et al. measured fibrinogen in nasal discharge and reported that it was increased in the presence of viral upper respiratory inflammation; they supposed that fibrinolytic peptides were generated to participate in inflammatory and defense processes [10] . Nasal allergy is characterized by large amounts of serous rhinorrhea. That production of u-PA increases in allergic rhinitis suggests that u-PA activity may help with the passage of large amounts of rhinorrhea by reducing its viscosity. Additionally, it is thought that t-PA acts as an adjunct to treat a large quantity of nasal discharge effectively because of the finding that t-PA has a rapid production turnover and secretion in allergic nasal mucosa. In our study of normal nasal mucosa, t-PA mRNA appeared in mucosal epithelia, and t-PA activity was noted in nasal discharge according to fibrinautography [8] . Thus, t-PA may constitutively adjust the viscosity of the discharge, even in nonallergic tissue.

It is conceivable that PAI-1 functions in circumferential tissue and promotes fibrosis in allergic nasal tissue. Thus, PAI-1 also is secreted into nasal cavity in allergic rhinitis and adjusts the fluidity of nasal discharge. Only u-PA increased in parallel with an increase of PAI -1 in allergic rhinitis, whereas the t-PA concentration did not change. It shows that not t-PA but u-PA acts while competing with PAI-1 in allergic rhinitis.

Nasal discharge in respiratory infections is a complex mixture of plasma and glandular exudates with cellular elements (e.g., goblet cells, plasma cells, and neutrophils) of variable composition that changes over the course of the infection and severity of the inflammatory response (Eccles 1983 ). The first phase of nasal discharge consists of a glandular secretion reflex caused by stimulation of the upper airway's trigeminal nerves. Studies have demonstrated that intranasal administration of ipratropium inhibits nasal secretions in the first 4 days of a common cold (e.g., when it is caused by coronavirus) (Akerlund et al. 1993; Hayden et al. 1996) . The color of the nasal discharge may change from watery clear to yellow and green during the course of the respiratory tract infection and this reflects the severity of the inflammatory response rather than the etiology of the infection (Stockley et al. 2001) . The green or yellow color of nasal discharge is often regarded as a clinical marker of bacterial superinfection and clinical indication to antibiotic treatment, but there is no evidence that supports this concept (Murray et al. 2000) . The color change is related to the recruitment of leukocytes into the airway lumen (Stockley et al. 2001) . Neutrophils and activated monocytes contain chromatic, green granules (azurophil granules) containing myeloperoxidase with heme pigment. The more leukocytes present in nasal discharge the more colorful the nasal discharge appears (Stockley et al. 2001) .

A rhinoscopic exam helps to further investigate signs of obstruction. A light source (preferably headlight) with or without magnification, nasal speculum, or halogen otoscope with a large ear speculum can be used. Keeping eyes and mind open assists in detecting interesting findings. The first landmark to be identified by anterior rhinoscopy is the nasal valve (see Fig. 3 ), where the vestibular cutaneous and the mucosal lining merge, shaping the narrowest point of the nasal cavity. The inferior turbinate, middle turbinate, anterior aspect of the middle meatus (Fig. 6 ), septal integrity, and degree of septal deviation should be visualized next, followed by the assessment of patency of the nasal passages, degree of hypertrophy, deformity, or asymmetry of the structures. Attention should be paid to the color and thickness of the mucosal lining, septal integrity, and deviation. The origin of the nasal discharge should be searched for and its quantity, quality (watery, exudative, frankly purulent, crusty), and smell should be evaluated. The differentiation between middle turbinate and polyps sometimes might be difficult. The middle turbinate may appear with pseudopolypoid hypertrophic lining of the mucosa, but it is a single structure of firm consistency, relatively immobile, and sensitive to touch. The color of the middle turbinate also is more like the rest of the nasal mucosa and not as ashy and transparent as a polyp. Acute inflammatory changes commonly seen by anterior rhinoscopy are hyperemia and edema of the nasal mucosa covered by exudate. In response to allergens, characteristic signs include pale, bluish, bulging, watery mucosa. Visualization of purulent discharge draining down the middle meatus and facial tenderness on palpation over one or more sinuses with or without facial and periorbital edema is very suggestive of a sinus involvement. By applying a Q-tip, the patency of the nasal passage down to the nasopharynx (notice: not ""up"" to the nasopharynx) can be assessed, and suspicious structures, which may be a turbinate, a polyp, thick mucus, or any other sort of growth can be checked. This method can provide immediate, magic relief by gently squeezing against the edematous turbinates with a Q-tip soaked in decongestant. A gross functional assessment can be obtained by • Asking the patient to breathe in and out separately with each side of the nose. • Watching for mist formation while the patient breathes over some polished surface. • Listening with the stethoscope for nasal airflow. • Watching the patient blow his or her nose, checking for the effort, appearance and smell of the discharge.

Subjective symptoms include a sore throat, malaise, shivering (chills), shortness of breath, muscle aches and weakness, fatigue, and a loss of appetite and headaches (Snow et al. 2001; Wat 2004; Eccles 2005; Kennedy et al. 2012) . Febrile seizures are a rare but important symptom in young children up to 6 years of age (Schuchmann et al. 2011) . Symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections have been traditionally classified as early or late (Jackson et al. 1958; Eccles 2005) . The early symptoms are those that develop quickly and resolve rapidly after 1-2 days, like headaches, sneezing, chills, sore throat, and malaise. In children a high fever may be observed, complicated by seizures in some cases (Monto et al. 2000; Schuchmann et al. 2011) . Late symptoms include nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, and cough. The later symptoms develop over several days and are present one week after experimental infection (Jackson et al. 1958; Eccles 2005) . The development of sneezing before coughing in patients with a common cold may be partly explained by the involvement of the upper airways first and the infection subsequent spread to the lower respiratory tract (Eccles 2005) .",20.12640230073995,8.663641005506747

Syphacia muris pinworms usually inhabit the cecum and Rodentolepis (Hymenolepis) spp. tapeworms the small intestine. Detection of helminths in gross specimens may be enhanced by the use of a dissecting microscope. Incubation of a section of intestine in saline for a short period of time may also facilitate detection by allowing worms to migrate out of the dark fecal matter into the more transparent saline. Pinworms of the genera S. muris also deposit ova on the perineum and can thus be detected by perineal tape testing. For this test, a piece of clear cellophane tape is applied to the perineal skin, placed on a microscope slide, and examined for typical banana-shaped ova. This test offers the advantage of being usable in live animals. As an alternative, fecal flotation may be used to detect pinworm or cestode ova.",20.88598325858015,8.420773588153962

Moderate-to-severe anatomic deviations of the septum might cause a constant unilateral obstruction. A tumor might also present with the symptom of nasal blockage. Unilateral nasal obstruction that increases with time, possibly with pain or bloody discharge, suggests a possible sinister pathology in the nasal, paranasal, or nasopharyngeal cavities. A foreign body or NP might also cause unilateral obstruction. Patients with rhinosinusitis and other mucosal diseases most often experience alternating nasal obstruction, usually combined with anterior discharge, postnasal discharge, or both. The mucus might vary in quantity, quality, and color somewhat, depending on the cause of the disorder. Rhinosinusitis symptoms and signs include those seen with allergic or nonallergic rhinitis. 158 Nasal obstruction, nasal discharge, and hyposmia are all symptoms consistent with the diagnosis of rhinosinusitis. 12 2. Symptom severity scoring. Once the relevant rhinosinusitis symptoms have been itemized, they need to be individually quantified. This will help define the magnitude of a patient's disease and allow for more refined assessments of interventions. The scoring can be as simple as a dichotomy indicating the presence or absence of a given symptom. The most common symptom scoring range in clinical trials of upper respiratory diseases has 4 options: 0, none; 1, mild; 2, moderate; and 3, severe. 227 A 6-point Likert scale would range as follows: 0, none-absent; 1, very mild; 2, mild; 3, moderate; 4, severe; and 5, very severe. This scale has been used to identify which symptoms are typically the most problematic for patients with CRS (Table 11) . 230 An-other scoring system option is a visual analogue scale that ranges from 0 (no symptoms) to 100 (maximum severity). The Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters (representing the AAAAI; the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology; and the Joint Council of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology) has developed a method for assessing severity of symptoms of allergic rhinitis. It includes an assessment of nasal symptom severity, an assessment of nonnasal symptom severity, a global assessment of nasal and nonnasal symptom severity, an assessment of QOL issues related to allergic rhinitis, and the effectiveness and adverse profile of current and past rhinitis medications. 232 This method for severity assessment of allergic rhinitis symptoms still requires internal and external validation. Nonetheless, it appears to have potential for both assessing patient management and facilitating clinical research. In addition, by using this method as a guideline, a variation of it can be suggested and could be adapted for evaluating rhinosinusitis. Although patients might characterize the severity of rhinosinusitis as mild, moderate, or severe on the basis of one dominating symptom, there is often a mixed degree of severity of the individual symptoms that comprise the full clinical picture.",18.148533809546457,8.15082090986504

Garza et al. (1997) demonstrated that sea gull feces collected from the banks of TSV infected ponds in Texas during the 1995 TSV epizootic contained infectious TSV. They hypothesized that shrimp eating birds transmit TSV to other ponds or farms through defecation of TSV infected feces with subsequent ingestion of the infected fecal matter by scavenging shrimp. Water boatmen are commonly found in large numbers in shrimp farms. They possess a sucking proboscis and will prey on small postlarval shrimp Lightner, 1995 Lightner, , 1996a . Limited histological and TSV in situ hybridization (ISH) analyses of experimentally exposed and wild water boatmen samples indicate that these insects transport TSV within their intestinal contents but are not directly infected by the virus (Hasson, unpublished data; Lightner, 1996a,b) . Similar to sea birds, water boatmen are believed to be capable of disseminating infectious virus through their fecal matter, or, perhaps they spread the virus upon death when they are consumed by shrimp. Similar to the water boatmen, red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus), grass shrimp (Palaemontes sp.), and sea trout (Cynoscion nebulosus) are not infected by the virus as indicated by experimental TSV per os exposure and histologica analyses (Erickson et al., 1997) .

Health checks assessed calves on the basis of their general appearance, coat condition, gut fill, and fecal consistency, with definitions presented in Figure 1 . Dehydration levels were assessed by monitoring calves for sunken eyes and by performing a tent test to measure skin elasticity in which the skin of the neck was pinched and the time for the skin to return to its normal position was recorded (Ghanem et al., 2012) . Health checks were also used to monitor signs of nasal and ocular discharge and navel infection (a disease resulting from bacterial infection via the umbilical cord soon after birth). Rectal temperatures were taken once per animal during each health check using a digital thermometer (MC-343; Omron, Kyoto, Japan). Temperatures were split into 3 categories: low (≤37.9°C), normal (38-39.5°C), and high (≥39.6°C). As part of the health checks, RR was measured by observing flank movements to record the time taken for each calf to complete 10 breaths; this was then used to calculate RR (breaths/min). Calves were defined as being clinically ill when they were observed as being diarrheic. To be considered diarrheic, a calf had to be witnessed passing malodorous feces with a loose to watery consistency, with the possibility of blood present in severe cases (a score of 2 or 3 for fecal consistency; Figure 1 ). For calves that had not been observed passing feces but were suspected of being diarrheic due to loose fecal matter present on the top of the tail or hind legs, a fecal sample was taken to confirm whether the calf was diarrheic. From all diarrheic calves a fecal sample was collected for analysis to confirm NCD as the cause of illness and to identify the specific pathogen responsible. Once deemed clinically ill, calves were treated accordingly with electrolytes (Dexolyte; Bayer New Zealand Ltd., Auckland, New Zealand) and antibiotics (Amphoprim; Virbac New Zealand Ltd., Hamilton, New Zealand) as needed to help them overcome the disease.",22.598964432399587,8.606599262686958

A large number of chlamydial elementary bodies can be found, continuously or intermittently, in feces (up to 10 5 infectious units per gram of feces), urine, tears, nasal discharge, oropharyngeal mucus, and crop-milk (limited to Columbiformes) of infected birds. Unfortunately, not enough information is available about the period during which the clinically symptomatic birds or asymptomatic carriers can transmit the infection. In this way, a high concentration of bacterial particles can be aerosolized, and the wing flapping of a large number of birds in an enclosed collection can further facilitate this overhead suspension. Therefore, the infection can occur either by inhalation or by ingestion of these infectious particles. The following must always be kept in mind: u Infection takes place very quickly. u C. psittaci will replicate in the lungs, air sacs, and pericardium of infected birds, as soon as 24 hours after infection. u Within 48 hours, C. psittaci is present in the bloodstream. u After 72 hours, the infected birds are able to shed C. psittaci in the environment.

Also there was a signifi cant increase in tidal volume in the chair group after 1 minute of sitting out (403 ± 118 ml) compared with baseline (314 ± 105 ml). There was no diff erence in the electric bed group for all physiological parameters. The chair group had a better CPAX score on discharge from intensive care (chair group 24; electric bed group 13) and on discharge from the hospital (chair group 39; electric bed group 16). There were no adverse cardiovascular responses to either position. Conclusion Sitting suitable critically ill patients out into a chair is safe and can signifi cantly improve the arterial blood gas measurement and the tidal volume when compared with sitting a patient into the sitting position in an electric bed. Reference Introduction Sputum is essential for the protection of the respiratory tract but also plays a signifi cant role in the pathophysiology of lung disease [1] . This is evident in critical care where high sputum loads contribute to respiratory failure [2] . The quantity of sputum produced by a patient can impact on key decisions such as weaning, extubation and discharge. We undertook a survey to establish whether there was a consensus on how we quantify sputum on our intensive therapy unit (ITU). Methods We conducted a multidisciplinary team questionnaire of our 28-bed tertiary ITU. Staff were asked how they quantifi ed sputum load in intubated patients. They were also asked to rate statements on a fi ve-point scale pertaining to sputum characteristics. The results were analysed in Excel 2010. Results One hundred members of staff completed the sputum production in intensive therapy (SPIT) questionnaire (21% doctors, 71% nurses, 8% physiotherapists). Sputum load was deemed to be important or essential by more than 95% of respondents when making decisions to extubate or decanulate. The quantifi cation of sputum was inconsistent: 39% of respondents counted the frequency of suctioning, 24% measured the quantity of sputum in the suction tubing, whereas 25% used another method. An eff ective cough, consistency and colour were felt to be more important features of sputum than blood staining. Conclusion Our results showed a very high level of agreement on the importance of knowing sputum load for decisions to extubate, decanulate or discharge from the ITU. In contrast, there was little consensus on how we should quantify sputum load in ventilated patients. This lack of standard approach may contribute to uncertainty in the clinical decision-making process. We have developed an objective sputum scoring system. Components identifi ed as important by our survey such as suction frequency, sputum consistency and colour are included. We have recognised the benefi ts of the standardised Bristol stool chart to facilitate communication and believe this can be achieved with sputum load in ventilated patients.",20.48503847600113,9.165409794334387

Trigeminal dysfunction. Many of these disorders involve afferent trigeminal and efferent autonomic nerves. They are often dismissed as a functional disorder of nasal complaints without physical findings and lumped together as vasomotor rhinitis (idiopathic rhinitis). This is a misnomer that does no justice to the patient or his or her complaints. Perennial noninfectious, nonallergic rhinitis is an alternative term. There are no clear vascular, motor, or inflammatory cellular patterns. Inquiries about key historical issues can classify and direct therapy to these symptomatic and frustrated patients. These individuals appear to have increased afferent trigeminal nerve sensitivity to inhaled irritants, disordered axon response mechanisms, and potentially altered dorsal horn processing of nociceptive input that contribute to increased perception of these mucosal or visceral stimuli and hence greater complaints of symptoms. An alternative term, irritant rhinitis, describes the syndrome more accurately. 128 Patients with irritant rhinitis typically complain of nasal congestion and rhinorrhea in response to weather, temperature and humidity changes, and irritants, such as tobacco smoke, 129 gasoline fumes, perfumes and cleaning solutions, beer, and wine. An important function of type C nociceptive neurons is their role in immediate neurogenic responses to noxious stimuli. 130 New information about the nature of nociceptive sensors, such as the capsaicinsensitive ion channel receptor (VR1, recently renamed transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily protein or TRPV1) offers a new understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying responses to irritant gases, fine particulate material, cigarette smoke components, osmolarity, and temperature changes. 131 b. Cholinergic rhinitis. The afferent stimuli can recruit overactive parasympathetic cholinergic reflexes that mediate cholinergic (muscarinic receptor M3-mediated) glandular secretion. This mucus hypersecretion might confound observations of mucopurulent discharge and therefore suggest that rhinosinusitis is present. The effectiveness of anticholinergic agents suggests that parasympathetic cholinergic outflow is the major factor contributing to chronic or long-lasting irritant-induced (eg, cold dry air in skiers) nasal discharge in nonallergic rhinitis. Acute stimulation of nociceptive nerves (eg, by eating capsaicin-laden foods that stimulate vanilloid receptor 1 bearing type C trigeminal neurons) also recruits overwhelming lacrimal, nasal, and salivary glandular discharge. When excessive, this is termed cholinergic rhinitis. Again, anticholinergic agents are effective at blocking this CNS trigeminal-facial (Vidian parasympathetic) nerve-mediated reflex. c. Sympathetic dysfunction. Impaired sympathetic outflow can lead to default dilatation of venous sinusoids. This thickens the mucosa and reduces the cross-sectional area for airflow and therefore leads to obstructed nasal airflow. Horner syndrome is an example. d. Other. Hormonal, structural, and neoplastic disorders also lead to symptoms, including referred pain suggestive of rhinosinusitis. The hormones of pregnancy are notorious for causing nasal obstruction symptoms that can be very problematic to patients. This congestion clears with delivery of the placenta. Hypothyroidism leads to sympathetic dysfunction with ineffective noradrenergic effects and the absence of venous sinusoid vasoconstriction that results in default blood pooling and thickening of the nasal mucosa. Drugs that block this vasoconstrictor function (central and peripheral acting antihypertensive agents) will also lead to mucosal thickening and nasal obstruction to airflow.",17.142289004516318,9.65032105905523

Ascending respiratory tract infections, as in other species, are a cause of chronic frontal sinusitis and usually are caused by P. multocida. Chronic frontal sinusitis associated with old dehorning complications such as lowgrade infection, bony skull fragments, or sequestra typically is associated with infection by T. pyogenes or mixed infections that may include T. pyogenes, P. multocida, anaerobes, or miscellaneous gram-negative organisms. Signs of chronic frontal sinusitis include gradual loss of condition and production that may be persistent or intermittent. Unilateral nasal discharge usually is observed, again as a persistent or intermittent complaint. Additional signs include head pressing, an extended head and neck, partially closed eyes, or resting of the muzzle on inanimate objects, all of which signal headache or pain. Intermittent or persistent fever is present. Bony expansions of the sinus may occur, causing asymmetric facial distortion, especially in cattle that do not have significant nasal discharge because of occlusion or obstruction of the opening of the ethmoidal meatus into the nasal cavity. In fact, some cattle have intermittent bony swelling of the sinus that becomes less apparent during times of sinus drainage and subsequent nasal discharge. Palpation or percussion of the frontal bone overlying the affected sinus causes pain, and the patient may be extremely apprehensive when the examiner approaches the head. Bony expansion of the sinus may result in ipsilateral exophthalmos and decreased air movement through the ipsilateral nasal passage (Fig. 4.10) . Neurologic complications, including septic meningitis, dural abscesses, and pituitary abscesses, are possible in neglected cases as a result of erosion through the bony sinus.

Contrary to popular belief, a change in the color or the characteristic of the nasal discharge is not a specific sign of bacterial infection because after a few days of a viral infection, mucopurulent nasal secretions may occur due to an influx of neutrophils. [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] In a recent study, 35 the clinical signs and symptoms significantly associated in a multivariate model with the presence of bacteria included colored nasal discharge, facial pain, and radiologically determined maxillary sinusitis (complete opacity, air-fluid level, or mucosal thickening Ͼ10 mm). The model only had a sensitivity of 69% and a specificity of 64% and therefore could not be used either as a screening tool or as a diagnostic criterion for bacterial rhinosinusitis. The authors of this study concluded that the signs and symptoms of acute rhinosinusitis in patients with mild-to-moderate clinical presentations are poor predictors of the presence of bacteria. 35 In a study by Gwaltney et al 4 (n ϭ 31), 87% of adults with acute onset of URI symptoms demonstrated inflammation within the nose and viscous secretions, sometimes with air bubbles, in the sinuses on CT scan. After 2 weeks without antibiotic therapy, repeat CT scans in 14 subjects revealed that 79% showed either disappearance or marked improvement in the previously identified abnormalities. The point at which a viral URI becomes superinfected with pathogenic bacteria may be determined with repeated sinus aspiration studies. Sinus aspiration studies in adults demonstrate significant bacterial growth in approximately 60% of patients with URI symptoms for 10 days or more. 36 While duration of symptoms beyond 7 days is a moderately sensitive predictor of ABRS, it is relatively nonspecific because duration of symptoms does not reliably distinguish prolonged viral infection from ABRS. 37 Individual cases may fall out of the ""norm"" of this typical progression and have specific findings suggesting bacterial infection (fever, facial erythema and swelling, and severe pain); therefore, clinicians need to rely on clinical judgment when using these guidelines. In general, a diagnosis of ABRS may be made in adults or children with a viral URI that has not resolved after 10 days or worsens after 5 to 7 days and is accompanied by some or all of the following signs or symptoms: nasal drainage, nasal congestion, facial pressure/pain (especially when unilateral and focused in the region of a particular sinus), postnasal drainage, hyposmia/ anosmia, fever, cough, fatigue, maxillary dental pain, and ear pressure/fullness (Table 1) .",17.074930987217666,8.821226702640974

These results indicate that there are clear seasonal-related variations in the exposure to the agents. We hypothesize that, during winter, some mortality of wildcats may be related with the exposure to one or more of the studied agents. This fact could be linked with the higher seroprevalence to FHV and Chlamydophila sp. in winter samples: selective mortality associated to these pathogens would explain why these agents showed lower seroprevalence in the following spring-summer. Although both pathogens course with low mortality in adult domestic cats (Gaskell and Dawson 1998) , nothing is known about the clinical course of these infections in free-living wildcats. In some cases, a chronification of the disease in cats occurs, with clinical signs ranging from sneezing and nasal discharge to corneal edema and blindness (Gaskell and Dawson 1998) .

This early phase of nasal secretion is a reflex glandular secretion that is caused by stimulation of trigeminal nerves in the airway, similar to sneezing. Support for the glandular origin of the early nasal secretions comes from studies on anticholinergic medicines such as ipratropium. These studies have demonstrated that nasal secretions in the first 4 days of a common cold are inhibited by intranasal administration of ipratropium. 25 The nasal discharge also consists of a protein-rich plasma exudate derived from subepithelial capillaries, 28 which may explain why anticholinergics only partly inhibit nasal discharge associated with URTIs. 27 The colour of nasal discharge and sputum is often used as a clinical marker to determine whether or not to prescribe antibiotics but there is no evidence from the literature that supports this concept, 29 since colour changes in nasal discharge or sputum reflect the severity of the inflammatory response 30 rather than the nature of the infection. Much of the literature relates to colour changes in sputum and the lower airways but the same concepts apply to the upper airways and nasal discharge. The colour of nasal discharge may change from clear to yellow to green during the course of an URTI. This colour change is related to the recruitment of leucocytes into the airway lumen and is a hallmark of airway disease. 30 Neutrophils and proinflammatroy monocytes have azurophil granules that are green because of the green protein myeloperoxidase.

This is the most common presenting sign in dogs with upper respiratory disease. Owners that present a dog for sneezing are likely to be accurate in their description of the problem. However, the presence or absence of a nasal discharge may be more difficult to establish. Volume, character, and frequency of the discharge ultimately determine whether the owner will have even observed this sign. The astute owner will report whether the discharge is unilateral or bilateral. In the patient that has a history of sneezing and nasal discharge, instillation of a topical nasal decongestant into each nostril occasionally will provoke sneezing and elicit the nature of any discharge that is present. Sneezing and/or nasal discharge localize the problem to the nose, nasal cavity, and paranasal sinuses. However, thorough examination of the nose and nasal cavity can be difficult, even with the availability of appropriate endoscopy equipment. In addition to careful examination of facial symmetry, the first part of the examination begins in the oral cavity, with emphasis on the maxilla, the hard palate, and the canine teeth.

Virus is mostly shed through nasal discharges to the surrounding environment. An efficient vaccine could prevent virus replication in the airways and thus reduce the virus shedding. There is a positive correlation between virus shedding in nasal secretions and the possibility of a previously uninfected pigs getting infected through aerosol. Therefore, it is pertinent that even vaccines yielding partial protection could slow the rate of influenza transmission. The pigs that received PAV shed significantly less virus through nasal discharge on both DPC 3 and 6 when infected with the antigenic variant or the heterologous strain.

They are particularly useful in the neutral to basic pH range where the output from a xenon lamp is relatively high and where interference from most biological compounds is low. They are specific substrates whose specificity is further enhanced upon cleavage of a single amide bond, because the fluorophore undergoes conversion from the lactone to the quinone state. This process is accompanied by an increase in the de- gree of conjugation and hence stability which leads to an enhancement of the reactivity of the susceptible bonds in the substrate. They are selective substrates because their structure mimics the amino acid sequence in the reactive site of a proteinase's natural substrate.",15.948371337476264,4.600405275640896

Individual calves in pens are examined and assigned a clinical score of 0 (normal), 1 (variation of or slightly abnormal), 2 (abnormal), and 3 (severely abnormal) for temperature, nasal discharge, cough and eye discharge, and ear position. Calves with a total respiratory score over 4 are considered to have respiratory disease based on bronchoalveolar fluid cytology and culture validation (McGuirk, unpublished data, 2007) . All of the calves are scored if there are less than 20 calves. For larger groups, a representative sample up to 50 calves are screened by the scoring system to determine the earliest age of onset and barn, pens, or location of most of the affected calves. In group pens, respiratory disease evaluations are similar but based on the percentage of calves in the pen with abnormal ocular or nasal discharge, abnormal ears, or coughing as shown in Table 5 . With completion of the scoring examinations, a detection rate is calculated by dividing the number of calves currently on treatment for respiratory disease by the total number of calves with a total respiratory score greater than 4. As with enteric disease, the goal is detection of at least 85% of the calves that require treatment, but this goal is rarely met until the farm is trained to use the respiratory screening procedure. With digital thermometers that have a 15-second reading time, an individual examination can be completed in less than 2 minutes per calf. Calves are easiest to examine between milk feedings when they are resting. The nasal discharge, eye, and ear scores can be assigned without entering the calf pen. Spontaneous coughing can also be noted from outside the pen, giving the calf 3 points in that category and obviating the need to use tracheal compression for cough induction. Proactive use of the respiratory scoring system improves early detection, provides more reliable information on case rate, monitors for treatment efficacy, and determines which calves can move into the postweaning group pen.",24.260933998272343,11.81877310977969

A long turnaround time for results, unproven test performance, and limited test availability have made such routine testing impractical. Furthermore, transmission of WNV has occurred in the absence of detectable viraemia or seroconversion in organ donors. 65, 66 Low viral loads in blood and a short duration of viraemia in normal individuals present major problems for nucleic acid amplification testing.

In fact, experimental infection of seronegative calves reproduced the disease observed in the natural outbreak albeit with less severe signs and clinical course. The Koch's postulates were full-filled as the infected animals displayed fever, nasal discharge, moderate leukopenia and a certain degree of viremia, shed the virus with nasal secretions and faeces and seroconverted against the challenge virus. A similar course of infection was observed in lambs, with nasal discharge occurring for a longer period but with less virus being detected in the blood and shed through nasal secretion and faeces. In these animals leukopenia was less profound and long-lasting than in calves. In contrast, inoculated pigs did not show any clinical signs, alteration of WBC counts, viremia and viral shedding. In these animals, detection of low titres of 'Hobi'-like pestivirus antibodies could be associated to a reaction to the antigen in the inoculum rather than to true seroconversion against the challenge virus. However, the fact that the virus was administered intranasally should rule out antibody production in the absence of active infection. Specific antibodies were detected in all inoculated animal species by means of VN using the homologous virus, reaching discrete titres in calves and lambs. When a commercial kit commonly used for detection of BVDV antibodies was employed, OD values in calves were greatly lower than those expected, a finding that had been already observed in a previous study (Decaro et al., 2011) . Although the test has not been fully validated in the ovine and swine species, BVDV ELISA tested negative in lambs and piglets despite the presence of 'Hobi'-like pestivirus VN antibodies. These findings pose some concerns about a possible poor sensitivity of commercial BVDV ELISA tests as for the detection of antibodies against 'Hobi'-like strains, which may affect pestivirus surveillance programs mainly in cattle herds. Therefore, an ELISA test specific for 'Hobi'-like pestivirus antibodies is needed in order to considerably improve the surveillance activity on this new pestiviral species in cattle.",23.3448354384495,11.858351214072865

Several cell types in the human body are susceptible to SARS-CoV infection and replication, which in turn trigger a series of pathological changes (8) . The development of specific diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV is of paramount importance for the effective treatment of infected patients and the prevention of future SARS outbreaks. Nucleocapsid protein (NP) is the most predominant virus-derived structural protein and is shed in large amounts in serum, nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA), throat wash samples, fecal matter, and urine during the early days of infection (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) 15) .

The lack of an effective, sensitive, and easy-to-use assay was considered to be one of the major drawbacks in the prevention of the 2003 SARS outbreak. Hence, the development of an easy-to-use, sensitive, and specific assay for NP could be a way forward to prevent a future SARS pandemic.

It is caused by a diverse group of viruses, each of which has its own collection of syndromes. Except for rhinoviruses, the common cold is only one of the patterns of illness that a particular virus can cause. The symptoms most prevalent in patients with the common cold, in order of prevalence, are throat clearing, nasal obstruction, nasal discharge, cough, and postnasal drip.I5 These symptoms often are found in association with sneezing, sore throat, drowsiness, weakness, dry mouth, and dizziness. In a study by Curley et al,I5 sore throat, sneezing, and drowsiness were found to have decreased significantly by day 2 or 3 of the illness. Cough, nasal discharge, postnasal drip, and throat clearing frequently still were present on day 14 after onset. In young children, RSV and parainfluenza viruses cause cough by direct invasion of the lower respiratory tract. These same viruses cause cough in older children and adults indirectly by stimulation of the upper respiratory tract. Coronaviruses produce a syndrome that is typical of the common cold but are more likely to produce myalgias, headaches, and general malaise than rhinoviruses or RSVs. Like the parainfluenza viruses, coronaviruses commonly will produce a bit more fever than the rhinoviruses and the RSVs. Adenoviruses are well known to produce a syndrome similar to the common cold but much more commonly produce conjunctivitis and laryngitis as part of the syndrome. Adenovirus types 3 and 7 cause pharyngoconjunctival fever distinguished by severe conjunctivitis and pharyngitis with minor contribution of other cold symptoms. Pharyngoconjunctival fever most often is found in summer when people are swimming in lakes and other nonchlorinated pools. The echoviruses and coxsackieviruses can produce coryza alone, an acute episode of rhinitis with minimal other symptoms. This is a summer disease also.

Nasal decongestants improve cold symptoms in adults and improve nasal patency in children; however, their side effects, such as rebound obstruction and nasal epithelial drying, have impeded their use [90] . First-generation antihistamines have shown favourable effects upon nasal symptoms in adult studies, probably because of their anticholinergic effects [91] . Topical application of ipratropium (an anticholinergic drug) at a moderate dose, which is minimally absorbed across biologic membranes, reduces rhinorrhoea and sneezing in colds [92] . The routine use of cough medications in healthy children and adults should pose no potential problem, but they should be used with caution in patients with chronic obstructive airway disease. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been shown to reduce symptoms in rhinovirus infections [93] by reducing fever, headache, sore throat and cough. This may be because prostaglandins are amongst the inflammatory mediators responsible in the pathogenesis of rhinovirus colds. Intranasal interferon alone is not a practical treatment option for the common cold; however, when it is used in combination with ipratropium and a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, it can significantly reduce symptoms in experimental colds [94] .",18.916451611323293,7.789073215296962

Another is that under stress, cattle defecate over one another, and fecal matter from one cow can contaminate the hides of other cattle. Second, when this meat was ground into hamburger, it increased the surface area of the meat by several orders of magnitude, thereby allowing the pathogen a great deal of exposure. Third, once this hamburger meat was shipped to Jack in the Box restaurants, it appears that hamburgers were being systematically undercooked, below industry standards. This allowed the E. coli to survive and enter the hosts' systems.

It is true that the majority of data regarding first reports of infectious diseases events currently derives from informal sources like media reports and the Internet. Digital surveillance systems aim in detecting events with epidemic potential earlier than official notifications. 10 The Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN) is one of the most important event-based surveillance systems that systematically scans a multitude of such informal sources, including web sites, electronic discussion forums, news reports, online newspapers and the email listserv of the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED-mail, www.promedmail.org/) 11 for unusual disease events and rumors for outbreaks.

Nasal washings of volunteers experimentally infected with rhinovirus showed a 100-fold increase in PMN concentration 1 to 2 days after inoculation. 20 This influx of PMNs coincides with onset of symptoms and correlates with the presence of a colored nasal discharge. 21 A yellow or white nasal discharge may result from the higher number of PMNs, whereas the enzymatic activity of PMNs (due to myeloperoxidase and other enzymes) may cause a green nasal discharge. A potent chemoattractant for PMNs is produced by cells in culture infected with rhinovirus. 22 This chemoattractant has been identified as interleukin-8 (IL-8). 23 Elevated causes bronchiolitis in children 2 years or younger, influenza viruses cause febrile respiratory illness with severe lower respiratory tract involvement, adenoviruses cause pharyngoconjunctival fever, parainfluenza viruses cause croup in young children, HBoV is associated with wheezing, and enteroviruses cause a variety of illnesses, including aseptic meningitis and herpangina.",23.365966880841906,8.991023046854485

The majority of cases reported in the United States are from southeastern and south central states, extending as far north as Missouri. 23 Clinical signs include wheezing, sneezing, unilateral seropurulent nasal discharge, epistaxis, and possibly a visible mass within the nares. 19 Exposure to contaminated water 6 and history of trauma 19, 22 have been suggested as predisposing factors. Some authors suggest hunting and roaming dogs are at increased risk due to increased exposure to these factors. 22 Animal-to-animal and animal-to-human transmission have not been documented, 22 and could be explained by recent research suggesting that there are multiple host-specific strains. 24 The typical lesion is a single, unilateral nasal polyp with a characteristic ""strawberry"" appearance that is soft, pink, and bleeds easily. 22, 25 Pinpoint white foci, representing mature sporangia, may be visible grossly. 6, 19 Nasal scrape smears are preferred over fine-needle aspiration since lesions tend to bleed, and demonstration of intact spherules with endospores free and within sporangia is diagnostic. 25 However, sporangia are not often seen in cytology as they do not exfoliate readily. 22 Alternatively, histopathology on excisional biopsies are both therapeutic and diagnostic and show polyploid proliferation of the submucosa, hyperplasia, and metaplasia of the overlying epithelium, granulomatous to pyogranulomatous inflammation, and sporangia in various stages of maturation ( Figure 1B ). 22 Endospores are round, eosinophilic to magenta to basophilic bodies that are 5-15 µm in diameter with internal eosinophilic globules and thick walls. 23 Stains that may be helpful in identifying endospores include toluidine blue, periodic acid-Schiff reaction, methenamine, Wright's, and Gridley's. 19, 23 The preferred method of treatment for nasal rhinosporidiosis is surgical excision of lesions; however, there have been reports of slowly progressive recurrence after surgery. Other treatments include systemic ketoconazole or dapsone; however, these drugs are often associated with side effects and there is limited information regarding efficacy in canine patients. 19, 22 Nonspecific infectious rhinitis Nonspecific infectious rhinitis is rare in dogs and commonly occurs secondary to nasal trauma, allergy, or inhalation of foreign material. Clinical signs include sneezing, coughing, and watery-mucous to suppurative nasal discharge. Depending on the severity of infection, these signs may be accompanied by fever, lethargy, and anorexia. There are no specific agents associated with this clinical presentation; although, canine parainfluenza virus, canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2), and Bordetella bronchiseptica are the most commonly isolated agents. 26 Morphological changes are nonspecific and include mucosal hyperemia and swelling from edema fluid and glandular secretions. Histologically, these changes vary upon the severity and chronicity of the disease. Initially, there is minimal ballooning degeneration of the nasal epithelium accompanied by ciliary loss, submucosal edema, and occasional infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells. In more severe cases with secondary bacterial invasion, the mucosa is infiltrated by neutrophils and there is necrosis and desquamation of the epithelium. In chronic stages, the lamina propria is thickened by abundant fibrous connective tissue and there is mucosal gland atrophy and epithelial dysplasia. Because predisposing factors are commonly unknown, treatments are targeted to manage nonspecific respiratory symptoms and secondary bacterial infections.",16.55490534398954,7.8720730564286345

PAR is caused by toxigenic strains of Pasteurella multocida, whereas NPAR is the result of toxigenic strains of Bordetella bronchiseptica. In both forms, the bacteria attach to cilia in the nasal passages and the cytotoxin production causes hypoplasia of nasal turbinates. Clinical signs include sneezing, deviated snouts, and, in cases of PAR, bloody nasal discharge occurring in a large number of grow-finish pigs. Mortality is low but the reduced growth that results due to AR makes it economically important. Beacause the cytotoxins are responsible for AR, isolation of either bacterium from nasal passages is not sufficient for diagnosis. In addition, B. bronchiseptica and P. multocida colonize the lung leading to bronchopneumonia causing cough and dyspnea in pigs postweaning, often part of PRDC (Hansen et al., 2010) . Therefore, examination of nasal turbinates at slaughter is the recommended method for diagnosis of AR (Gatlin et al., 1996) .

Recently, leptospirosis was the cause of epidemic disease in Ecuador after the breakdown of infrastructure caused by flooding (74) .

Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFA) are volatile compounds that are directly correlated to the quantitative and qualitative bacterial population of the gastrointestinal tract. An increasing number of publications assessing gastrointestinal health and inflammation include SCFA measurements in fecal matter. However, there is scant information about the repeatability and reliability of SCFA analysis in dogs and cats. As SCFA are highly volatile and unstable, and our preliminary results in feces from both dogs and cats showed high variability for the same animal and between healthy animals, we investigated repeatability and variability of SCFA measurement.",18.516852889659773,7.532474534184704

However, it takes several days to obtain the results of urine culture for confirming an infection. In the case of febrile UTI, treatment delayed by more than 48 hr may cause deleterious effects such as renal scarring [20]. Therefore, clinicians may often make decisions to prescribe antibiotics or perform renal sonography based on the findings of initial urinalysis. However, previous studies have shown that positive urinalysis findings and/or positive urine culture may not reflect a true case of UTI. A considerable portion of patients with UTIs determined by positive urine culture may have negative urinalysis findings; alternatively, some patients without UTIs but with viral infections may have abnormal urinalysis findings such as pyuria, asymptomatic bacteriuria, or both [1121]. Therefore, patients with false-positive findings run the risk of receiving unnecessary antibiotic treatments and undergoing imaging.

The Jupyter notebook includes widgets to set parameters, initiate a simulation run, and visualize diffusing substrates and cell agents. In turn, we also developed a protocol to deploy the PhysiCell model and the Jupyter notebook interface on nanoHUB as a cloud-hosted, interactive model. This allows developers to rapidly convert a locally executable, command-line model to a cloud-hosted shared model with graphical interface in a matter of minutes to hours (depending upon testing speed on nanoHUB).",9.386116471389276,5.207830578361719

Overall, higher levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA were detected in nasal swabs of aged animals compared to young adult animals. SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in throat swabs peaked at day 1 p.i. in young adult and day 4 p.i. in aged animals and decreased more rapidly over time, compared to nasal swabs, but could still be detected intermittently up to day 10 p.i.

Similar to those of metabolites, the total numbers of significantly altered lipids (>1 log2 fold change (FC) <-1, typically P <0.05) in the severe and mild 10 groups (S1 vs H, S2 vs H, M1 vs. H, and M2 vs H) were similar, which are significantly less than the number of altered lipids in the fatality group, indicating that the alterations of lipid metabolism were much more dramatic in fatal COVID-19 patients than in survivors. Besides, for either severe or mild groups of patients, many of their lipids had not returned to normal before their discharge from hospital ( Figure 3B , S2 vs H and M2 vs H), even though SARS-CoV-2 could not be detected and the major clinical signs had disappeared in these patients based on official discharge criteria.

Understanding the causes of antibiotic failure inspires the development of new drugs and informs clinical treatment strategies [3] [4] [5] . These failure mechanisms are broadly classified into three distinct categories (i.e., resistance, 5 persistence, and tolerance), which are characterized by the change in drug concentration and exposure time required to kill bacteria 6 . For example, resistance is characterized by genetic mutations or phenotypic changes which result in bacteria requiring significantly higher concentrations of antibiotic (minimum inhibitory concentration, MIC) to be lethal. By contrast, bacteria exhibiting tolerance or persistence require increased drug exposure time (minimum 10 duration for killing, MDK), with the latter exhibiting a biphasic killing profile (Fig. 1A) . Further, bacteria populations become tolerant through environmental conditions or genetic mutations, whereas persistence is an actively maintained, non-heritable state exhibited by a subpopulation of bacteria. Discriminating between these survival strategies employed by bacteria is crucial for the development of new drugs and clinical treatment decisions 6 . 15",9.402853256619906,3.4522632121095334
