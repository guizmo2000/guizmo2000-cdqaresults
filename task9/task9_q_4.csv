Infectious disease surveillance should enable (i) the timely detection of outbreaks, (ii) the quantification of health problems, (iii) the identification of subpopulations at risk, and (iv) the assessment of temporal trends including the impact of control strategies [3, 4] . National surveillance systems typically collect data from patients seeking care at sentinel hospitals or other healthcare facilities and can provide useful information for public health purposes. However, hospital-based surveillance generally underestimates disease burden since only a proportion of cases visit a hospital for care [5] . Low case detection may also undermine the value of hospital-based surveillance for outbreak detection. Moreover, if patients captured by the surveillance system are not representative of all cases in the community, surveillance statistics could lead to erroneous interpretations of disease patterns and misallocation of prevention resources. In particular, sex, socioeconomic status, or distance can affect healthcare seeking at hospitals, especially where access to care is limited [6] [7] [8] [9] .

While longer delays in local transmission to the summer in countries in the Northern hemisphere could have substantially aided pandemic mitigation, due to seasonal factors [3] and school vacations [10, 11] leading to lower peak attack rates [12] , the observed delays in the present pandemic suggest entry screening provided around 1-2 weeks of additional time for preparation and planning. While our study focused on the impact of entry screening, some nations also implemented other containment and mitigation measures, such as isolation of suspected or confirmed cases, quarantine of their contacts with or without antiviral chemoprophylaxis, school closures or other social distancing measures, and public health campaigns to improve hygiene. Most nations enhanced their influenza surveillance. If countries that expended greater effort into entry screening also had more effective containment and mitigation measures in the general population, these might have led us to overestimate the effect of entry screening. Conversely, if countries that expanded greater effort into entry screening also tended to have better influenza surveillance and were able to identify local transmission earlier, we may have underestimated the effect of entry screening.

A delay of 1-2 weeks could be useful if the additional time permits more comprehensive planning and preparation for a local epidemic, or shortens the time required for other pandemic mitigation measures such as school closures to be sustained.

Some of these responses are individual responsibilities, while others deal with compliance to governmental mandates or laws. Protective behaviors can be broadly grouped into three categories: preventive, avoidant, and management [6] . Preventive behaviors may be non-pharmaceutical measures (e.g., hand washing, sanitation, and mask wearing) or pharmaceutical measures (e.g., vaccination uptake). Avoidant behaviors include staying home from work or school, avoiding public or crowded settings, and complying with quarantine constraints, all examples of non-pharmaceutical measures. Management behaviors include taking pharmaceutical antiviral medications and seeking medical help. More examples of health-protective behaviors are shown in Table 1 . An understanding of the demographic determinants of protective human behavior can inform the communication strategies of both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions during an epidemic/ pandemic disease outbreak. In addition, determining the drivers that are responsible for these protective behaviors can inform mathematical models that are intended to provide decision support. Mathematical modeling is typically used to understand disease dynamics and assess the impact of different interventions [7, 8] . Recently, several models [9-12] have attempted to include human behavior but their impact has been limited by the lack of quantitative consensus regarding how behavior is influenced by different demographic characteristics. As such, understanding these behavioral factors is crucial for devising public health campaigns, providing information to parametrize mathematical models, and ultimately limiting disease spread.",47.90954668212873,20.759204256645138

All highlight the importance of supporting ongoing surveillance efforts as the cornerstone of disease prevention. Early recognition of an outbreak allows control measures to be initiated in a timely way that can shift the epidemic curve, reducing its impact and possibly its geographic spread. Enhanced surveillance measures with an emphasis on innovation, transparency and incorporation of the One Health model are critical to epidemic preparedness measures in the future. It is also crucial to encourage research during outbreaks through rapid data sharing to facilitate rapid response efforts, as is promoted through organisations such as the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC) [9] . Vaccination, if it can be implemented in time, can also bend the epidemic curve. Promoting platforms for rapid vaccine development and deployment could provide a significant boost to outbreak control. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a public-private coalition that has been working to halt epidemics through the development of appropriate vaccines, is promoting both pathogenspecific and agnostic platform approaches [10] . These efforts deserve wide support and encouragement. In order for vaccines to be effectively employed, the growing threat of vaccine hesitancy worldwide must also be countered using methods grounded in the social sciences. Governments, through their public health agencies and in coordination with efforts like the Global Health Security Agenda, must adopt preparedness plans and exercise them before outbreaks become major threats [11] . Emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases will continue to present significant challenges in the coming years, and investing in novel methods for detection, prevention as well as therapeutics should remain priorities for the global public health community.",46.6109931737613,18.906624827250933

What are the hospital infection control issues associated with a SARS outbreak, and what are the most effective approaches to address these issues? What type State and local health departments continue to face unprecedented challenges in preparing for, recognizing, and responding to threats to the public's health. The attacks of 11 September 2001 and the ensuing anthrax mailings of 2001 highlighted the public health readiness and response hurdles posed by intentionally caused injury and illness. At the same time, recent natural disasters have highlighted the need for comparable public health readiness and response capabilities. Public health readiness and response activities can be conceptualized similarly for intentional attacks, natural disasters, and human-caused accidents. Consistent with this view, the federal government has adopted the all-hazards response model as its fundamental paradigm. Adoption of this paradigm provides powerful improvements in efficiency and efficacy, because it reduces the need to create a complex family of situation-specific preparedness and response activities. However, in practice, public health preparedness requires additional models and tools to provide a framework to better understand and prioritize emergency readiness and response needs, as well as to facilitate solutions; this is particularly true at the local health department level. Here, we propose to extend the use of the Haddon matrix-a conceptual model used for more than two decades in injury prevention and response strategies-for this purpose. of advance planning strategy could a local public health department use to identify the contributing factors to this public health emergency?

There is, for example, no equivalent to public health organizations such as US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Public Health Agency of Canada and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control that has prime responsibility for the detection and control of invasive species. This contrast is probably due to a number of reasons, including the local, regional or national (versus international) scope of many invasions, the often long time lag between biological invasions and detected impacts, and the generally slower nature of invasions, which together result in fractionated efforts that may be ineffective. Responsibilities for coordinating responses to EIDs of public health significance always lie with public health organizations, but responsibilities for responding to invasive species vary depending on the impact or location of the invasive species and may be organizations responsible for agriculture, fisheries, environment, natural resources, transport or local government entities [114] . 4) .

The WHO Western Pacific Region Office provides updates on HFMD cases notified through local public health systems in Japan, Singapore, China, Vietnam, The Philippines and Thailand. 2 Outbreak control measures are targeted at interrupting virus transmission from person to person, as well as through contact with contaminated surfaces (such as toys) or fomites. Therefore health education messages focus on personal hygiene and good sanitation, including recommendations for frequent hand washing, proper disposal of soiled diapers and regular disinfection of soiled surfaces. The transmission of EVs is most efficient in crowded settings, and therefore during outbreaks most countries in the region have adopted social distancing measures, such as closures of childcare facilities and schools and cancellation of public functions involving children. Little systematic research has been done to assess the effectiveness of such measures, but one study from Singapore seemed to show some benefit. 19 However, the optimal timing for implementation of these measures is unclear-early, as soon as a HFMD is reported, or later following confirmation of EV71 as the causative agent. In addition, the effectiveness of distancing measures, which have substantial socioeconomic implications, is uncertain. If EV71 is like other directly transmissible viruses, such controls may decrease the peak incidence of disease during an outbreak/epidemic, and blunt the burden on the healthcare system, which can be of great value. However, it could thereby also prolong the outbreak and the total numbers would be similar. In addition, school closure could cause relocation to other geographical areas. 6 ",47.186451482578995,18.316836612156735

Many related issues were discussed, including low literacy level, poverty, and trust of and/or deference to health authorities. Some cultural variations were expressed; for example, that certain societies more readily accept autocratic directives for disease control. Participants at all meetings affirmed that their cultures do not tolerate corruption and indicated that a lack of transparency raises suspicions of corrupt dealings. Government authorities and leaders are expected to be open and consult the community in making important decisions, including public health emergency decisions, affecting their people. Factors that complicate mass communication that were discussed at all meetings include low levels of literacy, the inaccessibility of media such as television, newspapers, and the internet because of poverty; and the unavailability of the internet and cell phone towers in some rural areas. Although the detail and depth of discussions regionally varied and some cultural variation was evident, transparency in decision-making was in general decisively affirmed. At the African meeting, in contrast to the general perception that ""big men"" and individuals with centralized power make all of the decisions, participants agreed that traditional cultures expect leaders to seek input from those they lead, through elder councils and similar institutions. Participants noted that public health leaders include traditional healers who serve as both recipients of and conduits for information. Because many Africans will seek care from traditional healers during a pandemic, these health providers must also be informed of how to protect themselves from infection, and how to guard against spreading the infection. In addition, a wide variety of local and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs), often funded by high-income countries, are active in resource poor countries in Africa seeking to meet the populations' most basic needs. Thus, it is important that both traditional healers and NGOs be engaged in the decisionmaking process. The participants at the Asian meeting varied widely in their views and practices relating to informing and engaging the public. For example, when SARS broke out in one Asian country, the government issued mandatory public health measures and expected public compliance. Due to the culture of deference to authority, nearly all communities in this country instantly adopted the measures (eg, quarantine, isolation, and social distancing). However, not all participants reported such deference to authority. This was reflected in a story from another Asian country about a boycott of a government polio immunization campaign by a minority community due to suspicions about the government's motives. Others reported that when the central government was perceived as misgoverned or weak, responsibilities for informing the public about health threats and providing leadership during emergencies fell to local leaders. Participants at the Latin American meeting stressed that community participation and cooperation will be crucial during a pandemic influenza response, particularly for migrants or minorities who are already stigmatized. Latin American participants also pointed to the importance of the media and health authorities in communicating health information and avoiding panic, as well as to convey factual information about availability and access to therapeutics. Some participants were concerned about the wide disparity in resources within and between countries, which make transparency even more important. Participants at the Eastern Mediterranean meeting emphasized the need for inclusion, accountability, and transparency in public health policies, but also noted the reluctance among countries to collaborate because of political differences and disparity in wealth and resources. Participants discussed the need to establish a clear understanding of who will make what decisions during an emergency, how guidelines will be established, and the importance of considering multiple perspectives, including perspectives from individuals most at risk.",42.960431907771394,18.250844964354663

There was a sharp decline in asthma hospitalization rates following the SARS outbreak. This observation further suggests that hospital admissions for asthma in developed countries may be affected by extraneous factors. One of the reasons for the drop in asthma hospitalizations could be due to changes in hospital policies that resulted in the prohibition of nebulizer use. In its replacement, metereddose inhalers with spacers, which were also more readily available in households, were used. This practice could also explain the sharp decline in C:R. The total number of units of relievers sold in 2004 (924,700 units) more than doubled that in 2003 (409,400 units). Similar changes were not observed in other countries affected by SARS. The low asthma hospitalization rates and C:R were sustained in the years after SARS in Hong Kong SAR. Although difficult to verify, the practice of health-seeking behaviors like frequent hand washing, adherence to doctors' advice, regular exercise, and frequent use of masks when having symptoms of influenza post-SARS as described by Lau et al 30 may have reduced respiratory viral infections and, therefore, viral-triggered wheezing.

Recently, in the Arabian Peninsula, including in Saudi Arabia, epidemiological data indicated an actual increase in the number of emerging and/or reemerging cases of several viral zoonotic diseases. Data presented in this review are very relevant because Saudi Arabia is considered the largest country in the Peninsula. We believe that zoonotic pathogens in Saudi Arabia remain an important public health problem; however, more than 10 million Muslim pilgrims from around 184 Islamic countries arrive yearly at Makkah for the Hajj season and/or for the Umrah. Therefore, for health reasons, several countries recommend vaccinations for various zoonotic diseases among preventive protocols that should be complied with before traveling to Saudi Arabia. However, there is a shortage of epidemiological data focusing on the emerging and reemerging of zoonotic pathogens transmitted from animal to humans in different densely populated cities and/or localities in Saudi Arabia. Therefore, further efforts might be needed to control the increasing impacts of zoonotic viral disease. Also, there is a need for a high collaboration to enhance the detection and determination of the prevalence, diagnosis, control, and prevention as well as intervention and reduction in outbreaks of these diseases in Saudi Arabia, particularly those from other countries. Persons in the health field including physicians and veterinarians, pet owners, pet store owners, exporters, border guards, and people involved in businesses related to animal products have adopted various preventive strategies. Some of these measures might pave the way to highly successful prevention and control results on the different transmission routes of these viral zoonotic diseases from or to Saudi Arabia. Moreover, the prevention of these viral pathogens depends on socioeconomic impacts, available data, improved diagnosis, and highly effective therapeutics or prophylaxis.",40.6898691559599,16.067997985747272

To our understanding, global health can be considered as an application of medical and public health sciences together with other disciplines (1) in tackling those issues with global impact and (2) in the effort to seek global solutions. Thus, global health treats public health sciences and medicine as their foundations, and will selectively use theories, knowledge, techniques, therapeutics and prevention measures from public health, medicine, and other disciplines to understand and solve global health problems. There are also clear boundaries between global health, public health and medicine with regard to the target population. Medicine targets patient populations, public health targets health populations in general, while global health targets the global population. We have to admit that there are obvious overlaps between global health, public health and medicine, particularly between global health and international health. It is worth noting that global health can be considered as an extension of international health with regard to the scope and purposes. International health focuses on the health of participating countries with intention to affect non-participating countries, while global health directly states that its goal is to promote health and prevent and treat diseases for all people in all countries across the globe.

To reduce the financial barriers to and burdens on patients seeking essential healthcare, a ""free-TB service policy"" has been implemented gradually throughout the country [10, 11] . Under this policy, tuberculosis suspects are provided a free diagnosis and anti-tuberculosis treatment, including a free chest X-ray examination, sputum smear test and designated firstline anti-tuberculosis drugs [12] . Initially, the free-service policy was only performed for sputum smear-positive patients. Now it has expanded to sputum smear-negative patients. Moreover, the government has taken more measures to reduce the patient burden, including the establishment of universal health coverage and increasing the reimbursement rate for patients with tuberculosis [13] . The central government's spending on tuberculosis control increased from 40 million Chinese Yuan (CNY) in 2001 to 580 million CNY in 2010 [14] . China has established universal health coverage for 830 million rural residents through the rapid expansion of the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS). Moreover, a free-service policy has been gradually adopted in order to lighten the economic burden of patients with tuberculosis. Despite these policy changes, previous studies have revealed that patients still bear a high financial burden, which could affect their health care-seeking behaviors and treatment outcomes [10, [15] [16] [17] [18] . The revenue-driven practices in some health facilities, such as over-prescription of medication, poor referral and high hospitalization rates not only influence a patient's economic burden but also affects the entire tuberculosis control program [19, 20] .",45.17757659097388,17.799478226194342

The all-hazards approach is viewed as essential for public health systemlevel readiness, enabling effective and efficient preparedness that accounts for the difficulty in predicting the type and severity of events [14, 22, 23] . The conventional cycle of emergency management includes four phases which are (1) prevention/mitigation, (2) preparedness, (3) response and (4) recovery; public health agency activities relate to all four phases [24] . In this study, we focus on preparedness as upstream activities and actions that promote enhanced public health system capacity and resilience throughout all four phases. It is important to note that in Canada, PHEP addresses population-level preparedness, distinct from clinical care and health care facility preparedness. Communication and integration of preparedness activities between sectors like health care, government and the community is, however, often a responsibility of public health agencies. Relevant levels of the public health system in Canada are local or regional (varies by province/territory), provincial/territorial, and federal.

As in the case of the SARS epidemic, the current epidemic must be fought with public health measures. As a first measure, the Chinese authorities have closed the 'wet' seafood market in Wuhan. Due to the close contact of live animals with humans, these markets offer ideal conditions for the transmission of zoonotic infections. After two coronavirus infections having emerged from Chinese 'wet' food markets, strict hygiene measures are clearly warranted. However, consuming meat and other products of wild animals has a long tradition in China. There is a philosophy of medicine food homology, ('eaten when hungry is food, eaten when ill is medicine') such that in China pangolin products, for example are reputed to help against rheumatism; 'meridian obstruction'; liver disease; and to improve eyesight (Li and Li, 2020b) . More recently, consumption of meat of wild animals has become a sign of social status. It will not be easy to eradicate these false medical beliefs. Interdiction might create black markets; therefore, some scientists recommend strictly controlling, instead of forbidding, this market. Protecting the healthcare workers against nosocomial infection is another urgent need, since patient care will already represent a heavy burden to the health system and any reduction in health personnel would cause further problems. Face masks are insufficient protection for them; N95 masks, goggles and protective gowns are needed for medical personnel (Chang et al., 2020b) . For the general public, frequent hand washing, cough and sneezing etiquette and wearing masks when visiting public places are recommended . However, scientific evidence is lacking for the effectiveness of wearing masks by the uninfected person in contrast to the proven effectiveness of hand washing against respiratory infections. The SARS epidemic was contained by means of syndromic surveillance; isolation of patients; and quarantine of contacts. These measures will also play an important role in the current epidemic which, due to its sheer size, will necessitate more draconian measures such as limiting the movement of persons to and from hotspots of infection, resulting in the lockdown of Wuhan and of particular small cities in Italy and Germany. WHO has declared the novel coronavirus epidemic as a public health emergency. This expanding epidemic will be a stress test for existing health systems, including those of industrialized countries. It should also be a further motivation to strengthen fundamental research in trans-species viral infections and on potential zoonosis impacts, particularly from bats, under changing environmental conditions. From the viewpoint of citizens, when it comes to the protection of lives, one might ask whether one should not put the same spending on public health and preventive research as on the spending on defence budgets.",44.406580525090554,19.35981914113719

There is increased risk of disease transmission because of huge influx of those attending the event. Overcrowding and overwhelmed medical services in such gatherings often aggravate the risk of infectious disease outbreaks [3] . Considerable challenges are posed by a mass gathering event (MG) in terms of communicable and noncommunicable disease surveillance, emergency preparedness, environmental health, vaccination, crowd management, and various other issues [4] . In spite of the fact that MGs are an undeniably regular activity of our society that are attended by huge crowds, such gatherings are not very well understood. Even though such gatherings are accumulations of ""well people,"" vast number of people associated with MGs can put a serious strain on the entire health care system [3] . Along these lines, such MG events are more perilous and hazardous in terms of higher incidence of injury and illness compared to population in general [5] . Preplanning for MG events is crucial, and identification of potential health risks can be a vital element in pre-event planning for a MG [6] . Broadly, it includes health management and major incident planning [7] . Public health managers need to plan for, and respond to, a wide range of incidents and emergencies that could affect health or patient care. These could be anything from extreme weather conditions to an outbreak of an infectious disease or a major transport accident related to the MG event [1] . It is important to note that planning for MG events offer a chance to enhance health service delivery, strengthen public health systems, and escalate health promotion activities [8] but failure to plan sufficiently can also disturb the routine health services as the existing system is not attuned to deal with such gatherings of people [9] . The aim of public health at MGs is to prevent or limit the risk of injury or ill health and boost safety for participants, spectators, and residents of host community. Scope of planning for MG is largely dependent on the type of event, risk assessments (RAs), and available resources. Unfortunately, effective preparedness to mitigate and control health risks are inadequate when it comes to planning and management of MG events, especially in countries with poor resources [1] . It is important to note that public health priorities are determined based on the assumptions laid down during initial stages of public health planning of MGs [10] . For instance, in the development of any surveillance system, utilizing syndromic surveillance during MGs requires making suitable inquiries of the data before the event. Those inquiries are a result of RA, a process which has to be performed before and during the event in order to determine what public health-related outcomes will potentially occur and whether these outcomes can be addressed through syndromic surveillance [11] . RA serves as an initial step in the process of planning [12] . RA for a MG is a process that determines the intent and implementation of risk reduction measures, response planning, and capacity building for health functions. RA for MGs is undertaken to empower the public health authorities to identify and evaluate the generic characteristics of a MG which introduce or escalate specific threats. It incorporates assessment of the potential public health effects of the MG [1] . Systematic assessment of risks also helps to identify the potential health security risks that require cooperation of other departments and government agencies [8] . Existing research in the field of MG health is dedicated to the development of rapid diagnostic methods, monitoring and response, and treatment and vaccines. Public health surveillance systems are less likely to include information on non-infectious health threats such as air quality, which can be extremely important for event organizers. This area poses particular challenges for traditional public health surveillance which is generally designed to detect when things happen. This is where RA comes into picture [13] . For example, the leading causes of morbidity and mortality during the Hajj are heat-related illnesses and trauma-related injuries. Identification of such risks had allowed event planners to instigate preventive measures and rapid response strategies. For instance, provision of shaded areas reduced the incidence of heat-related illnesses and effective crowd control reduced the risk of a stampede. Drug and alcohol use were identified as health risks for other types of MGs [14] ; therefore, restriction of their use mitigated the associated illnesses. In the context of limited resources, it has been suggested that one can choose to alleviate more likely events even if their potential impacts are smaller. Events that are catastrophic, but extremely unlikely, can then be given less priority [15] . During religious gatherings in India, some special events and unforeseen events occur at the places of religious MGs besides fixed places of worshipping. Special events like idol procession, chariot pulling, fire walking, and animal sacrificing happen pulling larger crowds within the MGs and causing more damage to human beings and property. History is in replete with incidences when MGs at fairs and festivals of India have turned into the hotspots of various types of risks [16] . Fire incidents have been reported to have occurred as a result of plastic sheets used as construction material for building cottages as temporary shelters for the pilgrims and also due to the use of liquid petroleum gas cylinders in the Kumbh mela premises and presence of unplanned and faulty electrical lines near lodging areas [17] . Previous studies [18, 19] have reported impaired water quality of Ganges River and consequential health risks by virtue of mass ritualistic bathing and insisted time and again that water of river Ganges was not fit for drinking or bathing purposes. A 10-year analysis of public health safety in 27 traditional MG events of India indicated around 936 dead and 540 injured casualties [20] .",43.515301343504426,18.175889425323746

Three major implications emerge from this research. First, as stressed by the narratives of the informants, alienating the participation of populations and excluding their involvement, leads to non-compliance and increases risk of virus transmission. A community-based isolation of contacts, managed locally by leaders, health authorities, and community-based organizations, would likely have been a more acceptable alternative to vertical quarantine. Second, a top-down militarized-like measure does not allow the population to understand the emergency situation, creating a distance between institutions and citizens [14] . Third, coercion does not directly result in a change of practices or benefit health-seeking behaviours. On the contrary, enforcement of vertical measures is seen as a command, an injustice and a judgment of allegedly untoward behaviours. Such mechanisms feed self-organization as a form or resistance, but also a creation of informal economies that could be hazardous for public health and increase socio-economic divides. Throughout the epidemic, safe and dignified funerals should been sustained as a clear sign of respect and understanding of the complex socio-cultural and spiritual significance of the dead, even in times of crisis. Cremation, for example, could have been promoted as a temporary measure and organized through the involvement of community leaders-in particular those more in touch with people, such as chairpersons, chiefs, pastors and imams. Family of the deceased could have been involved and could have been returned the ashes. Again, local patterns of funerals could have been identified, discussed with health promoters in collaboration with recognized local leaders, to plan a prevention of transmission within the families [28] .",45.50212599724071,17.914181203259407

However, the ability of SS to reduce disease-related morbidity and mortality remains to be demonstrated, as does its cost-effectiveness and warning devices. It will be critical to assess its utility, sensitivity, and accuracy in outbreak or bioterrorism within the context of health systems that respond to both ""true"" and ""false"" alarms in infectious disease syndemic settings. This involves the collection of information and clinical data that might indicate if an infectious disease outbreak might be happening in the community and whether it warrants further public health response. Before an outbreak occurs, little is documented in health centers and by airport active SS, except for passive checks of yellow card immunization for BCG, polio, and hepatitis vaccines programmes, in addition to medical referrals for passengers requiring medical or surgical interventions abroad. During the ongoing outbreak of Ebola in West Africa, SS, along with collaborative efforts between local health departments, has been used on patients, ground staff, health workers, passengers across community/national borders, and airports across Africa and in some other major airport hubs worldwide. (2)This approach is confronted by a lack of effective and accurate spot invasive frontline and airport rapid diagnostics tools, district and provincial health laboratories being equipped with little or no advanced molecular technologies, lack of drugs and vaccines to treat Ebola, inadequacy in coordinated Ebola frontline planning efforts in the community, as well inefficient or nonexistent community and national active infectious disease surveillance systems. Syndromic surveillance systems monitor existing descriptive data of these behaviors (e.g., school and work absenteeism, sales of over-the-counter medications, illness-related information, emergency room admissions for symptoms indicative of infectious diseases) for patterns or clusters of behaviors suggestive of an illness outbreak [7] . Hence, SS is not sufficiently equipped to control and contain Ebola in Africa due to its complex web of interactions and challenges. The usefulness of laser thermal detection of febrile state or other characteristic symptoms of individuals in frontline and airport surveillance systems could be very challenging in hyper-, holo-, and meso-endemic settings, and present several limitations with the rampantly increasing confounders of poverty-related diseases in Africa and elsewhere. In addition, it should be noted that several factors such as travel syndrome, menopausal or post-menopausal syndrome in women and other lifestyle stressors associated with an increase in temperature-although normal-can trigger false alarms. Moreover, syndemics and partial acquired immunity in the region poses concerns about the spread and the burden of the disease due to asymptomatic reservoirs and the long latency period of infection [15, 16] . Efforts should be devoted to enhancing research and developing innovative, more sensitive detection and diagnostic tools for early-stage epidemic warning and preparedness in frontline and airport spot surveillance mechanisms and response, rather than increasing the use of empirical broad-spectrum detectors.",40.33322854981738,17.989883671711596

Prodromal surveillance tools could be very timely and vital in the realm of emergency communication, advice, behavior change, hygiene and sanitation, and provide an integrated grassroots-based participatory approach. This could lead to more effective prevention, thus curbing the spread and containing the outbreak at the different levels of the disease, and at different places in time and space [3, 6] . (3)Outbreak detection systems urgently require reliable, effective, and cost-effective tools and interventions which allow for constant access to diagnostic tools and personal protective equipment in healthcare centers across the region [7] . (4)Information system-based sentinel surveillance. (5)Biosurveillance systems are used in practice to augment classical outbreak investigations. The major advantages of syndromic systems include sensitivity, timeliness, and flexibility, and being able to provide data for situational awareness. However, biosurveillance precincts lack in specificity, rely on chief complaint data, and lack formal training for users. Linking syndromic data to triage notes and medical chart data would substantially increase the value of biosurveillance in outbreak investigations and thus reduce the health burden [8, 9] . (6)Laboratory-guided detection of disease outbreak surveillance systems relies on detection and monitoring of biothreats enabled by laboratory methods of diagnosis and identifies trends in biosurveillance research. It is based on three approaches, namely: (1) laboratory-initiated infectious disease notifications, (2) SS based on health indicators, and (3) genotyping-based surveillance of biothreats. The insufficient and delayed support for biosurveillance alerts for public health users and the inadequate integration of surveillance signals into action plans remain the major barriers, and require coordination between syndromic and laboratorybased surveillance for efficient public health outbreak monitoring and response [10] . (7)Health indicator surveillance provides authorities with vital health indicators such birth rates, motility rates, and life expectancy. However, trustful and reliable information and communication, health education on preventable fatalities and cautious behavior are also required in order to prevent fear, panic and community resistance to stem out the spread of the disease outbreak. (8)Digital or electronic bio-epidemiology surveillance systems, including social media networking and web-based systems, provide valuable channels for timely collection of public health data; give information on the early detection of, and response to, disease outbreaks; and enhance situational awareness to communities. The creation of blogs and user-generated content has turned social networking into a conversation space in which everyone can participate. However in West Africa, the low level of literacy and high inequality indices compromised the usefulness of such tools to trace and map the Ebola outbreak, as compared to their usefulness and effectiveness in a community with high literacy, for example during the SARS and H9N7 influenza outbreak in Hong Kong and mainland China. Social media (e.g., Twitter, Facebook) and web-based communication provide epidemiological knowledge dissemination, and creates virtual communities based on shared values about critical outbreak perceptions, seriousness of the crisis, and population evidence-based guidance. However, it is not subject to experts or authorities' advice and assessment, and doesn't receive guidance from associated communication or information risk management and security. This requires further development and attention. The implications of social media and web-based information and communication in creating fear, anxiety and stigmatization about Ebola in some communities in West Africa are noteworthy. During this outbreak, web-based activities were also responsible for fuelling rumors that led to counter-productive behaviors.

Infection control measures recommended by the WHO during the influenza pandemic included droplet and standard precautions among the HCWs in addition to maintaining a minimum distance of . 1 m between patients when providing routine care to patients infected with pandemic H1N1 influenza and those with influenza-like symptoms [12] . Our coughing propagation distances from the HPS would support the WHO recommendation for the HCW to wear a medical mask if working within approximately 1 m from the patient or upon entering the room/cubicle of a patient on droplet precautions [12] . Surgical masks appeared to be as effective as N95 respirators for respiratory protection of HCWs during the routine care of patients hospitalized with seasonal influenza, [32, 33] and were also as effective in reducing production of infectious aerosols during coughing when worn by influenza patients [34] . The incidence of nosocomial pandemic H1N1 infections appeared to remain low in staff members using surgical masks in a hospital despite admitting substantial numbers of pandemic H1N1 patients [35] .

For effective control of rabies, for example, it is increasingly clear that sustained, contiguous and large-scale programmes are needed, as even small pockets of low vaccination coverage (involving less than 0.5% of the dog population) can significantly hamper progress [75] . Even where the cost-effectiveness of One Health strategies has been demonstrated, for example, in relation to mass rabies vaccination of dogs in Africa [76, 77] , sheep and goat vaccination against brucellosis in Mongolia [62] and control of human African trypanosomiasis in Uganda [13] , barriers remain to scaling-up. Increasing attention is being paid to opportunities for integrating platforms for delivery of health interventions, with international health agencies focusing on the importance of strengthening health systems to achieve equitable delivery of health services, rather than developing multiple vertical programmes for specific diseases [78] . It is recognized that establishing independent delivery efforts for specific diseases can lead to fragmentation, and that coordination across sectors is needed to strengthen health systems. In Tanzania, these ideas are being explored through a programme investigating whether the reach and cost-effectiveness of MDA targeting soil-transmitted helminths in children and mass vaccination of domestic dogs against rabies can be improved through integration. Adopting One Health approaches, the project aims to break down traditional barriers that exist between veterinary and human health interventions, and build on the community trust achieved through the provision of a common good (effective control of rabies) in order to achieve cost savings, develop synergies and improve the effectiveness of both interventions. Further opportunities to establish co-delivery across a range of health interventions exist, not only for integrating control measures against several different zoonoses [73] , but also for cross-linkages with public health interventions, such as water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programmes, and joint delivery of public health and veterinary services, particularly in remote or nomadic rural communities [79] .",38.49018629927678,14.930394768602996

Public education measures and behavioral changes prompted by the SARS outbreak may have contributed to the ensuing decline in excess P&I mortality in Taiwan and other SARS-affected countries/areas [29, 31] . Although our observation periods were not long, the evidence suggests that the SARS outbreak not only spurred behavioral change among Taiwanese citizens [32] but also prompted government officials to reform the infectious disease surveillance system [33] as well as policies for hospital management [34] and infection control [35] in Taiwan These changes, in combination with increasing awareness of infectious diseases among physicians, may have contributed to the sustained post-SARS effect that we propose had a significant impact on Taiwan's elderly P&I mortality rates. Three studies in Taiwan [36] , in Wuhan City of Hubei Province in mainland China [30] and in Hong Kong [31] support the claim that public health efforts were sustained after the SARS epidemic. Interestingly, influenzaassociated mortalities in Taiwan, southern China and Hong Kong in the post-SARS period were all lower than in the pre-SARS period (personal communication in the March 15-19, 2010 MISMS Oceania Regional Influenza Meeting and Workshop in Melbourne, Australia). Moreover, many public health measures taken in response to SARS-including advising sick students to stay at home, teaching coughing etiquette, providing hand-cleaning facilities in front of elevators and at building entrances, closing classes if more than three influenza-like illnesses occur in one class, and vaccinating high-risk populations-all had been applied during the 2009 influenza H1N1 pandemic. The effectiveness of these public health efforts is supported by the lower total number of P&I mortalities observed during the 2009-2010 winter season (ending February 26, 2010) than in previous years [37] . In addition, we found that people had a greater understanding of health protection measures during the 2009-10 pandemic influenza in SARS-affected areas/countries such as Taiwan and Hong Kong [38] . This protective effect may have contributed to the lower numbers of P&I deaths in 2009-10 compared to seasonal influenza in 2008-2009 and to the reduction in total laboratory-confirmed pandemic influenza H1N1 deaths in Taiwan (42 deaths from July 1, 2009 to May 8, 2010)) and Hong Kong (80 deaths from July 17, 2009 to April 15, 2010) [39] .",42.72135188701792,17.257939973305316

During the 2003 SARS-CoV epidemic, researchers found that moderate levels of anxiety were associated with higher uptake of preventive measures by respondents [21] . Our findings showed the opposite trend. Specific precautionary measures including avoidance of sharing utensils (e.g., chopsticks), hand hygiene, and wearing masks regardless of the presence or absence of symptoms were associated with lower levels of psychological impact, depression, anxiety, and stress. The experiences of the 2003 SARS-CoV epidemic could have changed the perception of the general public towards precautionary measures and have led to a positive effect on the initial psychological responses to the COVID-19 epidemic by giving respondents confidence and sense of control in prevention. As the Chinese prefer to use chopsticks to pick up food commonly shared on a plate during mealtime as part of their culture, it is not unexpected that avoidance of sharing utensils (e.g., chopsticks) during meals is significantly associated with less psychological impact and lower levels of anxiety, depression, and stress. During the initial stage of the COVID-19 epidemic, health authorities outside China had different recommendations for mask usage due to a global shortage of masks. While some health authorities urged citizens not to wear masks if they were well (e.g., Singapore), other health authorities urged their citizens to always have masks and hand sanitizers ready (e.g., Malaysia, Vietnam) [36] . The official guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO) advises that healthy people should only wear masks if they are taking care of a person with suspected COVID-19 infection or if people are coughing and sneezing [37] . Our study found that wearing masks, regardless of the presence or absence of symptoms, was associated with lower levels of anxiety and depression. Although the WHO emphasizes that masks are effective only when used in combination with frequent hand-cleaning with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water, wearing a mask regardless of the presence or absence of symptoms could offer potential psychological benefits by offering a sense of security. This finding was anticipated because wearing face masks is a common practice when people are sick or to counter urban pollution or haze in parts of Asia, including China [38] . Governments and health authorities should ensure there are infrastructures to produce and provide an adequate supply of masks, soaps, alcohol-based hand rubs, and other personal hygiene products during the COVID-19 epidemic.",41.869388010525434,16.440972742684984

They represent informed public opinion better than other social research methods (e.g. surveys or focus groups) because they give participants factual information, bring them into a structured and constructive dialogue with experts, provide them with time to reflect and deliberate, and allow them to represent their views directly to policymakers. To be successful, One Health needs to be about more than disease prevention and control. The dynamic, unpredictable effects and risks to peoples' lives of EIDs necessitate a public health and biosecurity infrastructure equipped to address the ethical problems that arise. EID management must therefore be based on normative principles as well as local knowledge, operational experience and disease-specific scientific and economic evidence.

Realistic decision models, driven by sociological survey data, can elucidate vaccine campaign failures and identify key pressure points for increasing uptake. Second, how can we streamline intervention campaigns to achieve efficient, rather than universal, adherence? This study reminds us that more intervention is not necessarily better intervention. The decision paradigm that most reduced transmission also required the least resources. Given the simplicity of our model, we do not suggest that public health agencies should promote 'infection-counting'.

Effective implementation of prevention and control strategies for the prioritized zoonotic diseases requires sustained collaboration among both the animal and human health sectors. To facilitate this, the workshop participants recommended the creation of a One Health-focused Zoonotic Disease Unit, which would include staff from EPHI and MoLFR or other appropriate animal health agencies. The proposed unit would develop a national zoonotic disease strategy and coordinate efforts between the human and animal health sectors to jointly address the selected zoonotic diseases and respond to outbreaks in people and animals. Such a unit would enhance inter-sectoral linkages, facilitate efficient utilization of scarce resources, and capitalize on various sectors' capabilities to improve prevention and control of zoonotic diseases.

Travel restrictions reduced the illness rate only in the event of mild local disease transmission intensity. In some rural areas or island countries, the disease transmission intensities as well as the reproduction numbers remain at low levels due to limited human mobility and contacts. In addition, these areas may be infrequently visited by foreign travelers. Such areas may benefit significantly from travel suspension. In some studies [54, 55] , beneficial delays in epidemic establishment have been reported, as a result of blocking imported cases. Apart from travel restrictions, there are other public health measures such as regular hand washing, voluntary quarantine, and school closures to reduce the impact of influenza pandemic. Compared with travel restrictions, school closure is easier to implement in a community. Past influenza pandemics have shown a particular focus on disease transmission in children. School closures resulted in a positive effect proven to be effective in reducing the disease transmission during the H1N1pdm [28] . Nevertheless, while school closures and antivirals are good for transmission reduction, they may not be for buying more time in epidemic preparation. Closing schools for a long time would induce social and economical impacts, whereas closing schools for a short period of time may not be sufficient to show effects on community transmission [56] .

This is different from deployment of masks in the general population during an outbreak of an infectious disease, where anyone may encounter the infectious micro-organism, implying much greater heterogeneity, in training levels (experience and understanding), goodness of fit of a mask, and activities interfering with mask use and thus reducing potential reduction of transmission. The protective effect of masks is created through a combined effect of the transmission blocking potential of the material, the fit and related air leakage of the mask, and the degree of adherence to proper wearing and disposal of masks. Personal respirators such as those worn by staff attending TB patients, are used primarily to protect the wearer, and are designed to fit to the face with as tight a seal as possible. Their efficiency is graded on the degree of protection the material offers, assuming a perfect fit and optimal compliance. In contrast, surgical masks, as commonly worn in the operating theatre, are primarily used to protect the environment from the respiratory droplets produced by the wearer. With these masks, facial fit is much looser. The fit of home made masks, which could be e.g. made of a tea cloth or other comparable material available in the home, is likely to be even looser. Thus personal respirators confer a higher degree of protection than surgical masks, and these are again likely to give a higher degree of protection than home-made masks. In professional situations, ample time might be available prior to use to ensure a perfect fit and to give extensive counselling on adherence, but it is unlikely this will apply to the general population in case of a pandemic. It is possible that the discomfort in wearing associated with a certain type of masks will lead to reduced adherence and thus to a loss in overall protectiveness [10, 11] . Indeed a review among health care workers could not determine whether personal respirators conferred better protection for the health care workers than surgical masks [10] .",52.19183473436764,19.928004942606446

All 192 UN Member States are required to meet the core capacity requirements of the IHR, which entered into force in 2007 (International Health Regulations, 2005) . ""Core Capacity 8,"" the laboratory core capacity, emphasizes the concept that building laboratory capacity to support a public health system requires a strong focus on biosafety and biosecurity. The BWC, which has 170 States Parties, entered into force in 1975 (http://www.unog.ch/bwc). The BWC States Parties hold Review Conferences every 5 years in an effort to enhance compliance. At the 2008 BWC meeting of States Parties, it was stated that ""biosafety and biosecurity measures contribute to preventing the development, acquisition, or use of biological and toxin weapons and are appropriate means of implementing the BWC"" and also that ""pursuing biosafety and biosecurity measures could also contribute to the fulfillment of other respective international obligations and agreements, such as the revised IHR of the WHO."" UNSCR 1540 was adopted unanimously on April 28, 2004 and established for the first time legally binding obligations on all UN Member States to ""develop and enforce effective measures against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD),"" which includes biological weapons (UN Security Council, 2004) . UNSCR 1540 also recognizes that non-state proliferation is a threat to the peace under the terms of Chapter VII of the UN Charter and requires every UN Member State to criminalize various forms of non-state actor involvement in WMD and its related activities in its domestic legislation and to enforce such legislation. An ad hoc committee (known as the 1540 Committee) was involved in the implementation of this resolution. As part of its mission, it developed matrices to be used as tools to help UN Member States implement the resolution. The matrix for biological weapons and related materials identified the areas where domestic controls should be implemented and enforced ( Table 5) .",43.72569008554312,17.744011918304885

One study found that particles from healthy subjects ranged from 0.09 to 3 mm particles. Concentrations ranged from 100 to 350 particles/L during normal breathing and 150 to 2000 particles/L during talking or coughing. 19 Another showed concentrations ranging from 14 to greater than 3000 particles/L and an average particle size of 0.32 mm. 20 The filters of most of these surgical masks will allow a large majority of wearer-generated particles to penetrate and will collect only a small percentage of airborne particles generated by infectious patients. Even when equipped with filters demonstrating relatively high collection efficiency, 10% to 40% of particles will penetrate the face seal as a result of poor fit. For aerosols containing organisms with a low infectious dose (eg, tuberculosis), this level of face seal leakage would not prevent a potentially infectious exposure during even a brief encounter with a patient generating copious amounts of aerosol. [21] [22] [23] The poor performance of dental masks is of particular concern, given dental surgeons' close proximity to patients and the high aerosol concentrations generated by dental procedures. 24 A limited number of previous studies of surgical masks as personal protective devices also show that surgical masks are not equivalent to respirators. Two studies simulating inward leakage compared surgical masks sealed and unsealed on a mannequin face and found fit factors from 3 to 5 (18% to 32% face-piece leakage) for 1.8-mm dioctyl phthalate particles and 22-mm fungal spores. 15, 25 A significantly higher prevalence of antibodies for several respiratory tract viruses (influenza A and B and respiratory syncytial virus) was found in 50 dental surgeons compared with 50 controls. However, no significant difference in antibody prevalence was found between surgeons wearing masks versus those who occasionally or never wore surgical masks. 26 Surgical masks were not effective at reducing internal deposition of Technetium-99 metastable, an aerosolized radiopharmaceutic, in nuclear medicine personnel and did not significantly reduce latex particle inhalation in a study of 20 health care workers. 27,28 A surgical and laser mask showed similar fit factors of 3.0 (95% CI: 1.8-4.2) and 3.8 (95% CI: 2.9-4.6), much less than the fit factor of 102.6 (95% CI: 41.2-164) for a FFP2 respirator. 29 A recent study found a geometric mean fit factor of 2.6 (geometric SD, 1.6) for 6 surgical masks, using a TSI Portacount device with an N95 Companion. 30 There are few studies that compare the clinical efficacy of respirators versus surgical masks. In one Toronto hospital, all attending health care workers reported to be wearing ''respirators'' contracted severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during a patient intubation. 31 Closer examination reveals that employees were wearing surgical masks, not respirators. Another study found that nurses in a Toronto hospital not consistently wearing either a filtering face-piece N95 respirator or a surgical mask had 4 times the risk of contracting SARS as those consistently wearing respirators or surgical masks. 32 Fit testing is not required and was infrequently employed in Canada during the SARS outbreaks. 33 Our data illustrate how important fit is to preventing inward leakage of particles. Qualitative fit tests are considered valid measures of personal protection for respirators that must achieve a fit factor of 100 (used in atmospheres less than 10 times the permissible exposure limit). Although 2 subjects were able to pass the qualitative fit test on 2 different surgical masks when assisted with fit, we believe these results occurred because of temporary taste desensitization. Our quantitative fit test results support this conclusion. None of the test surgical masks attained an individual fit factor of 100, the minimum level expected for a half-mask filtering face-piece respirator.

The ability to identify quickly the causative viral pathogen of an emerging viral epidemic markedly increases the chances of success of any countermeasures for containment, prevention and control of the possible disease. Surveillance of environmental viruses can underpin the detection of both cases and outbreaks by identifying an increase in frequency of disease above its background incidence (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2001 ) and by estimating disease impact. In addition, surveillance can help generate hypotheses and stimulate research, evaluating prevention and control measures and facilitating planning. Many countries and international organizations, notably the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), and international research projects have devoted considerable energy to developing integrated surveillance networks; these networks are for tracking environmental viruses including food-and water-borne viral pathogens such as NoV, RV and EV and for providing information about the viruses' genetic structure and geographical distribution and about the host populations and environmental matrix involved. Recent advances in molecular biology, including DNA chip technology and wholegenome sequencing technologies, continuously improve diagnostic power to detect and characterize a wide range of pathogens and their variants. Public health surveillance systems for outbreak detection can establish the relative value of different approaches for the detection of outbreaks at the earliest stages and provide the information needed to improve their efficacy. However, substantial costs can be incurred in developing, enhancing and managing these surveillance systems and investigating false alarms (Wagner et al., 2001) .

Inadequate implementation of a quarantine protocol and poor public health sur veillance seem to have allowed a business trip to be made by a symptomatic man aged 44 years, who was in close contact with the index patient, which consisted of travel by air from Seoul to Hong Kong on May 26, 2015, and then by bus from Hong Kong to Huizhou in southern China. He was subsequently confi rmed to have MERS coronavirus infection on May 29, 2015, in Huizhou, leading to intensive contact tracing by local public health authorities and panic in the communities in mainland China and Hong Kong. 3 Previous major nosocomial outbreaks of MERS coronavirus infection in Saudi Arabia in April and May, 2013, in Al-Hasa province, 4 and in several Jeddah hospitals in April and May, 2014, 5 were attributed to poor hospital infection control measures and showed no evidence of major viral mutations. The Korean hospital cluster 2 and the export of an active case to China 3 emphasises the importance of maintaining stringent hospital infection control and prevention measures. These measures include isolation of the index patient in a negative-pressure room or a well ventilated room, droplet and contact precaution with eye protection when caring for probable or confi rmed cases of MERS coronavirus infection, and airborne precautions when performing aerosol generating procedures. 6 For the hospital infection control and isolation system to function eff ectively, it is important to maintain administrative controls (such as careful triage of patients, separation of potentially infectious cases from other patients in waiting rooms in the emergency area), environmental controls (such as ensuring a clean environment with adequate ventilation and spatial separation), and compliance with appropriate personal protection equipment (such as gloves, gowns, eye protection, surgical masks, and respirators). 7 MERS had captured global attention and the media spotlight since its discovery in 2012, until it was overshadowed by the epidemic of Ebola virus disease in west Africa. 8 Over the past 3 years, MERS cases have continued to increase and, as of May 31, 2015, 1187 laboratory-confi rmed cases have been recorded, with 485 deaths (40% mortality). 9 Although the great majority of MERS cases have been reported in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, people with a history of travel to the Middle East have exported cases to Europe, the USA, north Africa, and Asia. Of major concern is that the fi rst case of MERS was reported almost 3 years ago, and yet the disease remains a serious health threat to the global community, with many basic questions remaining unanswered. 10 Phylogenetic analysis of MERS coronavirus isolates from human beings show that camels and bats are reservoirs for MERS coronavirus, but the exact mode of transmission to human beings remains unknown and only a few people infected with MERS have had contact with camels. The absence of such crucial information has made it diffi cult to develop eff ective interventions to reduce the risk of disease transmission, defi ne the epidemiology of the disease, and develop eff ective public health control measures. Importantly, the natural history, risk factors, pathogenesis, viral virulence, viral kinetics, duration of infectiousness, protective immune responses, optimum management, and prognostic factors remain unknown. This information is required for the development and evaluation of new biomarkers, diagnostics, drugs, adjunct therapies, and vaccines. 9, 10 Similarly to other coronaviruses, MERS coronavirus is prone to mutations and can acquire an enhanced ability to be transmitted to human beings and between human beings. Such mutations would increase the risk of a pandemic, especially since several million pilgrims travel throughout the year from all continents to Saudi Arabia, with much of this travel associated with the Hajj and Umrah. Fortunately, no increase in MERS cases related to the Hajj has been reported. 11 As with Ebola virus disease, no specifi c or eff ective drug treatment or vaccine exists for MERS.

Negative reactions may vary from denial to panic to stigmatization. Denial or minimization of the threat of an EID by the population at risk can impede prevention efforts and increase transmission. Alternatively, an overreaction to the threat of an EID can overwhelm public health systems and resources, divert resources from effective disease control activities, and lead to severe economic losses in areas affected by the disease. Stigmatization can increase problems of persons with the disease and facilitate transmission because persons with or at risk for the disease may avoid seeking healthcare and because governments may attempt to suppress information about EIDs, considering their potentially severe economic consequences.

Therefore, enhancing awareness among other groups of Hajj pilgrims, especially elderly adults and those with pre-existing illnesses, about the importance of seeking professional pre-travel advice could be an important strategy to improve the uptake of preventive measures. Moreover, providing GPs with culturally appropriate health information on Hajj and the preventive measures recommended by the Saudi MoH could also facilitate uptake. 42 This study has some limitations. Two different groups were surveyed and the groups showed significant differences in demographic characteristics, particularly in sex, education level, and country of birth. Also, the sample size of the post-Hajj group was smaller than intended. These could limit the generalizability of the findings of one group to the other. These limitations are being addressed by a second, larger cohort study among Australian pilgrims during Hajj 2015, and a qualitative study among GPs and tour group leaders is underway. Despite these limitations this study has uniquely identified the barriers to and facilitators of the uptake of preventive measures among Australian Hajj pilgrims, providing important preliminary data upon which to build.",46.42548209992492,17.468528655654243

The seven casecontrol studies suggest that implementing barriers to transmission, isolation, and hygienic measures are effective with the use of relatively cheap interventions to contain epidemics of respiratory viruses.

Biggs, when reflecting on the controversies that had greeted his efforts to mandate the reporting of tuberculosis cases-as he moved forward to begin the surveillance of sexually transmitted diseases in the early twentieth century-remarked that, ""[t]he ten year long opposition to the reporting of tuberculosis will doubtless appear a mild breeze compared with the stormy protest against the sanitary surveillance of the venereal diseases"" (Biggs, 1913) . Despite the existence of much opposition, the reporting of cases by name to local and state health departments and to special confidential registries ultimately became part of the tradition and practice of public health. u S courts almost always deferred to public health authorities that have deprived individuals of their liberty in the name of public health. one uS state high court declared at the beginning of the twentieth century that, ""[i]t is unquestionable that the legislature can confer police powers upon public officers for the protection of the public health. the maxim Salus populi suprema lex is the law of all courts in all countries. the individual right sinks in the necessity to provide for the public good"" (parmet, 1985) . Even more remarkably, a plenary grant of authority was still found to be constitutional in the 1960s. in upholding the detention of a person with tuberculosis pursuant to a statute that provided virtually no procedural protections, a california appellate court declared in 1966 that, ""[h]ealth regulations enacted by the state under its police power and providing even drastic measures for the elimination of disease…in a general way are not affected by constitutional provisions, either of the state or national government."" t he breadth of powers that public health authorities had enjoyed remained virtually unchallenged through most of the twentieth century, but finally came under increasing scrutiny during the last decades of that era. the development of a robust jurisprudence of privacy, and the ""due process revolution"", which extended rights to prisoners, mental patients and others under the authority of the state, ultimately questioned the long-held assumptions that had protected public health from constitutional scrutiny. the groundwork for this profound change was laid in the transformations that occurred in american politics, law and culture during the 1960s and 1970s. But it was the HiV/aiDS epidemic that forced a fundamental rethinking of the dominant ideology of public health. the methods of mandatory screening and examination, reporting the names of those who were sick or infected to public health registries and the imposition of quarantine once again became the subject of controversy and dispute (Bayer, 1989) .",41.82573878956422,16.72579599685872

However, there is no quantitative support for this conclusion, because of lack of quality data. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (or SARS) outbreak in 2003 triggered strict public health measures and personal awareness in the prevention of infectious respiratory diseases, providing us an opportunity to quantify the impact of hygiene related factors in the spread of the disease. In this paper, we model the number of the respiratory illnesses by a semiparametric model which models the environmental and weather impacts using a multiple index model and the impact of other public health measures and possible personal awareness using a growth curve with jump. Using data from Hong Kong, we found that public health measures contributed to about 39% of reduction in the number of respiratory illnesses during the SARS period. However, the impact of hygienically related factors eventually fades as time passes. The results provide indirect quantitative support to the usefulness of governmental campaigns to arouse the awareness of the public in staying away from transmission of respiratory diseases during the full outbreak of the disease.

Nevertheless, all 72 patients required thorough assessment and, depending on the results of the assessment, institution of appropriate prevention and control measures. Changing case definitions caused confusion in classifying cases. A centralised assessment of the reported cases by a team with clinical and public health expertise (epidemiological and geographical risk assessment) is a practical solution for addressing differences in applying case definitions.

Public health is divided into the staple pillars of assessment, policy development, and assurance. 3 All three of these pillars are interdependent and cyclical. Two functions address the issues of assessment: (1) monitor health and (2) diagnose and investigate. Under policy development are the functions (1) inform, educate, empower; (2) mobilize community partnerships; and (3) develop policies. The following functions define assurance: (1) link to and/or provide care, (2) ensure a competent workforce, and (3) evaluate. 3 Like traditional programs in public health, ranging from maternal and reproductive health to injury control and prevention, the public health response to disasters also fulfills the same basic tenets of assessment, policy development, and assurance.

While IPC programs are frequently responsible for reporting hospital-associated infections within their facility, it is the responsibility for reporting communicable diseases that is relevant to defense against biological attacks. Communicable disease reporting requirements (also known as Infectious Disease Reporting) vary within each state and even county, but overall, there are state laws requiring medical providers to report notifiable disease to local public health departments [1] . While there is variation in the lists of notifiable diseases that states require healthcare providers to report, there is a general consistency of common and concerning microorganisms that includes all Category A agents and a majority of those listed within the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) bioterrorism agents page [2] [3] [4] [5] . Within hospitals and healthcare facilities, it is generally the IPC program that is responsible for reporting communicable diseases to local public health authorities. While laboratory reporting can and does happen, it is mostly incomplete information and commonly limited to the positive laboratory result and the name of the patient. The legal responsibility of reporting the communicable diseases ultimately tends to fall upon the infection prevention and control program, which must not only report such diseases with complete patient and laboratory information, but also within the required time frame. State reporting laws dictate the list of notifiable diseases and their required reporting time frame. For example, in California, the California Code of Regulations requires a report for West Nile virus infection be submitted by electronic transmission, telephone, or mail within one working day of identification, while a human or animal case of plague requires immediate reporting by phone [6] . These lists mirror that of the CDC's National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). In essence, the reporting structure commonly begins with the IP performing surveillance based off laboratory reports and daily reports of admitting diagnoses for newly admitted patients. From this surveillance, reporting is performed to the local health department, which will then report to the state health department, which then reports it to the CDC. In short, national diseases surveillance and reporting frequently starts with hospital IPC programs. IPC programs have a critical role in communicable disease reporting, which aids in public health response. The strength of the infection prevention and control program will be seen in their ability to perform more specific surveillance and real-time disease reporting. Poorly supported or minimally staffed IPC programs will likely rely solely on microbiology reports and might be delayed in their surveillance and reporting efforts. Some diseases, like Kawasaki syndrome, cannot be confirmed by laboratory tests, which can be challenging, but is overcome through daily chart review and a strong relationship with physicians and other clinical staff. Moreover, once a case is identified as a communicable disease that must be reported, the skilled IP will not only report the required information (e.g., laboratory results, demographics, contact info) but also relevant medical record information for the condition, which will include a timeline of illness, travel history, physician notes, etc. Such attention to detail facilitates a more rapid and efficient response from public health authorities. Overall, the infection prevention and control program within healthcare facilities is frequently the primary source of communicable disease reporting, which is a vital part of public health response during biological events.",45.49216506352352,19.264312425400956

These closures prevent contact among children and reduce cases. However, closing schools has down sides, even if the only goal of the measure is to save lives during an epidemic.

The language of human rights is increasingly part of the landscape for health law in Australia and a See, for example, Public Health Act 1991 (NSW) s 23. internationally. [43] [44] [45] Given the potential for public health laws to impact upon the freedom of individuals, and the need for public health laws to balance the interests of individuals and society, public health laws will ideally have a transparent ethical framework, articulating the principles upon which state intervention will be premised. 46 The World Health Organization has acknowledged the importance of legal and ethical considerations to pandemic preparedness, noting that public health measures such as quarantine, compulsory vaccination and off-licence use of medicines 'need a legal framework to ensure transparent assessment and justification of the measures that are being considered, and to ensure coherence with international legislation (International Health Regulations)'. 47 Consideration of ethical issues is also essential for, as the World Health Organization has noted, ethical issues 'are part of the normative framework that is needed to assess the cultural acceptability of measures such as quarantine or selective vaccination of predefined risk groups'. 48 The exercise of state powers in terms of quarantine, isolation and detention during a public health emergency is likely to be particularly controversial in Western liberal democracies such as Australia. The extent to which the state can and should exercise its powers in this area has become increasingly relevant in public health, as is clear from debates over detention of tuberculosis patients, 49, 50 and from the use of quarantine during the SARS crisis. 51 Although comparable countries to Australia in Europe, the USA and Canada all have human rights charters or equivalents, which could provide procedural protections and safeguards for citizens in relation to quarantine and detention, Australia has yet to develop a Bill of Rights at the federal level. While Australian state and territory governments have begun enacting human rights legislation, 52 there is no comprehensive inclusion of human rights safeguards in the federal Quarantine Act, which raises issues about the mechanisms for ensuring procedural safeguards in the event of a pandemic. 53 Public health measures directed at implementing social distancing, quarantine or travel restrictions will not only infringe on individual liberties that are often taken for granted in Western societies, but are also likely to have a profound economic impact. As outlined above, estimates indicate that pandemic influenza will have a significant impact on the global economy. At local level, businesses may be closed or experience a reduction in their cash flow as public health measures are introduced or people stay home voluntarily. In such an environment, the economic cost to individuals and businesses may be significant, which in turn demands consideration of development of support systems and compensation systems for those affected. 54 In the USA, a great deal of work has been done on strengthening the public health laws, both generally and specifically for public health emergencies. The Turning Point Public Health Statute Modernization National Collaborative developed the Turning Point Model State Public Health Act. 55 In 2001, the Centre for Law and the Public's Health at Georgetown and Johns Hopkins Universities prepared a Model State Emergency Health Powers Act, setting out the powers for a state of public health emergency. The provisions of the earlier Model State Emergency Health Powers Act were adapted and included in the Turning Point Model Act. 56 Article V of the Turning Point Model Act deals with the powers of public health authorities, including the powers of quarantine and isolation. The Model Act provides that the principles to be applied in relation to quarantine and isolation include that they should be by the least restrictive means necessary to prevent the spread of disease (s 5-108[b](1)).

Future directions to control the spread of the disease Extensive measures to reduce person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 are required to control the current outbreak.

A guideline was published for the medical staff, healthcare providers, and, public health individuals and researchers who are interested in the 2019-nCoV [29] . The early death cases of COVID-19 outbreak occurred primarily in elderly people, possibly due to a weak immune system that permits faster progression of viral infection [8, 12] . The public services and facilities should provide decontaminating reagents for cleaning hands on a routine basis. Physical contact with wet and contaminated objects should be considered in dealing with the virus, especially agents such as faecal and urine samples that can potentially serve as an alternative route of transmission [15, 16] . China and other countries including the US have implemented major prevention and control measures including travel screenings to control further spread of the virus [13] . Epidemiological changes in COVID-19 infection should be monitored taking into account potential routes of transmission and subclinical infections, in addition to the adaptation, evolution, and virus spread among humans and possible intermediate animals and reservoirs. There remains a considerable number of questions that need to be addressed. These include, but are not limited to, details about who and how many have been tested, what proportion of these turned positive and whether this rate remains constant or variable.

What is clear is that public health rights and responsibilities for infectious disease are global as well as national. If we are to assess the adequacy of our legal frameworks for pandemic preparedness, we also need to assess the adequacy of our laws in terms of their suitability for meeting our international obligations. While developed countries of the world already have sophisticated public health systems, the capacity to meet their obligations under the IHR (2005), and the financial resources to develop national vaccine stockpiles, the developing countries of the world face a very different outlook. 57 As we consider the intersections of law and public health in the context of the shared global risks of an influenza pandemic, it is important to realize that pandemic preparedness must necessarily involve improved international cooperation and the sharing of expertise to assist in capacity building for public health and the regulatory frameworks surrounding it, as well as a renewed dialogue around international obligations to help the world's poorest and least healthy people. 58 Legal analysis must be a key part of our planning for pandemic influenza. It is essential that federal and state laws are harmonized so as to ensure their smooth functioning and to eliminate crossjurisdictional differences and uncertainties. Public health laws also play a key role in setting out the rights and responsibilities of individuals, communities and governments, providing transparency and accountability to the frameworks for decision-making.

The rationale for the use of surgical face masks is twofold: to protect the wearer from sources of infection, e.g. splashing or spraying of blood, and to protect others from the wearer as a source of infection. 15, 16 It has also been recommended that a surgical face mask with attached face shield or a surgical facemask and goggles should be used for the protection of the wearer during aerosol-generating procedures in patients who are not suspected of being infected with an agent for which respiratory protection is otherwise recommended. 2 The use of surgical masks as part of the Transmission Based Precautions (TBPs) is designed to protect healthcare workers from exposure to potentially infective respiratory droplets. Otherwise, mucosal surfaces of the nose and mouth are exposed, providing an easy route of entry to the body for pathogenic micro-organisms. 2 No standard definition of a surgical facemask was identified in the literature. There appears to be a wide variation in design and quality of masks in use. In terms of design, it is recommended that masks should fully cover the nose and mouth of the wearer. 17e19",53.43960142671864,20.96474750229647

Among these, surveillance mechanisms dominated, which involved new epidemiological techniques and statistical profiling strategies. In this paper, Gramsci's concept of hegemony is used to further understandings of public health governance during the outbreak of emerging infectious diseases. Specifically, the function of the discourse of 'risk' in public health governance is examined, along with public health as a 'moral agent' in the naturalization of specific public health measures. In addition, the pervasive discourse of 'security' is discussed in relation to current public health practices. These characteristics of public health are examined with consideration of their potential for propagating social exclusion and stigmatization of individuals and communities.

Cowling and colleagues 12 noted that the social distancing measures implemented during the COVID-19 outbreak reduced community transmission by 44%, which was much greater than the estimated 10-15% reduction in influenza transmission conferred by school closures implemented alone during the 2009 pandemic in Hong Kong. 44 During the SARS epidemic, schools in Beijing were closed on April 24, 2003, approximately 6 weeks after the beginning of the outbreak, and remained closed for over 2 months. One study 36 concluded that school closures made very little difference to the prevention of SARS in Beijing, given the very low attack rate in schools before the closure and the low prevalence of disease in children. A second study 37 estimated the effective R for each day of the Beijing SARS outbreak, noting that school closures occurred after the R had dropped below 1 and that school closures in this case added little to control of the outbreak. Class cancellation strategies, in which upper high-school and college students remained on college campuses but did not attend classes, were also widely used during the SARS outbreak in mainland China. 45 There was no recorded transmission of SARS in schools during the outbreak in mainland China. 46 A review 33 of the 2003 SARS outbreak in Singapore noted that twice daily, mandatory temperature screen ing of all children aged 6-16 years in schools was part of the containment measures instituted. Pupils were excluded from school if their temperature was more than 37·8°C for students aged 12 years or younger, or more than 37·5°C for students older than 12 years. Although there were school children diagnosed with SARS in Singapore, none of them were identified through temperature screening. 35 All educational facilities in Singapore were closed for 3 weeks from March 27, 2003 (the SARS outbreak ran from late February to May 2003), together with suspension of other activities to prevent the congregation of large groups of children. 34 A review 24 of responses in Taiwan to the SARS outbreak and 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic noted that schools were designated as alternative health-care sites in case the health system was overwhelmed during the SARS outbreak, but that there were no school social distancing measures (including closures) introduced during the SARS outbreak. This finding is in contrast to the use of class suspensions during the H1N1 pandemic in Taiwan. 24 Schools were also closed in Hong Kong during the SARS epidemic; however, the extent to which this was at a city-wide or local level is unclear. There was no evidence of spread of the infection in schools, with spread among children almost entirely through family settings and living in the same apartment blocks as infected cases. 27 A preprint study by Jackson and colleagues 32 used routine viral surveillance to examine the effects on transmission of endemic human coronaviruses (229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1) and other viruses of a 5-day closure of nearly all schools in the greater Seattle metropolitan area in February, 2019, due to extreme weather on transmission of these viruses. Their study estimated that the school closure resulted in a 5·6% (95% CI 4·1-6·9) reduction in coronavirus infections, similar to influenza H1N1 (7·6%; 5·2-9·7) but higher than influenza H3N2 (3·1%; 2·5-3·2), all of which were prevalent at the time. 32",47.300180494992276,18.496380010319665

This situation had rapidly escalated from 29 countries with national school closures a week before. 2 School closures are based on evidence and assumptions from influenza outbreaks that they reduce social contacts between students and therefore interrupt the transmission. 3 School closures can affect deaths during an outbreak either positively, through reducing transmission and the number of cases, or negatively, through reductions in the health-care workforce available to care for those who are sick. Studies of UK children and young people report that the mean number of daily social contacts during school holidays are approximately half that of school term days; 4, 5 however, contacts continue and mixing between children and adults and between children at different schools actually increases during holidays and school closures.

In examining the causal factors related to the SARS outbreak, community-level determinants have been shown to be crucial in the emergence of the disease in human populations. Some key factors that have been identified with SARS are densely populated communities and close, repeated contact with wild animals, especially palm civets (Paguna larvata) and raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procuyoinboides) (Breiman et al., 2003; Poon, Guan, Nicholls, Yuen, & Peiris, 2004; Webster, 2004) . On a national level, China's deficiencies in health infrastructure allowed the emergence and continued spread of the disease without appropriate response measures (Liu, 2004) . In contrast, Singapore rapidly introduced strict infection control measures resulting in low numbers of secondary cases (World Health Organization, 2003) . This illustrates how national infrastructures and health policies can influence disease spread at the community level. At the global level, intercontinental travel facilitated disease spread (World Health Organization, 2003) , whereas the existence of global health infrastructures and global communication networks allowed enhanced information exchange and rapid implementation of appropriate control and prevention measures worldwide (Fidler, 2004; Heymann, 2004) .

Use of chemoprophylaxis to prevent surgical wound infections is an example of a control measure targeted to the individual. The second level is that of the institution, which is predominantly the domain of the infection-control practitioner or the school health official. This level includes health care facilities, nursing homes, other residential facilities, and schools. Programs to prevent the spread of bloodborne pathogens or tuberculosis to health care workers in hospitals are examples of control strategies targeted at the institutional level. The third level is targeted to the community in general and is predominantly the domain of public health agencies (at the local, state, and national levels). Removal of a contaminated food product from the market is an example of a control measure targeted to the community. The fourth level is related to global strategies. For a number of important pathogens, it has become clear that global control strategies are critical to have an impact on disease occurrence within the United States.

The purpose of this study is to examine the H1N1 pandemic decision-making process in Canada with an emphasis on the use of evidence for public health decisions. Using semi-structured key informant interviews conducted after the pandemic (JulyeNovember 2010) and a document analysis, we examined four highly debated pandemic policies: use of adjuvanted vaccine by pregnant women, vaccine priority groups and sequencing, school closures and personal protective equipment. Data were analysed for thematic content guided by Lomas' policy decision-making framework as well as indicative coding using iterative methods. We interviewed 40 public health officials and scientific advisors across Canada and reviewed 76 pandemic policy documents. Our analysis revealed that pandemic pre-planning resulted in strong beliefs, which defined the decision-making process. Existing ideological perspectives of evidence strongly influenced how information was used such that the same evidentiary sources were interpreted differently according to the ideological perspective. Participants recognized that current models for public health decision-making failed to make explicit the roles of scientific evidence in relation to contextual factors.

Critics have much to say about the importance of infrastructure and basic supplies needed, but less has been said about the limitations of Ebola containment measures. Although these previously worked well within geographically isolated communities where Ebola periodically emerged, they were less likely to do so in a sustained and widespread outbreak. In light of the current catastrophe, it now compels us to consider also the limitations of traditional public health measures during an epidemic of this magnitude, which although they may bring an acute situation under control eventually, are challenging to enforce, strain medical and social networks, and provide limited prevention and no cure. 4 Indeed, although these measures have brought the emergency to its current abating state, it took a great deal of time and vast efforts, many still died, and infection resurgence is a possibility. The importance of biomedical countermeasures, such as vaccines, therefore cannot be understated. In this respect, it has been resolved that failures in advanced drug development and production must be tackled (WHO 2015) , especially the political and economic barriers that hamper development and deployment in places such as West Africa, and which further emphasise the neglect of certain transmissible diseases in that region (Marzi and Feldmann 2014) . 5 The current perspectives to zoonotic risks and pandemic planning have changed little despite the warnings from the 'swine flu' pandemic of 2009 6 that the opportunities for expedient vaccine production and sustainable clinical access still seem someway off (Gates 2015) .",46.275645336604185,17.176051234338306

Pandemic infection control and prevention efforts in the healthcare setting, including guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment, produced vigorous debate regarding the quality of the scientific evidence on which the recommendations were based. 64 As an example, the WHO recommended surgical masks be worn by healthcare workers for care of patients with suspected 2009 H1N1 influenza, reserving N95 respirators with 0.3particle filtering capacity, for high-risk aerosol-generating procedures. 65 In contract, CDC recommended fit-tested N95 respirator use by all healthcare workers with close contact with suspected 2009 H1N1 cases. 66 The divergent recommendations were based on very limited evidence showing superior effectiveness of the N95 mask over surgical masks for protection against the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). 67, 68 A recent report found effectiveness of surgical masks and N95 respirators in seasonal influenza prevention to be similar in a study of 446 nurses working in emergency departments and hospital units in 8 tertiary care hospitals in Ontario, Canada, although healthcare worker infection rates were surprisingly high in both groups (23.6% and 22.9%, respectively). 69 Given the limitations of the evidence, cost and availability of the N95 masks drove infection prevention decisions in many healthcare systems. The effective bundling of interventions that include hand hygiene, masks, gowns and gloves has been shown to be highly effective in reducing respiratory virus transmission in a healthcare setting. 67",43.90461344031727,18.86131530282778

In the context of pandemic influenza, it is considered that social measures authorized by law will be at least as important as medical interventions. 3 Evidence from the 1918 influenza pandemic suggests that compulsory home isolation and quarantine were not particularly effective disease control measures because of the difficulty in diagnosing mild cases. Nor were such measures likely to be feasible beyond the initial cases. 4 However, compulsory interventions such as school closures, closure of public places and restriction of mass gatherings, along with disease surveillance and hygiene improvement, have proved effective both in influenza outbreaks and in the SARS epidemic. 5 International and EU instruments require states to undertake such measures, many of which will require a legal underpinning. The requirement of compliance with the revised IHR and the globalization of disease information and exchange have prompted many states to revise their public health laws. Other states, which had no public health legislation, have now enshrined public health laws in legislative form. These initiatives were long overdue. Across Europe, as elsewhere, national public health laws tended to be old, based on flawed science, and to predate contemporary understandings and protection of human rights. 6, 7 The allocation of responsibility for public health practice and the role of the state in regulating private behaviours have very different histories across Europe. 8 Not surprisingly, states have adopted very different positions on the issue of the extent to which constraints can be placed upon individuals for the public benefit. Earlier research on European national public health laws in relation to tuberculosis 9 enabled the identification of four different 'families' of public health legislative models in Europe. These were: authoritarian (the enforcement of a high number of compulsory control measures); moderate (the enforcement of predominantly compulsory control measures without recourse to prevention powers such as compulsory vaccination or population screening); preventive (where compulsory provisions were oriented towards preventive measures, including screening, medical examination and/or vaccination, rather than compulsory treatment or detention); and the laissez faire model, where few or no compulsory measures existed.",66.38687991491153,26.62126098659553

School buildings will be used as centres for vaccination and for accommodation of vulnerable persons. The new Code withdraws employment rights such as the right not to work in a situation of danger. Employees and public servants in France currently have the right to withdraw from their workplace if they reasonably believe that their work situation presents a grave and imminent danger to life and health, provided that they have alerted their employer to the danger and provided that their leaving does not create a new risk for others. Under the new Code, which only applies in the particular case of pandemic influenza, this right of withdrawal will not apply in circumstances where the employer has taken all foreseeable measures to reduce the risk of exposure to disease. The formulation of public health measures across Europe reflects cultural values and priorities. French law, for example, proposes the possible closure of schools in an epidemic, but the new French Public Health Code, recognizing the importance of education in France, provides very specific measures to protect the right to education of its children. The Code acknowledges the need for school closures because children are more susceptible to the influenza virus than adults. However, the Code requires that during a school closure, every effort must be made to continue educational provision via the Internet, radio and television, and sets out detailed provisions on ways in which education might be continued throughout the pandemic.",65.51742642366065,25.091911715617883

Additional and pre-emptive measures must be taken for malaria control in these countries, anticipating the potential challenge that would be faced by the public health system during an outbreak of COVID-19. In the case of Ebola, it was estimated that malaria cases in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone could have increased by up to 1 million in 2014 as a result of a cessation of distribution of insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs). 10 Governments and health leaders in malaria-endemic regions must ensure that such stresses to medical infrastructure are minimised in the event of an outbreak of COVID-19. Resource allocation should be optimised whenever possible to ensure minimal disruption to malaria control should COVID-19 management become necessary. Management of medical supplies and stockpiling of surgical masks and other protective equipment should be done in advance and medical staff should be adequately trained in their use. In cases of emergency, mass drug administration and the distribution of ITNs might be considered for short-term malaria relief in hyperendemic areas. Such measures would also aid efforts in COVID-19 management by reducing the strain on medical resources and minimising confounding factors in diagnosis. Previous successful implementation of such measures occurred during Ebola outbreaks in Sierra Leone in 2014-15 and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2018, in accordance with WHO guidelines. 11, 12 In malaria-endemic regions, malaria diagnostics should be systematically added to fever management, including for suspected cases of COVID-19, and health-care facilities should be well stocked with artemisinin combination therapy drugs.

On 29 April, for example, the Chinese Prime Minister announced measures to have SARS 'brought under control'. Framing responses to SARS in a discourse of bureaucratic control drew on a long tradition in which public health as 'medical police' is a function of the civil state similar to the other kinds of 'policing' it carries out (Jordanova, 1980; Porter, 1999) . Ideas of police ran throughout the limited repertoire of traditional public health techniques used to halt SARS. Quarantines of the infected and their contacts, and surveillance of travellers were the two most important methods used against SARS, with travel bans imposed by some countries. 4 The relationship to policing was clear: governments promised 'to hold victims', 'detain SARS sufferers', identify 'those suspected of harbouring the virus'.

Importantly, the 1933 convention sought to overcome the problem of where such micro-practices of public health should occur. As with other modes of transport, most notably rail travel, the issue was whether public health surveillance should be implemented on departure or arrival; that is at or beyond the sovereign borders of a nation. As we note, one solution was to pass some of the responsibility for implementing public health measures on to the airlines and their passengers. After all, it was the commercial airlines that were required to carry out disinsection, and it was the passengers who were responsible for ensuring that they carried valid documentation detailing the inoculations they had received prior to travel.

By contrast, the basic reproduction number (R0) is the reproduction number when no immunity from past exposures or vaccination, nor any deliberate intervention in disease transmission has been carried out. As a result, it is more appropriate to use R(t) to monitor the real-time transmissibility when public measures are in place. The case fatality rate (CFR) can be used to measure the mortality rate.",44.41230433176571,17.908195787138887

Subsequent to the outbreak of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the Institute of Medicine (IOM) noted the existence of associations among various emerging diseases, emphasizing that microbial threats endanger public health across the globe and demand the urgent need for better strategies and tools to tackle infectious diseases. The IOM outlined several factors contributing to microbial spread, which officials at IOM, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization, and other health agencies are attempting to halt by limiting antimicrobial use, by pouring money into global health funds, by establishing international surveillance networks and, in severe instances, by limiting travel. 10",43.81356613703031,17.776259755130713

Co-investments across sectors, or at least reinforcing ones, have practical value as well. Although typically applied to for-profit contexts, we can consider the process of innovative disruption, which circumvents incumbents to effectively provide an alternative that catches an underserved market or outperforms. Shifting a portion of global health investments from reactionary approaches to preventive capacity could support development of needed renewable technologies such as solar microgrids; building local capacity for installation and maintenance could reduce cost and technological barriers for uptake and use. Capitalizing on voluntary corporate collaboration may be highly fruitful; as of 2012, 1.6% of publically traded companies held more than half of the market value globally, representing enormously powerful interests; gaining their collaboration in sustainable investments could lead to new industry standards. 67 Finally, although a survey of company managers suggested only 27% view climate change as a business risk, 68 compelling industry losses are at stake from broader ecological changes. For example, outbreaks of Marburg virus in Eastern Africa, associated with human encroachment into wildlife habitat for natural resource extraction, prompted mine closures. 69 Adding health to routine environmental and social impact assessment processes for development projects can help identify and mitigate public health risks. There are many opportunities for engagement among those organizations already conscientious of the range of effects (positive and negative) that their investments may have. Multilateral development banks and bilateral aid agencies may be best positioned to lead here given their long histories undertaking impact assessments and diverse expertise, including health. These assessments might include assessment of health inequities of disease burden or disproportionate health-related financial impact to certain populationsdinfrastructure or systems resiliency can also be assessed and improved to reduce vulnerability of investments under climate change. Risks are also highly relevant to reinsurance companies, as their clients increasingly face climate-related losses that add to volatility of risk management.

In such situations, authoritative guidance is needed. Countries all over the world have established their own structures to disseminate outbreak control guidelines and, if necessary, put outbreak control systems in place. In a crisis, health care professionals with diverse backgrounds need to work quickly together to identify cases, perform laboratory diagnostics, trace contacts, and institute infection prevention and control measures as described in the outbreak control guidelines. 1 Optimal compliance with the guidelines, with timely and adequate outbreak control as final outcome, requires good adherence by professionals. Unfortunately, however, their adherence is often not optimal, 2-5 due to knowledge, attitudes, and behavior among professionals, 6, 7 as well as to organizational and other factors. Guidelines are not always clear, and existing facilities are not always adequate or adaptable to the sudden intrusion of crisis measures. A systematic review conducted by Cabana et al 8 revealed a variety of barriers that hinder adherence. The authors provide a generic framework for exploring barriers in various settings. According to the authors, barriers to adherence include those related to the professionals, with a more cognitive (knowledge, awareness) or affective (attitude, motivation) component, those related to the guidelines (their content and target patient population), and those related to the environment (organization, social setting). 8 Many studies have looked at determinants of adherence to guidelines in the routine care of infectious disease, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] but little is known about determinants of adherence to guidelines in crisis situations. 15, 16 Crisis situations differ significantly from routine communicable disease control, because health professionals must respond with prompt decisions, uniformity of action, and quick integration of new knowledge and skills. Furthermore, the context of crisis situations is complex, requiring optimal communication and cooperation between public health services and hospitals. A better understanding of the reasons for nonadherence of health care professionals in crises situations is needed to improve crisis management.

This guidance is based on a pathogen's known epidemiology (ie, patterns of transmissibility and infectivity). 15 Particle size does not affect the infectivity of the pathogen; however, the principle that smaller airborne particles can travel farther and remain suspended in room air longer than larger particles (ie, droplets) is also an important factor to consider in selecting the best protective facemask ( Figure 1 ). Filtering facepiece respirators, such as N95 respirators, are designed to protect the user from both droplet and airborne particles, and they come in many sizes and are designed to seal to the face. Both surgical N95 respirators and surgical masks are disposable, single-use devices that should be worn during a single patient encounter by a single person and should not be shared between wearers. 18 High-filtration surgical laser masks were designed as a form of barrier or source control. When placed on a contagious patient, surgical masks limit the spread of large-sized droplet respiratory secretions to others. When worn by a health care worker, the patient's incisions are protected from infectious agents present in the worker's mucus and saliva, while at the same time, the worker is protected from any sprays of blood or body fluid coming from the patient. Only protective facemasks cleared by the FDA as medical devices are recommended for use in health care workplaces. The FDA does not independently test the devices but rather reviews the manufacturer's testing data for n filter efficiency, n breathing resistance, n flammability, and n fluid resistance. 19, 21 In addition, with regard to the filter efficiency requirements for FDA clearance, a surgical mask must perform as well as one other cleared surgical mask currently on the market. 19 Two key features associated with the level of protection provided by high-filtration surgical laser masks are filtration efficiency and fit. Studies have shown that the filtration efficiency for surgical masks is highly variable depending on the type of mask and the manufacturer. 22, 23 The filtration efficiency can be as high as that of a surgical N95 respirator, but even when surgical masks with the most efficient filter media (ie, high-filtration surgical laser masks) are properly worn, the fit factor obtained is quite low. Oberg and Brosseau 22 conducted filtration performance and fit tests with nine types of surgical masks and found that none of the models tested exhibited adequate filter performance and facial fit characteristics to be considered equivalent to a surgical N95 respirator. Surgical masks are not designed to seal to the face. Without an adequate seal to the face, inhaled breath is not forced through the filter and instead flows through the gaps around the seal area, providing minimal protection by allowing potentially hazardous contaminants to enter the workers' breathing zone through gaps between the wearer's face and the mask. Therefore, surgical and high-filtration surgical laser masks do not provide the degree of protection to be considered respiratory PPE.",44.519815308643885,17.617989414908216

The SARS-CoV had a relatively long 4-to 6-day incubation period and a peak infectious period that was delayed until the tenth day of severe illness. 16 SARS was transmitted predominantly in the healthcare settings, with a case fatality rate exceeding 10%. These features made SARS relatively easy to detect and readily amenable to individual-based control measures such as case isolation and contact tracing before substan-tial spread could occur beyond initial seeding and local hospital-based outbreaks. Influenza viruses, in contrast, are characterized by shorter incubation (typically 1-4 days), pre-clinical virus shedding and peak infectiousness shortly after illness onset. 17, 18 Influenza illness comprises a spectrum including mild or asymptomatic infection with overall case fatality below 2% even during the worst pandemic on record (1918) and 10-fold lower still during subsequent pandemics. 19 In keeping with this classic influenza profile, pandemic (H1N1) 2009 shows a larger proportion of mild infections, community-based propagation and a lower case fatality than SARS. 20 Thus, while the reproduction numbers of the two infections are not dramatically different, they likely will require a different set of population-based social distancing and mitigation measures. General reinforcement of voluntary self-isolation, cough etiquette, handwashing and self-monitoring by contacts combined with social strategies to disrupt complex contact networks and lessen virus amplification and adaptation at the community level are needed. National health authorities in North America and Europe have implemented varying school closure policies (e.g. broadly in Mexico, targeted in the UK and minimal in the US) in an attempt to contain viral transmission; as of this writing, these measures are being scaled back, but further interventions to change social contact patterns may be important as the outbreak progresses. 21 Pandemics are classically defined as the emergence of novel influenza A subtypes that have not previously been experienced by human populations, or at least not for a 2009 remains a worthwhile goal until a safe and effective vaccine can be developed and administered. Furthermore, global inequalities in social and economic conditions amplify the impacts of infectious diseases, including influenza. 22 As our estimates account for important sociological anomalies and are based on multiple data sources from communities rather than closed settings, they are likely to be broadly applicable. However, our optimistic prognosis relies on several critical assumptions about disease progression, virulence, and reporting rates, and it is clear that worse scenarios could evolve. Vigilant surveillance, self-isolation, adherence to social distancing and hygiene measures, strategic school closures, and other community measures to mitigate spread, as directed by national policy, may be paramount in the months to come.

Important primary prevention efforts include vaccination, hand hygiene, and use of personal protective equipment. Protection efforts are hindered by a lack of data on modes of transmission of respiratory pathogens such as influenza, on effectiveness of protection provided by different types of equipment, and on how to ensure adherence to safe work practices. 1 Adherence to personal protective equipment generally has been identified as a long-standing problem in the health sector, and most proposed solutions have either had minimal impact or been unsustainable. Adherence to personal protective equipment (such as gloves) to prevent the spread of bloodborne disease is an area that has been well studied. 2 Adherence to facial protective equipment (FPE) (respirators, surgical masks, eye/face protection) to prevent the spread of communicable respiratory illness has only recently become the focus of research. Studies have shown that adherence to FPE was the most problematic of all types of personal protective equipment in health care.

These guidelines, which outline specific strategies for prevention and control of influenza in acute care facilities, supplement CDC's 2008 infection control recommendations (4). Despite these strategic references, at least 48 cases of influenza A (H1N1) strain have been reported among health care personnel since the initial outbreak, indicating that compliance with the CDC's recommendations may be lower than desired (5) . Although there is limited and controversial evidence regarding the effectiveness of either surgical or N95 masks in reducing transmission of the influenza virus, studies of occupational exposures during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak suggest that the wearing of either surgical or N95 masks might be protective in the health care setting (6 -10) .

One recommendation is to empower and encourage these non-physician health providers, using triage protocols, to deploy droplet precautions, such as providing patients who have recognized symptoms of respiratory infections with a surgical mask and assigning them a private room. Other recommendations during busy influenza weeks include cohorting patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) in a holding area when private rooms are not available, and visible signage at patient check-in requesting patients' voluntary use of surgical masks (provided for those patients with symptoms of ILI [e.g., cough, fever, myalgia]).

First, under Article 43.2, countries cannot implement additional health measures exclusively as a precaution but must rather ground their decision making in ""scientific principles"", ""scientific evidence"", and ""advice from WHO"". 1 Many of the travel restrictions being implemented during the COVID-19 outbreak are not supported by science or WHO. Travel restrictions for these kinds of viruses have been challenged by public health researchers, [4] [5] [6] and WHO has advised against travel restrictions, arguing they cause more harm than good. 7, 8 Second, under Article 43.1 any additional health measures implemented by countries ""shall not be more restrictive of international traffic and not more invasive or intrusive to persons than reasonably available alternatives"". 1 In this case, even if travel restrictions did work, there are so many other more effective measures that countries can take to protect their citizens. WHO has issued COVID-19 technical guidance on several such measures, including risk communication, surveillance, patient management, and screening at ports of entry and exit. 9 Third, and most importantly, Article 3.1 strictly requires all additional health measures to be implemented ""with full respect for the dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms of persons"", 1 which in turn must reflect the international law principles of necessity, legitimacy, and proportionality that govern limitations to and derogations from rights and freedoms. 10 Under no circumstances should public health or foreign policy decisions be based on the racism and xenophobia that are now being directed at Chinese people and those of Asian descent. 11 Many of the travel restrictions implemented by dozens of countries during the COVID-19 outbreak are therefore violations of the IHR. 12 Yet, perhaps even more troubling, is that at least two-thirds of these countries have not reported their additional health measures to WHO, 12 response to public health emergencies and prevents countries from holding each other accountable for their obligations under the IHR. Some countries argue that they would rather be safe than sorry. But evidence belies the claim that illegal travel restrictions make countries safer. [4] [5] [6] In the short term, travel restrictions prevent supplies from getting into affected areas, slow down the international public health response, stigmatise entire populations, and disproportionately harm the most vulnerable among us. In the longer term, countries selecting which international laws to follow encourages other countries to do the same, which in turn undermines the broader rules-based world order. Effective global governance is not possible when countries cannot depend on each other to comply with international agreements. 13 Of course, the IHR is far from perfect. For example, the IHR only governs countries, not corporations and other non-governmental actors. Thus, some countries are finding themselves with de-facto travel restrictions when airlines stop flying to places affected by COVID-19.",40.92132136416703,17.07704030491207

The Chinese social networking sites' timeliness of reporting are significantly better compared to international mainstream media in English, official websites of the central Chinese government and WHO. Information was released by the local news agencies on the social networking site in the local language before any reports in the conventional news websites or government websites. The information was subsequently amplified by the social networking sites through re-posting of the original report. This allowed the international community greater access to more detailed and timely information compared to that released at the central government level to the international media. The central Chinese government may have allowed the provincial/municipal health authorities to release information on new cases when available to ensure transparency and timeliness of public communications. The access to such timely, crowd-sourced information on infected cases greatly facilitated the understanding of the epidemiology of an unknown disease, which is key in developing effective prevention and control measures. public health practitioners, social media surveillance could provide early warning for unusual public health events in a foreign country and serve as an additional source of epidemiological intelligence to complement conventional surveillance tools.

In fi nancial terms, funding from diff erent partners is harmonised under one fi nancing plan with clear funding needs and gaps-another model for other programmes. Furthermore, the failure to control tuberculosis in the past-when tuberculosis services were not free-and the success in tuberculosis control over the past few yearswhen tuberculosis services have been free-have provided policymakers with arguments to increase funding for public health from the government. With regard to management, several features of DOTS-eg, directly observed therapy to manage treatment of patients and the management of logistics and drugs-are now used to tackle HIV/AIDS and in other public-health programmes. Furthermore, although many public-health workers are being trained to implement DOTS, setbacks caused by inadequate numbers of trained workers have shown governmental leaders the importance of such resources in public health, and thus they have increased planning for them.

The consideration that should accord severe infectious diseases the top priority in emergency public health events was inadequate. Nowadays, infectious diseasesespecially acute and severe ones transmitted via respiratory and intestinal tractsmay appear as either newly emerged infectious diseases or weapons in biological terrorism. Since such diseases usually emerge in an explosive and indiscriminate manner and have wide spread impact, they often lead to panic, social disorder, and economic trauma. Historically, severe epidemics had sometime changed war outcomes, wreaked social disorder, and altered political regimes. Considering these grave potential impacts, the establishment of a response system to severe infectious diseases should be given significant priority in the response system of sudden public health incidents. Acute and severe viral infectious diseases generally do not have specific and effective prevention and treatment measures; therefore, emergency response, prevention, and control need to be given the top priority. 2. The most significant revelation from the SARS outbreaks is that the response system to emergency public health events is inadequate. In the epidemics, weaknesses in China's command system, information system, prevention and treatment teams, and corresponding material storages were completely exposed. For the past two decades, the public health service in China has lagged behind, primarily due to inadequate funding. To solve these problems is an essential step for China to build a harmonious modern society with long-term lasting and equilibrating economic development. The establishment of China's CDCcentered nationwide laboratory monitor network, epidemic information network, emergency teams, and material storage is an essential component in building up the national response to public health emergencies. 3. No consummate public reporting institution of epidemic is observed. In the beginning of the epidemic, the policy of ""strict inward while loose outward"" concerning SARS blocked the epidemic information. The mystery of epidemic disease hovered among the public. Information was not transparent and blocked between related CDCs and researchers, even among departments of government including China and international organizations. This delayed the timely control of the epidemic and even initiated a confidence crisis among the public. It is essential to develop a complete system to announce and report epidemics -a scientific system to analyze and explain epidemics so that various departments can coordinate control of the epidemic and so that the public can correctly understand the epidemic and positively support the measures that the government takes to contain the epidemic.

Surgical masks are worn over the nose and mouth such as those worn in the operating room. N-95 respirators are masks designed to be 95% effective in filtering particles down to 0.3 m in size and are used in a variety of occupational settings. Facemasks must be replaced frequently because the accumulation of moisture from breathing will decrease the ability to block the penetration of microbes. 92 Use of facemasks and covering the mouth when sneezing may have helped reduce transmission of SARS. 93 Official recommendations for the use of respiratory protection are undergoing constant review. Recently, the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), an arm of the CDC, modified prior recommendations from 2004 and now advocates the use of N-95 respirators for workers engaged in activities with the high likelihood of generating infectious aerosols. 94 Other CDC guidance documents recommend the use of surgical masks in the event of a shortage of N-95 respirators. Surgical masks offer protection from larger aerosol droplets and are not as effective as the N-95 in protecting the wearer. If respiratory protection is worn, users must be trained in its proper use, including advice on proper fitting, maintenance and hygiene, re-use protocols and proper disposal of used respirators. 95 Despite recommendations for the use of respirators or surgical masks in caring for flu patients in the health care setting, the Department of Health and Human Services is stopping short of recommending their use by the general public unless they are caring for family members known to be ill from pandemic influenza. 96 The CDC's recommendations for airline flight crews encourage giving sick passengers surgical masks to reduce dissemination of aerosol particles to others in the aircraft cabin. 97 Still, the government has not strongly advocated their use elsewhere by sick individuals nor have they encouraged production and stockpiling of respirators or sur-gical masks for use during a pandemic. 98 In addition, there is a stigma in most Western countries about wearing surgical face masks and respirators in public, and this may prove to be a barrier to their use. 99 Hogg and Houston 89 have developed a simple mnemonic, MASKS, for basic precautions that can be taken in an outpatient setting:",47.3878699558224,18.607366577390433

Although the initial cover-up of the outbreak in mainland Chinese media caused panic among communities, a drastic improvement of coverage and measures boosted confidence in this source, in particular sources from the regions of China that people originated from. Major local European language media (TV, newspapers, and Internet news websites) and websites of health authorities such as WHO were used by English/Dutch-speaking respondents. Nevertheless, mass media coverage of SARS from and about both affected Asia and unaffected Europe was regarded as exaggerated and sensational. Respondents expressing this view recalled that images of orientallooking people wearing face masks dominated both Asian and local European mass media, which initiated a feeling of fear. Different focuses in media coverage were noted and an impression of a racialized discourse in European media was recalled. For example, the Asian media were associated with regularly updated death and infection bulletin tolls, implementation of protective measures, and the sacrifices made by the health workers. Memories of European media coverage focused on travel warnings, alarmist predications about the global spread, and blame on the Chinese government's handling of the outbreak. Awareness of information available from British and Dutch public health organizations was low among the group participants. Lack of information in Chinese languages from these sources was identified as a reason for using communications intended for infected regions, for example, WHO and Hong Kong's Department of Health websites, rather than local public health agencies.

Undergraduate education in public health, which takes place in medical schools, covers areas including epidemiology, biostatistics, environmental health, occupational health and safety, food hygiene, school health, health toxicology and radiation protection. In recent years, medical sociology, maternal and child health, health management and policies, health economics, health inspections and their roles within healthcare services have been gradually added to the curriculum of most schools. There has also been an increase in masters courses in public health.

A meta-analysis comparing bloodstream infection due to MRSA and meticillin-susceptible S. aureus showed a significant increase in mortality associated with MRSA bloodstream infection. 3 Preventing and controlling MRSA requires a multifaceted approach that includes early detection and isolation, a common feature of many national guidelines. 4 In the UK and elsewhere, there is a move towards the introduction of universal screening, i.e. the taking of swabs from all patients irrespective of risk, and this has provoked some discussion on its merits. 5 In the emergency department (ED), infection prevention and control measures have to be balanced with the requirement to treat patients urgently and to transfer patients requiring admission as quickly as possible to acute hospital beds. Furthermore, in North America and elsewhere, the phenomenon of community-acquired MRSA is being seen, particularly in EDs, in patients without known risk factors for healthcare-associated MRSA. 6 We have documented that anything that prolongs patients' ED stay may adversely affect patient welfare and compound overcrowding. 7 Most national and local guidelines on the prevention and control of MRSA largely focus on inpatients but their implementation has implications for the ED. Prolonging patients' stay in the ED will further compound overcrowding, which is a recognised contributor to spread of hospital-acquired infection. 8 We assessed the contribution that previous MRSA risk group identification and selective rescreening of these patients made to their stay in a busy, overcrowded ED.",43.086827508184065,19.059598025729716

Limitations of the intervention include participant attrition and insufficient access to comprehensive mental health and substance use management resources. D. Further Recommendations: For many, maintaining treatment adherence is challenging. Implementing programs that offer unlimited sessions of mental health counseling and substance use treatment or harm-reduction strategies for people living with HIV could greatly increase treatment adherence. Additionally, public health policy could be modified with the aim of de-stigmatizing those living with HIV/AIDS. Effective legislation could include acts recognizing and legitimizing same sex couples. Comprehensive, accessible health care should be provided to anyone, regardless of socioeconomic status. These changes could help mitigate the shame reported by some people living with HIV/ AIDS, potentially leading to greater help seeking behaviors and lower transmission rates. Additionally, embracing HIV testing as a routine component of primary care could help to reduce HIV incidence and minimize stigma, potentially leading to a number of positive personal and public health outcomes, including increased treatment adherence. The impact of depression on treatment adherence in individuals with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) has been well-supported in the literature (Hailey & Moss, 2000) ; however, the influence of anxiety on adherence is less clear. It has been suggested that the relationship between anxiety and adherence may be indirect and influenced by other cognitive or psychosocial variables such as locus of control or knowledge of disease (Brownbridge & Fielding, 1994 , DiMatteo et al., 2000 . Anxiety has been related to adherence with antibiotic regimens (Cockburn et al., 1987) , and for patients with asthma (Baiardini et al., 2006) and COPD (Dowson et al., 2004) . A limitation of previous research on anxiety and adherence in ESRD is the failure to investigate the differential impact of anxiety on specific components of adherence (e.g., medication, appointment attendance, dietary guidelines). The goal of the present study was to conduct a preliminary investigation into the relationship of anxiety and renal disease knowledge to treatment adherence. Data includes 124 veterans with ESRD referred for pre-surgical psychological evaluations for renal transplantation. Renal disease knowledge was assessed in several subcategories of diet, medication, and laboratory tests. Adherence was assessed with respect to diet, medication, and appointment attendance. Both knowledge and adherence were rated by clinicians based on patient self-report and renal team staff-report. Patients were divided into ""anxious"" and ""non-anxious"" groups based on self-reported presence of anxiety symptoms. Data analysis on self-reported compliance revealed that there were no group differences with regard to renal disease knowledge; however, patients in the anxious group were rated as significantly more compliant with renal diet and appointment attendance than non-anxious patients (t > 2.20, p < .05). In addition, regression analyses indicated that anxiety and knowledge significantly predicted compliance with appointment attendance [F (1, 116) = 3.68, p = .05] and dietary adherence [F(4,115) = 5.95, p < .001].",42.82461433206289,17.523695818662656

As a further extension of learning from Ebola, the UN established a Zika Multi-Partner Trust Fund to help secure funds to support the R&D efforts. 18 In response to the recognised difficulties in diagnostic testing for Zika, 19 WHO issued a Target Product Profile in April to support and direct research efforts to develop better tests. 20 The international reaction to the Zika PHEIC declaration was also different to the reaction to the Ebola PHEIC.

The traditional surveillance network using reporting cards filled out by hand and sent by mail or fax has been replaced with an automatic information system called the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention, which is the world's largest internet-based disease reporting system. 12 The government has also increased their investment in enhancing the capabilities of detecting, diagnosing, preventing, and controlling newly emerging infectious diseases at various levels. New and innovative strategies have been established for response to health emergencies, such as the establishment of the parallel laboratory confirmation mechanism for newly emerging infectious pathogens to reduce the risk of errors, rapid disclosure of information to the WHO and to the public, international information exchange and collaboration, and the provision of more information on public health and on infectious diseases to the public. Furthermore, the Chinese government has strengthened both the related aspects of the legal system and the disease prevention and control system. For example, the government issued the Law of the People's Republic of China on Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases (Revised Draft) in 2004 and Regulations on Preparedness for and Response to Emergent Public Health Hazards in 2003, created the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, and improved surveillance systems of infectious diseases and preparedness and response capacity for emerging public health events. [28] [29] [30] Education and training projects, such as training courses for public health officials and HCWs, have been initiated, and new training has been added to the education programs of universities. Funds for research projects on the development of vaccines, drugs, and diagnostic techniques have been granted to develop new approaches in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of emerging infectious diseases.",43.25111225833197,16.317888483965344

Those results are consistent with those of a simpler analysis in which persons were stratifi ed according to adherence (online Technical Appendix, available from www.cdc.gov/EID/content/15/2/233-Techapp. pdf). We emphasize that this level of risk reduction is dependent on the context, namely, adults in the household caring for a sick child after exposure to a single index case. We urge caution in extrapolating our results to school, workplace, or community contexts, or where multiple, repeated exposures may occur, such as in healthcare settings. The exact mechanism of potential clinical effectiveness of face mask use may be the prevention of inhalation of respiratory pathogens but may also be a reduction in handto-face contact. Our study could not determine the relative contributions of these mechanisms. In our study, fi t testing for P2 masks was not conducted because this is unlikely to be feasible in the general community during a pandemic. As such, we felt it was more appropriate to determine the effi cacy of non-fi t-tested masks. We found no difference in adherence between P2 and surgical masks, an important fi nding, as there is a common belief among healthcare workers that P2 masks are less comfortable. The size of the study did not permit conclusive comparison of the relative effi cacy of P2 masks and surgical masks. Given the 5-to 10-fold cost difference between the 2 mask types, quantifying any difference in effi cacy between surgical masks and particulate respirators remains a priority that needs to be addressed by a larger trial.",41.82931343472899,16.240835056850464

As with many populations affected during the 1918-1919 pandemic (e.g. Geneva, Switzerland; Chowell et al. 2006) , Sydney experienced multiple epidemic waves. There are several theories explaining the multiple waves, including transient post-infection immunity, viral antigenic drift and the involvement of multiple viral strains; substantial counterarguments exist for all these theories and the issue remains unresolved (Taubenberger & Morens 2006) . In the case of Sydney, the beginning of a second wave coincided with the lifting of public infection control measures, suggesting that transient adoption of social distancing measures could underlie the observed dynamics (McCracken & Curson 2003) . More broadly, Hatchett et al. (2007) observed that the quality and timing of non-pharmaceutical public health interventions aimed at decreasing disease transmission by reducing social contact rates appeared to influence the course of influenza epidemics in 17 large US cities during 1918, with second waves occurring only after the relaxation of interventions. We hypothesize that the public of Sydney in 1919 initially responded to the public health measures and subsequently rising and/or high incidence of cases and, particularly, case fatalities by reducing their exposure to potentially infectious contacts. Bootsma & Ferguson (2007) have documented a similar reactive reduction in contact rates in response to high mortality rates arising from pandemic influenza. As the perceived risk decreased, the public subsequently relaxed, returning to normal behaviour. There is a delayed negative feedback between the contact rate and the incidence, and, as with many dynamical systems that experience time lags, oscillations develop. We assume that R 0 is constant over the duration of the epidemic. This is in contrast to Chowell et al. (2006) for example, who assumed that R 0 differed between waves-we consider this to be a phenomenological rather than explanatory assumption.",40.06476278570593,14.934162343179734

Significant medical school debt can drive new physicians away from the ID specialty and public health. Targeted loan repayment opportunities would allow more physicians to pursue these critical career paths. In July 2018, in a move supported by IDSA, the US House of Representative's Energy and Commerce Committee passed legislation that would authorize the CDC to provide loan repayment for those who serve in the Epidemic Intelligence Services (EIS). More than 85% of EIS officers continue serving in public health roles, and this proposal would significantly help make this career path more financially feasible for physicians. Such loan forgiveness opportunities could also be broadened to support ID physicians who work in public health at the federal, state, or local level and face similar challenges around compensation and medical student debt. Establish financial compensation for ID physicians who work in public service (eg, local, state, and federal public health agencies) or who do ID work that provides broader public health benefits (infection control and antimicrobial stewardship). Physicians who perform infection control and antimicrobial stewardship work should be compensated for these activities. As part of hospital accreditation, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) mandates that every participating facility have an active infection control program [37] . States could attach an accreditation process to such mandates that would formally document ID clinicians who oversee hospital infection control and antimicrobial stewardship committees, with loan forgiveness or other financial incentives attached to this accreditation. Ensure that ID physician compensation reflects public health value added. As a cognitive specialty, many of the clinical services ID physicians provide are billed under Evaluation and Management codes, which have not been reevaluated in more than 20 years. The CMS should update these codes to reflect the increasingly complex care provided in inpatient and outpatient settings. Public and private payers, healthcare systems, and hospitals should also provide appropriate compensation and protected time for nonclinical services that are crucial to public health, including infection prevention and control, antimicrobial stewardship, and bioemergency preparedness and response.

The reasons for this are varied and complex, but they include limited access to resources that can help people to take action during an emergency, culture and language barriers, lower perceived personal risk, distrust of authorities, lack of preparation and protective action, and frequent reliance on informal sources of information. 1, 2 Central to these factors, we argue, is the phenomenon of communi-cation inequalities, which we define as differences among individuals and social groups in accessing and using health information and the resultant impact on knowledge and behaviors. [2] [3] [4] While a solid body of work in social epidemiology has documented a connection between social determinants such as socioeconomic position, race, and ethnicity and health outcomes, the mechanisms linking the 2 have been less clear. Viswanath and colleagues developed an explanatory framework of how inequalities in public health emergency preparedness outcomes attributable to social determinants could potentially be explained by inequalities on various dimensions of public health emergency preparedness. 5 The framework is summarized by the Structural Influence Model (SIM) of preparedness communication depicted in Figure 1 . 5 The model is a heuristic framework developed to link social determinants with preparedness outcomes through public health emergency preparedness communications. The framework was originally developed in the context of health communication 5 and subsequently adopted to public health emergency preparedness communication to the public. 6 Communication to the public is critically important in public health emergency preparedness. It is one of 15 public health emergency preparedness capabilities developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): ''Public Information and Warning.'' 7 During a crisis, federal, state, and local public health agencies are typically engaged in a variety of public information efforts to inform the population, encourage the adoption of preventive behaviors, and limit the adverse impacts of specific events. Yet, individuals and groups may not be able to access and use some of the resources offered to them, including information on health and specific threats, because of existing social inequalities, including socioeconomic position, race, ethnicity, and physical and mental health disabilities, among others. 8 Emergencies, including disasters, also can lead to longterm disparities, even controlling for predisaster socioeconomic status, as a study of Hurricane Katrina showed. 9 These disparities are also found among nations. For ex-ample, a United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) study showed that the adverse consequences of disasters, such as mortality, are greater among countries with low income, low life expectancy, and less education. 10 In contrast, advanced countries with higher income and education and more stable governance suffer fewer losses in disasters. 9 Poorer households tend to have poorer coping strategies and suffer consequences over the longer term. 11 In an analysis, Kim showed that poor people are more likely than nonpoor people to be exposed to disasters and that the poor are much more likely to be concentrated in disasterprone areas, highlighting the importance of public health emergency preparedness communications. 6 During an emergency, a number of psychosocial as well as social factors influence action, even when information about a probable hazard is available and promptly communicated to the public. For example, Mexican Americans often have delayed responses to natural emergencies because of the time they spend in trying to communicate with their extended families. 12 Hearing impairment may leave elderly people more vulnerable to information processing and cause difficulty in understanding evacuation orders, 13 and individuals with low literacy may be challenged in interpreting written messages and are likely to benefit from preparedness resources that are easy to read and visually appropriate. 14 Given the importance of communicating to the public in public health emergency preparedness, it is important to examine the extent to which this issue has received attention from the scientific community. The goal of this project was to conduct a systematic review of the scientific literature to describe current research in public communication in public health emergency preparedness, with a particular focus on communication inequalities and their association with communication and preparedness outcomes. This review examines the relationship among sociodemographics, behavioral characteristics, and communication outcomes in public health emergency preparedness.",41.14808401015529,16.416512694870384

This study has shown that around half of the respondents had washed their hands more than 10 times a day. Previous local studies conducted during and after the SARS period, as well as one study that was related to avian flu, which was conducted in 2007, also recorded very high frequencies of handwashing. 12 Moreover, the vast majority of our respondents (close to 90%) wore face masks in case of ILI symptoms. A comparable prevalence (92.4%) was obtained from a local study, which was conducted in 2007, investigating responses to an anticipated human-to-human H5N1 epidemic in Hong Kong. 13 The frequency of mask use in case of ILI symptoms therefore had in fact been increasing since the SARS and post-SARS period. 14 Frequent handwashing and use of face masks in case of ILI symptoms have been promoted by the Hong Kong government in the last few years as part of the preparedness against avian flu. There were posters and public health announcements on TV and other media, frequent broadcasts in all train stations, as well as leaflets handed out at the customs, educating people about the importance of washing hands frequently and properly. Similar messages were given during the SARS period, as well as for prevention of avian flu and seasonal flu. Such efforts have escalated since the influenza A/H1N1 outbreak occurred and are paying off: frequent handwashing seems to have become a habit of many Hong Kong people, and use of face masks in case of ILI symptoms seems to have become a norm in the Hong Kong community, worn to protect others from contracting influenza. It is known that subjective norms are important determinants of health behaviors.

These two measures would decrease human exposure to H5N1 and decrease likelihood of mixing of H5N1 with human-specific viruses. The WHO specifically recommends workers involved in the culling of poultry flocks take protective measures to decrease exposure to bird excrement. Protective clothing and gear as well as proper cleaning of surfaces must be employed. The WHO also reports that poultry workers in areas with outbreaks should receive antiviral drugs as prophylaxis. Proper reporting to local and state officials is a must when cases of avian influenza are found in humans. Public health is dependent on the dissemination of pertinent information. Officials need to assess the virology of circulating animal and human infections to best assess vaccination needs and other protective measures. 6 To date there has been no evidence of efficient humanto-human transmission of H5N1 virus. However, the continued circulation and now spread to Europe of the virulent H5N1 virus increases the possibility of the reassortment of this virus with other circulating human influenza A strains and increases the possibility of a global influenza pandemic.

Support during the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014À16 and Zika spreading out from Brazil in 2016À17 has been criticized as bumbling and inadequate, but did indicate strong levels of international cooperation and shared global concern. This most recent Ebola epidemic was the longest and most deadly in history, resulting in nearly 29,000 cases and over 11,000 deaths in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Several potentially useful therapeutic agents were available in 2014 that had been tested on animals, and limited early studies of the safety of vaccine candidates for humans. However, the affected countries struggled to deal with the rapidly escalating epidemic and the growing number of patients. Médecins sans Frontiére (MSF) provided the front-line treatment and infection control, and warned that the epidemic was ""out of control"" and would require a massive international response. First responders in many settings show the way in ethical behavior in calamitous situations such as the Syrian civil war where civilians as well as medical facilities are bombed and gassed deliberately by government and foreign forces. National, international, and local representatives play a critical role in preparing the global community for unexpected epidemics. Research, with sound clinical trials based on best practices for improving clinical care and vaccines for prevention to protect at risk populations, are needed during and between public health emergencies.

Low health-care worker awareness of the possibility of MERS-CoV with consequential poor implementation of infection control procedures resulted in nosocomial outbreaks. These outbreaks involved transmission of the infection to existing hospital patients, outpatients, visitors, and health-care workers within health-care facilities.

RISK, RIGHTS AND PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES","But what of human rights? Do they feature in the new IHR? Put shortly, the answer is yes. Article 3(1) contains the first reference to human rights: it states that the implementation of the IHR is to be ‘with full respect for the dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms of persons’. Thereafter, human rights crop up in a number of articles. Article 42, for example, provides that all health measures must be applied in a transparent and non-discriminatory way. Informed consent and information privacy feature in several articles, including Article 23 which provides that States Parties must not apply health measures such as vaccination, medical examination or isolation to international travellers without ‘prior express informed consent’, save in circumstances where there is ‘evidence of an imminent public health risk’.38 Article 45(1) provides that States Parties must treat personal health information in a confidential manner ‘as required by national law’. More generally, the new IHR feature requirements concerning any limitations on rights that are familiar from international human rights law. So, for example, WHO recommendations to States Parties, and health measures implemented by States Parties in response to identifiable risks, must be ‘no more invasive or intrusive to persons than reasonably available alternatives that would achieve the appropriate level of health protection’.39 The IHR also give WHO a new power to use information about disease outbreaks provided by unofficial sources (for example, non-governmental organisations or individual scientists).40 Significantly, WHO has described this new power as a ‘revolutionary departure from previous international conventions and regulations’.41",41.97149899160174,16.979611393753267

RISK, RIGHTS AND PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES","In thinking about risk within rights in the context of public health emergency preparedness, these points suggest a range of strategies. For example, the use of coercive measures—such as quarantine—requires particularly strong justification. These measures infringe liberty and privacy rights and, if mistakes are made, healthy individuals are put at serious risk of infection. The threat of quarantine can lead individuals to delay seeking diagnosis and treatment. It can also provoke or compound discrimination and stigmatisation of particular individuals and groups. And, as Lucia Zedner has pointed out, the use of risk categories to target certain groups can create a further problem:
At one level, it makes perfect sense to target security measures at those deemed most to threaten. Yet an inherent danger of selectivity is that precisely because it imposes restrictions only on targeted sections of the population, it is less likely to invoke the natural political resistance generated by burdens that affect us all.70
Critical counter-terrorism scholarship should also be seen as relevant in developing an account of risk-based evidence and its relationship to human rights. Some public health commentators, discussing coercive measures, have begun to advocate a direct linkage between risk expertise and human rights standards:
An approach, which might enable the formulation of a body of public health ethics acceptable to human rights jurisprudence is to introduce into the language of ethics and rights the notion of evidence-based assessment of risk.71
This approach, they argue, could help to bring consistency and coherence to the ‘balancing [of] the common public health good with individual rights’.72 For this to be true, critical counter-terrorism scholarship suggests that two particular problems will need to be addressed: the first concerns the terminology of balance; the second concerns the nature and role of risk-based evidence in legal processes.",41.51922166018738,16.26821150962679

However, manufacturers and suppliers often cannot meet the surge demand because of difficulties in material preparation, insufficient production capacity, and global panic buying. The discrepancy between the supply and demand directly affects protection measures for the frontline healthcare and epidemic prevention workers, causing fear and reduced workplace efficiency. After the SARS epidemic, the Taiwan CDC proposed “A Strategy Plan for PPE Minimum Stockpile” and established the 3-tier stockpiling framework—a central health authority (managed by the Taiwan CDC), local health authorities, and medical institutions—to effectively respond to emergent demands and spread the risk of stockpiling. We have also formulated a minimum stockpile for each tier, taking into consideration: (1) the protective properties of PPE; (2) the consumption of PPE during nonepidemic and epidemic periods; (3) the production capacity of the manufacturers; (4) potential alternatives; and (5) the lead time. In addition, the amount of PPE required for nationwide medical care, border quarantine, and epidemic prevention during the early phase of an outbreak was estimated. In 2003, the nationwide minimum stockpile of PPE included 3 million N95 respirators, 1.5 million coveralls, and 25 million surgical masks.

In Singapore, given our findings, this might involve stressing the necessity of such measures to reduce mortality, to co-opt the mortality-averse group, and to minimise the economic impact, to gain support from the sizeable tax-averse group. Studies such as this one can also identify misperceptions among the public that may hinder support for effective control. Two such examples surfaced in our study: (1) temperature screening island-wide received considerable support by our survey participants, although temperature screening at the country’s main airport was estimated only to pick up around one imported case in four in 2009,28 and was increasingly ineffective as the infection became more widespread,57 and (2) the predicted risk of infectious disease outbreaks was considerably underestimated: 2013 saw ∼ 20 000 dengue infections in Singapore, but the mean forecast risk of an outbreak infecting at least 200 people was a mere 29%. Future studies might evaluate the effect of priming respondents with accurate public health information before eliciting their preferences. We included interventions that would be considered for use in response to an emerging infectious disease, and so did not consider vaccination given the lead time needed to develop a vaccine. For many vaccine-preventable infections, however, decisions about whether to be vaccinated are made by the individual, rather than by the government, and so alternative study designs might be better suited to determining features that lead to vaccine uptake and support, such as standard cross-sectional surveys.58 Ethical issues regarding loss of liberty during an outbreak were not covered in our experiment, and should be explored in future studies, together with more contextual information on why policies were favoured or not.59

Reactive school closure during an influenza pandemic was often accompanied by other control measures such as intensive screening, border control measures and improved sanitation, which may confound the assessment of effects of school closure on influenza incidence. To differentiate the effects of school closure from other accompanied interventions and changed health-seeking behaviour, some studies have evaluated the effects of school closure on influenza transmission by focusing on school breaks rather than reactive school closures. As school calendars are usually set at the beginning of each school term, observed changes of influenza incidence before, during and after school breaks are believed to be less confounded than school closures aimed to control a pandemic.9
10 Significant associations between winter school breaks and temporary reductions of influenza-like illness (ILI) incidence have been found in Chile10 and Argentina,9 as children were less likely to be gathered during school breaks thus reducing the chance of influenza transmission. We hypothesised that the 4-week winter/7-week summer breaks in China might also be relevant to ILI incidence reductions among schoolchildren and adults.

The diagnostic laboratory plays a central role in identifying the etiological agent causing an outbreak and provides timely, accurate information required to guide control measures. This is exemplified by the epidemic of Nipah virus in Malaysia in 1998/1999, which took more than six months to effectively control as a consequence of the misdiagnosis of the etiologic agent and the resulting implementation of incorrect control measures.15,16 However, there are occasions when control measures must be based on the epidemiological features of the outbreak and pattern of disease transmission, as not all pathogens are easily identifiable in the early stage of the outbreak (Figure 1). Establishing laboratory and epidemiological capacity at the country and regional levels, therefore, is critical to minimize the impact of future emerging infectious disease epidemics. Developing such public health capacity requires commitment on the part of all countries in the region. However, to develop and establish such an effective national public health capacity, especially the laboratory component to support infectious disease surveillance, outbreak investigation and early response, a good understanding of the concepts of emerging infectious diseases and an integrated country and regional public health laboratory system in accordance with the nature and type of emerging pathogens, especially novel ones, are highly recommended.",45.931925691025356,18.650547654330644

Gostin et al. [9] argued that it becomes essential to develop a set of legal and ethical recommendations, especially when scientific evidence is not enough and public health action is urgently required as in the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). During the MERS outbreak in Korea, difficult choices between public health needs and the protection of individual rights, which include privacy, liberty, and freedom of movement, had to be made. Gostin et al. [9] proposed four ethical values: the precautionary principle, the least restrictive option, fairness, and transparency in decision making. It is unclear that these values were fully considered in the public health actions that were taken during the MERS outbreak in Korea. The Korean government strictly restricted the movement of 16 752 individuals who satisfied the operational definition of “close contacts with a MERS patient” within designated hospitals or their homes for the maximum incubation period regardless of whether they displayed MERS symptoms [1]. According to the WHO, there is no evidence that MERS can be transmitted before symptom development or in early symptomatic stages. Therefore the WHO does not recommend quarantine nor isolation of asymptomatic contacts during this period [10]. The urgent social demand for controlling the MERS outbreak overwhelmed the issue of legitimacy of the public health interventions taken by the government. Economic issues have also been raised regarding this restriction of movement. In this situation, the people who undertake the costs incurred by movement restriction are not the same people who benefit. In principle, if those who benefited were to compensate those who were made worse off, the outcome could have been considered an improvement (known as a “Kaldor–Hicks improvement”) [11]. For effective and fair implementation of public health measures against MERS or other transmissible infectious diseases that compromise individual rights, a reasonable compensation scheme for the victims, including for health care providers, should be designed to benefit those individuals and society overall.",40.56077749546816,16.786146170454792

School closures are some of the highest-profile social distancing measures employed to slow the spread of an infectious disease. Japan recently instituted a nationwide school closure, which drew a swift response from families scrambling to make alternative childcare arrangements. South Korea, Italy, and some US school districts have closed schools. School closures prevent contacts among children and reduce cases. But, there is a downside to closing schools, even if the only goal is saving lives during an epidemic. Closing schools can inadvertently cause child care shortages that strain the healthcare system. Lempel et al. estimated that the child care obligations associated with school closure could reduce key medical personnel by 6-19%. 1 Here, we use the recent years (2018-2020) of the US Current Population Survey to estimate the school closure induced child care obligations for the US healthcare labor force. Approximately 29% of US households with a healthcare worker have at least one school-aged child age 3-12, who requires child care. Child care obligations are especially high and relatively inflexible in households where a parent is a nurse or medical assistant. Understanding these tradeoffs are important in planning the public health response to COVID-19, because if the survival of infected patients is sufficiently sensitive to declines in the healthcare labor force, then school closures could increase deaths.",40.67348574502074,16.253037168741038

The price of this is to force companies and other institutions to stop operations, which is at huge cost. Another is social distancing, including closure of public places in the city, community containment, isolation of the infected, and quarantine of the suspected, which affects the operation of some urban institutions, and the cost is less than the traffic control.

Information on the epidemic was sent to WHO on 3 January, and the whole genome sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was shared with WHO on 10 January. Protocols for COVID-19 diagnosis and diagnosis and treatment were formulated. Mechanism of the State Council were established. President Xi Jinping personally directed and deployed the prevention and work control and requested that the prevention and control of the COVID-19 outbreak be the top priority of government at national levels. [7] Prevention and control measures have been implemented rapidly, from the early stages in Wuhan and other key areas of Hubei province to the current overall national epidemic. It has been undertaken in three main phases, with important events defining those phases. COVID-19 outbreak was included in the statutory report On January 29, all provinces across China had launched the highest level of response for major public health emergencies.",32.621486151619216,13.228422253868192

In fact, many prevention and control measures taken by China, especially Wuhan lock-down, nationwide traffic restrictions and Stay At Home Movement, go far beyond the requirements for responding to emergencies, setting new benchmarks for epidemic prevention in other countries.
