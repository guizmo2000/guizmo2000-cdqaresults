In Iran, the first cases of COVID-19 were officially announced between February 19 and 23, 2020 and it soon became clear that Iran is one of the countries that is worst-hit by COVID-19 outbreak (1, 2) . It is now evident that most cases of COVID-19 disease develop mild respiratory and constitutional symptoms (3), while some cases are asymptomatic (3, 4) . Involvement of other organs, including liver and kidneys has been reported in patients with COVID-19 (5). Many questions remain unanswered about associations and presentations of COVID-19. Shohada-e-Tajrish Hospital, a university hospital located in Tehran, Iran, was designated as one of the main centers providing diagnostic and healthcare services for patients suspected to be infected with the new virus. Here, we share our experience regarding computed tomography (CT) findings suggestive of COVID-19 disease among patients who underwent radiologic investigation due to traumatic injuries. Several trauma patients had findings on their chest and/or abdominal CT scans, which were suggestive or highly suggestive of COVID-19 (1). The findings were noted in the lung bases that were visible on an abdominal CT scan or on a clinically indicated spiral CT scan of the chest. The most frequent mechanisms of injury were fall and car accident. Conscious patients did not report dizziness or loss of consciousness before the trauma and most of them did not have any symptoms related to COVID-19 (e.g., fever, shortness of breath). To our knowledge, there is no study or report about the possible association between COVID-19 and trauma in the lit-erature. So, the mentioned observations could be just a coincidence, but this association could still be proposed as a research objective. The importance of this finding is that CT characteristics of COVID-19 could be seen in patients who were admitted to the hospitals not due to COVID-19 related symptoms, but because of chest and abdominal trauma. This issue should be considered by health care workers serving trauma patients and it should be kept in mind that during an outbreak of respiratory infections, in particular COVID-19 disease, every attempt should be made to protect the health and safety of the staff even when providing care for trauma patients.",56.31372489492188,25.283802784343877

In response, the National Health Commission of China [5] has established crisis psychological intervention teams across many Ivyspring International Publisher psychiatric hospitals in Hubei province and other parts of China [6] . This inevitably places increased pressure on the already inadequate mental health resources in China. For instance, the proportion of psychiatrists and doctors in psychiatric hospitals was 2.15 per 100,000 in 2016 [7] , which is considerably lower than that in most developed countries [8] . The mental health emergency response and deployment of expert teams from psychiatric hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak may further deplete mental health services across psychiatric hospitals. In China, the public psychiatric hospitals are either run by the Ministry of Health, or by the public security and civil affairs systems. Apart from regular psychiatric services, psychiatric hospitals in the public security and civil affairs systems provide services in the areas of forensic psychiatry, substance dependence and psychiatric rehabilitation. Compared to those run by the Ministry of Health, these hospitals are usually located in suburban areas with poorer protective equipment and training for infectious diseases, which is associated with higher risk of the COVID-19 transmission. Some measures should be adopted to resolve these challenges.

Although a 30-bed ward in an infectious disease hospital in Wuhan was established for psychiatric patients on 3 February 2020, the rapidly escalating number of cases has led to a severe shortage of hospital beds. As an alternative, isolation wards have been established in psychiatric hospitals for psychiatric patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19, but this option could increase the risk of hospital-acquired infection especially if there is inadequate capacity for infection control in these hospitals [1] . Another option is to establish specific quarantine facilities for clinically stable psychiatric patients with mild-moderate symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Gymnasiums, exhibition centers and sports centers have been converted into 'Fang Cang' (temporary quarantine hospital facilities) for infected patients with mild symptoms [14] (Figure 1 ). In conclusion, the COVID-19 outbreak has raised numerous challenges for psychiatric hospitals in China to safely manage patients' major psychiatric disorders in addition to preventing and treating COVID-19.

Furthermore, in the past decade, internship period in internal medicine has been reduced for medical students whose major is psychiatry in many medical schools in order to extend their training in mental health. All these factors could limit their clinical competence to control the potential transmission of COVID-19 in psychiatric hospitals. In addition, the lack of community-based mental health services has led to an over-reliance on psychiatric services provided by large psychiatric hospitals [10, 11] . For the vast majority of patients with serious mental illness, they can only access appropriate mental health care in hospital settings, which are mostly located in city areas. Therefore, they are more prone to exposure to infectious diseases such as the COVID-19, unless the psychiatric hospitals themselves implement stringent measures of infection control similar to general hospitals. Clearly, preventive measures such as the provision of adequate medical supplies and protective equipment, public education on the risks of COVID-19 for hospital staff and patients, and restricting family visits to hospitals, are essential to reduce the likelihood of disease transmission in major psychiatric hospitals. Moreover, all people including patients' families and health care workers need to be advised to wash hands regularly and maintain good personal hygiene. Measurement of body temperature should be performed at least once a day to closely monitor any suspected infectious symptoms. Activities involving group interaction in communal areas should be avoided.

Establishing a surveillance system for a new epidemic is believed to be a core intervention in controlling the disease (45). Surveillance system data provides reliable information for epidemiologists to identify weak chains of transmission and facilitates evidence-based decisions by policymakers both inside and outside the healthcare service. Moreover, updating and sharing interpretations of data with media, especially in earlier phase of an epidemic, will aid community engagement and participation in control activities and prevention of spreading rumors. Although, it may be too soon to compare the effectiveness of surveillance systems for COVID-19 epidemic in different countries, it seems that the Chinese surveillance system is highly effective as it ensures timely detection, recording, tracking, updating and sharing information on media for an outbreak with unknown origin and high burden of cases (4) . In a large number of countries, the initial focus of the surveillance system for CIVID-19 is examination of all suspected cases with symptoms of the disease (mostly fever) and all people with a travel history to China or visiting Chinese travelers or citizens it the previous two weeks. However, this type of screening program mainly relies on fever cases and those with direct flights from China, so it misses pre-symptomatic cases as well as infected travelers who are arriving from regions with high burden of disease via indirect flights, which could be a source of infection in COVID-19-free countries (46) . In a communicable disease outbreak, essential data are usually collected in parallel from different available information sources in the country including data of weekly outpatient visits to health care centers and hospital referrals with a chief complaint of fever, data of weekly inpatient fever cases and deaths with unknown origin (45). Furthermore, increase in the number of cases and deaths due to pneumonia may raise an alarm in COVID-19 free areas. A prerequisite for establishing a surveillance system is to provide basic laboratory facilities, particularly at ""point of care"" (10). This system should be constantly monitored and evaluated using sensitive indicators to ensure the quality of case detection, diagnosis and management. Detection of primary confirmed cases with poor prognosis in early phase of the epidemic without any link to confirmed cases from other regions emphasis on the insensitivity of a national and local surveillance systems and low performance of control activities against the disease in community level.

What are the hospital infection control issues associated with a SARS outbreak, and what are the most effective approaches to address these issues? What type State and local health departments continue to face unprecedented challenges in preparing for, recognizing, and responding to threats to the public's health. The attacks of 11 September 2001 and the ensuing anthrax mailings of 2001 highlighted the public health readiness and response hurdles posed by intentionally caused injury and illness. At the same time, recent natural disasters have highlighted the need for comparable public health readiness and response capabilities. Public health readiness and response activities can be conceptualized similarly for intentional attacks, natural disasters, and human-caused accidents. Consistent with this view, the federal government has adopted the all-hazards response model as its fundamental paradigm. Adoption of this paradigm provides powerful improvements in efficiency and efficacy, because it reduces the need to create a complex family of situation-specific preparedness and response activities. However, in practice, public health preparedness requires additional models and tools to provide a framework to better understand and prioritize emergency readiness and response needs, as well as to facilitate solutions; this is particularly true at the local health department level. Here, we propose to extend the use of the Haddon matrix-a conceptual model used for more than two decades in injury prevention and response strategies-for this purpose. of advance planning strategy could a local public health department use to identify the contributing factors to this public health emergency?

By contrast, calls for unity over invasions (e.g. [113] ) have so far largely failed to produce effective agencies. There is, for example, no equivalent to public health organizations such as US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Public Health Agency of Canada and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control that has prime responsibility for the detection and control of invasive species. This contrast is probably due to a number of reasons, including the local, regional or national (versus international) scope of many invasions, the often long time lag between biological invasions and detected impacts, and the generally slower nature of invasions, which together result in fractionated efforts that may be ineffective. Responsibilities for coordinating responses to EIDs of public health significance always lie with public health organizations, but responsibilities for responding to invasive species vary depending on the impact or location of the invasive species and may be organizations responsible for agriculture, fisheries, environment, natural resources, transport or local government entities [114] . 4) .

Prevalence of Underlying Diseases in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19: a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"In late 2019, a novel corona virus (first: 2019-nCov, then: SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases, which infected a lot of people in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei province of China (1) . SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread and led to an outbreak in China and then became a global health emergency. Although control measures and isolations have been applied for prevention, the infection has increased and caused a pandemic (2) . Although this virus belongs to a relatively well-known viral family, Coronaviridae, and is similar to viruses that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which had an outbreak in 2002, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which had an outbreak in 2012, in some characteristics, there are a lot of uncertainties and unknown specifications about this virus such as its origin and source of infection, its emergence, and its mechanism of action and transmission (3, 4) . Since the number of COVID-2019 cases is rising around the world and it has been associated with a large number of mortality and morbidity, it has led to a new global phobia called Coro phobia (5) . Based on recent reports, the novel Corona virus can be identified through various symptoms (Fever, Cough, Dyspnea, Myalgia, and Fatigue) (6) (7) (8) . Similar to other viral respiratory infections, SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 can be transmitted through the respiratory tract. It mainly causes respiratory tract infections and develops severe pneumonia in infected patients who may require intensive care. Severe disease may result in death due to progressive respiratory failure (9, 10) . Everyone is susceptible to this virus, but the elderly and those with underlying diseases are more at risk of adverse outcomes. Current knowledge has shown that death rate is high in people with chronic underly-ing diseases (11) . Therefore, special attention should be paid to the elderly and immunocompromised patients. Infections might progress rapidly in these groups and timely clinical decisions are needed (12) . Currently, information on the prevalence of predominant chronic diseases is rare. Moreover, knowing the underlying diseases in COVID-19 infected patients is important for healthcare workers. In the current study, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted on the prevalence of underlying diseases in confirmed hospitalized COVID-19 cases. and World Health Organization (WHO) portals as the national public health institute were evaluated. Due to the huge number of articles in Chinese language, the abstracts were evaluated in these studies.",38.17029779794137,16.241871454068146

CRS is characterized by elevated levels of IL-6, IFN-γ and other cytokines, provoking consequences and symptoms related to immune activation, ranging from fever, malaise and myalgias to severe organ toxicity, lung failure and death. In parallel, one of the most important mechanism underlying the deterioration of disease in COVID-19 is represented by the cytokine storm, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome or even multiple organ failure [16] . The cytometric analyses of COVID-19 patients showed reduced counts of peripheral CD4 and CD8 T cells, while their status was hyperactivated. In addition, an increased concentration of highly proinflammatory CCR6+ Th17 in CD4 T cells has been reported, and CD8 T cells were found to harbor high concentrations of cytotoxic granules, suggesting that overactivation of T cells tends to contribute to the severe immune injury of the disease [17] . Moreover, the pathological findings associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome in COVID-19 showed abundant interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate in the lungs, dominated by lymphocytes, once again implying that the immune hyperactivation mechanisms are at least partially accountable for COVID-19 severity [17] .

Despite the Chinese authorities have announced relevant policies and actuating principles in a strategic manner, the COVID-19 outbreak has posted an emerging serious challenge for the mental health services in China. There are some limitations that need to be addressed. First, several online mental health services have been constructed across different areas, however, unified national management and coordination policies are still inadequate, which could result in uneven distribution and wastage of medical resources, let alone evaluating the efficacy of these services. Second, online mental health services are the predominant assistance measure and therefore, some people (e.g., older adults) who may have limited access to smartphones and the broadband internet, may benefit less from the services [42] . Third, frontline health professionals may have limited time and energy to access to these services due to heavy workload. Fourth, based on experiences of SARS outbreak, some patients and health professionals would be traumatized by the COVID-2019 outbreak and still suffer from persistent psychiatric symptoms even after the outbreak [43] . Thus, the COVID-19 epidemic has become an extra socio-economic burden on existing mental health service provision in China.

Since the outbreak, several groups reported estimated R 0 of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and generated valuable prediction for the early phase of this outbreak. After implementation of strict prevention and control measures in China, new estimation is needed. An infectious disease dynamics SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Removed) model was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Wuhan, China under two assumptions of R t . In the first assumption, R t was assumed to maintain over 1. The estimated number of infections would continue to increase throughout February without any indication of dropping with R t = 1.9, 2.6, or 3.1. The number of infections would reach 11,044, 70,258, and 227,989, respectively, by 29 February 2020. In the second assumption, R t was assumed to gradually decrease at different phases from high level of transmission (R t = 3.1, 2.6, and 1.9) to below 1 (R t = 0.9 or 0.5) owing to increasingly implemented public health intervention. Several phases were divided by the dates when various levels of prevention and control measures were taken in effect in Wuhan. The estimated number of infections would reach the peak in late February, which is 58,077-84,520 or 55,869-81,393. Whether or not the peak of the number of infections would occur in February 2020 may be an important index for evaluating the sufficiency of the current measures taken in China. Regardless of the occurrence of the peak, the currently strict measures in Wuhan should be continuously implemented and necessary strict public health measures should be applied in other locations in China with high number of COVID-19 cases, in order to reduce R t to an ideal level and control the infection.",43.583453470241714,21.99735463343073

Epidemic information has been released in an open, transparent, responsible, and timely manner home and abroad. Cooperation has been established with other countries and international organizations. These measures have won full recognition of the international community, including WHO. Specifically in Wuhan, in the early phase from beginning of December 2019 to 23 January 2020, there was no limitation of population flow and gathering. When the human-to-human transmission was confirmed, an important decision was made to isolate Wuhan from other parts of the country. As a result, since 24 January 2020, all public transports from and to Wuhan, as well as public transports and people's gathering events within Wuhan, were stopped. Since 2 February 2020, strict public health measures were taken to prevent population flow among distinct communities, whereas since 9 February 2020, public health interventions including quarantine of each building in the urban area and each village in the rural area were implemented in order to block the transmission chain among the household. Therefore, strong efforts of authorities and people in Wuhan with the support of the central government and people from all over China, as well as the WHO and the international society, may have gradually braked COVID-19 outbreak. R t is therefore assumed to decrease gradually from 3.1 to 0.5 in Wuhan, China in the current study. The trend of the estimated cases is in accordance with the trend of currently confirmed cases. The relatively big difference in number may be due to the possible existence of a large number of mild and asymptomatic cases and the imperfection of current diagnostic measures. According to NHC, before 12 February 2020, the confirmed cases were diagnosed according to contact history, clinical manifestations, chest X-ray, or computer-assisted tomography (CT) and RT-PCR for COVID-19. Since 12 February 2020, the diagnosis has been mainly based on contact history, clinical manifestation, and imaging evidence of pulmonary lesion suggestive of pneumonia, while viral detection with RT-PCR is still being performed in a part of patients 23 . After the diagnosis method was changed, a large number of cases that were previously missed and piled up for testing were reported in Wuhan, which greatly increased the number of existing cases and made it approaching our estimated number. A peak of the estimated number of infections would occur in late February under this assumption. If the peak does occur in February, the very strong measures China has taken may have already received success in controlling the COVID-19 infection in Wuhan.",46.678690179036906,19.375050980196793

Under even a cursory examination, it is clear that the boundaries between the public health, clinical and scientific response are blurred, with the necessary evidence overlapping and being collected from the same patient. What distinguishes research from clinical or public health practice is often difficult to define, and rather than trying to draw arbitrary boundaries, we should aim to integrate the data needs of all disciplines. The quality of evidence could then be improved by designing unified data and sample collection protocols that are driven by an explicit link to the public health and clinical decisions that need to be taken. Rather than using inferential techniques such as mathematical modelling to compensate for suboptimal data, analysis-ready datasets that provide meaningful information to support individual and population-based practices could be generated by working forwards from a suite of public health and clinical decisions, to evidence needs, and finally to data needs (Fig. 2) .

The COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection represents a spectrum of clinical severity [3] [4] [5] . Some patients are asymptomatic or have merely mild upper respiratory tract symptoms. However, SARS-CoV-2 causes pneumonia that can be severe and characterized by fever, cough, dyspnea, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and acute respiratory injury. It is estimated that approximately 20% of patients are developing severe respiratory illness, with the overall mortality around 2.3% [2] . Thereby, it is critical to identify individuals who confer intrinsic susceptibility to become severe or even critically ill upon infection, for the purposes of prevention and treatment, especially when there is no drug directly targeting at SARS-CoV-2 that has been proven to be clinically effective.

Indeed, the asymptomatic proportion is a useful quantity to gauge the true burden of the disease and better interpret estimates of the transmission potential. This proportion varies widely across infectious diseases, ranging from 8% for measles and 32% for norovirus infections up to 90-95% for polio [5] [6] [7] . Most importantly, for measles and norovirus infections, it is well established that asymptomatic individuals are frequently able to transmit the virus to others [8, 9] .",40.75108775607876,19.29070596286899

Research data are needed to develop evidence-driven strategies to reduce adverse psychological impacts and psychiatric symptoms during the epidemic. Results: This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China. In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels. Most respondents spent 20-24 h per day at home (84.7%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1%). Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.g., myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p < 0.05). Specific up-to-date and accurate health information (e.g., treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular precautionary measures (e.g., hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with a lower psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p < 0.05). Conclusions: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety.

Given the limited resources available and time-sensitivity of the COVID-19 outbreak, we adopted the snowball sampling strategy. The snowballing sampling strategy was not based on a random selection of the sample, and the study population did not reflect the actual pattern of the general population. Furthermore, it would be ideal to conduct a prospective study on the same group of participants after a period. Due to ethical requirements on anonymity and confidentiality, we were not allowed to collect contact details and personal information from the respondents. As a result, we could not conduct a prospective study that would provide a concrete finding to support the need for a focused public health initiative. There was an oversampling of a particular network of peers (e.g., students), leading to selection bias. As a result, the conclusion was less generalizable to the entire population, particularly less educated people. Another limitation is that self-reported levels of psychological impact, anxiety, depression and stress may not always be aligned with assessment by mental health professionals. Similarly, respondents might have provided socially desirable responses in terms of the satisfaction with the health information received and precautionary measures. Lastly, the number of respondents with contact history and who had sought medical consultations was very small. Our findings could not be generalized to confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19. Notwithstanding the above limitations, this study provides invaluable information on the initial psychological responses 2 weeks after the outbreak of COVID-19 from respondents across 194 cities in China.

Based on our findings, cognitive therapy can provide information or evidence to enhance confidence in the doctor's ability to diagnose COVID-19. Cognitive therapy can challenge cognitive bias when recipients overestimate the risk of contracting and dying from COVID-19.

As the epidemic is ongoing, it is important to prepare health care systems and the general public to be medically and psychologically ready if widespread transmission occurs outside China [32] . Our findings have clinical and policy implications. First, health authorities need to identify high-risk groups based on sociodemographic information for early psychological interventions. Our sociodemographic data suggest that females suffered a greater psychological impact of the outbreak as well as higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. This finding corresponds to previously extensive epidemiological studies which found that women were at higher risk of depression [33] . Students were also found to experience a psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. As the total number of people infected by COVID-19 currently surpasses those stricken by the 2003 SARS-CoV epidemic, major cities in China have shut down schools at all levels indefinitely. The uncertainty and potential negative impact on academic progression could have an adverse effect on the mental health of students. During the epidemic, education authorities need to develop online portals and web-based applications to deliver lectures or other teaching activities [34] . As young people are more receptive towards smartphone applications [35] , health authorities could consider providing online or smartphone-based psychoeducation and psychological interventions (e.g., cognitive behavior therapy, CBT) to reduce risk of virus transmission by face-to-face therapy. Online platforms could also provide a support network for those people spending most of their time at home during the epidemic. We found that the general public with no formal education had a greater likelihood of depression during the epidemic.

During the 2003 SARS-CoV epidemic, researchers found that moderate levels of anxiety were associated with higher uptake of preventive measures by respondents [21] . Our findings showed the opposite trend. Specific precautionary measures including avoidance of sharing utensils (e.g., chopsticks), hand hygiene, and wearing masks regardless of the presence or absence of symptoms were associated with lower levels of psychological impact, depression, anxiety, and stress. The experiences of the 2003 SARS-CoV epidemic could have changed the perception of the general public towards precautionary measures and have led to a positive effect on the initial psychological responses to the COVID-19 epidemic by giving respondents confidence and sense of control in prevention. As the Chinese prefer to use chopsticks to pick up food commonly shared on a plate during mealtime as part of their culture, it is not unexpected that avoidance of sharing utensils (e.g., chopsticks) during meals is significantly associated with less psychological impact and lower levels of anxiety, depression, and stress. During the initial stage of the COVID-19 epidemic, health authorities outside China had different recommendations for mask usage due to a global shortage of masks. While some health authorities urged citizens not to wear masks if they were well (e.g., Singapore), other health authorities urged their citizens to always have masks and hand sanitizers ready (e.g., Malaysia, Vietnam) [36] . The official guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO) advises that healthy people should only wear masks if they are taking care of a person with suspected COVID-19 infection or if people are coughing and sneezing [37] . Our study found that wearing masks, regardless of the presence or absence of symptoms, was associated with lower levels of anxiety and depression. Although the WHO emphasizes that masks are effective only when used in combination with frequent hand-cleaning with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water, wearing a mask regardless of the presence or absence of symptoms could offer potential psychological benefits by offering a sense of security. This finding was anticipated because wearing face masks is a common practice when people are sick or to counter urban pollution or haze in parts of Asia, including China [38] . Governments and health authorities should ensure there are infrastructures to produce and provide an adequate supply of masks, soaps, alcohol-based hand rubs, and other personal hygiene products during the COVID-19 epidemic.",48.50185243541215,21.74689609695449

This may be a good clue for early diagnosis in the future. Case 2 developed a fever a few days after the CT findings, suggesting a delay in symptom development in these patients. During the earlier days of the outbreak, there had been limitations in both capacity and turnaround time for the nucleic acid test, which had further caused delay in confirming the diagnosis of COVID-19 7 in many patients. It seems that the time for the early lung lesions or COVID-19 to become severe enough to cause clinical symptoms is rather long. Even among patients with fever, the typically used pharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction test may be negative, owing to the absence of viruses in the upper respiratory tract despite the presence of pneumonia. However, radiographic changes can occur early (chest CT scan is mostly employed in the People's Republic of China during the current outbreak). Therefore, during an epidemic season, it is prudent to carefully evaluate any lung infiltration for GGO, and an appropriate serology test must be performed to rule out potential infection. 7 These two incidents also typify a common scenario during the earlier phase of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, during which a significant number of health care providers became infected in hospitals in Wuhan, and patients in a same room were cross-infected, as they were exposed to unknown transmission sources. Because of this, it is important to practice ""universal precaution"" in surgical pathology laboratories and regard all fresh specimens as potentially infectious. In the People's Republic of China, most surgical specimens are received already fixed in formalin. However, for larger specimens, the center of a specimen may not be sufficiently fixed and still pose potential risk for infection.

While COVID-19 transmits as a droplet pathogen and is placed in Category B of infectious agents (highly pathogenic H5N1 and SARS), by the China National Health Commission, infection control measures recommended are those for category A agents (cholera, plague). Patients should be placed in separate rooms or cohorted together. Negative pressure rooms are not generally needed. The rooms and surfaces and equipment should undergo regular decontamination preferably with sodium hypochlorite. Healthcare workers should be provided with fit tested N95 respirators and protective suits and goggles. Airborne transmission precautions should be taken during aerosol generating procedures such as intubation, suction and tracheostomies. All contacts including healthcare workers should be monitored for development of symptoms of COVID-19. Patients can be discharged from isolation once they are afebrile for atleast 3 d and have two consecutive negative molecular tests at 1 d sampling interval.

The UNDRR asked national disaster management agencies to continue with the development of their preparedness and response capacities to include health emergencies as a top priority, alongside earthquakes, floods, storms and other natural hazards (UNDRR, 2020). It also highlighted the importance of silo-breaking in disaster prevention and management, notably the silos between disaster management and health workers. The UNDRR reiterates that the Sendai Framework emphasizes the need for resilient health systems and the integration of disaster risk management into health care provision at all levels. After all, Sendai turns the focus from disaster response and management to preparedness, surveillance and disaster risk management in the health context (UNDRR, 2020). Yet it is not clear whether COVID-19 is leading to collaboration between the WHO and the UNDRR. We appraise the speed and scale by which COVID-19 response funds are made available.

Viral RNA has not been identified in the tear film of COVID-19 patients without conjunctivitis to-date, but data representing sampling performed early in disease when viral load is highest are lacking. 11, 12, 13 The World Health Organization (WHO) and United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have recommended the use of full PPE for the examination of PUIs and COVID-19 patients. The face masks can be divided into N95 respirators and surgical masks, and both have different uses. The N95 respirator is designed with filtration requirements to prevent inhalation of small airborne particles and minimize leakage from the facial seal. 14 As such, it protects the wearer from the inhalation of viral particles. Surgical masks are often fitted loosely but can prevent respiratory droplet transmission and prevent hand-to-face contact. They are considered to be more effective in preventing spread from an infected person wearing the mask to another than in protecting the wearer from infection. In a randomized clinical trial, the use of N95 respirators and surgical masks were found to have comparable outcomes in protection from influenza virus in outpatient settings 14 ; however, N95 respirators are the preferred option when dealing with PUIs or COVID-19 patients.",41.5410006437407,16.71028647599589

The actions included wearing face masks in public by everyone, washing hands regularly (especially before touching mouth and eyes and having food). Official actions included cleaning surfaces in public areas such as handles and buttons with disinfectants regularly, and temperature checks at airports and other immigration ports.

Besides, hygiene related factors such as the public health measures by the government and possible personal awareness in the community can also affect the spread of infectious respiratory diseases. However, there is no quantitative support for this conclusion, because of lack of quality data. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (or SARS) outbreak in 2003 triggered strict public health measures and personal awareness in the prevention of infectious respiratory diseases, providing us an opportunity to quantify the impact of hygiene related factors in the spread of the disease. In this paper, we model the number of the respiratory illnesses by a semiparametric model which models the environmental and weather impacts using a multiple index model and the impact of other public health measures and possible personal awareness using a growth curve with jump. Using data from Hong Kong, we found that public health measures contributed to about 39% of reduction in the number of respiratory illnesses during the SARS period. However, the impact of hygienically related factors eventually fades as time passes. The results provide indirect quantitative support to the usefulness of governmental campaigns to arouse the awareness of the public in staying away from transmission of respiratory diseases during the full outbreak of the disease.

That is, the effect of public health measures as measured by the shift in the total number of illnesses. By noting the magnitude of impact decreases eventually over time due to many factors including behavioral and memory dynamics, the growth curves are widely used in psychological research to model the changes over time (Mcardle and Nesselroade, 2002) . The logistic growth curve is a special case of the generalized Richard growth curve (Richard, 1959) . A negative value of ξ 1 indicates a reduction of the number of illnesses, meaning an effective impact of public health measures. A positive value of ξ 3 means that the impact of public health measures will fade and vanish over time. We do not use the full Richard curve because it involves complicated computing due to a limit or embedded cases (Shao, 2002) and the special case here is good enough to fit the data. Bear in mind that we do not use the data during the SARS epidemic as it is highly unstable.

These closures prevent contact among children and reduce cases. However, closing schools has down sides, even if the only goal of the measure is to save lives during an epidemic. Closing schools can inadvertently cause childcare shortages that strain the health-care system. A study by Lempel and colleagues 1 estimated that child-care obligations associated with school closures could reduce key medical personnel by 6-19% . Under standing these trade-offs is important for planning the public health response to COVID-19, because if the survival of patients who are infected is sufficiently sensitive to declines in the health-care labour force, then school closures might increase deaths. Indeed, the entire idea of flattening the curve is to protect health-care capacity to reduce mortality, which might not be proportional to cases. How the curve is flattened also influences health-care capacity.",52.51944092725351,20.81994637385132

Respiratory droplets and contact are the main routes of transmission of COVID-19 [2] . However, the fetal-oral routes may also be a potential human-to-human transmission [3, 4] . Admittedly, recent studies have reported the detection of the virus (SARS-COV-2) in feces [4] [5] [6] . SARS-COV-2 infects human cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [7] , and the expression of ACE2 in the small intestine is significantly higher than that in the lung [8] . In theory, the intestine is the target organ for SARS-COV-2 infection. In fact, diarrhea as a bowel symptom is not rare in COVID-19 patients. Although the occurrence of diarrhea is not as high as that of fever and cough, it may be the first symptom of COVID-19. Here, we summarized the occurrence of diarrhea that are currently publicly available (Table 1) . A total of 2506 COVID-19 patients were included, of which 145 had diarrhea before admission and the overall occurrence of diarrhea was 5.8% (145/2506). In our own data, the occurrence of diarrhea is 6.3% (4/64) (not yet published). Differential occurrence of diarrhea across studies may be due to different criteria for determining diarrhea. Another possible reason is that the patient's bowel movements were not listed as the focus of observation. In general, diarrhea is not a common symptom in patients with COVID-19. More attention is needed because diarrhea is a reminder that SARS-COV-2 invades the intestine. In autopsy reports of patients with COVID-19, staged narrowing and expansion of the small intestine may be a more intuitive warning [9] . Future research should focus on how long SARS-COV-2 persists in the feces of COVID-19 patients with diarrhea. This helps to better manage discharged patients and to properly dispose of the patients' feces, thereby avoiding potential sources of SARS-COV-2. Clinicians, especially digestive physicians, should pay close attention to the atypical symptoms of COVID-19 and take personal protection against the feces of patients. When discharged from home, patients with COVID-19 should pay special attention to hand hygiene and avoid sharing toilets with family members. In addition, we remind the public not to panic, but to prevent it scientifically.",47.384221717930664,20.581791231856634

We accounted for the occupation within the health-care sector, state, and household structure to identify the segments of the health-care workforce that are most exposed to child-care obligations from school closures. We used these estimates to identify the critical level at which the importance of health-care labour supply in increasing the survival probability of a patient with COVID-19 would undo the benefits of school closures and ultimately increase cumulative mortality. , the US Current Population Survey included information on more than 3·1 million individuals across 1·3 million households. We found that the US health-care sector has some of the highest child-care obligations in the USA, with 28·8% (95% CI 28·5-29·1) of the health-care workforce needing to provide care for children aged 3-12 years. Assuming non-working adults or a sibling aged 13 years or older can provide child care, 15·0% (14·8-15·2) of the health-care workforce would still be in need of child care during a school closure. We observed substantial variation within the health-care system. We estimated that, combined with reasonable parameters for COVID-19 such as a 15·0% case reduction from school closings and 2·0% baseline mortality rate, a 15·0% decrease in the health-care labour force would need to decrease the survival probability per percent health-care worker lost by 17·6% for a school closure to increase cumulative mortality.

Although some health-care occupations might be able to work remotely temporarily, the life-saving treatments that we focused on in this analysis generally require inperson care. We do not know how much a reduction in the health-care labour force, and in what occupations within that labour force, decreases the probability of survival for patients with COVID-19. However, we estimated that the segment of the health-care workforce most responsible for infection control in nursing homes is likely to be among the most highly affected by childcare obligations induced by school closures. Given our reasonable estimates of case reductions from school closures, a measure of the increased mortality risk of patients with COVID-19 from health-care absenteeism to care for children is a crucial, and to date, unknown parameter. This analysis did not include non-COVID-19 mortality that could occur from other conditions if the US health-care work force is reduced, but the risk to these patients should also be considered when deciding about school closure.

A guideline was published for the medical staff, healthcare providers, and, public health individuals and researchers who are interested in the 2019-nCoV [29] . The early death cases of COVID-19 outbreak occurred primarily in elderly people, possibly due to a weak immune system that permits faster progression of viral infection [8, 12] . The public services and facilities should provide decontaminating reagents for cleaning hands on a routine basis. Physical contact with wet and contaminated objects should be considered in dealing with the virus, especially agents such as faecal and urine samples that can potentially serve as an alternative route of transmission [15, 16] . China and other countries including the US have implemented major prevention and control measures including travel screenings to control further spread of the virus [13] .

Thus the terms used for the different situations could be restricted according to the control measures that are necessary. Perhaps unique to pandemics, these include considerable international coordination and collaboration in providing aid to affected countries, recruiting the necessary resources for promoting research on medications and vaccines, and developing complex risk communication. In particular, travel restrictions become a major issue and, although these are guided by the International Health Regulations, countries have the option to adopt unilaterally their own barriers to international travel.

The language of human rights is increasingly part of the landscape for health law in Australia and a See, for example, Public Health Act 1991 (NSW) s 23. internationally. [43] [44] [45] Given the potential for public health laws to impact upon the freedom of individuals, and the need for public health laws to balance the interests of individuals and society, public health laws will ideally have a transparent ethical framework, articulating the principles upon which state intervention will be premised. 46 The World Health Organization has acknowledged the importance of legal and ethical considerations to pandemic preparedness, noting that public health measures such as quarantine, compulsory vaccination and off-licence use of medicines 'need a legal framework to ensure transparent assessment and justification of the measures that are being considered, and to ensure coherence with international legislation (International Health Regulations)'. 47 Consideration of ethical issues is also essential for, as the World Health Organization has noted, ethical issues 'are part of the normative framework that is needed to assess the cultural acceptability of measures such as quarantine or selective vaccination of predefined risk groups'. 48 The exercise of state powers in terms of quarantine, isolation and detention during a public health emergency is likely to be particularly controversial in Western liberal democracies such as Australia. The extent to which the state can and should exercise its powers in this area has become increasingly relevant in public health, as is clear from debates over detention of tuberculosis patients, 49, 50 and from the use of quarantine during the SARS crisis. 51 Although comparable countries to Australia in Europe, the USA and Canada all have human rights charters or equivalents, which could provide procedural protections and safeguards for citizens in relation to quarantine and detention, Australia has yet to develop a Bill of Rights at the federal level. While Australian state and territory governments have begun enacting human rights legislation, 52 there is no comprehensive inclusion of human rights safeguards in the federal Quarantine Act, which raises issues about the mechanisms for ensuring procedural safeguards in the event of a pandemic. 53 Public health measures directed at implementing social distancing, quarantine or travel restrictions will not only infringe on individual liberties that are often taken for granted in Western societies, but are also likely to have a profound economic impact. As outlined above, estimates indicate that pandemic influenza will have a significant impact on the global economy. At local level, businesses may be closed or experience a reduction in their cash flow as public health measures are introduced or people stay home voluntarily. In such an environment, the economic cost to individuals and businesses may be significant, which in turn demands consideration of development of support systems and compensation systems for those affected. 54 In the USA, a great deal of work has been done on strengthening the public health laws, both generally and specifically for public health emergencies. The Turning Point Public Health Statute Modernization National Collaborative developed the Turning Point Model State Public Health Act. 55 In 2001, the Centre for Law and the Public's Health at Georgetown and Johns Hopkins Universities prepared a Model State Emergency Health Powers Act, setting out the powers for a state of public health emergency. The provisions of the earlier Model State Emergency Health Powers Act were adapted and included in the Turning Point Model Act. 56 Article V of the Turning Point Model Act deals with the powers of public health authorities, including the powers of quarantine and isolation. The Model Act provides that the principles to be applied in relation to quarantine and isolation include that they should be by the least restrictive means necessary to prevent the spread of disease (s 5-108[b](1)).

In addition, the pervasive discourse of 'security' is discussed in relation to current public health practices. These characteristics of public health are examined with consideration of their potential for propagating social exclusion and stigmatization of individuals and communities. The specific case of SARS in Toronto is used to examine the implications of public health as a mechanism for social control and reproduction rather than the promotion of equality in health throughout the population.",47.3547342592222,20.719589522561417

Homeless populations might be more transient and geographically mobile than individuals in the general population, 8 making it difficult to track and prevent transmission and to treat those who need care. COVID-19 was recently found to be transmittable via the oral-faecal route. 9 Some major US cities with large homeless populations, like San Francisco, have experienced issues with public defecation, which might pose an additional transmission risk for people experiencing homelessness and other individuals. Together, the multitude of potential vulnerabilities and risks for people experiencing homelessness in becoming infected, needing care, and transmitting COVID-19 cannot be ignored and must be planned for. Some lessons can be learned from the response to severe acute respiratory syndrome among homeless service providers nearly two decades ago. 10 Testing kits and training on how to recognise COVID-19 should be widely disseminated to homeless service providers and deployed in shelters, encampments, and street outreach.

It is unclear how and where unsheltered people experiencing homelessness will be moved to if quarantines and lockdowns are implemented. In such a scenario, closures of shelters and other high-density communal settings (eg, drop-in centres and soup kitchens) are possible, which could increase the number of unsheltered people experiencing homelessness and reduce their access to needed services. Lockdowns and disease containment procedures might also be deleterious to the mental health of people experiencing homelessness, many of whom have fears around involuntary hospitalisation and incarceration. 11 In response to COVID-19, the State of Washington has declared a state of emergency, allowing cities to take extraordinary measures, which has included King County moving people infected with COVID-19 to housing units that were originally intended to provide housing for people experiencing homelessness. 12 As other cities follow suit, these actions might further displace people experiencing homelessness and put them at greater risk of COVID-19. Another complicating matter is that in December, 2019, the US Supreme Court declined to review the case of Martin v City of Boise, upholding a ruling that cities cannot arrest or punish people for sleeping on public property unless cities have provided adequate and accessible indoor accommodations.

It is important to mention here that although the cerebral damage may complicate a COVID-19 infection, it appears that it is the widespread dysregulation of homeostasis caused by pulmonary, renal, cardiac, and circulatory damage that proves fatal in COIVD-19 patients. With that being said, a dominant cerebral involvement alone with the potential of causing cerebral edema in COVID-19 can take a lead in causing death long before systemic homeostatic dysregulation sets in. Access of the COVID-19 virus to the brain via the transcribrial route, as described previously for other CNS targeting pathogens, 7 could have been the case in a recently reported patient with hyposmia and the cases of acute respiratory failure in COVID-19, 5 which needs to be further elucidated by isolating the SARS-CoV-2 virus from the zones that are in proximity to the olfactory bulb. It is expected that the differences in the sequence of spike proteins between COVID-19 virus and SARS-CoV ( Figure 2A ) will enable scientists to identify epitopes in COVID-19 virus for the development of monoclonal antibodies against this virus. With the recent COVID-19 outbreak, there is an urgent need to understand the neurotropic potential of the COVID-19 virus in order to prioritize and individualize the treatment protocols based on the severity of the disease and predominant organ involvement.

During this period of COVID-19 proliferation, the majority of the general public is staying at home for isolation. Thus, they gained more time to gather knowledge about the epidemic and the lives of other people, especially those of patients with COVID-19, through the internet and media (Hu et al., 2015) .

This group is mainly composed of middle-level backbone members, where most of them are single children and have not given birth. Close contact with patients with COVID-19 and direct exposure to the patients' physical and psychological sufferings have been well recognized to render front-line nurses prone to suffer from vicarious traumatization; therefore, the society and psychotherapists should actively pay more attention to the psychological problems of front-line nurses (Borenstein, 2018; Taylor et al., 2016) . However, the results of the study imply that the vicarious traumatization severity of non-front-line nurses, regardless of physical or psychological responses, is more serious than that of front-line nurses. This finding suggests that non-frontline nurses are more likely to suffer from psychological problems, whereas the psychological endurance of front-line nurses is stronger. This notion may be due to the fact that front-line nurses are voluntarily selected and provided with sufficient psychological preparation. Second, the selected front-line nurses are mainly middle-level backbone staff with working experience and psychological capacity. In addition, the vicarious traumatization of front-line nurses is typically derived from sympathy for patients with COVID-19, whereas non-front-line nurses not only feel sympathy for patients with COVID-19, but also bear the worry and sympathy for front-line colleagues. Finally, the front-line nurses are more knowledgeable about the epidemic than the general public and non-front-line nurses. Therefore, a transparent announcement of epidemic information is very beneficial to social and psychological constructs and psychological intervention at a later time (Wang et al., 2006) .

Evidence of the Distribution of ACE2 in the Human Brain. The brain has been reported to express ACE2 receptors ( Figure 1A , C) that have been detected over glial cells and neurons, which makes them a potential target of COVID-19.

In the SARS-CoV infections that were reported in the past, autopsy findings of the patients have shown strong evidence of the presence of SARS-CoV by electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and real-time reverse transcription-PCR 3 . Patients with acute SARS-CoV illness have also demonstrated the presence of the virus in cerebrospinal fluid. The role of the blood-brain barrier in containing the virus and preventing it from gaining access to the neural tissues needs to be further explored in patients diagnosed with COVID-19.

Thus, the unique geospatial characteristics of specific originating locations and regions need to be identified to accurately assess risk and develop effective response plans for point of entry interventions. For example, if a rapidly unfolding outbreak were taking place in Central America, it would make sense to anticipate higher need for public health resources focused on direct flights coming to the U.S. from high-volume contributors such as Managua and Guatemala City. Although other passengers from Central America may come to the U.S. via connecting flights, these travelers would be so low in number as to present minimal risk, and to expend resources to address them initially may divert from more effective efforts with the bulk of travelers arriving on direct flights at a few U.S. locations. Our analysis of 2009 flight data revealed that, by volume, the airports most affected by flights from Central This approach seems intuitive, but others have observed that this risk-based, targeted approach to bolstering surveillance and response capacities at key airports has been the exception rather than the norm, and that careful planning for public health response at key points of entry can be more effective than the usual first response of implementing travel restrictions. 13, 41, 47 In light of current global economic uncertainties and the overall decline of resources for public health in the U.S. and other countries, current planning and future point of entry interventions for global disease outbreaks must optimize the resources that are available, quickly and accurately assess risks and prioritize efforts to maximize impact of intervention efforts. 48 The ""node-to-node"" approach embodied in our model will allow public health officials to preserve resources for longer-term, community-based mitigation and prevention activities by targeting response to those points of entry likely to be affected earliest.",34.14385294785001,16.021906804586095

Given the rapidity with which the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is spreading, we can expect an increased burden of cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at oncology treatment clinics and a need to address this diagnosis. As of the date of this writing, the U.S. has witnessed an increase in confirmed cases, not far behind the large outbreaks of European countries. 2, 3 Since the outbreak in Wuhan, Chinese researchers have published on their experience with COVID- 19 and have highlighted high-risk groups, including, the elderly and patients with comorbidities, including cancer. In one of the largest series reported from Wuhan, elderly patients were at a higher risk for disease severity with an 8.0% case fatality rate in those aged 70 to 79 years, and 14.8% in those aged 80 years and older. 4 The case fatality rate for cancer patients in that cohort was notably higher than noncancer patients at 5.6% versus 2.1% in the whole sample; it must be noted that this series is very small. How these numbers will evolve in the U.S. population remains to be determined. Based on available data, the impact of patients both at risk for and suffering from COVID-19 will be felt throughout oncology clinics.

Patients who test positive for the novel coronavirus will, at a minimum, require a 14-day quarantine per CDC recommendations. 15 At the other end of the spectrum, cancer patients with immunosuppression may require hospitalization and isolation precautions, thereby preventing the continuation of radiation treatments. Data from a report of the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 showed that 6.1% of patients required intensive care, mechanical ventilation or died. 16 Although it is yet unclear how the virus will behave in the US, the situations in China and Italy suggest the burden on hospitals and intensive care units will be significant. Additionally, this study demonstrated that pneumonia and lymphocytopenia were prominent at 91.1% and 83.2%, respectively, which would impact decisions to hold off on treatments pending improvements in the patient's clinical status and immune recovery. 16 These treatment interruptions would be of utmost concern in tumors for which treatment package time significantly impacts outcomes such as head and neck and cervical tumors. 17, 18 However, this is also of concern in lung tumors and other thoracic tumors, for both tumor control and the lungs potentially lying in the path of treatment beams. Treatments would likely need to be paused while monitoring the course of COVID-19 in this setting. Treatment delays may also be due strains on the healthcare system in the setting of a pandemic due to travel restrictions, availability of workforce, and/or lack of access to hospital care. 19 If possible, travel restrictions for the general public should be tailored for patients with cancer, such as being done currently in Italy. 20 Little data exists currently to guide radiation treatment decisions in the setting of a pandemic. However, we may borrow insight from the response of Radiation Oncology clinics during Hurricane Maria. As per Gay et al, mitigating the impact of a natural disaster on cancer patients requires 4 components or ""PCOC"": prepare, communicate, operate, compensate. 21 In preparing, consideration should be made for scenarios which may require delayed treatment starts, or shorter fractionation regimens (i.e. hypofractionation), given that COVID-19 poses a substantial immediate risk for elderly patients. Again, there is a paucity of data to guide these decisions and priority should be given to higher risk tumors (H&N, Cervix, Lung, etc.), which are nicely referenced in the Hurricane Maria review.

In Colombia, despite the implementation of the rules established by the national government, exists an elevate concern both for mortality and for the limited capacity of the health system to respond effectively to the needs of patients infected and requiring intensive care by the respiratory complications associated with this infection. 1 The data collected so far on the number of infected people and the evolution of the epidemic are imprecise. Even though to date in Colombia (March 19, 2020) there are no deaths yet, nor patients in intensive care by COVID-19, the diagnoses of infection by SARS-CoV-2 have increased (Fig. 1) . In this country, since the first case was reported (March 6, 2020), the number of infected patients follows an exponential trend, like other countries in the region, except Ecuador, with a lower incidence. If this trend continues, in a week (until March 26, 2020) or two (April 2, 2020), there will be 2581 and 40,535 infected patients, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2 . 1, 2 According with the Knowledge of this infection so far, the high-risk age groups are among the people over 60 years of age, primarily due to the burden of disease and the complications that this infection generates in them. Regarding to the current COVID-19 data available from Colombia, the proportion of patients in that age group is 15%, and of them, 4.7% needing hospitalizing, proportion which is lower than in other age groups. Additionally, as of March 19, most cases are imported (64%). 3 On the other hand, according to the official reports of the World Health Organization (updated to March 19, 2020), in Latin American countries the first cases of mortality by COVID-19 occurred in Argentina after the 12th day of the first case was diagnosed, and in Panama was the first death was reported after the sixth day. This situation differs from European countries, where COVID-19 associated deaths started until after the 23rd of the first diagnosis (France). Additionally, the reports curve of some European countries has a slower start compared to Latin American countries. This situation may be due to a higher degree of alertness in this region, motivated by the experiences of European and Asian countries, leading to earlier diagnostic tests (early detection). Additionally, in Europe, at the beginning of the infection, the diagnoses were oriented to people with symptoms.",45.28450852662624,18.29787647734687

Patient-centered care typically includes collaboration with informed patients to craft care plans that reflect their personal goals. Patient-centered care has been increasingly embraced across multiple specialties with multimodal interdisciplinary care. The COVID-19 pandemic has upended patientcentered care in inpatient units and residential facilities practically overnight due to patient isolation, staffing limitations, and growing concerns over limited resources like ventilators and hospital beds. Moreover, for patients who are on a ventilator or otherwise limited in expressing themselves, family members often serve as surrogate decision-makers to communicate patient preferences. Now, visitation policies have been practically eliminated, further hindering communication and patient-centered care. As the health care system experiences increasing strain, decisions about patient care may be based on resource allocation and protection of others, shifting the focus of care from patient-centeredness to societal good. Under these circumstances, clinicians are especially challenged in making efforts to respect patient preferences.

By Jan 30, 2020, COVID19 was declared a public health emergency of international concern. The similarities between SARSCoV and SARS CoV2 are striking, not only in name. The whole genome of SARSCoV2 has a 86% similarity with SARSCoV. 1 Both viruses share high degrees of homology to SARS like coronaviruses isolated in bats, suggesting that bats are the probable origin of both SARSCoV and SARS CoV2. Live animal markets selling multiple species of wild and domestic animals in proximity to large populations of densely housed humans are thought to be the source of both outbreaks. Even in terms of disease dynamics there are apparent similarities. The main transmission route is thought to be respiratory droplets, although viral shedding via faeces has also been reported for both viruses. The angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2), found in the lower respiratory tract of humans, has been identified as the receptor used for cell entry for both SARSCoV and SARSCoV2. 2,3 COVID19 and SARS have a median incubation time of about 5 days.

However, there are a few important points that need consideration-1. As caregivers, it is our utmost responsibility to protect ourselves from getting infected while managing these patients. Therefore, all heathcare personnel engaged in the care of COVID-19 patients must observe necessary precautions at all times. All of them should be trained in donning, usage, and doffing of the personal protective equipment in accordance with the existing practice guidelines. 2. The hospital systems need to ensure preparedness for dealing with large volume of COVID-19 patients, many of whom would need ICU care and/or acute cardiac care. Appropriate protocols for rapid diagnosis, triage, isolation, and management of COVID-19 patients with CV complications should be developed and well-rehearsed. Rapid triaging and management of these patients is crucial, not only to allow efficient utilization of healthcare resources but also to minimize exposure to caregivers. There are already reports highlighting delays in delivering acute cardiac care due to extra precautions that need to be observed in view of COVID-19 [14] . Efforts should be made to minimize such delays. 3. Strong emphasis should be placed on avoiding unwarranted diagnostic tests (e.g. cardiac troponin, echocardiography, etc.) in these patients. This is required to minimize unwarranted downstream diagnostic/therapeutic procedures which would further strain the already stretched healthcare resources and would also subject caregivers to added risk of exposure to the infection. The American College of Cardiology has released an advisory discouraging random measurement of cardiac biomarkers such as troponins and natriuretic peptides [15] . It urges all the clinicians to reserve these assays for circumstances in which they would actually meaningfully add to the management of the patients with COVID-19. The American Society of Echocardiography has also issued a similar advisory regarding the use of echocardiography in these patients [16] . 4. The individual hospitals may also have to reconsider risk-benefit ratio of primary percutaneous intervention vs fibrinolysis in patients with COVID-19 who present with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. 5. There has been a concern regarding the safety of ACE inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. These agents upregulate expression of ACE2 in various tissues, including on cardiomyocytes [17] . Since SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 to gain entry into human cells, there is a potentially increased risk of developing COVID-19 or developing more severe disease in patients who are already on background treatment with ACEi/ARB. However, to date, no experimental or clinical data have emerged to support these concerns. At the same time, the risks of discontinuing these therapies are well known. Therefore, several leading professional societies have strongly urged to not discontinue clinically-indicated ACEi/ARB therapy in the event the patient develops COVID-19 [18, 19] . 6. Clinicians caring for these patients also need to be fully aware of the potential CV side-effects of various therapies used for treating the viral infection. Additionally, various anti-retroviral drugs have significant interactions with cardiac drugs, which need to be considered and appropriate dose modification done. More recently, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and azathioprine have been proposed as potential therapeutic options, based on preliminary evidence [20] . Both these drugs are known to prolong QT interval and due caution must be exercised when prescribing these agents. Their combination is best avoided and even when using chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine alone, daily electrocardiogram for monitoring QT interval is warranted, esp. in patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction and in those receiving another drug with potential to prolong QT interval.",40.762320957341515,18.88498734098231

Framing responses to SARS in a discourse of bureaucratic control drew on a long tradition in which public health as 'medical police' is a function of the civil state similar to the other kinds of 'policing' it carries out (Jordanova, 1980; Porter, 1999) . Ideas of police ran throughout the limited repertoire of traditional public health techniques used to halt SARS. Quarantines of the infected and their contacts, and surveillance of travellers were the two most important methods used against SARS, with travel bans imposed by some countries. 4 The relationship to policing was clear: governments promised 'to hold victims', 'detain SARS sufferers', identify 'those suspected of harbouring the virus'.

Challenged by the reality that earlier opportunities had been missed, China launched a costly public health response in Wuhan, which involved many tactics besides isolation of cases and contacts, including lockdown of the city and mass quarantine, social distancing mandates, school closures, and intense case finding and contact tracing by the medical and public health professionals who were mobilised across the country to come to Wuhan. [2] [3] [4] The approach in Wuhan and the nearby cities in Hubei Province took exceptional measures in response to the outbreak, because there was evidence of high-level community transmission and widespread nosocomial infections. 5 As of Feb 11, 2020, 3019 COVID-19 cases among health workers had been reported, with at least five deaths. 5,6 In many regions outside of China, decision makers and the medical community still have the opportunity of early detection and response. 2 The Article by Hellewell and colleagues gives us a clearer sense of how quickly the window for early response is closing: when the number of initial cases increases to 40, the probability of failure to control is high, at 80% even with 80% of contacts traced and isolated. Based on the early experience in Wuhan, the number of COVID-19 cases could increase from 20 to 40 cases within 3 days (from Jan 6-8, 2020), and outbreak sizes doubled in every 7·4 days on average, highlighting the urgency of early detection and rapid response. 7 In Hellewell and colleagues' model, transmission before symptoms, even when the percentage is moderate, at 15-30%, had a marked effect on probability to control. 1 Unlike the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus, where almost all onward transmissions occur after symptom onset, 8 we now know that transmission of COVID-19 virus can occur before symptom onset. In the fifth version of Chinese guidelines governing contact tracing, it defined close contacts as ""those who have been in close contact since 2 days before the onset of symptoms in suspected and confirmed cases, or 2 days prior to an asymptomatic confirmed case,"" which reflects our current understanding that secondary transmission of COVID-19 virus is possible at least 2 days before symptom onset. 9 However, the efficiency of transmission remains uncertain, and seroprevalence studies among different contacts will be important. Transmission by people with no or mild symptoms can dampen the power of the isolation strategy because of reduced likelihood of isolating all cases and tracing all contacts. The identification and testing of potential cases need to be as extensive as is permitted by health care and diagnostic testing capacity-including the identification, testing, and isolation of suspected cases with no or mild disease (eg, influenza-like illness).",38.75954410686441,19.17596132992726

Indeed, the topic of access, particularly for vulnerable populations, pervades much of EM public health research. Before the 1980s, it was both traditionally and federally reinforced through Hill Burton funding that hospitals provided the majority of ''charity care'' [3] . The original emergency rooms were started in response to unattached patients. At that time, those individuals without primary care physicians who presented to the hospital in acute distress would be evaluated by the charge nurse and, if necessary, the on-call physician. Early EDs were primarily staffed by nurses, rotating residents from various specialties, and physicians trying to build practices [4] . The growth of the specialty of EM was very much consumer driven as the volume increased to the point that overwhelmed existing staff, who were all trying to do other jobs. Finally, small groups of physicians began providing full-time coverage of EDs as attending physicians dedicated to providing emergency care; the Pontiac Plan and the Alexandria Plan were examples. These informal groups soon united to define the scope of EM, develop curriculum and board certification, and lobby organized medicine for specialty status. The new specialty grew exponentially and was amazingly successful both for hospitals and EM physician groups [4] . However, major changes in the financing and delivery of health care in the 1980s resulted in increasing rates of uninsured patients [5] . Many private hospitals started to baulk at absorbing this burden and developed policies of referring or transferring uninsured ED patients to publicly funded county hospitals. Emergency physicians and patients responded to these ''patient dumping'' policies with research and advocacy [6] .

The newly emerging 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), later named SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 was identified initially in Wuhan, China. Since its first description in December 2019, the total number of cases as reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) had reached 191,127confirmed cases on February 18, 2020, with 7807 deaths [2] . The clinical picture and radiographic presentations were recently described [3, 4] and the clinical picture in nine pregnant women [5] were similar to non-pregnant women [3, 4] . One study showed that 15 pregnant patients with COVID-19 had mild disease [6] . All of the pregnant patients in one study and 66.7% of pregnant COVID-19 patients had C-section, moreover all the newborn survived [5, 6] . However, 4 of 9 (44%) pregnant COVID-19 patients had premature delivery [5] . In a previous study of MERS-CoV, there were 11 pregnant women [7] . A comparison between MERS-CoV and COVID-19 cases in pregnancy is shown in Table 1 . There was no difference in the age group of the patients, however, the gestational age was lower among MERS-CoV than COVID-19 patients. Of the MERS-CoV cases in pregnancy, 63.6% required intensive care unit admission and this is comparable to 50% of SARS pregnant women [8] . There was no mention about the death rate among pregnant women with COVID-19, however, the case fatality rate among MERS-pregnant patients was about 35% and was not statistically different when compared to the overall MERS case fatality rate [7] . In the MERS cases, 40% had C-section and this is much lower than 100% C-section rate in the case of COVID-19. This difference may reflect a variance in the practices between different countries. Another difference is the high fetal demise rate of 30% among pregnant women with MERS compared to 0% among COVID-19. The fetal demise rate among 12 pregnant women with SARS was 25% [8] . Thus, similar to the difference in the clinical presentation and course among SARS, MERS-CoV and COVID-19, there is also differences in the outcome and course of pregnant women with these coronaviruses' infection.

Simultaneously, data from the State Council Information Office in China suggest that more than 90% of health-care workers in Hubei province are women, emphasising the gendered nature of the health workforce and the risk that predominantly female health workers incur. 5 The closure of schools to control COVID-19 transmission in China, Hong Kong, Italy, South Korea, and beyond might have a differential effect on women, who provide most of the informal care within families, with the consequence of limiting their work and economic opportunities. Travel restrictions cause COVID-19: the gendered impacts of the outbreak the intervention, a careful interpretation of the negative findings is needed. Drug development and clinical evaluation of more potent and specific latency reversal agents alone and in combination in people living with HIV receiving ART and finding new approaches to put the kill into the kick and kill regimen are still warranted to determine if this strategy might allow people living with HIV to safely stop ART and achieve a cure. financial challenges and uncertainty for mostly female foreign domestic workers, many of whom travel in southeast Asia between the Philippines, Indonesia, Hong Kong, and Singapore. 6 Consideration is further needed of the gendered implications of quarantine, such as whether women and men's different physical, cultural, security, and sanitary needs are recognised. Experience from past outbreaks shows the importance of incorporating a gender analysis into preparedness and response efforts to improve the effectiveness of health interventions and promote gender and health equity goals. During the 2014-16 west African outbreak of Ebola virus disease, gendered norms meant that women were more likely to be infected by the virus, given their predominant roles as caregivers within families and as front-line health-care workers. 7 Women were less likely than men to have power in decision making around the outbreak, and their needs were largely unmet. 8 For example, resources for reproductive and sexual health were diverted to the emergency response, contributing to a rise in maternal mortality in a region with one of the highest rates in the world. 9 During the Zika virus outbreak, differences in power between men and women meant that women did not have autonomy over their sexual and reproductive lives, 10 which was compounded by their inadequate access to health care and insufficient financial resources to travel to hospitals for check-ups for their children, despite women doing most of the community vector control activities. 11 Given their front-line interaction with communities, it is concerning that women have not been fully incorporated into global health security surveillance, detection, and prevention mechanisms. Women's socially prescribed care roles typically place them in a prime position to identify trends at the local level that might signal the start of an outbreak and thus improve global health security. Although women should not be further burdened, particularly considering much of their labour during health crises goes underpaid or unpaid, incorporating women's voices and knowledge could be empowering and improve outbreak preparedness and response. Despite the WHO Executive Board recognising the need to include women in decision making for outbreak preparedness and response, 12 there is inadequate women's representation in national and global COVID-19 policy spaces, such as in the White House Coronavirus Task Force. 13 If the response to disease outbreaks such as COVID-19 is to be effective and not reproduce or perpetuate gender and health inequities, it is important that gender norms, roles, and relations that influence women's and men's differential vulnerability to infection, exposure to pathogens, and treatment received, as well as how these may differ among different groups of women and men, are considered and addressed. We call on governments and global health institutions to consider the sex and gender effects of the COVID-19 outbreak, both direct and indirect, and conduct an analysis of the gendered impacts of the multiple outbreaks, incorporating the voices of women on the front line of the response to COVID-19 and of those most affected by the disease within preparedness and response policies or practices going forward.",49.132907036429785,22.098382957001675

This is not to suggest that quarantine should not be used; the psychological effects of not using quarantine and allowing disease to spread might be worse. 44 However, depriving people of their liberty for the wider public good is often contentious and needs to be handled carefully. If quarantine is essential, then our results suggest that officials should take every measure to ensure that this experience is as tolerable as possible for people. This can be achieved by: telling people what is happening and why, explaining how long it will continue, providing meaningful activities for them to do while in quarantine, providing clear communication, ensuring basic supplies (such as food, water, and medical supplies) are available, and reinforcing the sense of altruism that people should, rightly, be feeling. Health officials charged with implementing quarantine, who by definition are in employment and usually with reasonable job security, should also remember that not everyone is in the same situation.

By March 10, 2020, 116 166 cases have been reported globally, causing 4088 deaths. The epidemic has spread to 118 countries around the world. 2 With immunocompromised status and physiological adaptive changes during pregnancy, pregnant women could be more susceptible to COVID-19 infection than the general population. As COVID-19 is rapidly spreading, maternal management and fetal safety become a major concern, but there is scarce information of assessment and management of pregnant women infected with COVID-19, and the potential risk of vertical transmission is unclear. In The Lancet Infectious Diseases, Nan Yu and colleagues 3 report the clinical features and obstetric and neonatal outcomes of pregnancy with COVID-19 pneumonia in Wuhan, China. Seven pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia were assessed and the onset symptoms were similar to those reported in non-pregnant adults with COVID-19. All patients received oxygen therapy and antiviral treatment in isolation. All patients had caesarean section after consultation with a multidisciplinary team and the outcomes of the pregnant women and neonates were good. Three neonates were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and one was found to be infected with COVID-19 36 h after birth. The findings of the study provide some indications for clinical assessment and management of pregnant women with COVID-19, but questions remain on how to manage pregnant women infected with COVID-19.",46.33745041708645,19.498538427821536

In population health, zoonotic disease threats should be addressed through surveillance systems that include domestic and wild animal and human populations, which would help lead to effective control measures. Since physicians and veterinarians would be the key professionals to recognize and report outbreaks, enhanced communications between hospital epidemiologists, veterinarians, and local public health officials would not only help expedite a local response, but also help identify whether unusual diseases or outbreaks involving animals and humans were related or separate events. In the research setting, collaboration between physicians and veterinarians in comparative medicine would improve our understanding of zoonotic agenthost interactions.",41.198302450108166,19.43060492656099

It is mandatory, especially in a finite resource system, to balance the potential benefit of containment measures, such as postponing scheduled procedures, with negative health and social costs. Diverting the attention exclusively to the COVID-19 situation and overshadowing the everyday clinical practice may have substantial negative implications, especially for cancer patients. Re-allocating an excessive amount of health care personnel, both nurses and doctors, to the COVID-19 triage and management may stretch an already fragile system and potentially leave uncovered some vital activities, such as treatment administration, surgeries and inpatient assistance. It is well established that delayed oncologic surgery may lead to disease progressions and result in tumors no longer resectable, leading to worse survival outcomes. The same goes for neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy regimens administered with suboptimal timing. It should be emphasized that we are talking about patients potentially cured by oncologic treatments. Therefore, any delay of these fundamental procedures, either intentional or due to shortage of personnel, should be avoided. The same risk is present for the people who have scheduled screening activities (e.g. screening mammography for the early diagnosis of breast cancer). People should be advised to maintain their scheduled appointments, if the procedure is feasible safely, or at least to promptly reschedule their appointment when the epidemic is expected to slow its pace. For patients with advanced disease, as oncologists we know the enormous negative impact from disease progression in terms of both survival time and quality of life. The inability to deliver palliative care to patients unable to move from their homes and the management of treatment side-effects are other significant concerns from a forced quarantine. 5 Patients with advanced disease, and no suggestive symptoms of COVID-19, should keep receiving planned chemotherapy or radiotherapy treatment, without unnecessary delays.

How can the past assist in the real-time management of the crisis? What insights can be gleaned from the ongoing epidemic for future disease preparedness and prevention? Lurking in the background of these interrogatives is a more or less explicit accusation: why haven't past lessons been learned? The gist of some commentaries seems to be: ""there is almost nothing surprising about this pandemic"". 2 The history-as-lessons approach pivots on the assumption that epidemics are structurally comparable events, wherever and whenever they take place. The COVID-19 outbreak ""creates a sense of déjà vu"" with the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). 3 Citing early estimates of the disease's infectiousness, based on an analysis of the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan, 4 comparisons have been drawn with the 1918-19 influenza pandemic. 5 Although in some respects the outbreak of COVID-19 presents a compelling argument for why history matters, there are problems with analogical views of the past because they constrain our ability to grasp the complex place-and-time-specific variables that drive contemporary disease emergence. A lessons approach to epidemics produces what Kenneth Burke, borrowing from the economist and sociologist Thorstein Veblen, called ""trained incapacity""-""that state of affairs whereby one's very abilities can function as blindnesses"". 6 Habitual modes of thinking can diminish our capacity to make lateral connections. When the present is viewed through the lens of former disease outbreaks, we typically focus on similitudes and overlook important differences. In other words, analogies create blind spots. As Burke commented, ""a way of seeing is also a way of not seeing-a focus on object A involves a neglect of object B"". 6 A lessons approach to the past, which usually comes from outside the discipline of history, reinforces an idea of the past as a series of interlinked crises that offer instructive insights into cause and effect. 7 Historians need to push back against easy analogies and examine the specific contexts of outbreaks, asking, for example, in what ways SARS and COVID-19 are in fact comparable. The designation of the new virus as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by Over the past 7 years, China's President Xi Jinping has sought to extend Chinese influence abroad while tightening his grip on power at home. 10 Some would argue that this enhanced authority has enabled him to put in place draconian, Mao-style infectious dis ease containment measures including the lockdown of cities. 11 Bruce Aylward, a senior adviser to WHO's Director-General who co-led the WHO-China Joint Mission on COVID-19 in late February, 2020, praised China's efforts as ""probably the most ambitious, and I would say, agile and aggressive disease containment effort in history"". 12 Meanwhile, the protests in Hong Kong from June, 2019, have been a reaction to a perceived erosion of the territory's quasi-autonomy as a special administrative region. While ostensibly an anti-government protest against the introduction of an extradition bill, the Hong Kong protests could be viewed as an attempt to push back against Xi's expansion of central power. 13 Concurrently, a US-China trade war instigated by President Donald Trump's imposition of tariffs on China in 2018 is hitting the Chinese economy. 14 The COVID-19 outbreak is compounding this economic situation, holding out the potential for a global recession with major disruption to global supply chains. 15 Taken together, these entangled circumstances have created a unique setting in which the COVID-19 outbreak is evolving. In an interview with the Hong Kong newspaper Ming Pao, the physician Joseph Sung, who had a leading role in the fight to contain SARS in 2003, underscored the striking differences between Hong Kong society then and now. ""At that time, society was more united"", Sung said of the SARS era, ""whereas now people feel they have to rely on themselves for protection. They have less trust in the government"". 16 Analogies of COVID-19 are rarely extended to encompass these intermeshing social and political environments. The lessons approach skates over this history, even as history's expediency as a tool for instruction is flaunted. Historians need to contest false analogies that obscure, rather than elucidate, the social processes partly driving new infections. They need to challenge efforts to corral and straitjacket the past into summary lessons. By contrast, espousing an anti-lessons approach to history might prevent trained incapacity. Such an approach could help to ensure a strategic open-mindedness to emergent threats at a time when borders of many kinds are going up across the globe. I declare no competing interests. Recognition of the need for equitable health care for people with disabilities and the need to appropriately educate the health-care workforce has emerged over the past few decades. [1] [2] [3] Although people with disabilities experience the same general health-care needs as other people, they are more likely to experience health-care inequities due to the inadequate skills and knowledge of health-care providers and inaccessible healthcare facilities. 4 In 2009, an art of medicine essay in The Lancet by Tom Shakespeare and colleagues 5 posited that ""perhaps the most dramatic learning can come when it is a peer who is disabled, rather than a patient"". Medical schools are beginning to consider students with disabilities as a constituent part of their diversity, equity, and inclusion agenda, and several organisations and academic leaders from around the world are now offering formal guidance to medical schools, with the goal of fully realising the value that people with disabilities bring to medical education. [6] [7] [8] [9] We share The Lancet's commitment to promoting diversity in medicine 10, 11 and concerns about the structural biases that negatively impact patient care. Health-care disparities for patients with disabilities are universal, and while efforts towards inclusion of more health-care providers with disabilities have been made, there is a global under-representation of clinicians with disabilities (appendix). The barriers to health care for people with disabilities are ingrained. The United Nations 2018 Flagship Report on Disability and Development maintains that ""attitudinal barriers have compromised access to health services for persons with disabilities, as health professionals often have little experience interacting with or providing services to persons with severe and/or complex disabilities, or have negative, stigmatizing attitudes towards these patients"". 12 This segregation of patient and provider, healthy and disabled, has adverse impacts on the wellbeing of people with disabilities and constitutes a barrier to health-care services and education.",43.03545669714507,18.686369707186657

First, under Article 43.2, countries cannot implement additional health measures exclusively as a precaution but must rather ground their decision making in ""scientific principles"", ""scientific evidence"", and ""advice from WHO"". 1 Many of the travel restrictions being implemented during the COVID-19 outbreak are not supported by science or WHO. Travel restrictions for these kinds of viruses have been challenged by public health researchers, [4] [5] [6] and WHO has advised against travel restrictions, arguing they cause more harm than good. 7, 8 Second, under Article 43.1 any additional health measures implemented by countries ""shall not be more restrictive of international traffic and not more invasive or intrusive to persons than reasonably available alternatives"". 1 In this case, even if travel restrictions did work, there are so many other more effective measures that countries can take to protect their citizens. WHO has issued COVID-19 technical guidance on several such measures, including risk communication, surveillance, patient management, and screening at ports of entry and exit. 9 Third, and most importantly, Article 3.1 strictly requires all additional health measures to be implemented ""with full respect for the dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms of persons"", 1 which in turn must reflect the international law principles of necessity, legitimacy, and proportionality that govern limitations to and derogations from rights and freedoms. 10 Under no circumstances should public health or foreign policy decisions be based on the racism and xenophobia that are now being directed at Chinese people and those of Asian descent. 11 Many of the travel restrictions implemented by dozens of countries during the COVID-19 outbreak are therefore violations of the IHR. 12 Yet, perhaps even more troubling, is that at least two-thirds of these countries have not reported their additional health measures to WHO, 12 response to public health emergencies and prevents countries from holding each other accountable for their obligations under the IHR. Some countries argue that they would rather be safe than sorry. But evidence belies the claim that illegal travel restrictions make countries safer. [4] [5] [6] In the short term, travel restrictions prevent supplies from getting into affected areas, slow down the international public health response, stigmatise entire populations, and disproportionately harm the most vulnerable among us. In the longer term, countries selecting which international laws to follow encourages other countries to do the same, which in turn undermines the broader rules-based world order. Effective global governance is not possible when countries cannot depend on each other to comply with international agreements. 13 Of course, the IHR is far from perfect. For example, the IHR only governs countries, not corporations and other non-governmental actors. Thus, some countries are finding themselves with de-facto travel restrictions when airlines stop flying to places affected by COVID-19.",56.97279196026808,23.46190814341118

Some studies suggest a high rate of AKI events upon COVID-19 infection, whereas a recent study from Wuhan, China, reported that AKI happened in <5% of the hospitalized patients with this viral infection. 11 As more studies are underway, it is prudent that during an active COVID-19 we ensure the mitigation of PEW risk and immediate correction of PEW in all patients with kidney diseases including transplant recipients. We encourage adequate protein and calorie intake, be it enterally or parenterally, so that any occurrence of hypokalemia or hypophosphatemia can be avoided and that PEW, sarcopenia and cachexia can be prevented or immediately corrected. 12 In the midst of this serious infection there is no role for delaying nutrition support or for low protein, low phosphorus, or low potassium regimens if the patient has COVID-19 infection. 13 Therefore, the need to supervise the nutrition regimens of patients with kidney diseases may be enhanced during this period and should not be ignored while focusing on other, seemingly more urgent, matters.

Direct health consequences include trauma-related deaths and disability, gender-based violence, and mental disorders. Disruption of health systems contributes to increased morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases, malnutrition, obstetric complications, and non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Health indicators in the EMR are among the worst in the world. 6 State fragility and conflict are among the biggest challenges to attainment of Sustainable Development Goal 3. 7 Conflict is a global health security threat because affected countries are less able to prevent, detect, and respond to disease outbreaks. More than 70% of disease outbreaks worldwide occur in fragile and conflict-affected settings. 8 Yemen has experienced the largest cholera outbreak in history. 9 During the second half of 2019, there were six concurrent disease outbreaks in Sudan. 10 Wild polio virus returned to Syria due to conflict, 11 while Afghanistan and Pakistan are two of three countries where the virus remains endemic. 12 The average International Health Regulations (IHR) core capacity score is much lower for the 12 conflict-affected countries than for the other countries in the region, 6 placing them at greater risk of spread and public health consequences of the ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and other epidemic-prone diseases.

However, lasting behaviour change is a result of decisions made at the individual level. To facilitate voluntary behaviour change a campaign must appeal to the values and cost-benefit evaluation of each audience group targeted, emphasising near-term salient benefits rather than long-term, abstract, collective benefits. Likewise, veterinary public health messages must be customised in such a way that they are interesting, relevant and captivating to their audience. Messages should be clear, easy to understand and easy to act on. Unless it is easy for people to remember how, when and what to do it is unlikely that a veterinary public health communication campaign will be successful. Social marketing techniques applied to emerging zoonosis communication campaigns have been shown to be effective in crafting health messages that 'speak' to target audiences [6] . Successful communication campaigns are based on systematic planning efforts and on objectives that are attainable, measurable, clear and time-bound. Successful campaigns develop and deliver health messages that are tailored to specific target audiences. Disseminating generic veterinary public health messages widely and increasing knowledge about certain emerging zoonoses issues and healthy behaviours have been shown to be less effective than more targeted efforts. Audience-centred health communication efforts with a consumer perspective are much more effective in motivating target audiences to change their behaviour. This requires designing and delivering messages that are adapted to the needs, perceptions, preferences and situations of the intended audiences rather than the needs and goals of the message designers or institutions. Communicators in veterinary public health practice therefore need to know as much as possible about their target audience(s) in order to stimulate voluntary behaviour change [7] .",33.44342876477994,15.85163991800333

The prime objective of public health law is to pursue the highest possible level of physical and mental health in the population, consistent with the values of social justice'. 3 This might be compared with an Australian definition, which identifies public health law as 'any area of legal regulation which affects the maintenance and improvement of the health of individuals in a community', 4 and with that of Martin, writing from a UK perspective, who has defined the field as 'that body of law which can be used as a tool in the provision, protection and promotion of the health rights of the population'. 5 The differences between these definitions reflect the nature of the legal framework in differing jurisdictions: in some instances, public health law will primarily take the form of legislative intervention, while in others (such as England and Wales), a patchwork of legislation dealing with public health sits alongside regulation through the common law, which enables individuals to bring actions in public or private law to protect their public health 'rights'. Common to each, however, is a perception of the facilitative role which may be played by law: that, as Gostin has written, it can function as an 'essential tool for creating the conditions that enable people to lead healthier and safer lives'. 3, 5 In contrast to the above, medical law concerns itself primarily with the individual, not the collective, with the physician-patient nexus being central. As Kennedy and Grubb note, it 'is essentially concerned with the relationship between health care professionals (particularly doctors and to a lesser extent hospitals or other institutions) and patients'. 6 It emphasizes internal, rather than external, causes of disease and ill health, and its orientation is towards the remedying of error, not the management and reduction of risks to health. Notwithstanding that there has been a recent emergence of courses in healthcare law, which seek to move beyond the clinical relationship to explore broader legal issues in the organization and delivery of health services, 7 public health remains, at best, a subsidiary concern as the focus remains upon care of the sick as distinct from promotion of the health of the population.",39.12688261455121,17.873262414982296

There was no evidence of new onset atrioventricular block in COVID-19 patients and no arrhythmic cardiac death during hospitalization. Nevertheless, a previous report in 138 COVID-19 patients showed that common complications included arrhythmias in 16.7% of cases and acute cardiac injury in 7.2% [2] . This was confirmed in another recent report in 187 patients with COVID-19 demonstrating malignant arrhythmias in 11.5% of patients with increased troponin [4] . In this study the upper reference limit of troponin I was 0.12 ng/mL. The same authors demonstrate that even if functional and morphological cardiac abnormalities were infrequent with increased troponin levels had a significant hazard ratio of 8.9 (95% confidence interval 1.9-40.6) for the risk of death, as reported by others [4, 5] . Of note, in accordance with a similar report, troponin I was not elevated at the beginning of the infection while in patients with severe clinical conditions tended to increase [10] . This finding suggests that troponin I is mainly a marker of multiorgan failure and pulmonary hypertension associated with ARDS more than a marker that identifies patients with acute myocarditis. Finally, the Authors conclude that elevation of troponin during hospitalization is an important marker of prognosis and should be seen as a warning sign even if not generally increased at the beginning of hospitalization. The observation that troponin levels at the beginning of hospitalization cannot differentiate between survivors and non-survivors is also in line with a previous publication [10] . The study by Deng et al. [9] does not support to perform routine echocardiogram in all patients with COVID-19, but it should be considered in those with raised troponin. Several reports suggest that increased troponin levels in the emergency department could identify patients at higher risk for acute myocarditis triggered by SARS-CoV-2 [7, 8] . Identification of these patients would be important clinically since they often present with atypical symptoms such as chest pain and minimal respiratory involvement [7, 8] . Acute myocarditis, in addition to acute coagulopathy, could explain cases of sudden cardiac death observed during quarantine among COVID-19 patients not admitted to hospital [4] .",39.25831588370966,17.688285462977277

This is reflected in increasing demand, rising costs, and a return towards curative and hospital care, making re-exploration of the Alma-Ata principles both timely and relevant. 3 A better alignment of a population-based public health approach with personal health services is needed urgently, along with better integration of personal health care and public health. To quote van Weel et al., primary care needs to be organized on the principle of care for individuals in the context of the population, and the future of primary care, and health care in general, will depend on how effectively a community-oriented approach and its contribution to equity and social cohesion is achieved. 2 The recognition that health systems play a key role in public health has been endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in the report 'Primary Health Care -Now More Than Ever', published on the 30 th anniversary of the international conference of Alma-Ata. Arguing the need to revisit Alma-Ata, the report identifies four broad policy directions of improving health for all: tackling health inequalities through universal coverage; putting people at the centre of care; integrating health into broader public policy; and providing inclusive leadership for health. 4 This approach requires public health strategies as well as clinical skills in meeting the needs of populations, particularly the poor and vulnerable, and is congruent with the influential report from the Commission on Social Determinants of Health which stresses the relevance of an ecological approach to health, essential to achieving the millennium development goals. 5 The implicit need for stronger public health was again re-inforced by the 2009 WHO World Health Assembly resolution which calls for primary healthcare services to provide health promotion and disease prevention as well as curative care and palliative care, and for integration and co-ordinated practice to take account of the needs of populations and to promote active participation by all people. 6 The corollary to these global health policy developments is an increasing interest in appropriate educational strategies, and a growing recognition that public health education must change if it is to meet the needs of modern societies, the health threats they face and the challenge of developing equitable health systems.",42.73692827547661,18.904970544514804

Clinical nurses experienced great stress when they were fighting against COVID-19 with needs for health, safety, interpersonal relationships, and related knowledge. Alderfer [3] proposed the existence, relatedness, and growth (ERG) theory of humanistic needs on the basis of Maslow's hierarchy of needs. He believed that people have three core needs, namely a need for survival, a need for relationships, and a need for growth and development. The purpose of this study is to use in-depth interviews to understand the psychological needs of front-line nurses working in extraordinary epidemic situations, and to analyze the main content of their psychological needs from the lens of the ERG theory and to provide a perspective for interventions to alleviate the psychological stress of nurses at the front-line.",43.80179054816364,20.07133114484876

An effective public health response requires a coordinated laboratory response in the Ministry of Health (MOH) network with credible laboratories capable of providing accurate and reliable results in a timely manner to enable effective public health measures to contain the spread of the outbreak. Most countries have limited expertise and experience for detecting exotic diseases that may be imported and depend on the World Health Organization (WHO) and network laboratories or the Centers for Disease Control, United States for technical expertise, kits or controls and laboratory confirmation. Although the information and resources exchange during any crisis is available through this network, this process takes time. Time is a critical factor in the public health response for preventing spread, surge and for efficient containment of an outbreak. Stewardship from a reference laboratory is important to take the lead for the laboratory network, to provide referral diagnostic services, on-going training and mentorship and to ensure coordination of an effective laboratory response. Ebola virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome corona virus (MERS-CoV) and avian influenza A (H7N9) are examples of emerging and reemerging viruses that have gripped the attention of many nations worldwide. It is vital that countries should have the ability to quickly identify potential cases as part of their pandemic preparedness plan. In Malaysia, the Institute for Medical Research (IMR) is the reference laboratory for specialized diagnostics and infectious disease outbreak management.

This suggests some potential difference from SARS and MERS in the pathogenesis of coronavirus [2] . There is also a potential repressed immune function in COVID-19 patients with the hypo-albuminemia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, and decreased percentage of CD8 + T cell [2, 7] . Recent reports suggest that in some COVID-19 patients, although being negative for the viral nucleic acid test, still sometimes present with a high level of inflammation. A clinical trial using certolizumab pegol (a TNF blocker) along with other anti-virus therapies may have beneficial effects in COVID-19 patients. Collectively, the finding indicates that inflammation is a major feature in COVID-19 patients. Thus, we hypothesize that excessive inflammation, depressed immune system, and an activate cytokine storm substantially contribute to the pathogenesis of COVID-19.",42.517285926069675,17.25241450073724

Perspectives from Bergamo Neurosurgery Department,"We describe, with this report, the shocking effect of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak on the Department of Neurosurgery of Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital in Bergamo, which represents at the moment, the most affected city in the entire Italian territory (Figure 1 ). 1 This epidemic is challenging the Italian Government and the Healthcare System and is having a devastating impact on all the health activities, without excluding the neurosurgical reality. The first known contagion from SARS-CoV-2, causing Coronavirus Disease 2019 , was reported on February 21, in the small town of Codogno, in Lombardy. On the same day, the fist death from COVID-19 happened in Padua, and the second occurred on February 22 in Lombardy. 2 The consequent infection chain led the Italian Council of Ministers to publish a decree prohibiting the transit in and out of the outbreak areas (the so-called red areas), suspending all the public events, and introducing the quarantine for all the infected citizens, (Figure 2A ). The first cases in Bergamo were identified on February 23. Since then, the virus spread exponentially in Northern Italy, and afterwards throughout the state. Lombard hospitals were gradually overcrowded by patients with COVID-19. 3 On March 8, in an attempt to contain the epidemic, a decree of the Italian Prime Minister extended the red areas to the entire Lombardy and to other 14 Italian provinces ( Figure 2B ). This act was implemented the day after, when the whole of Italy became a red area ( Figure  2C ); 4 this was globally launched by the Government itself even in social networks, with the hashtag #iorestoacasa (#istayhome). In so doing, the movement of people throughout the country was reduced, all sports events were suspended, and teaching activities in schools and universities were stopped until April 3. By March 11, only basic shops were left open. Up to today (March 20), the total SARS-CoV-2 positive patients are 47.021, making Italy the second state with the most confirmed infections, after China. Italian death toll had recently surpassed China, becoming the country with the highest COVID-19-related mortality worldwide. 5 Bergamo is currently the most plagued Italian city and Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital is the largest health care center in the city. It comprises 1,080 beds, 83 of which are in critical care beds (53 of Intensive and 30 Subintensive Care beds). It is designed with a central area (which includes laboratories, diagnostic services, the Emergency Department, 32 operating rooms) and 7 towers all around it, each of which harbors different medical specialties. It also includes a 24-hour heliport and 280 outpatient clinics. The Hospital is home to one of the six highly specialized Trauma Centers identified by the Lombard Trauma Management Network in 2012. Moreover, it is the only Pediatric Trauma Center in the Region. The Department of Neurosurgery is one of the Hospital flagships. The neurosurgical catchment area covers nearly 1.200.000 citizens. Ten attending neurosurgeons and three residents work in the Department. There is a neurosurgeon on call 24-hours-a-day. Neurosurgical Ward includes 34 beds and another 16 beds in the dedicated Neurointensive care unit. Two operating theaters, offering 17 weekly surgical interventions, are available. In 2019, we completed 1360 surgical procedures (305 major cranial, 285 minor cranial, 191 major spinal, 483 minor spinal), including 260 urgencies, 70 pediatric procedures, and 3.630 outpatient visits were performed. 6 This solid infrastructure underwent important changes in the last two months, in accordance with the evolving COVID-19 pandemic Since the last days of February, there was a massive increase of COVID-19 cases in Bergamo, and a large number of patients overloaded the Emergency Room. Initially, they were kept in the Emergency Department or admitted to the Department of Infectious Diseases. When the situation worsened further, it was necessary to activate supplementary emergency responses, which resulted in a profound reorganization of all sectors, including Neurosurgery. Many wards were closed and many other were reconverted to COVID-facilities, according to the Hospital Health Direction. On February 24, all hospitalizations for elective surgical procedures were stopped. On March 6, the Gastroenterology Department was converted to a ""Gastro-COVID"" unit; after two days the ""Pneumo-COVID"" was created, and on March 10 the Department of Neurology became the ""Neuro-COVID"". Lastly, the Department of Hematology was transformed into the ""Hemato-COVID"" on March 17. New intensive care areas were created, taking mechanical ventilators from the dismissed operating rooms. Inside the so-called ""COVID-Towers"", 400 total beds have been established for COVID-19 patients, and 92 additional beds in the Intensive Care Units. All units are currently saturated. Four intensive positions are available for cardiac emergencies or pediatric trauma. In the Emergency Department, 42 beds are at disposal, and 4 others advanced stations are located in the Shock Room. In order to streamline the constant flow of people, the triage system was extended even in the parking space. The actual number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients stands to 538 (442 in hospital ward and 96 in intensive care units), which represent the 49.8% of the Hospital total capacity. At the moment, it is not possible to increase this quantity for the lack of workers, and the critical issues associated with COVID-19 infected hospital staff. Moreover, there exists a significant deficiency of personal protective equipment, medications (i.e. antiviral drugs, antibiotics), medical devices and even oxygen. The opening of these special areas required the recruitment of medical and nursing staff (even without specific skills) in treating pulmonary or infectious diseases, taken from both local medical and surgical Departments. 7 On March 6, 25% of the neurosurgical staff was assigned to COVID-towers; this percentage arose to 50% on March 13, and to 75% since March 20. This deficit was accompanied by a concomitant overall reduction of neurosurgical activities. Hospitalized patients were gradually discharged, and the Department of Neurosurgery was closed on March 12. On call duty 24/7 was also terminated, and our last patients were moved to a new temporary Ward of ten beds, in common with orthopedic surgeons and otolaryngologists. Outpatient visits were unaffected until March 6, at which time they were reduced to a weekly session for urgencies and another one for cerebral and spinal oncological cases. Surgical activity was regular with 17 intervention per week until March 1, when seven slots were withdrawn, and only ten surgical procedures were allowed. In the week from 9 to 15 March, only four urgent operations were performed; and following 15 March, no procedures were performed. In order to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, the Regional Health System adopted different urgent containment measures. 8 On March 8, with the Decree XI/2906, 9 the Lombard Health System was reorganized and the regional neurosurgical network was concentrated in 4 Hub Hospitals: three of them for cranial or spinal emergencies, and a fourth specialized for oncological pathologies (Figure 3) . Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital remained the reference point for pediatric trauma, while all the other Lombard Departments of Neurosurgery became the Spoke of a Spoke and Hub system. In this way, Hub Hospitals were free to deal with specific medical or surgical emergencies, while Spoke Hospitals focused on COVID-19 patients. Even if in Italy the national Health Care System is mainly public, Research Hospitals and accredited private Hospitals were included in this network. As of today, no pediatric traumatic emergencies were sent to our Institution. This is significatively below the expectations, 9 and likely has resulted from legitimate curfew instituted by the government to limit contagious spread of the virus, with the unexpected advantage associated with a reduced risk of traumatic injuries. The true efficacy of this system still needs to be clarified when further data, when such becomes available. The recent literature suggests that SARS-CoV-2 spreading is still expected to propagate exponentially. 10 Therefore, the readiness of foreign Health Systems will continue to be challenged worldwide. The Italian experience has demonstrated the priceless contribution of neurosurgeons and other not-specialized physicians dealing with COVID-19, where all the available resources are needed. The world is fighting a battle with an invisible common enemy, which must be won.",40.987685084605154,18.118138152452683

Infectious disease outbreaks such as COVID-19, as well as other public health events, can cause emotional distress and anxiety. These feelings of distress and anxiety can occur even in people not at high risk of getting sick, in the face of a virus with which the common people may be unfamiliar. I read publications on ""Vicarious traumatization in the general public, members, and non-members of medical teams aiding in COVID-19 control"" and on ""Traumatization in medical staff helping with COVID-19 control"" with a great interest (Li et al., 2020; Joob and Wiwanitkit, 2020) . Li et al. reported how much people and medical staff suffer from vicarious traumatization and how this vicarious traumatization of non-front-line medical staff is more serious than that of front-line medical staff (Li et al., 2020) . As in South and Southeast Asia countries, also in Italy, there are similar problems in medical staff due to high workload and intermittent lack of protective devices. In addition, some slight form of racism is demonstrated against health care professionals who potentially have a higher risk of being infected and between non-front-line medical staff towards front-line medical staff. We don't have to forget the many doctors and nurses were infected and many of them died due to COVID-19 infection. Also in Italy, local people also have high levels of stress due to no firm estimate of how long pandemic will last and how long our lives will be disrupted or whether or not we or our loved ones will be infected. Previous research has revealed a profound and wide spectrum of psychological impact that outbreaks can inflict on people (Lima et al., 2020) . New psychiatric symptoms in people without mental illness can occur or aggravate the condition of those with pre-existing mental illness and cause distress to the caregivers of affected individuals (Kelvin and Rubino, 2020) . Most health professionals working in isolation units and hospitals very often do not receive any training for providing mental health care (Lima et al., 2020) . Barbisch et al. (2015) described how the confinement ""caused a sense of collective hysteria, leading the staff to desperate measures"". Suicidal cases were reported in India (Goyal et al., 2020) but also in other countries, Italy included, where two infected Italian nurses committed suicide in a period of a few days probably due to fear of spreading COVID-19 to patients. It is possible that fear and anxiety of falling sick or dying, helplessness will drive an increase in the 2020 suicide rates. In the United States (US), the COVID-19 Pandemic's New Epicenter, a dedicated Lifeline (the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline) was activated for emotional distress related to COVID-19 to prevent suicide.",48.750377746329804,20.31152695036643

Results also show that the number of acute care beds from more than 45 designated hospitals plus two newly built ones in Wuhan has been consecutively increasing up to 23 532 (as of Feb 24) under the government-directed re-allocation (Fig. 1D) . This supply thus enabled the severe and critical patients to be treated timely and effectively 6 . More importantly, there have been over 10 temporary hospitals (named Fangcang hospitals) reconstructed from gymnasium and exhibition centers, which provide more than 26 000 makeshift beds for mild patients (Fig. 1D) . These combinations guaranteed nearly 100% percent of COVID-19 patients to be treated in hospitals even if the number of remaining confirmed cases has ten-fold increased up to 38 000 on 18 Feb (Fig. 1D) . In contrast, a lot of patients had to stay at home in the early stage of the outbreak in Wuhan due to the shortage of beds such that many transmissions in households occurred 6 . Accordingly, the effective implementation of comprehensive control measures and infection-treatment practices is critical for combatting any new pathogens, not only interrupting the transmissions but also saving the patients. Timely supplied medical resources, including re-allocation of acute care beds, rapid construction of new hospitals and generous aid of health workers by other less-severe areas, apparently help the epicenter of the outbreak Hubei (Wuhan) to accomplish a unique and also encouraging outcome for life-saving such that the mortality and recovery rates of nearly 50 000 COVID-19 patients exponentially decays and grows, respectively. Other crucial factors contributing to this success may include the improved and optimized diagnosis and treatment strategies 8 , which are critical for saving severe and critical patients 5, 6, 9 . This speculation appears to be supported by the exponential growth of the COVID-19 recovery rate outside Hubei (Fig. 1B) where medical resources are relatively sufficient 10 .

Reducing contact between health care personnel and COVID-19 patients is an integral step in limiting its spread and resource utilization, including use of personal protective equipment (PPE).",47.64550215230179,22.93315610666103

Considering the speed of transmission of COVID-19, individuals from vulnerable health systems are at particular risk. An example is the Eastern European countries that in recent years faced health system vulnerabilities due to post-communism delayed reforms, corruption, and the emigration of physicians [3] . Romania is a concerning example of a vulnerable health system [3] with the highest governmental instability within the EU [4] , the leadership of the Romanian Ministry of Health changed 25 times in 27 years, a turnover three times higher than in other EU countries [4] . In its recent history, Romania experienced a series of economic crises (in the 1990s, and in late 2000s) which forced an estimated~5 million people to emigrate, including in countries where currently COVID-19 was identified (especially in Italy, Spain, Germany and United Kingdom). Many of these migrants regularly travel back to Romania which increases the likelihood for COVID-19 to spread [1] to Romania. Rising public awareness among migrant travelers and providing hygiene products is highly suggested to limit the spread of COVID-19. After the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Romanian Ministry of Health released late January a set of recommendations and proceeded to the acquisition of medical equipment with the purpose of initial identification of travelers that show COVID-19 symptoms [5] . As the Romanian government collapsed on February 5th, 2020, public auctions were suspended and the confusion among population is very high combined with the political instability. As this unstable situation continues how will Romania cope with the spread of the COVID-19 by incoming travelers? Romania has 14 international (out of 16) airports that are highly connected with airports across all EU (in 2019, over 23 million passengers used these airports), including from countries where COVID-19 was already identified in the EU. The vulnerability is even higher considering the high potential of false-negative rate of diagnostic of COVID-19 that already has been documented [6] and the lack of personnel. As such, public awareness, widespread public health measures, and close collaboration with countries from which incoming travelers are arriving in Romania is a key to limit the spread of COVID-19 and promote the wellbeing of travelers and the members of the community (resident or diaspora).",57.62251229743505,22.607834681681002

The existence of a large health system such as AP-HP was helpful to recruit nurses and other HCWs from outside the hospital and to organise support between different hospitals when absenteeism was a problem. Vacations were put on hold and many HCWs did extra hours that the hospital and AP-HP management committed to pay. HCWs who developed COVID-19 were managed in the hospital if needed or as outpatients and were put on sick leave for at least 7 days and 2 days free of symptoms.

The Fangcang shelter hospitals, which can be rapidly established, 4, 5 can provide large numbers of hospital beds and appropriate care for patients who do not have severe or critical disease. 5, 6 Health workers at Fangcang shelter hospitals can transfer patients to higher-level hospitals for more complex treatment if their conditions worsen. 6 Fangcang shelter hospitals can also offer emotional and social support to help patients recover and thrive during an otherwise disruptive period in their lives. 6 In this report, we document the conception and dev elop ment of Fangcang shelter hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak in China, describe their key characteristics and essential functions, discuss critical issues for the success of Fangcang shelter hospitals, and consider applications of the concept as part of the COVID-19 public health response in other countries. on the city's medical system. 7 At the beginning of February, 2020, Wuhan had no beds available for COVID-19 patients in the hospitals designated for treating the virus. 8 Thousands of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 had to be sent home for isolation and observation. With a shortage of hospital beds, Wuhan needed an approach to rapidly and massively scale its capacity to isolate and care for patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. As the outbreak in Wuhan reached its most severe point, with thousands of new infections per day, the city opened three Fangcang shelter hospitals on Feb 5, 2020, by converting exhibition centres and stadiums. Over the following weeks, Wuhan opened an additional 13 Fangcang shelter hospitals. 9 Figure 1 shows the progression of bed capacity and occupancy of the Fangcang shelter hospitals over time. As the epidemic in Wuhan subsided and bed occupancy moved towards zero, the Fangcang shelter hospitals were successively suspended. The first hospital closed on March 1, 2020; by March 10, all Fangcang shelter hospitals had been suspended. 10, 11 Home isolation is an important alternative to hospital isolation, which requires behaviour change but no additional infrastructure investment. Chinese policy makers decided against home isolation of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 for a number of important reasons. 12, 13 First, home isolation puts patients' family members at risk. Early epidemiological evidence in China showed that more than half of all patients with COVID-19 had at least one family member with the disease, and 75-80% of all clustered infections were within families, suggesting high rates of intrafamily transmission. [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] Second, patients can find home isolation psychologically taxing, because they know that they are putting those they care about most at risk of contracting the disease. 19, 20 Third, home isolation is unlikely to be fully effective because it cannot be strictly enforced. Patients might break with the mandated behaviour to stay at home and go outside for errands, entertainment, or exercise. Lastly, it is difficult to organise medical care, frequent monitoring of disease progression, and timely referral to hospital care for thousands of patients in home isolation. 21 COVID-19 can deteriorate from mild or moderate to severe illness, requiring rapid referral to hospital care. [16] [17] [18] In home isolation in Wuhan, before the introduction of the Fangcang shelter hospitals, the time from onset of severe symptoms to admission to a tertiary hospital for intensive care was up to 10 days. 8, 22 The Fangcang shelter hospitals substantially reduced these delays.",45.73545714126677,19.92792613275178

The built over a period of 3 weeks contained 13 000 hospitals beds (figure 4). By March 10, 2020, the 16 hospitals had provided care to about 12 000 patients. 34 In caring for and sheltering such a large number of patients who would otherwise have been confined to their homes, these shelter hospitals effectively supported China's COVID-19 policy of leaving no patient unattended or untreated. 35 The third characteristic is the low cost of building and running Fangcang shelter hospitals. Investment costs are low because converting public venues into health-care facilities avoids costly construction of new physical infrastructure. Equally, once the epidemic has subsided, the structures can be returned to their original purposes, avoiding long-term, inefficient use of space, which is a particularly important consideration in a densely populated city. Running costs are low because Fangcang shelter hospitals require fewer doctors and nurses than traditional hospitals. 36 The low health worker-to-patient ratio is for two reasons: first, all patients in the hospital share the same primary admission diagnosis, reducing the complexity of care, and second, all patients have only mild to moderate disease. 9,37 By isolating and treating only mild to moderate cases, Fangcang shelter hospitals in Wuhan freed up the scarce medical infra structure of higher-level hospitals, such as the inpatient units providing respiratory support and intensive care, for patients with severe to critical COVID-19 and other patients requiring critical or complex care. More than 90% of severe cases in Hubei province were in Wuhan, 38 and the bed vacancy rate in the traditional hospitals designated for the care of patients with COVID-19 increased from 4% on Feb 4, 2020 (before the first Fangcang shelter hospitals had opened) to 16% on Feb 22, when 16 Fangcang shelter hospitals had started admitting patients. 38 The Fangcang shelter hospitals improved the distribution of patients with COVID-19 according to the severity of their symptoms, increasing the overall efficiency of care. Figure 3 summarises the functions of Fangcang shelter hospitals. The first essential function is isolation. Before the construction of the hospitals, thousands of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 in Wuhan had to be sent home for isolation. Patients with mild to moderate symptoms are generally more active than the severely ill and thus in greater contact with others, increasing the possibility of transmission and placing family and community members at risk. 39 The Fangcang shelter hospitals isolated COVID-19 patients more effectively from their communities than home isolation.",47.70060943195193,19.735240859986735

We have established a ""double triage"" protocol; our goals were ensuring the continuity of care and to protect the health care professionals from the infection. The first triage is a telephone interview, performed by a dedicated nurse the day before the scheduled home visit.

Liver injury is estimated to occur in up to 20-30% of patients at the time of diagnosis with SARS-CoV-2 infection. 14 Severe hepatitis has been reported but liver failure appears to be rare. 39 The pattern of liver injury appears to be predominantly hepatocellular, and the etiology remains uncertain but may represent a secondary effect of the systemic inflammatory response observed with COVID-19 disease, although direct viral infection and drug-induced liver injury cannot be excluded. One study of liver biopsy specimens obtained from a patient with COVID-19 disease revealed microvesicular steatosis and mild lobular and portal activity, suggestive of either SARS-CoV-2 infection or drug-induced liver injury. 41 Abnormal liver enzymes may be observed in both adults and children with COVID-19, 42 and do not appear to be a major predictor of clinical outcomes. 15 Early studies have multiple methodologic limitations, with variable laboratory thresholds, limited longitudinal assessment of liver enzymes, heterogeneous evaluation for alternative etiologies, and limited information regarding baseline liver diseases and confounding variables. Additional studies are needed to further characterize the unique clinical considerations for SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with chronic liver disease and/or cirrhosis, 43 although preliminary guidance has been provided by the AASLD on March 23, 2020. 44 What are the potential risks to health care workers performing endoscopy? SARS-CoV-2 is presumed to spread primarily via respiratory droplets from talking, coughing, sneezing, and close contact with symptomatic individuals. However humanto-human transmission can occur from unknown infected persons (e.g. asymptomatic carriers or individuals with mild symptoms) as well as individuals with virus shedding during the pre-incubation period before symptoms develop. 45 Data related to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the early phase of the pandemic have confirmed that health care professionals are at higher risk of infection than the general population. The WHO and Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) reported infection of 2055 health care workers as of February 20, 2020 during the index outbreak in Hubei Province, with health care workers facing a rate of infection approximately three times the general population. 46 This prompted the Chinese Department of Health Reform to deploy more than 40,000 additional health-care workers to the region, preserve personal protective equipment (PPE), and implement surveillance measures and quarantine protocols. 46 Such measures appear to have slowed the spread to health care workers, with recent cases primarily attributable to household contacts rather than occupational exposure. Similar trends have been observed in Europe, with an estimated 20% of COVID-19 infections in Italy occurring in health care workers. 47 Preliminary reports in the US also suggest that health care workers are at risk of nosocomial infections, including infection of 20 health care workers among the first 67 COVID-19 positive individuals in Philadelphia, and additional health care workers cases in WA, NY, and MA. 48, 49, 50 The spread of disease via health care workers is concerning for several reasons: a) appropriate PPE may not be utilized effectively, especially when COVID-19 patients cannot be identified quickly, b) shortage of health care workers due to infection and/or quarantine, and c) the concern of the role of infected health care workers to act as a vector for transmission to patients.",42.79286655093204,19.23087155130247

WHO and international partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) worked with the Ministry of Health in Angola to conduct an investigation and public health response to the outbreak. Outbreak-control efforts were directed at providing technical support for case management, strengthening infection control in hospitals, improving surveillance and contact tracing, and educating residents about the disease and its mode or transmission. As part of a public health response, in addition to posting information for travelers, the CDC sent personnel to join the WHO-coordinated GOARN response team. The CDC representatives assisted with epidemiologic investigation, infection control, and laboratory diagnosis. The CDC also provided laboratory and other scientific and logistical support. 15 In most Western countries, MHF is a reportable or notifiable disease. Cases or outbreaks also should be reported to the WHO. The virus is a hazard category 4 virus and should be handled in a containment level 4 laboratory. Strict isolation and barrier nursing are recommended, and the handling of biological specimens for diagnosis and patient management should be performed according to regulations governing risk assessment and control. Case contacts or individuals with exposure in laboratories should be placed under health surveillance for 21 days after their last exposure to infection. If they should become feverish, they should undergo risk assessment and perhaps be admitted to strict isolation pending the results of diagnostic tests. 5 In conjunction with the WHO, the CDC has developed guidelines entitled ""Infection Control for Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers in the African Health Care Setting.""

Second, a systematic review from Tran et al revealed an increased risk of viral transmission in health care workers performing aerosol-generating procedures (mostly bronchoscopy or tracheal intubation). 59 (Supplemental Figure 3 ). Zamora and colleagues investigated the amount of contamination on the neck and face from individuals using a PAPR mask (in combination with N95) compared with a N95 mask alone 60 ; Individuals who used the PAPR-based strategy experienced a lower risk of face and neck contamination compared to N95 mask alone (RR = 0.08; 95% CI: 0.03-0.19).

As people are trying to avoid transmission of the virus, social support structures are breaking apart; places like churches, schools, and workplaces have been shut down, which eliminates the benefits of social support and may cause feelings of isolation and vulnerability. Furthermore, there is a high chance of the disease itself being stigmatized, as it is new and incurable.7 Most stigmatization targets are patients or specific groups of people (i.e., People with specific religion in south Korea or Asians in COVID-19 and SARS outbreaks, and West Africans in Ebola outbreaks). The targeted people are often removed from their social support system, which can lead to isolation and mental health problems. More importantly, stigmatization can drive potential patients to avoid accessing the healthcare system, and instead, continuing to spread infection over worries of being shunned by others.

Firstly, rapid urbanisation and industrialisation and changing patterns of interactions between people and pathogens have altered the pattern of infectious diseases,15 a feature of the covid-2019 outbreak. Geographical disparities raise questions around access to healthcare, other medical and educational resources, public health programmes, and infrastructure in rural and remote areas. Not surprisingly, the western regions of China with poor resources and a special geographical environment and culture face a burden from multiple infectious diseases, with Qinghai, Tibet, and Xinjiang having higher incidence of vaccine preventable diseases, bacterial infections, and sexually transmitted diseases and bloodborne infections. However, the epidemiological characteristics of infectious diseases are also affected by densely populated urban regions,55 which might contribute to higher rates of sexually transmitted diseases and viral gastrointestinal infections, at least in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai. Different factors apply in rural and remote areas, where livestock based lifestyles increase the risk of zoonotic infections and where climate might be an additional factor, particularly for vectorborne diseases. Seasonal variation in infectious diseases, with the example of peaks of influenza and rubella, measles, and scarlet fever in winter and spring suggests the high vulnerability of Chinese children to infections transmitted by aerosol droplets. Furthermore, the rapid increase in HIV/AIDS, especially in adolescent males, requires a much wider set of social and educational responses than for less sensitive behaviours and stigmatised diseases. The resurgence of some diseases that were previously under control (eg, scarlet fever, mumps, syphilis, and brucellosis) and imported cases (eg, Zika virus infection, Rift Valley fever, yellow fever, and Ebola) have put greater pressure on the public health system, as has been seen with the current covid-2019 outbreak that began in Hubei province, China. Although in most cases of covid-19, mortality appears to be higher in older people,10 although the immediate impact of this on children and adolescents is nonetheless immense. A global pandemic of covid-19 could bring about multiple impacts, such as economic recession, food crisis, price fluctuations, constraints on resources, which will have immediate or indirect negative effects on children in the near or long term. In addition, the exact impact has not yet been determined in further studies, but there could be physical and psychological effects on children who have been deprived of concentrated effort of care as a result of the guardian’s illness, which need further studies post-covid-19.",45.58069755052953,18.84763421312372

Gostin et al. [9] argued that it becomes essential to develop a set of legal and ethical recommendations, especially when scientific evidence is not enough and public health action is urgently required as in the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). During the MERS outbreak in Korea, difficult choices between public health needs and the protection of individual rights, which include privacy, liberty, and freedom of movement, had to be made. Gostin et al. [9] proposed four ethical values: the precautionary principle, the least restrictive option, fairness, and transparency in decision making. It is unclear that these values were fully considered in the public health actions that were taken during the MERS outbreak in Korea. The Korean government strictly restricted the movement of 16 752 individuals who satisfied the operational definition of “close contacts with a MERS patient” within designated hospitals or their homes for the maximum incubation period regardless of whether they displayed MERS symptoms [1]. According to the WHO, there is no evidence that MERS can be transmitted before symptom development or in early symptomatic stages. Therefore the WHO does not recommend quarantine nor isolation of asymptomatic contacts during this period [10]. The urgent social demand for controlling the MERS outbreak overwhelmed the issue of legitimacy of the public health interventions taken by the government. Economic issues have also been raised regarding this restriction of movement. In this situation, the people who undertake the costs incurred by movement restriction are not the same people who benefit. In principle, if those who benefited were to compensate those who were made worse off, the outcome could have been considered an improvement (known as a “Kaldor–Hicks improvement”) [11]. For effective and fair implementation of public health measures against MERS or other transmissible infectious diseases that compromise individual rights, a reasonable compensation scheme for the victims, including for health care providers, should be designed to benefit those individuals and society overall.",42.507986282848535,20.323120800097907

An important question regarding the possible dual use of synthetic biology is a rather pragmatic one: why take the long and complex way of synthesizing a biological weapon, if in practice there are many more and easier ways to reach the same result? This is confirmed by the American biologist Drew Endy. He estimates the risks for the short and medium term very low. “From a security perspective, many people are concerned that it is now possible to directly construct harmful pathogens from DNA sequence information. This seems to me a real but remote possibility, and is likely best addressed by improvements in our capacity to respond to emerging infectious diseases, natural or otherwise, and to our public health systems.

In 2010, the Ministry of Health and Welfare pushed for a law amendment to allow the practice of telemedicine between healthcare providers and patients, but it failed due to delays caused by opposition from concerned organizations. At that time, the government's consideration was focused on the economic aspects rather than people's health.

[2, 3] The outbreak of virus coincided with China's Spring Festival travel peak, and to curb the spread of the disease, the Chinese government launched unprecedented public health intervention measures, such as shutting down Wuhan transportation, extending the legal holiday, mass isolation, strict enforcement of quarantine of all contacts, and canceling all public gatherings and health public to abide by hygienic practices. To reduce the flow of people, the health monitoring of returning residents has been conducted at the nationwide level. As of 16:00 clock on February 28, Dr. Wan'nian Liang, chief of the National Health Commission's institutional reform department and head of the Chinese expert panel, said: The virus outbreak in Wuhan is curbed basic.
