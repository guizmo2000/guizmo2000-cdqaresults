These studies were initially framed by the DTRA science leads, ministerial heads of Kazakhstan and subsequently the contractors developed a country science plan reflective of these leaders' needs, which detailed the projects and studies, participating institutes, research collaborators, and stakeholders. Often the country plan described what studies would be implemented rather than describing an overall research strategy. Through the implementation of the CBR projects and studies, project outputs included developing abstracts and presentation of results, documenting progress in routine reports, and authoring peer-reviewed publications. In addition, outputs related to optimizing scientific methods were used to inform and revise standard operating procedures for infectious disease surveillance. While the primary BTRP objective is related to US national security by reducing global health security threats by working with partner countries, CBR enables those partner countries to focus on broader capacity-building for biosurveillance and enhancing BS&S [11] . These capabilities include priorities for biosurveillance and pathogen research based on the US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Select Agents list plus those pathogens of pandemic concern that include emerging infectious diseases; and promote hypothesis-based research projects. Earlier BTRP work in Kazakhstan and other FSU republics was implemented in a top-down fashion, through ministries and related state institutes such as public and veterinary health, which have disease surveillance responsibilities similar to the AP system. The list of participating institutes in Kazakhstan has grown along with the number of projects and studies (Table 1) since the BTRP program started, which is a positive aspect of the program. The objectives for the three lines of BTRP's work BS&S, BSV, and CBR are often achieved in consensus for capacity-building which is traditionally associated with international development, but are inherently difficult to measure. A major accomplishment of DTRA BTRP funding has been building research networks to better implement the CBR program in Kazakhstan, which can be measured in simple metrics such as conference presentations and peer-reviewed publications, both in the English language, and outcomes such as results from testing suspect samples and operational enhancements. The cooperation between Kazakhstan and the US continues to show intent for reducing biological threats and the CBR program has also increased cooperation among institutes in Kazakhstan that often did not previously communicate their respective infectious disease surveillance results.

This problem is particularly severe in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries because of shortages in certain medical disciplines, due to a lack of nationallytrained professionals and a less developed educational system compared to other high income countries. Consequently, GCC countries are heavily dependent on an expatriate health care workforce; a problem exacerbated by high turnover. We discuss challenges and potential strategies for improving and strengthening capacity building efforts in health care professions in the GCC. Main text: In the GCC, there are 139 schools providing professional health education in medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, nursing, midwifery, and other specialties. Health education school density reported for the GCC countries ranges between 2.2 and 2.8 schools per one million inhabitants, except in Oman where it is 4.0 per one million inhabitants. The GCC countries rely heavily on expatriate health professionals. The number of physicians and nurses in the GCC countries are 2.1 and 4.5 per 1000 respectively, compared to 2.8 and 7.9 among member countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Interestingly, the number of dentists and pharmacists is higher in the GCC countries compared to OECD countries. A nationally trained health care workforce is essential for the GCC countries. Physiotherapy and occupational therapy are two identified areas where growth and development are recommended. Custom-tailored continuing medical education and continuing professional development (CPD) programs can augment the skills of health practitioners, and allow for the expansion of their scope of practice when warranted. Conclusion: Capacity building can play an essential role in addressing the major health challenges and improving the overall quality of health care in the region. Efforts aimed at increasing the number of locally-trained graduates and developing and implementing need-based CPD programs are vital for capacity building and lifelong learning in health care professions.",31.57159584126301,16.374967587754128

A substantial proportion of the GCC countries' population aged over 15 years are non-nationals, reaching over 80% in Qatar and the UAE [8] . Qatar's capital, Doha, is recognized as hosting speakers of 190 languages [9] . Non-nationals constitute a majority of both the population and health care professionals in these countries [7, 48] . Health professions educational programs such as nursing, should continue to focus on issues surrounding provision of culturally sensitive healthcare. A study including nursing students from Saudi Arabia and Oman demonstrated how undertrained students are in cultural competence [49] . Capacity building efforts in cultural competence are underway in the region to improve interaction between patients and health care providers and amongst health care staff who do not originate from the same culture [9] . In Qatar, to address the cultural and linguistic challenges due to the diverse patient population, WCM-Q developed the Center for Cultural Competence in Health Care, which provides education in medical interpretation and cultural competence [9] . Financial support and public health decisions are required to scale-up medical interpreters' recruitment in all health care centers and to make cultural competence programs mandatory for all health care professionals who serve diverse populations. Evidence for strengthening healthcare capacity by developing links to organizations outside the GCC In this section, we demonstrate that developing links between organizations located in the GCC countries and those located in non-GCC countries has been a great opportunity to strengthen health care capacity. There are several types of international educational partnerships between various institutions in the GCC and non-GCC countries that already exist and involve capacity building (Table 4 ). Partnerships include international scholarships, premedical programs for undergraduate students, partial institutional link at a program level, consulting agreement between two institutions, establishment of new completely affiliated medical school in a recipient country, and physician exchange programs at institutional level; each has its strengths and weaknesses [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] . An example of one global partnership is the health care training facility WCM-Q, founded in 2001 and affiliated with the well-established and respected Weill Cornell Medicine in New York.

Today, approximately 75% of newly emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are zoonoses that result from various anthropogenic, genetic, ecologic, socioeconomic, and climatic factors. These interrelated driving forces make it difficult to predict and to prevent zoonotic EIDs. Although significant improvements in environmental and medical surveillance, clinical diagnostic methods, and medical practices have been achieved in the recent years, zoonotic EIDs remain a major global concern, and such threats are expanding, especially in less developed regions. The current Ebola epidemic in West Africa is an extreme stark reminder of the role animal reservoirs play in public health and reinforces the urgent need for globally operationalizing a One Health approach. The complex nature of zoonotic diseases and the limited resources in developing countries are a reminder that the need for implementation of Global One Health in lowresource settings is crucial.

Efforts have been incorporated in the principles of the tripartite initiative among intergovernmental organizations, with the FAO, WHO, and OIE to jointly pursue the One Health approach, working in close collaboration with research institutions, academia, intergovernmental organizations, the private sector, nongovernmental organizations, civil societies, and other stakeholders. An adequate surveillance system, including a strong laboratory network, is a key component of any meaningful prevention and control of zoonotic diseases. In order to develop an effective One Health implementation plan for strengthening capacity at national, regional, or global levels, there needs to be reexamination of how existing systems are structured, resourced, and managed. Such analyses will enable the development and sustainability of synergies among the human health, animal health, and ecosystem sectors [21] . Many of the studies presented at the ICOPHAI session on capacity building and One Health metaleadership were related to risk management and surveillance systems with specific insights and recommendations for operationalizing One Health. Inherent to overall surveillance is improved practice applying environmental monitoring methods to better characterize sources and profiles of environmental contaminants and pathways (i.e., air, food, and water) and modes (i.e., inhalation and ingestion) of both human and animal exposures to pathogenic agents.

Even when publicly funded, patented inventions may not be easily accessible by other researchers or for use in disease-endemic countries. There may be even less incentive to share when such inventions are proprietary and privately funded. However, especially in the neglected disease space, both tiering and pooling arrangements have afforded greater access to needed research inputs. By tiering, preferential discounts or even royalty-free access to research inputs is provided, often bounded by field of use or geography. For AIDS drugs and many vaccines, tiered pricing arrangements offer price breaks to resource-limited countries. Further upstream, many neglected disease projects benefit from tiered licensing arrangements, whereby access to compounds otherwise inaccessible due to their proprietary nature is provided. The R&D pathway for repurposing existing drugs can be shortened considerably when such access is coupled with pre-clinical and even clinical data on these compounds.

This article reviews how Taiwan strengthened the core capacities at the Taoyuan International Airport (TIA) and the Port of Kaohsiung (PoK) by applying a new, practicable model. Design: An IHR PoE program was initiated for implementing the IHR core capacities at designated PoEs. The main methods of this program were 1) identifying the designated PoEs according to the pre-determined criteria, 2) identifying the competent authority for each health measure, 3) building a close collaborative relationship between stakeholders from the central and PoE level, 4) designing three stages of systematic assessment using the assessment tool published by the World Health Organization (WHO), and 5) undertaking action plans targeting the gaps identified by the assessments. Results: Results of the self-assessment, preliminary external assessment, and follow-up external assessment revealed a continuous progressive trend at the TIA (86, 91, and 100%, respectively), and at the PoK (77, 97, and 99.9%, respectively). The results of the follow-up external assessment indicated that both these designated PoEs already conformed to the IHR requirements. These achievements were highly associated with strong collaboration, continuous empowerment, efficient resource integration, and sustained commitments. Conclusions: Considering that many countries had requested for an extension on the deadline to fulfill the IHR 2005 core capacity requirements, Taiwan's experiences can be a source of learning for countries striving to fully implement these requirements. Further, in order to broaden the scope of public health protection into promoting global security, Taiwan will keep its commitments on multisectoral cooperation, human resource capacity building, and maintaining routine and emergency capacities.",20.08857493106301,8.375410275919451

The Saudi government's health sector expansion also includes research and development (R&D) capacity building. For example, Saudi Arabia intends to build a national center for vaccine and biologic research and development within King Saud University (KSU) in Riyadh. KSU is a leading university in healthcare research, and in order to support establishing this center, it signed an agreement with the Texas Children's Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, focusing on education and training and to support the transfer of technology to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This collaboration will help to train Saudi scientists at various steps of vaccine development and help to establish a parallel vaccine facility in Saudi Arabia. The ultimate goal for the Saudi's national center for vaccine and biologic research and development is to help in the research and development of vaccine candidates against local and regional infectious diseases, including major NTDs in the region. Furthermore, the Saudi Ministry of Energy, Industry, and Mineral Resources is sponsoring a new Saudi Vaccine and Biopharmaceutical Center funded by the King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST, the major funding agency for R&D in Saudi) and operated by SaudiVax and PnuVax, applying the concept of government-owned, contractor-operated model (GOCO). The center will have the capacity to scale up cell-based vaccines up to 2,000 L under good manufacturing practice (GMP) guidelines with approval from the Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA). The idea of the center is to support moving early discoveries from the bench to the market, especially those with low global market value and so week incentives for large multinationals to support.

Researchers have also highlighted the impact of farming practices, population movement and China' s economic progress on control of this disease (44) . In the 1950s, hundreds of millions in 12 southern provinces were at risk of this disease, and around 2% of China' s population was infected (45, 46) . Early control efforts focused on transmission control, especially by early mass mobilization of people to alter snail habitats (45) . With the introduction of praziquantel in the early 1980s (47) the focus changed to morbidity control, and mass treatment funded by a World Bank loan and other activities from 1992-2000 (45) . In each case the observed reduction in infection numbers was at risk when priority and funding for control programs declined (46) . After completion of the World Bank project, case numbers rose again in certain areas (48) ; the concentration of cases in poor rural areas and the lack of funding for preventive health care in general led to diminished control efforts, leading national health authorities to rate schistosomiasis control, tuberculosis, hepatitis B and HIV as equally critical priorities, in contrast to its status as a neglected tropical disease in other nations (49) . Schistosomiasis persists in seven provinces, in a much smaller area of the upper and lower Yangtze River catchment and particularly in villages whose population totals around three million people (41) . National funding was required to kick-start new control efforts including periodic mass chemotherapy, reduction of infection sources (animal management, mechanization of farming, water supply and sanitation measures) and public education, supported by a 2004-2015 government-funded vertical project (49) (50) (51) . Based on infection rates among the population and cattle in the affected areas, this is apparently the most successful combination of activities yet, and the screening program being undertaken has also demonstrated an impact on rates of infection with the soil-transmitted helminths Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiuria, probably as a result of the sanitation and public education components (51).",15.912684779371169,11.885877107930057

If the outbreak turns into a pandemic, specialised laboratories' efforts would refocus to reference activities like confirmatory testing, laboratory surveillance including virus characterisation, provision of reference materials and advice, while general testing for 2019-nCoV would shift to first-line hospital laboratories that currently do not have this capacity.

The United States (U.S.) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), under the auspices of its WHO Collaborating Center for Influenza, is one of the major public health agencies which provides support globally to build national capacity for influenza surveillance. Our main objective was to determine if laboratory assessments supported capacity building efforts for improved global influenza surveillance. Methods: In 2010, 35 national influenza laboratories were assessed in 34 countries, using a standardized tool. Post-assessment, each laboratory received a report with a list of recommendations for improvement. Uptake of recommendations were reviewed 3.2 mean years after the initial assessments and categorized as complete, in-progress, no action or no update. This was a retrospective study; follow-up took place through routine project management rather than at a set time-point post-assessment. WHO data on National Influenza Centre (NIC) designation, External Quality Assessment Project (EQAP) participation and FluNet reporting was used to measure laboratory capacity longitudinally and independently of the assessments. All data was further stratified by World Bank country income category. Results: At follow-up, 81 % of 614 recommendations were either complete (350) or in-progress (145) for 32 laboratories (91 % response rate). The number of countries reporting to FluNet and the number of specimens they reported annually increased between 2005, when they were first funded by CDC, and 2010, the assessment year (p < 0.01). Improvements were also seen in EQAP participation and NIC designation over time and more so for low and lower-middle income countries. Conclusions: Assessments using a standardized tool have been beneficial to improving laboratory-based influenza surveillance. Specific recommendations helped countries identify and prioritize areas for improvement. Data from assessments helped CDC focus its technical assistance by country and region. Low and lower-middle income countries made greater improvements in their laboratories compared with upper-middle income countries. Future research could include an analysis of annual funding and technical assistance by country.

The needs of the society must be addressed for vacant public buildings conversion [60] . Complying with the tendency of declining birth rates and rapidly aging populations, the Taiwan government has actively proposed building reuse policies with respect to converting vacant public school buildings to other public facilities, such as community hospitals, in these years [61] . Middle schools in Taiwan, for example, are usually located within communities, and reusing these school buildings as they become vacant by converting them to public community hospitals is more convenient for elders and children who need more frequent general health examinations and medical treatments. Some classrooms in schools can be easily converted to medical consultation rooms and the others can be used for public medical education and service without demolition.

Second, an optimization mechanism adopting GAA* is developed to optimize renovation strategies within several constraints. Finally, a simulated vacant school building converting to a public community hospital renovation project is introduced to validate the proposed system. The solutions suggested by the system are shown to be superior to the results from the project decided by the hospital managers, not only in budget utilization, but also of quality improvement. In this study, reusing and renovating vacant buildings can not only be helpful to reduce energy consumption within the buildings, but also be friendly to the environment and beneficial to nearby communities. Although the proposed system demonstrated its robustness and efficiency for decision-making, the system still had certain limitations. First, the system is developed for hospital managers, and most of them are non-experts in architecture/engineering/construction fields; providing a simplified method for current condition assessment and restoration actions is necessary. This simplified process, however, might cause the system to be incomprehensive. Second, the system was only tested by hospital buildings; although the data modules and interfaces of the system provide managers with great flexibility to clarify, modify, and customize the assessment criteria and renovation strategies to apply to different building types, future efforts to examine its feasibility on different building projects are highly suggested. Third, the system paid more attention to environmental sustainability issues, renovation actions resulted from functionally spatial adjustment were not considered. Finally, only general specification of materials, resources and equipment for hospital buildings were included in the system; future research could continuously expand practical or specific data to establish a more integrated decision support system.",16.94432117448909,10.702289850188613

China now has the world's largest plantation area (approx. 800 000 km 2 (approximately the size of Mozambique, Ahrends et al., 2017) . At the same time, China is trying to reduce pressures on natural forests through strict bans on logging in primary forests and a massive expansion of its forest reserves to a current total more than 2 500 reserves covering 1.6 million km 2 (this area includes 17.1% of the country, which is approximately the size of Iran or twice the state of Texas). Lastly, over the last two decades there has been a large movement of people from rural areas (i.e., next to the reserves where China's primates are found) to the cities. In fact, the urbanization rate rose from 17.9 to 52.6% between1978 and 2012 and currently more than half of China's population live in cities (Deng et al., 2015) .",21.33128321703905,12.502916022020797

Much of the prior resilience research has been conducted in the context of disasters and other traumatic events. This work has yielded some consensus around the factors that make a resilience approach unique from traditional emergency preparedness. Namely, resilience is more broadly defined, focuses on the whole community, is relationship based (vs. plan-based), and places relatively more emphasis on population strengths (vs. vulnerabilities), organizational assets (resources, money, skills, relationships), and sustainable development. Also, while preparedness has typically been phased (preparedness-response-recovery) or episodic, resilience as previously defined is an ongoing capacity building [6, [8] [9] [10] .

Public education measures and behavioral changes prompted by the SARS outbreak may have contributed to the ensuing decline in excess P&I mortality in Taiwan and other SARS-affected countries/areas [29, 31] . Although our observation periods were not long, the evidence suggests that the SARS outbreak not only spurred behavioral change among Taiwanese citizens [32] but also prompted government officials to reform the infectious disease surveillance system [33] as well as policies for hospital management [34] and infection control [35] in Taiwan These changes, in combination with increasing awareness of infectious diseases among physicians, may have contributed to the sustained post-SARS effect that we propose had a significant impact on Taiwan's elderly P&I mortality rates. Three studies in Taiwan [36] , in Wuhan City of Hubei Province in mainland China [30] and in Hong Kong [31] support the claim that public health efforts were sustained after the SARS epidemic. Interestingly, influenzaassociated mortalities in Taiwan, southern China and Hong Kong in the post-SARS period were all lower than in the pre-SARS period (personal communication in the March 15-19, 2010 MISMS Oceania Regional Influenza Meeting and Workshop in Melbourne, Australia). Moreover, many public health measures taken in response to SARS-including advising sick students to stay at home, teaching coughing etiquette, providing hand-cleaning facilities in front of elevators and at building entrances, closing classes if more than three influenza-like illnesses occur in one class, and vaccinating high-risk populations-all had been applied during the 2009 influenza H1N1 pandemic. The effectiveness of these public health efforts is supported by the lower total number of P&I mortalities observed during the 2009-2010 winter season (ending February 26, 2010) than in previous years [37] . In addition, we found that people had a greater understanding of health protection measures during the 2009-10 pandemic influenza in SARS-affected areas/countries such as Taiwan and Hong Kong [38] . This protective effect may have contributed to the lower numbers of P&I deaths in 2009-10 compared to seasonal influenza in 2008-2009 and to the reduction in total laboratory-confirmed pandemic influenza H1N1 deaths in Taiwan (42 deaths from July 1, 2009 to May 8, 2010)) and Hong Kong (80 deaths from July 17, 2009 to April 15, 2010) [39] .",16.05577849807983,10.550127695122619

A full discussion of these agreements is beyond the scope of this paper and the interested reader is referred to Bakanidze et al. (2010) for additional information.

The BWC, which has 170 States Parties, entered into force in 1975 (http://www.unog.ch/bwc). The BWC States Parties hold Review Conferences every 5 years in an effort to enhance compliance. At the 2008 BWC meeting of States Parties, it was stated that ""biosafety and biosecurity measures contribute to preventing the development, acquisition, or use of biological and toxin weapons and are appropriate means of implementing the BWC"" and also that ""pursuing biosafety and biosecurity measures could also contribute to the fulfillment of other respective international obligations and agreements, such as the revised IHR of the WHO."" UNSCR 1540 was adopted unanimously on April 28, 2004 and established for the first time legally binding obligations on all UN Member States to ""develop and enforce effective measures against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD),"" which includes biological weapons (UN Security Council, 2004) . UNSCR 1540 also recognizes that non-state proliferation is a threat to the peace under the terms of Chapter VII of the UN Charter and requires every UN Member State to criminalize various forms of non-state actor involvement in WMD and its related activities in its domestic legislation and to enforce such legislation. An ad hoc committee (known as the 1540 Committee) was involved in the implementation of this resolution. As part of its mission, it developed matrices to be used as tools to help UN Member States implement the resolution.

Changes in how scientists conduct research on biological select agents and toxins (BSATs) have occurred not only in the United States (U.S.) but internationally as well. It has been influenced by a number of terrorist events, which have increased national and international awareness of the threat of terrorism (including bioterrorism) such as the unsuccessful anthrax attack in Kameido, Tokyo in 1993 (Kaplan, 2000; Takahashi et al., 2004; Danzig et al., 2011) and the release of the nerve agent sarin in the subway system of Tokyo in 1995 by the Aum Shinrikyo (Olsen, 1999; Kaplan, 2000; Danzig et al., 2011) ; the bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995 (Smoak and Geiling, 2004) ; the terrorist attacks using commercial airlines on September 11, 2001 (Smoak and Geiling, 2004) ; and the 2001 anthrax attacks in the U.S. (Cole, 2003) . In an effort to control the misuse of these dangerous pathogens and toxins by those wishing to do harm, the U.S. passed legislation and promulgated regulations designed to limit unauthorized access to these agents. Following the implementation of these regulations, Casadevall and Relman (2010) proposed that the policies may have the unintended consequence of hindering necessary research on countermeasures and potentially increasing societal vulnerability to biological attacks and natural epidemics. The international community has responded in a variety of ways to the threat of bioterrorism, which provides additional perspectives on the impact of policy solutions in this area. For example, several countries have developed and implemented laboratory biosecurity legislation to regulate possession, use and access to biological agents while other countries use existing biosafety legislation for pathogen security.

The National Strategy for Countering Biological Threats (National Security Council, 2009) seeks to facilitate a ""culture of responsibility"" through engaging the global life sciences community, encouraging: (1) sustained dialog on the development of behavioral norms; (2) the development of a code of ethics; (3) the development of training materials; and (4) efforts to explore community-based approaches www.frontiersin.org for identifying and addressing irresponsible conduct. Codes of conduct for the global sciences community are widespread. Many apply to the individual (e.g., professional oaths and codes of ethics) and workplace (e.g., recombinant DNA guidelines). Most are voluntary, have minimal penalties and/or no mechanism for ensuring compliance, and primarily rely on the ethical behavior of the individual. The scientific community is best served by a balanced approach between voluntary codes of conduct and regulations/laws that protect society from the misuse of BSATs, while not hindering legitimate biological research.

The total synthesis of a viral genome and recovery of infectious viruses (Cello et al., 2002) , enhancing the virulence of a minimally virulent nonselect agent virus (Rosengard et al., 2002) , and the creation of a bacterial cell controlled by a chemically synthesized genome (Gibson et al., 2010) are examples of technological advances that could be used to circumvent the regulations.

Contribution rate can improve the understanding of the causes of inequality in the allocation of PHWs. From the perspective of inequality decomposition, we found that PHWs in China were unevenly distributed across geographical areas, including regions, provinces, and municipalities. The contribution of within-region inequality has an overwhelming superiority, although there are differences between regions in terms of comparative analysis of data concerning basic characteristics. This suggests that the imbalance of PHWs is internal to each region, including all three categories of PHWs. Further, the contribution of inequality within-province also has significant weight, suggesting that although provinces are smaller geographical partitions than regions, the PHW inequities are greater within each province. This supports the results of the decomposition by describing the density of PHW. For the density of provinces, the difference between the averages of PHWs was smaller than the difference between the maximum density and the minimum density of counties within each province, and the difference within provinces was greater than that between provinces. The subsequent decomposition of intercounty inequality by municipality also supports this point. The overall decomposition of inter-county inequality (by municipality) shows that staff and health professionals have a similar proportion of withinmunicipal and between-municipal inequality. However, the results of the decomposition of inter-county inequality by municipality of 31 provinces indicates that withinmunicipality inequalities still cause the municipal inequality of most provinces. This suggests that the government, especially at the municipal level, should focus on eliminating PHW inequalities between counties within their jurisdictions. The finance and human resources departments of the government should introduce various incentive policies, such as signing contracts with medical colleges to train medical students to serve at the basic level or improving the salary level of basic public health workers, in order to attract more talents to county-level CDCs with weak human resource allocation. The regression analysis revealed the contextual factors affecting the geographical distribution of PHWs, which included living environment, working conditions, personal development, and children's education. For the first time, large-scale and representative data sets were used to measure the role of these factors in explaining the inequality of PHW distribution in China. Agency building area per employee caused between-municipality and within-municipality inequalities for all three categories of PHWs. Per capita GDP had a similar effect, except for between-municipality inequality of professionals and within-municipality inequality of field epidemiological investigators. Therefore, our results reveal that the key incentives for the unequal distribution of PHWs among municipalities are the level of infrastructure construction of institutions and the level of economic development of residential areas. A good level of infrastructure construction means that PHWs can have a better and more spacious working environment, which may be an aspect that PHWs pay more attention to. The level of economic development in the residential area is equally important, because it means that the local development can provide a better living environment and facilities for themselves and their family.",12.840791508305955,5.408743481995772

Ministries of health have complex relationships with both the companies that have access to personal data and with the public. They face many competing health priorities and complex political choices when it comes to open sharing of epidemiological data. Disease control programmes are often hampered by limited capacity and high turnover of personnel, and health workers on the ground during an epidemic have their hands full responding to the immediate crisis and might not be trained or incentivised to report epidemiological data accurately.

Consequently, much of the work in this area is accessible only through preliminary (and often unpublished) reports at conferences and therefore unavailable for use by nursing faculty, policy makers, decision makers, and researchers. Fundamental to a comprehensive and effective national training plan for nurses and other health care professionals is consensus about the operational definitions of emergency preparedness. Heightened understanding of all the components of emergency preparedness education ensures that the range of preincident actions and processes are: standardized and consistent with mutually agreed upon doctrine and measurable, resulting in integrated emergency preparedness education. Additionally, there should be training exercises incorporating nationally formulated core competencies across all responder/receiver roles.

to minimize obstruction to wind flow at the ground level to enhance wind circulation at the pedestrian level,0.24932026516239003,2.881091356277466,4.241929531097412,bc7706c8-716d-48e4-973e-89f838bd3445,custom_license/Adopting 'lift-up' building design to improve the surrounding pedestrian-level wind environment,"The 'lift-up' building design is a potential solution for enhancing urban air ventilation in the city. The main structure of a 'lift-up' building is elevated from the ground by individually, or a combination of, columns, shear walls, and a central core (Fig. 1 ). The main structure elevated from the ground is known as 'lift-up' floors, and the ground area under the elevated main structure is referred to as the 'lift-up' area. The main benefit of the open space between the ground and the 'lift-up' floors is to minimize obstruction to wind flow at the ground level to enhance wind circulation at the pedestrian level [7] . In addition, the 'lift-up' area can be used as a recreational area, parking area, or a pathway to access other buildings or areas. The 'lift-up' design is, however, not widely adopted for buildings due to unacceptable or even dangerous high wind speeds found in the 'lift-up' area [1, 5, 17] . These high wind speeds are a result of accelerated wind flows through narrowing openings, which connect positive and negative pressures on the windward and leeward sides of a building, respectively [17] . However, the accelerated wind flows in the 'lift-up' areas may be favourable in achieving the minimum acceptable wind speeds in cities where undesirable low wind speeds prevail. In fact [25] , have demonstrated that the addition of 'lift-up' floors to a single building, a building array, and building(s) with podium structure(s) can considerably increase the wind circulation around the building and is effective in achieving outdoor thermal comfort even under the prevailing low wind speed conditions in Hong Kong. However [25] , employed a single core size thus no results are available to quantify the influence of the 'lift-up' core dimensions on the pedestrianlevel wind field. This lack of understanding on influential parameters of 'lift-up' core dimensions prevents designers to adopt the 'lift-up' design to buildings in cities. Therefore, the present study aims to assess the influence of 'lift-up' core dimensions on the pedestrian-level wind environment, so as to be used to guide designers to adopt a 'lift-up' design for buildings to improve pedestrian-level wind conditions in a modern city such as Hong Kong. A series of wind tunnel tests were conducted using 9 isolated building models with different dimensions of central 'lift-up' core. Albeit being the simplest building arrangement, isolated buildings are (1) able to generate less complex flow conditions than in a group of buildings, and (2) capable of producing all important flow features in the surrounding wind environment [1, 8, 12] thus selected for the current study. On the other hand, a central core design would minimize the influence on wind conditions in the liftup area, the main concern of this study, compared to rows of columns or shear walls at the perimeter of the building. In the wind tunnel tests, the wind speeds at the pedestrian level near lift-up buildings were measured and subsequently compared with wind speeds near a control building model (i.e., a building without the 'lift-up' design) with similar dimensions in order to identify flow features in pedestrian-level wind field modified by the 'lift-up' design.",17.922718648545647,10.902915103784647

The flow modifications include (1) increases in area and magnitude of high wind speed (HWS) zones, (2) the formation of a pronounced low wind speed (LWS) zone on the leeward side of the 'liftup' building, and (3) a weakened LWS zone in the upstream direction of the 'lift-up' building. All of these modifications are the direct results of the wind flow that passes through the 'lift-up' area. Therefore, it is possible to maintain the desired wind environment near a 'lift-up' building by controlling the amount of wind flow passing through the 'lift-up' area or in other words, by adjusting the 'lift-up' core dimensions. (2) The area-averaged high wind speed ratio (the K HWS value) of a 'lift-up' building is considerably higher than of a building without 'lift-up' design due to the increases in size and intensity of the HWS areas. The K HWS value increases appreciably with the increase of 'lift-up' core height and slightly decreases with the increase of the core area. The effect of the 'lift-up' height is more pronounced for larger core areas (e.g. AP ¼ 49%) than for smaller core areas such as AP ¼ 9%.",18.247065280593674,9.877134719641044

Kelen and McCarthy's definition of surge capability (2006) and the wider debate over the centrality of the ""systems"" aspect (and concerns voiced recently regarding its neglect) bring to mind the long philosophical tradition (dating back to Aristotle's formulation in The Nichomachean Ethics; Aristotle 1980) of distinguishing between capacity (as command over resources) and capability (as the ability to convert resource command into a valued potential outcome). Based on this distinction, surge capacity (the portion of health system resources that can be dedicated to meeting surge needs) would be an important (but not necessarily the most important) indicator.

The most noticeable flow modification is found on the lateral sides of the 'lift-up' building where the corner streams (CS), which is also referred as the separation layers, are larger in size and higher in magnitude than of the CB. Moreover, the CS zones of model M5 are formed closer to the building in such a way that a portion of the corner streams is in the lift-up area, which is indicated by the dash rectangular box in Fig. 5 . The low wind speed (LWS) areas (marked by blue) corresponding to model M5 also display some noticeable differences from those found in the CB. Particularly, a distinct LWS area is formed next to the leeward side of model M5, whereas no downstream near-field low wind speed zone (the DNLWS zone) can be identified for the CB. The influence of the 'lift-up' floors gradually diminishes far downstream of the building as indicated by the formation of the downstream far-field low wind speed zone (the DFLWS zone) of model M5 at the same location as in the case of the CB. However, compared to the CB, model M5's DFLWS zone has a larger area where K values are small (K 0.6). Apparently, K values in the Particularly, the HWS zones appearing on the lateral sides of the building display significant variations in size and magnitude with the core dimensions. For example, taller cores, such as in model M3, create larger HWS zones further away from the side walls of the 'lift-up' building. Shorter cores, on the contrary, produced smaller HWS zones closer to the building. Furthermore, the HWS zones, in some extreme cases, occupy a major portion of the 'lift-up' area, such as shown in Fig. 6 corresponding to model M1. The 'lift-up' core height has marginal influence on the LWS zones in the upstream and downstream directions of the buildings as indicated by a slight increase of K values in the ULWS zone with the 'lift-up' core height. However, the location of the ULWS zone, whether it is attached to the building or not, is strongly dependent on the core height. As it can be seen in model M1, the shorter core (h ¼ 3 m) creates an attached ULWS zone, but in model M3, which has a taller core (h ¼ 9 m), produced a ULWS zone that is detached from the building. Compared to the 'lift-up' core height, the core area has some distinct influences on the LWS zones both in the upstream and downstream directions of the buildings including the formation of bigger DNLWS zones with smaller K values by larger core areas.",15.605160803891174,6.567346360985372

To distinguish the variation of LWS in the upstream and downstream of buildings, the K LWS values are separately calculated for the two directions in following subsections. Fig. 10 displays the calculated K LWS values in the upstream low wind speed (ULWS) zones of the 'lift-up' buildings and the control building (red dash line). Except for models M2 and M3, K LWS values in the ULWS zones of the 'lift-up' buildings are smaller than in the ULWS zones of the control building (CB). The higher K LWS value of the CB than of 'lift-up' buildings is attributed to the difference between the LWS zones formed upstream of the 'lift-up' buildings and the CB. In general, there are two LWS zones formed upstream of the CB, which is a building without 'lift-up' design, one next to the windward side, and the other far upstream of the building [20] . However, the LWS zone far upstream is not visible for the CB in Fig. 4(b) because it was formed outside the measurement area owing to the strong backflow. On the other hand, leakage of the downwash flow through the 'lift-up' area has weakened the backflow, and subsequently forms the second LWS zone in the far upstream of measurement area, as shown in Fig. 6 . It should be noted that the wind flow through the 'lift-up' area not only creates the second LWS zone but also controls the K LWS values in the ULWS zones. Higher wind blockages induced by shorter cores with larger areas tend to stagnate more air on the windward side of the building and produced smaller K LWS values as observed for model M7. 'Lift-up' buildings with taller cores with smaller AP values, on the other hand, produce higher K LWS in the ULWS zone such as in the M2 and M3 cases. The 'lift-up' core height has a more influence on the K LWS values in the ULWS zone than the core area, as shown in Fig. 10. Fig. 11 further substantiates the greater influence of the 'lift-up' core height on the K values and corresponding areas of the ULWS zone. Taller 'lift-up' cores reduce considerably the size of areas with lower K values and are sometimes able to eliminate undesirable low wind speeds completely in the upstream direction of a 'lift-up' building. No areas with K < 0.4 found in the ULWS zone for model M3 is an example of the effectiveness of taller cores with smaller core areas to minimize stagnated air in the upstream of 'liftup' buildings. Fig. 12 displays the K LWS values in the DNLWS zone calculated only for the tested 9 lift-up buildings. The K LWS value cannot be calculated for the control building (CB) as no LWS area (i.e., an area with K < 0.7) is formed next to the leeward sides of the CB (Fig. 5) . The absence of DNLWS zone of the CB is attributed to the steady horseshoe vortex generated by the strong downwash along the front face of the CB. The steady horseshoe vortex of the CB wraps firmly around the base of the building and prevents the formation of a DNLWS zone on the leeward side of the CB [20] . The horseshoe vortices in each of the 'lift-up' buildings are, on the other hand, weaker because of the downwash flow passes through the 'lift-up' area. As a result, an LWS zone appear next to the leeward side of the 'lift-up' buildings, which have smaller K LWS values than the K LWS values obtained in the pedestrian-level wind field on the leeward side of the CB. In fact, the calculated K LWS value of the CB is 0.85 and thus it does not appear in Fig. 12 , which has a set maximum K LWS value of 0.7. In addition, Fig. 12 reveals that the 'lift-up' core height further reduces the K LWS values in the DNLWS zone. It is reasonable to link the reduced K LWS values to the increase of downwash passing through the taller 'lift-up' areas, which further weakens the horseshoe vortex generation. Fig. 13 displays the variation of the area within a specific contour line (AP cum ) in the DNLWS zone with the corresponding K value. It should be noticed that Fig. 13 does not show data related to the control building (CB) as its K values in the DNLWS are not less than 0.7. In other words, Fig. 13 depicts that the most of 'lift-up' buildings, generally, corresponds to smaller K values (such as K < 0.4) when comparing to higher K values (K > 0.7) corresponding to the CB. Moreover, AP cum values increase considerably with the 'lift-up' core height, especially when K values are smaller than 0.6. Furthermore, a distinct increasing trend of AP cum is identified with the increase of 'lift-up' core area from the smallest (AP ¼ 9%) to moderate (AP ¼ 25%) values but such an increasing trend is interrupted as the core area increases from moderate to the largest (AP ¼ 49%). In fact, larger core areas (AP ¼ 49%) are linked to the smaller AP cum value under the condition that 0.7 < K < 0.4. The decrease of AP cum with larger core areas may have resulted from the UNLWS zone shifted inside the 'lift-up' area rather than stretched into the downstream direction of the building. Therefore, a part of the DNLWS zone within the 'lift-up' area is not counted in the calculation of AP cum (see Fig. 6 ). The inward expansion of the LWS zone is further analysed in the section focusing on the distribution of wind speeds in the 'lift-up' area.",14.854690968919613,6.314955753808306

The growing number of tourism education providers and tourism journals in Brazil, in addition to the increasing interest about it in the academy and the easier access to international cutting-edge research, may lead to the consolidation of a knowledge base of tourism as a research topic. It is argued, however, that the majority of Brazilian tourism research may still lack conceptual, theoretical and methodological maturity. Lohmann (2004) , while making a comparison between tourism research in Brazil and Australia, argues that there is no Brazilian similar to the Council for Australian University Tourism and Hospitality Education (CAUTHE). As a result, there is no academic conference in the country directed to tourism experts and no outlet for cutting-edge research. However, he also notes that the recent creation of the National Association of Postgraduate Tourism Programmes (ANPTUR in the Portuguese acronym), is expected to help promote tourism research in Brazil while giving researchers the opportunity for networking.

This is fortunate given the very limited capacity to provide such care. While we foresee that this capacity will increase in the coming years, driven in large part by the collaborative efforts of the National Ebola Training and Education Center (NETEC), we expect that their principal benefit will derive from a reexamination and a strengthening of ""conventional"" infection control practices throughout the healthcare system. While some might call for a more dramatic expansion in HLCC capacity, further additions to the list of diseases managed in HLCC units, or even a return to BSL-4-like care, there is reason to proceed cautiously. HLCC, and especially BSL-4-like care, is not without disadvantages. The most obvious of these are economic. It is estimated that the average cost incurred by US Ebola Treatment Centers in acquiring HLCC capabilities during the 2014-2016 EVD outbreak exceeded $1.19 million per hospital [48] . While some of these are one-time investments (e.g., unit construction and planning), others are ongoing operational costs, such as staff training and the maintenance of supply stocks. Moreover, the provision of care under HLCC or BSL-4-like conditions creates numerous challenges for caregivers: PPE ensembles can be awkward and clumsy and can lead to claustrophobia. They also limit the time that caregivers can spend performing direct patient care activities, and they decrement auditory and tactile sense. All of these factors risk decreasing, rather than improving, patient and provider safety. While intense training and frequent exercising assist in mitigating against these risks in existing HLCC units, they may be impractical on a larger scale.",13.874342087237803,9.198974091971984

However, military assistance seems more prompt and more acceptable internationally during major disasters such as the Indian Ocean tsunami, when US Navy Hospital Ship Mercy significantly contributed to posttsunami relief in Asia. 42 Whatever the range of often overlapping motivations is, the resurgence of interest in global health has led to a dramatic increase in course offerings, joint projects, and programs across medical, public health, and nursing schools. There is a vision for health professionals to have a global perspective in caring-curing skills to serve in global settings. US universities, especially as consortia, not only have the potential, but the collective experience to make that expectation a reality. Expansion of global health training into a formal federally funded global health corps has been suggested. 43 Medical residency programs, including pediatrics, geriatrics, disaster management, and emergency medicine, are providing greater emphasis on global health training and overseas placements. 44, 45 Consortia such as GHEC have provided long-standing leadership in education and promoting interinstitutional partnerships with south consortia. Interuniversity collaborations at national and regional levels continue to further evolve in North America, Latin America-Caribbean nations, and recently in Europe. The influx of DAH funds from government and foundation sources seems to be a key catalyst. 46 What is exciting about the expansion in government and philanthropic engagement in global health is that several models to support south-south partnerships are likely to evolve as the emerging south countries take leadership to access more effectively global health resources.

The early efforts of the consortium was to disperse Stabilizing South-South Academic Collaboration a large number of small grants on operational research and problem-solving capacities related to infectious disease control, MCH, and family planning. The emphasis was to use simple techniques and culturally appropriate strategies to ensure sustainability. These practices also leveled the academic exchanges between the north and south. During the epidemics and pandemics of SARS, avian flu, Nipah virus, swine flu, and H1N1, APACPH members provided leadership in research training and services, showing south competency. The north members supplemented the efforts through technical support and other resources. The south leadership was critical in promoting health equity and addressing sensitive issues such as neglect of female children, abuse of elderly people, and stigmatized health conditions such as HIV/AIDS. In poor countries, efforts to control or eradicate major infectious diseases by medication alone without addressing underlying social conditions and investing on infrastructure have limited success. Success requires a comprehensive primary health care approach, with involvement of key ministries besides health. In this challenge, APACPH has supported lead institutions and national and regional networks to network with NGOs to achieve common goals. For instance, the Collaborating Centers of Excellence for Oral Cancer Prevention in Asia Pacific emerged as a response to the fast-growing problem of oral cancer (in epidemic proportions in some countries) related to betel nut chewing in Asia. 54 The center is linked to cancer prevention and humanitarian organizations that rehabilitate individuals with major disfigurements and stigma. These challenges have also helped revitalize the organization's own values and commitment to redefine collectively what is unacceptable for health in the south societies as well as what is feasible with limited resources. In the context of oral cancer, the reduction of betel nut chewing is our top priority. Similarly, networks based on problem-solving efforts such as in injury prevention, indigenous health, and peace through health initiatives are being promoted. The model of health as a bridge to peace is being expanded in curricula, conferences, and publications. 55, 56 SUMMARY Twenty-five years is a benchmark for any organization, more so in fragile international partnerships. Limited resources, rapid turnover in leadership in south universities, growing disinterest in north universities as control and power shifts to the south, slow membership growth and uneven resource support, which is largely voluntary, and organizational changes have all had a negative effect to various degrees. Despite those limitations, there is an overall sense of achievement particularly in the ability of the south's capacity to take over and manage APACPH successfully and contribute through the collective partnership. The boundaries of north and south have really almost completely blurred. From small beginnings, the annual conferences have grown to become a major global health event attracting university presidents, ministers, global health organizations, and local communities together in reinforcing policy initiatives and improving efficacy. The development of Collaborating Center and ICUH has created small but vibrant networks. In-country networks and south-south partnerships have stabilized as membership levels reached a healthy functional level of 3 to 5 in-country members. An ongoing strategy to revitalize in-country and regional networks is built in through national and regional conferences and partnership in national public health and medical organizations. Member university presidents have also begun to use APACPH networks and the Global Health Conferences to foster the social responsibility of universities whether in indigenous health, urbanization, or MDG-related goals. There have been sustained efforts to recognize and retain south leadership. Over the past 25 years, a total of 65 APACPH awards for excellence in leadership, research, teaching, and services have been given to leaders from the south. A Global Health Ambassadors program to retain the influence of leadership has been instituted. Capacity building has been slow but sustained, and has become south driven. Nearly 100 faculty and students received scholarships for their Masters and doctoral studies in the first 10 years through the WHO Collaborating Center at APACPH member universities, mostly in the north. It is estimated that more than 1000 faculty and students have been supported in short-term programs at member universities in the last 20 years. More than 60% of that support came from south universities, including the 4 APACPH Collaborating Centers. Each year, 10 to 15 APACPH travel grants are awarded to students and junior faculty to attend annual and regional conferences. APACPH members provide additional matching awards. The APACPH Global Health Conferences have therefore become a real opportunity for learning and exchange. Global health leaders and university presidents from many countries add their perspectives on global health equity across nations, the founding values of APACPH, reenergizing the commitment to primary health care and the MDGs. These acts of rededication of the social responsibility of universities to local and global communities touch the cornerstone of the social and environmental constructs in health. The beliefs and actions that emerge are value laden. In imperfect organizations like a university consortium there have been significant compromises and accommodation both by the north and the south. Yet the common goals and core activities have been revitalized by the members, especially the leadership of young global health professionals, whose dedication in serving the populations in need will sustain the collaboration.",15.928896613021383,10.721780794347218

Consequently, even though the need for moral conduct in food technology may be widely appreciated, their motivation to actually practice it might be limited. Education is also a prerequisite in fulfillment of food technology ethics as evidenced by the Chinese experience in the tainted milk scandal. In China, the food industry is often organized as a small-scale, labor-intensive one, lacking capital and hi-tech operations. Small-scale farmers have usually received little education on formal farming and husbandry practices; they might have thought that mixing certain ''magic'' chemicals (e.g. melamine) and preservatives to milk could make it look more nutritious and longer lasting, thus rendering it more profitable, with little understanding of the severity of the problems caused by their actions.

Food-related ethical discussion started thousands of years ago. Historical evidence for this traces back to the ancient Greeks, and is evident in literatures left by ancient Roman and early Christian scholars (Zwart, 2000) . A detailed historical development of food ethics was successfully presented by Zwart in 2000, and selected ideas pertaining to food in major historical periods are listed in Table 2 . Despite such early recognition of the importance of ethics in relation to food, most of the effort made in this area is limited to food preparation; as such, exploration of morality in the application of food technology in the industrial context is lacking. Such ignorance, however, appears not to have lowered the importance of food technology ethics. Instead, its social impacts as manifested by the occurrence of food safety problems seem to be urging both the academic and industrial sectors to pay attention to the issue. In fact, along with industrialization and capitalism, cooperative labor tends to be more specialized, thereby widening the distance between food consumption and its production. Under such circumstances, consumers have to place unidirectional trust in the governance structure and safety of the existing agri-food system. This trust relationship is basic to a harmonious society.

In fact, the AMA was the first to state boldly that "". . . when pestilence prevails, it is [physicians'] duty to face the danger, and continue their labors for the alleviation of suffering, even at the jeopardy of their own lives."" 18 This strong and largely unprecedented statement helped formalize a sense of physician duty that was sustained until the 1950s and 1960s, when, as the domestic threats of smallpox, polio, and related epidemics dissipated, such heroic statements vanished from the AMA Code. 13, 19 Decades later, the HIV threat motivated changes in the code that were less inspired. In 1986, language was added suggesting that treating HIV-positive patients was required only if the physician was ""emotionally able to do so."" 20 This self-serving stance was ridiculed, however, and within 6 months the AMA approved a revised statement: ""A physician may not ethically refuse to treat a patient whose condition is within the physician's current realm of competence solely because the patient is seropositive."" 13 More recently, the events of September 11, 2001 , and the subsequent anthrax scare ushered in the AMA's new ""Social Contract with Humanity,"" including a Declaration of Professional Responsibility that contains a statement on personal risk reminiscent of the AMA's 1847 Code: ""We, the members of the world community of physicians, solemnly commit ourselves to . . . apply our knowledge and skills when needed, though doing so may put us at risk."" 21 Of course, all physicians do not subscribe to the AMA Code of Ethics, and many emergency physicians rely instead on the American College of Emergency Physicians' (ACEP) Code of Ethics. Developed in 1996, the ACEP Code of Ethics specifically addresses a commitment to open access to all who seek emergency services. The first 2, and arguably most important, of the Principles of Ethics for Emergency Physicians read, ""Emergency physicians shall . . . embrace patient welfare as their primary professional responsibility . . . [and] . . . respond promptly and expertly, without prejudice or partiality, to the need for emergency medical care."" 22 These principles underscore an emergency physician's responsibility to put patient welfare first and to treat all, regardless of their presenting problem. Such principles from organized emergency medicine may have helped inspire more patient-centered versions of the AMA Code. The 2001 preamble to the AMA Code, for example, states that ""a physician must recognize responsibility to patients first and foremost, as well as to society, to other health professionals, and to self."" 23, 24 Ethics codes of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine, the Emergency Medical Residents' Association, and the Emergency Nurses' Association do not directly address this issue.",14.827186447537883,7.668341815228194

During the Ebola outbreak considerable work was undertaken on development of possible Ebola vaccines, with WHO coordinating international efforts for development of new interventions. 54 The potential for crises to harness efforts and innovations for public health is significant as is demonstrated by the announcement in late 2016 of the trial results of a potential vaccine for Ebola. 55 In 2016, the WHO developed a blueprint for research and development to prevent epidemics, 56 an approach that is in line with the recommendations of the various expert reviews of the Ebola response for accelerated R&D for global public health emergencies. 57 The R&D Blueprint focuses on three approaches: (i) 'improving coordination and fostering an enabling environment', (ii) 'accelerating Research and Development processes', and (iii) 'Developing new norms and standards tailored to of Health Preparedness and Response at the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, the one health approach to risk involves, 'not just to focus on humans but also the implicated animals and the environment to identify potentially novel prevention strategies', Ali Khan with William Patrick, The Next Pandemic: On the front Line against Humankind's Gravest Dangers the epidemic context'. 58 The publication in 2016 by WHO of Guidance for Managing Ethical Issues in Infectious Disease Outbreaks will assist these efforts by providing guidance on a range of important issues including research during emergencies, datasharing, biobanking of samples, and emergency use of unproven interventions, 59 issues which all came to the fore during the Ebola outbreak. 60 While pandemic response capacity in terms of R&D is being addressed globally, IHR core capacities are specified at the national level. The building of such capacity at the national level is multi-layered and resource demanding, so countries vary greatly in their ability (or willingness) to build capacities such as having enough or sufficiently proximate access to testing laboratories. 61 This is especially the case for developing countries in regions such as South-East Asia, where implementation of the IHRs is patchy due to resource and logistical challenges. 62 To assist the region to meet the IHR's mid-2014 deadline for development of core capacities, the Asia-Pacific Strategy for Emerging Diseases (APSED) was developed, originally in 2005 and updated in 2010. 63 APSED has provided a valuable framework to support development of IHR core capacities in the region with 19 out of 27 States Parties reporting that they have met the IHR core capacity requirements, 64 and a 2015 evaluation showing establishment of event-based surveillance by 85% of Member States; with 92% having 'a rapid response team and risk communication plans for emergencies; and 95% of national reference laboratories have participated in external quality assessment'. 65 The challenges associated with building capacity are significant. Although the IHR require countries to build certain core capacities within their health systems, the achievement of IHR core capacities remains uneven 66 sparking debate over the best means of ensuring compliance with IHR requirements, including consideration of the best means of assessing the national capacities required by the IHR. Commenting that 'When the health of all is at stake, information must be validated through some form of peer review or other external assessment', 67 the Ebola Interim Assessment Panel considered the system of voluntary self-assessment of IHR core capacities to be 'unacceptable' and recommended costed and independently assessed plans for development of IHR core capacities, an approach that has also been recommended by other international expert panels. 68 Importantly, there has been a shift away from viewing IHR compliance as a point-in-time assessment of compliance to one of on-going capacity building and continual improvement. Noting with concern the fact that 'only approximately one-third of States Parties have indicated that they have met the minimum [IHR] core capacity requirements', the Report of the Review Committee on Second Extensions for Establishing National Public Health Capacities and on IHR Implementation concluded that 'work to develop, strengthen and maintain the core capacities under the IHR should be viewed as a continuing process for all countries'. 69 The Review Committee also recommended external evaluations rather than self-assessment. 70 Following from these recommendations the WHO has developed a Joint External Evaluation Tool to assess the capacity of countries to prevent, detect and respond to public health threats. 71 Under the Joint External Evaluation the process of evaluation begins with completion of a survey by countries using their own self-reported data, which is provided to the joint external evaluation (JEE) team of national and international experts. Following a visit by the JEE team to the host country the JEE team draft a report on the country's capabilities and challenges. 72 National capacity to meet IHR core capacities is assessed on a 5-point scale: (i) no capacity, (ii) limited capacity, (iii) developed capacity, (iv) demonstrated capacity, and (v) sustainable capacity. 73 The resulting report is shared with the host country, and with the country's permission, stakeholders, in order to facilitate international support for implementation, circulate best practices, and promote accountability. 74 The development of the JEE tool is an important step towards greater transparency and accountability of the assessment of IHR core capacities. However, without substantial funding to support the realisation of core capacities, it is likely that many countries will continue to struggle to strengthen their national capacities.",19.969637149392348,11.136554394003324

We suggest that this framework can be applied by each actor using an iterative, developmental approach according to the following steps: 1) Identify the capacity components that individuals, agencies, and systems should possess given their particular mandate; 2) Identify the capacity components that individuals, agencies, and systems possess, and examine how these components relate to the other capacity components in the framework; 3) Identify the components that individuals, agencies, and systems do not currently possess in relation to the ideal state; and 4) Examine the potential for building these capacities internally or externally via strategic partnerships with other actors who already possess these desired capacities. This conceptual framework provides a common structure of public health capacity components that can be utilized by any actor to better coordinate and target capacity-building efforts to specific components identified using the framework. This framework has some limitations. It is descriptive in nature rather than prescriptive with respect to how each component should be enhanced in current public health systems. It is incumbent on each user of this framework to decide how best to modify and apply it to meet their particular needs. The framework is based on government and governmentcommissioned SARS reports that reviewed the Canadian and Ontario public health systems with an emphasis on community public health outbreaks and emergencies. Certain components such as maternal and child health were not addressed in these reports and are therefore not included in this framework.

This last point has been particularly relevant over the past several years as emerging viral outbreaks of Ebola and Zika viruses and others have quickly led to large sequencing efforts. There was a clear need to support these sequencing efforts with bioinformatics resources, but timelines prevented traditional development paths where new virus modules and features were added over the course of months. The first rapid deployment of a Virus Variation module was during the western African Ebola virus outbreak that began in December of 2013. The outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization on August 8, 2014 (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/ news/statements/2014/ebola-20140808/en/). By September, a Virus Variation Resource specific to Ebolaviruses was available to help access the sequences that had begun to pour into the INSDC databases. Similarly, a Virus Variation Resource module was developed in September 2014 in response to the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Most recently, this rapid response model was repeated for the Zika virus module, which was put in place in March 2016.

Inadequate public health services are socioeconomic problems, not just an issue within the health administrative system. The strategy needs to clarify functional boundaries for all health organizations, and to consolidate operational mechanisms so that accountability and efficiency can be achieved; to extend the coverage of the public health service system with clear definitions of responsibility, improved responsiveness, development of sensitive and co-ordinated teams, and self-sustainability of the systems as long-term goals; to build capacity to deal with emergencies, especially serious and urgent infectious disease epidemics or outbreaks, and other major infectious diseases. Also important is to strengthen capacity building for sudden public health emergency response resilience and preparedness; to establish and use a system of evaluation indices for public health services which are based on the principle of equity and application of scientific evidence; to facilitate construction of a solid infrastructure, particularly at basic levels where development of health facilities has long been overlooked; to develop public health primary care services in the communities and promote equal access to health services across the city. This includes action to meet the high demands for public health services from the general public, and to realize health equity aspirations regarding financial and physical health service accessibility; to establish and improve public health co-ordination mechanisms at the government and community level. A highquality and equitable health service system depends on cooperative efforts by communities, government departments including Shenzhen's health authority, social organizations and all residents of the city. Community mobilization and help from the media should be considered and prioritized; to strengthen health education and health promotion, and to increase public health literacy. Given the demographic features of Shenzhen with many young and mobile populations, information for high-risk populations about certain health conditions and behaviours is needed; to strengthen international and regional co-operation in disease prevention and control.",19.681372481478512,10.96637173023089

Some of the many strategies include elimination or adaptation of the pollutant sources, maintaining adequate waterproofing, removing water-stained ceiling and flooring, and keeping products such as paints, solvents, and adhesives tightly enclosed and in highly ventilated areas. Measuring air distribution and ventilation levels is also critical. Building codes should specify minimum levels of outside air admission; acceptable levels of oxygen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide; odor dilution; and adequacy of ventilation equipment.

If the incident escalates to a crisis, a company CMT should be convened to manage the crisis. The senior emergency response person, when at the scene, should manage the incident with the assistance of specialists as appropriate. • Evacuation and assembly: A critical objective during any emergency is employee safety. In the event it is necessary to evacuate a building or facility, having an established and orderly process is essential. Once a warning system sounds the notice to evacuate, employees must be aware of preestablished procedures for quick evacuation, including primary and alternate evacuation routes and where they should assemble. Maps or diagrams with this information should be included in the plan and posted throughout the work area. A floor warden or an employee with the assignment to facilitate evacuation should make a sweep of the area prior to their own evacuation to ensure all personnel have exited the building or facility. Once in the predetermined assembly area, a roll call must be taken. Primary, secondary, and tertiary responsibilities should be assigned to ensure someone is available to take roll call and report the results to security. If someone did not evacuate the facility, a search-and-rescue team or other emergency personnel may be required to reenter the facility and provide assistance. • Emergency evacuation drills: The efficient and complete evacuation of personnel from a building or facility in the event of an emergency is such an important event that periodic drills should be conducted to reinforce the process and its importance. At least annually, each building or facility should undergo an evacuation drill where employees respond to a warning and completely evacuate the building or facility. This may be required by law in some states or jurisdictions. Lastly, a roll call should be conducted and results reported to security and senior management. • Search and rescue: In the event of serious damage such as a fire or collapse of building, it may be necessary to search and account for employees. Search and rescue is the responsibility of responding emergency personnel who have proper protective equipment such as the fire department persons not trained in search-and-rescue techniques or who do not have proper equipment should not enter hazardous areas and conduct searches. Heavy lifting should always be left to the professionals such as properly trained search and rescue teams and fire department personnel. Heavy lifting in this context means security personnel should not supplant the proven experience of responding agencies and do it themselves without the proper training. This can cause critical delays in response and could even jeopardize lives. At its core, the job of the security officer is to observe and report. • Return to work: The process for returning to work after a crisis should also be included in the emergency plan. After any incident where employees are required to leave their work area and evacuate a building or facility, a process for having them return to work is necessary. For example, in the event of a false fire alarm where employees have evacuated a building, a means of communicating to them an all-clear, safe to return to work signal, is needed. This can be accomplished in many ways. Public address announcements can be made or security personnel can go to assembly areas, directing employees to return to work the good old fashion way by use of a bull horn. As appropriate, other methods may also be employed such as IP-based communication systems. In the event there is actual damage and employees cannot return to work, a process should be established identifying who makes the decision to send employees home-most likely Human Resources-as well as how that is communicated to them and how they are kept apprised of event updates. For example, if a building was severely damaged due to fire and cannot be occupied for several days, posting daily direction and guidance for employees on the company website or on an emergency toll-free phone line will allow employees to call each day for specific instructions. For this to be effective, employees must know this process, must know the phone number to call or website to access and, as with all other processes, this one must be updated regularly. Extended remote work authorization can also be of great assistance to a company keeping it operating efficiently while longer term infrastructure needs are addressed. This type of remote work authorization especially works well where natural occurrences most happen such as severe snow storms, hurricanes (when evacuation is not necessary), and typhoons. In some instances, keeping employees at home working remote while there is civil, social, and political unrest can save lives by keeping employees off the roads or away from the office. • After action: When any incident occurs that necessitates evacuation or results in injuries, major damage, or presents the possibility of major business interruption, an after action report must be prepared. The primary focus is twofold:",14.314022570075764,9.63331445279495

Great attention was paid to access barriers presented to the urban poor in the late 1990s and into the 21st century. training/capacity building were not addressed. In some cases, poor management persisted and, even with additional revenues from decentralization, the local authorities still could not pay for the services needed by the local populace (World Bank 2004) . In other cases, decentralization actually increased cost of service delivery (World Bank 2004) . In El Salvador, for instance, despite overall increases in public funding of health care, the funds which were allocated to the rural sectors decreased in part because the government, following a model of increased competition, contracted with NGOs to provide health care (Smith-Nonini 2000) . In African, Latin American and Asian nations, decreases in public spending and resultant low levels of salaries for health care professionals created a 'brain drain' with medical staff either concentrating in urban areas or relocating to other countries which offered higher wages (Oppong 2001; World Bank 2004) . In addition, some nations continued to suffer from trade imbalances which caused the import of essential drugs to slow or stop (Oppong 2001) . The decentralized health authorities were often left without necessary drugs or medical supplies.",16.620818186725195,11.373700445019956

Two principal dimensions to trust are brought to bear when public health surveillance data are 1326 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 24, No. 7, July 2018 shared. First, organizations sharing public health surveillance data should do so in a transparent manner and should be able to demonstrate to communities from which the data originate how their data are collected, analyzed, used, and protected. Second, trust-building measures between organizations or individuals sharing data, whether at the personal or organizational level, help create an environment where public health surveillance data can be shared. Transparency with regard to what data are shared with whom, and for what purpose, is a prerequisite. Trust includes ensuring that the shared data are used responsibly and not made available to other parties or publicly without consulting the data providers. When the purpose of sharing data is clear and explicit, and those persons involved in sharing know each other, understand each other's expectations, and carry out commitments as agreed, a trust relationship can emerge. Established trust increases the likelihood of collaboration and shared benefits and promotes core surveillance capacity through the creation of surveillance networks (19) . Building trust for routine data sharing can provide strong foundations for emergency surveillance and response. Building trust can be hard, but losing trust is all too easy. In practice, trust often translates into developing appropriate professional relationships with counterparts in other countries or regions (35) . Trust-building measures sometimes take the form of face-to-face meetings, regional workshops, desktop exercises, or joint outbreak investigations (19) . For data recipients, providers must be trustworthy in providing high-quality data.

Our experience suggests that while projecting change may be difficult, prospective collection of data may provide a measure of how service is delivered and specifically, when service is not delivered in a timely manner, and thus, provide quantifiable evidence for a need to improve. That is, by using registry data we were able to estimate the magnitude of improvements to our service delivery by measuring changes in key wait list indicators (in this case RMWT) that followed the implementation of each successive capacity building strat-egy. Likewise, we were able to estimate the detriment to the timeliness of service delivery each capacity stressor brought. Despite the awareness raised from this data that RMWTs were not being met during this time, the increase in capacity was slow. Reasons for the delay in expansion may have been exacerbated by competing interests for government funding, bureaucratic processes (that delay realized capacity even though funding has been allocated) [9] , a lack of standardized methods for monitoring and reporting wait times and wait list lengths, and/or government opinion differing from service providers on the seriousness of wait list problems [18, 19] .",17.759521278343406,10.303948711763454

The Predict project involves capacity building for strengthening detection and monitoring of, characterizing the drivers for, and improving predictive models for disease transmission between wildlife and people. The Prevent project involves assessment of the risks of associated with disease transmission and strategies to mitigate those risks. The Identify project involves the building laboratory capacity, including training personnel, to diagnose infectious diseases in animals and people. The Respond project involves facilitating networks of public health, veterinary medicine, and environmental health to improve transdisciplinary training and response efforts. In addition to these projects, the EPT program funds CDC to promote the detection and monitoring of zoonotic diseases, including providing support for the Field Epidemiology Training Program.",23.235153311540753,11.67170409353328

This is perhaps a practical consideration because OH otherwise would likely lose political traction under anything more concretely conceptual. The OH goal is to assemble a comprehensive set of data across a broad spectrum of expertise, and to thereby provide solutions that are of benefit to human wellbeing within ecological settings. Most recently, this idea is being framed as effectiveness gains through dynamic cooperation in environmental contexts, and has the effect of raising environmental concerns on par with concurrent efforts in public health such as in disease surveillance and animal management. This might be enough to create a vision of OH ethics: Van Rensselaer Potter, in his earliest definition of bioethics, talked about a system of human survival that included environmental, or ecological ethics (Potter 1988 ). This could easily capture the idea of OH as broadening public health into diverse fields. Potter, a pioneer in challenging parochial and non-secular ideas shaping the human condition, noted a schism between the medical-science domains and humanistic ethics, and that both were distanced from environmental ethics. The ethics of OH, therefore, may just be signalling the resurgence of bioethics as a unified endeavour (Thompson and List 2015) , allowing for reflective and critical engagement with current pandemic measures, which up to now gave little credence to solutions outside the scope of public health ethics.",16.613492735765472,11.861651054014498

This ability depends on both an individual's physical and mental capacities and on the environments one inhabits (for example access to transport and assistive devices) [10] . As described in the WHO's World Report on Ageing and Health [11] , while intrinsic capacity tends to decline with increasing age, a primary characteristic of older ages is great diversity. Even in the poorest settings, an eighty year old may be healthy, independent, and vibrant, while a sixty year old may need significant care and support. Chronological age is thus a poor marker of health state, and there is no fixed age when someone becomes ''old"". Furthermore, this diversity is often a consequence of the cumulative impacts of advantage or disadvantage across a person's life. This means that those with the greatest health needs in older age may have the least access to the specific required resources. In any population in the second half of life, three groups can be proposed: those with high and stable capacity; those with decreasing capacity; and those with substantial loss of capacity [10] , although individuals can transition between these states. Rather than defining target groups for vaccination solely by their chronological age, assessing an individual's level of capacity may add important information on their need for vaccination, response to vaccination, or the functional benefits likely to arise. For example, where a vaccine is currently recommended for those above 65 years [12] , some individuals may benefit from vaccination at an earlier age because of declining capacity. While implementing this approach would require development and adoption of simple and robust measures of capacity in a clinical setting, discussions of this topic may be beneficial in order to better understand optimal target groups for vaccination.",16.508343658280822,9.224478958548465

The screen shots at 2nd, 4th and 6th second show the pathway of the HF dispersion around the test building. Six seconds after the wind-assisted dispersion commenced, the HF has been completely removed from the windward region of the building. In contrast, it took twice as long, over a period of 12 s, for HF to be evacuated for the leeward near wake region. Evidently, at time 2nd, 4th and 6th second, HF remained within the re-entry area at the leeward face of the building before eventually migrated upward and dispersed, as shown by the indicating arrows. Fig. 8 presents the quantitative HF concentration as a function of time at 3rd, 6th and 9th floor re-entry in both windward and leeward faces of the building. Evidently, HF concentration at 3rd, 6th and 9th floor re-entry on the windward face decreases with time. At 6th second, HF concentrations were reduced to less than 0.5% at all locations. Within the leeward re-entry, HF concentrations fluctuate; within the first 3 s, concentration firstly decreases and then increases. Indeed, at 6th second, HF remains at about 3% at different stories. The variation in HF concentration suggests that turbulent mixing and recirculation within the near wake spread the diluted HF throughout the near wake and also keep the diluted HF entrapped within the near wake for a sustained period, prolonging the exposure of the leeward face of the building, including the reentry, to potentially harmful HF exposure.",15.95853571478426,8.2838169727163

Moreover, nurses must be familiar with decontamination procedures and be capable of using the required equipment to protect both their own safety and the safety of patients. Willingness and competence are required for effective responses, such as were seen in the global responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome Previous studies also considered ethics in disaster as an essential knowledge area for all healthcare providers, including nurses. For instance, Walsh et al. [35] demonstrated that healthcare providers must be proficient in identifying and discussing the general ethical issues relating to the standards of care and resources during times of disaster. Having adequate knowledge and a full understanding of the principal ethical issues involved in disaster situations can prepare nurses to respond with confidence to related problems [28] . Considering ethics is important; as such, ethics should be included as a consideration in disaster nursing education, drills, research and planning [12] .",20.173912466215562,10.986421779023225

Long working hours and close contact with patients increases the risk of infection, which imposes enormous stress on nurses who provide direct care for SARS patients [21] . The study findings add insight for nurse administrators and educators to further develop strategies to increase nurses' intention and volunteering to care for patients with other new and potentially fatal contagious diseases, such as SARS or avian influenza. First, providing sufficient and adequate personal protective equipment, periodically announcing and routinely practicing infection control measures and protocols, and providing up-to-date continuing education for nurses may help to reinforce nurses' self-efficacy in caring for such patients. Second, enhancing positive attitude is much more important than merely increasing nurses' knowledge regarding the disease. Reinforcement of nurses' positive attitudes could be easily achieved by verbal expression of approval and support from nursing administrators, or substantial rewards such as special compensation payments could be used to encourage and acknowledge nurses for their efforts. Third, improving nurses' access to resources provided by hospitals is a key point to increase nurses' intention. Nurse administrators need to ensure that staff nurses obtain sufficient resources and psychologic support, and have the capability and capacity to respond properly to care for SARS patients or any future public emergencies of this kind. Fourth, it is crucial for nursing administrators to serve as nurse advocates to reflect the frontline nurses' voices and concerns in the battle to contain diseases such as SARS, and build up direct communication channels between the hospital administration and staff nurses.",15.097926939740194,9.06920959932113

This scepticism stems from several recent analyses of pandemic plans, which have demonstrated that, while ethical considerations and guidance have been incorporated into many pandemic plans, underlying ethical reasoning and justifications remain largely absent. Pandemic planning requires numerous assumptions to be made regarding, among other things, the severity of the pandemic, the supply and availability of health care resources, and the availability of information regarding who is at risk and who can benefit (Prehn and Vawter 2008) . Variations in these underlying assumptions can have profound implications for ethical reasoning and justification, which may ultimately affect the nature and scope of ethics guidance included in a plan. As such, it is not surprising that considerable variety exists among plans in the attention paid to guidance for ethical decision-making (Prehn and Vawter 2008; McDougall 2010) . Indeed, many pandemic plans do not contain any ethical guidance at all (Prehn and Vawter 2008) . Of course, this is problematic not only for ethics preparedness for infectious disease pandemics beyond influenza, but for influenza pandemics as well. And while numerous ethics guidance documents and a substantial scholarly literature exist that can be drawn upon in the event of a pandemic (e.g., University of Toronto Joint Centre for Bioethics 2005; Kinlaw and Levine 2007; National Ethics Advisory Committee 2007; World Health Organization 2007 , 2008b Jennings and Arras 2008) , this should not be seen as a replacement for the integration of robust ethics guidance within pandemic plans themselves, as many of the decisions governments and health practitioners will make in preparing for and responding to pandemics will ostensibly be derived from their own jurisdiction's pandemic plan and the ethical guidance therein.",14.44423769547273,7.67079389216309

For one, as of the year 2000, there are more humans on the planet living in cities than outside them. In 2002, there were twenty megalopolises in the world with more than 10 million people, and by 2015 there will be nearly forty. Cities have always been the font of new ideas, new applications of technologies, new cultural movements, and social change. They constitute natural nodes in a network for disseminating innovations. In the problems they face and the opportunities they offer, they also provide a microcosm of the world. Finally, cities possess an organisational infrastructure and established leadership groups with the potential to see the value and to sponsor the design of a local learning system. In many cities, multisector coalitions or alliances are formed to take on a pressing issue such as improving urban schools, increasing access to low-income housing, cleaning up a business district, or building a stadium, park, or cultural facility (see Grogan and Proscio, 2000) . These coalitions, however, generally do not take sustained responsibility for stewarding a civic domain or for bringing together the full array of stakeholder constituencies to identify and address short-and long-term priorities. One way to assess the level of civic stewardship in any city or region is to map the prevalence, inclusiveness, and effectiveness of civic communities of practice (also known as coalitions, associations, partnerships, and alliances, among other terms) who take responsibility for clusters of issues related to particular civic domains, such as education, economic development, health, housing, public safety, infrastructure, culture, recreation, and the environment. The reality is that in many cities these domains have no explicit stewardship, or they are left to public agencies The city as a learning system: stewarding the 'whole round' of civic domains or to a menagerie of disparate, often competitive and conflicting organisations that carve out small pieces of the puzzle -regarding housing availability, for examplebut do not coordinate efforts or leverage a common base of expertise and resources. The city, re-imagined as a learning system, consists of a constellation of crosssector groups that provide stewardship for the whole round of civic domains (See Fig. 7.2) . Cultivating a learning system at the city level means taking stock of the current stewardship capacity in the city and accounting for the array of civic disciplines and the quality of active communities of practice stewarding them. This city-level assessment provides a template for what a nation can do. At the nation level, leaders might evaluate a representative sample of major cities and regions as a baseline assessment of its civic stewardship capacity. By extension, an evaluation of the top 500 strategic cities in the world could provide a benchmark for our civic learning capacity at a global level. At the national and global levels, the analysis also considers the strength and quality of linkages across cities both within and across nations. Of course, even at the city level, there are subsectors and neighbourhoods that are fractal elements of the city, each with its own whole round of civic practices, and among which neighbourhood-to-neighbourhood linkages are as instrumental as ones that connect cities and nations.",16.387043994172913,9.609266748554086

However, the examples of disease outbreaks in China show that exclusively top-down command and lack of coherent communication between and among the responsible authorities can aggravate the situation. From the analyses of the public health policies of China, one can see that the civic organizations were not encouraged in China to check and balance the information from the authorities and help monitor the outbreaks. Participation is thus lacking in the health communication process in China. Advocacy-communication can be seen from the social networking sites such as Weibo and in microblogging. Mostly, behavior change interventions and school-based interventions took place for introduction of vaccination and promoting a hygienic environment. Capacity building, domestically in China and with Hong Kong Special Administrative Region or with other nations in times of a health crisis, have always proven to be effective.

These initiatives have been assisted by regional coordination and the formation of, for example, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, and subregional networks such as the Mekong Basin Disease Surveillance Network. 82, 83 The adoption of the revised International Health Regulations, which have a target of establishment of minimum core capacities, or specific plans, by mid-2012, by the 194 member states of WHO was a noteworthy advance. 84 The revised Regulations incorporate a broad definition of outbreaks of public health concern, which include outbreaks in non-human animals, and provides an incentive for low-income countries to build capacity for pandemic surveillance and prevention. Although implementation will probably be delayed because many countries have so far been unable to achieve minimum core capacity goals, the adoption of the Regulations should greatly improve standards for surveillance, reporting, and response. 82 Efforts to reduce or prevent pandemic zoonoses before they emerge in people have also begun, and might form the template for a new, globally coordinated pandemic prevention strategy. For influenza, these efforts have been focused on animal surveillance as a strategy to identify periods when the risk of spillover to people is high. 64 Wider surveillance in wildlife to include targeted pathogen discovery has been called for. 3, 5, 7, 64 However, few coordinated efforts have been implemented to pre-empt zoonotic disease emergence with wildlife surveillance. The Emerging Pandemic Threats programme is a noteworthy project initiated in 2009 by the US Agency for International Development. The programme is a suite of capacity-building investments designed to rapidly identify (and eventually predict) the emergence of new public health threats and increase country-level capacities to mitigate the potential effects of these threats. 85 It draws heavily from efforts to address the H5N1 threat, and emphasises a strategic approach that builds on the understanding that the health and well being of people, animals, and the environment are inextricably linked; promotes a One Health approach that spans the animal health, public health, environ mental, and conservation communities; 86 targets promotion of policies and capacities to identify and minimise the risk of emergence of new disease; and uses a risk-based approach to target investments where the likelihood of disease emergence is greatest.",15.450481350049118,8.471224976766763

On the whole, this is true: individuals, communities, and governments have access to significant resources and engage in a range of actions to manage and control climate-sensitive health outcomes (Ebi, 2009; Ebi et al., 2009; Watson et al., 2005) . This assumption, however, does not adequately consider the persistence of withincountry economic and health inequities and their implications for vulnerable populations. This is particularly pertinent for developed nations with Indigenous populations living in what has been referred to as the 'fourth world' (O'Neill, 1986) . Indigenous peoples in Canada, New Zealand, United States, and Australia all experience a disproportionate burden of morbidity and mortality, with many social, economic, and health indicators similar to those in middleincome nations (Cooke et al., 2007; Green et al., 2009; Stephens et al., 2006) .

Canada in general has a well developed public health system and low burden of health which will moderate vulnerability. However, there is significant heterogeneity in health outcomes, and health inequality is particularly pronounced among Aboriginal Canadians. Intervention is needed to prevent, prepare for, and manage climate change effects on Aboriginal health but is constrained by a limited understanding of vulnerability and its determinants. Despite limited research on climate change and Aboriginal health, however, there is a well established literature on Aboriginal health outcomes, determinants, and trends in Canada; characteristics that will determine vulnerability to climate change. In this paper we systematically review this literature, using a vulnerability framework to identify the broad level factors constraining adaptive capacity and increasing sensitivity to climate change. Determinants identified include: poverty, technological capacity constraints, socio-political values and inequality, institutional capacity challenges, and information deficit. The magnitude and nature of these determinants will be distributed unevenly within and between Aboriginal populations necessitating place-based and regional level studies to examine how these broad factors will affect vulnerability at lower levels. The study also supports the need for collaboration across all sectors and levels of government, open and meaningful dialogue between policy makers, scientists, health professionals, and Aboriginal communities, and capacity building at a local level, to plan for climate change. Ultimately, however, efforts to reduce the vulnerability of Aboriginal Canadians to climate change and intervene to prevent, reduce, and manage climate-sensitive health outcomes, will fail unless the broader determinants of socio-economic and health inequality are addressed.",14.134058857669842,10.987506189593319

The core elements of the framework include the following: • Transparency: knowing how the data will be handled, accessed and exchanged • Accountability: tracking of data access and mechanisms for addressing misuse • Engagement: involving citizens and facilitating dialogue and deliberation around the societal implications of data sharing • Quality and security: mitigating unauthorized access and implementing an unbiased approach to storing and processing data • Privacy, data protection and confidentiality: complying with the relevant regulations at every stage • Risk-benefit analysis: weighing benefits (including new knowledge, efficiencies and informed decision making) against risks (including invasion of privacy and breaches of confidentiality), minimizing harm and maximizing benefit at the individual and societal levels • Recognition and attribution: ensuring recognition is meaningful to participants, providing due credit to all who shared data and ensuring credit is given for both primary and secondary data use • Sustainability: implementing systems for archiving and retrieval • Education and training: advancing data sharing, improving data quality, educating people on why data sharing matters, and building capacity • Accessibility and dissemination: maximizing accessibility, promoting collaboration and using publication and digital dissemination to share results to the global health community, the notion of reciprocity suggests that they should derive some corresponding local benefit. The 'trickle-down' effects of global genomic surveillance have yet to be fully articulated, but they are likely to be realized first in the zoonotic domain, where global surveillance efforts will feed back into improved animal health at a local level, in turn benefiting local farmers. Outbreaks occur at the intersection of risk perception, governance, policy and economics 117 , and outbreak response is often based on political instinct rather than data 5 . Building a resilient and responsive public health system is therefore more than just enhancing surveillance and coupling it to novel technology -it is about engagement, trust, cooperation and building local capacity 8 , as well as a focus on pandemic prevention through development rather than pandemic response via disaster relief mechanisms 57 . Expert panels convened by Harvard and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine 9 and by the National Academy of Medicine 8 have called for a central pandemic preparedness and response agency and also underscored the need for deeper partnerships between formal and informal surveillance, epidemiology and academic and public health networks 5 . More recently, evolutionary biologist Michael Worobey wrote: ""Systematic pathogen surveillance is within our grasp, but is still undervalued and underfunded relative to the magnitude of the threat"" (REF. 118 ). If we are to achieve the sequencing singularity -the moment at which pathogen, environmental and digital data streams are integrated into a global surveillance system -we require a community united behind a vision in which public health and the attendant data belong to the public and behind the idea that we are a better, healthier society when the public is able to access and benefit from the data being collected about us and the pathogens we share the planet with.",17.01686129281234,8.370536639871785

An obvious way to provide off-hours access to an office building would be to furnish keys to all building occupants or to those who need to enter the facility after hours. This approach, however, can have disastrous consequences proportional to the size of the building and the number of occupants. A heavy workload and costly expense can be created by lost keys, keys not returned by departing tenant employees, and the necessity of rekeying building entrances and reissuing keys to building key holders every time a key has gone astray. In addition, there may be the problem of the unauthorized duplication of keys. To avoid all these consequences, most office buildings never issue building access keys to tenants but rely on some way of verifying a person's right to enter the building. This verification may involve the following procedures. Visual Recognition. Building security staff or a receptionist may verify on sight a person's right to enter. Several problems may result, however, from this form of verification. For example, someone who closely resembles a person authorized to enter may be admitted in error. Also, particularly if the building is large with a high population, it will be difficult for security staff or the receptionist to recognize all persons authorized to enter. If there is a change or substitution of the security staff or receptionist, the new person will not be familiar with the persons authorized to enter. This may result in the questioning of authorized persons who normally are never challenged and subsequent complaints to building management. Finally, if the security staff is distracted by another duty, an unauthorized person may gain entry without being observed. Authorization Documents. A document (a letter, a memorandum, or an e-mail) listing those authorized for after-hours access may be provided in advance to security staff at the building entrance. Persons requesting access will identify themselves to building security staff. Security will compare their name (which should be confirmed by a driver's license or other photo identification) with the names listed in the document. In many buildings, tenants will provide management with a written request on their own stationery listing the names of the persons involved and the time after-hours access is permitted.

Building gaps, separations, and porosity close to the pedestrian levels are extremely useful in improving air space for urban air ventilation circulation. 8) Increasing urban density has gained attention in recent worldwide discussions. Traditional wisdom attributes the decline of urban air ventilation to increasing urban density because of high urban frontal area density (FAD). This understanding is generally correct, and balancing the need to reduce land resource demand with designing more compact cities is also useful. The current study suggests that more insights should be gained to fine tune and design urban morphologies and building forms that ""optimize"" urban air ventilation.

We have evidence demonstrating that influenzavirus genes migrate across continents and animal species, and assemble themselves in combinations which are a threat to animal and human health, resulting in panzootics like H5N1 or pandemics like H1N1 2009. The latter contains a unique combination of genes from three species and two hemispheres. In a globalized environment, mapping gene movement across species and national borders and identifying mutations and gene constellations with pandemic potential or virulence determinants is essential to enact prevention and control strategies at a global level. This is in line with, and possibly the best example of, the 'One Health' vision: a multidisciplinary collaborative approach to improve the health of humans, animals and the environment endorsed by the UN Food & Agriculture Organisation, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the World Health Organisation. Vast improvements in capacity building have been achieved as a result of the H5N1 global crisis. Thousands of viral isolates with zoonotic potential have been obtained through surveillance efforts, although the genetic information has not been exploited fully. In addition, the circulation of influenzaviruses in certain species including dogs, pigs and horses has been neglected. Time has come to invest in a novel approach to influenzavirus infections, abandoning prefixed compartments linked to geographical origin or species of isolation, and analyse the influenza gene pool as one entity. We propose capitalising on existing achievements and investments to develop an international network and a permanent observatory which will improve our understanding of the dynamics of the influenzavirus gene pool in animals and humans. This will generate essential information to support both public and animal health. The ""One Flu"" initiative would result in international synergies, bridging gaps between medical and veterinary scientists, permanent monitoring of virus evolution and epidemiology and the best exploitation of investments in capacity building.

An expenditure of $400 million a year on the Global Virome Project-which is at the higher end of the Global Virome Project cost rangewould be equivalent to just 0·5% of the ongoing annual economic risk of $80 billion from pandemic influenza (and other readily transmissible viral diseases) and thus be justified as a prudential measure.

Pollutant source in Unit W3. As mentioned in Section 4.1, due to the presence of a low upstream building, the air flow direction in the windward wall stagnation area of the downstream target building changes from separately downward and upward totally into downward. When the pollutant source of an isolated building is located in the stagnation area (W3), the pollutant released from the source unit flows both upward and downward on the windward wall, which means that units W4 and W2 are both affected by the pollutant. However, the presence of a low upstream building changes the near-wall flow direction of the downstream target building. Owing to the recirculation vortex between the two buildings, the pollutant released from Unit W3 is mainly transported downward. As shown in Fig. 11c , owing to the presence of a low upstream building, the R k of Unit W4 decreases from 0.15% to become negligible and the R k of W2 and W1 is increased substantially from 0.30% and negligible to 6.76% and 8.32%, respectively, which is consistent with the flow characteristics introduced before. Similar to the windward wall, the presence of a low upstream building increases the R k of leeward units. The presence of a low upstream building has a negative effect, which turns units W1 and W2 into very dangerous places, in terms of airborne disease control. However, when a high upstream building is present, the R k of all units are negligible, with the exception of W4 and W2. Unit W2 is slightly affected by the high upstream building but the R k of Unit W4 is increased greatly, from 0.15% to 9.90%.

The capacity of hospitals to deal with the challenge from emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases due to climate change is of great importance to population health. This study aimed to explore the capacity of hospitals in China to deal with such challenges. Methods: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was utilized to gauge information regarding capacity of hospitals to deal with infectious diseases in the context of climate change among 611 clinical professionals whose roles pertained to infectious disease diagnosis, treatment and management in Anhui Province of China. Descriptive analysis and logistic regression analysis were performed on the data. Results: More than 90% of participants believed climate change would have an adverse influence on population health and infectious disease control in China. Most indicated that their hospitals were well prepared for emerging infectious diseases at present, and they considered that logistical support in hospitals (e.g. administrative and maintenance services) should be strengthened for future capacity building. The majority of participants suggested that effective prevention and control measures, more interdisciplinary collaborations, more funding in rural areas for health care, and improved access to facilities enabling online reporting of infectious diseases, were extremely important strategies in building capacity to curb the population health impact of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases due to climate change in China. Conclusions: Clinical professionals recognized that climate change will likely increase the transmission of infectious diseases. Although rural health care and hospitals' logistical support need to be improved, most professionals believed their hospitals to be capable of dealing with emerging diseases. They thought that interdisciplinary and cross-regional collaborations, together with necessary resource support (e.g. improved facilities for rural health care) would be important control strategies.",19.88475844988558,8.832588003131416

It has been suggested that a reliable governance mechanism for health may only surface once all actors understand health as a global public good insinuating that political and financial commitment should follow not only in times of emergency (a pandemic such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)) but also in the form of long-term capacity building and sustained cooperation for health (Kickbush 2005) . How will sustained cooperation emerge? To answer this question, we turn to Régime theory. The concept of régimes for global health governance can be used as a way to collectively operationalize national initiatives at the global level (Kickbush 1999a, b) . Régimes may be understood as ""sets of implicit or explicit principles, norms, rules and decision-making procedures around which actors expectations converge in a given area of international relations"" (Krasner 1983) . Régime theory can serve as an analytical lens to explore the mechanisms for health policy cooperation in Southeast Asia in a contemporary context. It accounts for the expansion of nonstate actors and civil society, the increased opportunities for multilevel dialog between stakeholders and the subsequent proliferation of legal instruments (Koehane and Nye 1972, 1974) . The emergence of the Framework Convention for Tobacco Control (2003) and the International Health Regulations (2005) as international legal treaties for global health, demonstrates the validity of régime theory for GHG. The incentive for cooperation between actors that are directly or indirectly involved in health at the national, regional, and global levels lies in the common health threats that transcend national borders and require cross-cutting multilevel governance solutions (Duit and Galaz 2008) . In sum therefore, cooperation for health governance stems from an ""amalgam of mutual interests"", and the number of players involved (Axelrod and Keohane 1985) .",18.72092830920645,8.777220033849774

While the impacts of foodborne illness may have been overshadowed by a host of other emerging infectious diseases in the past 3 decades, the impact of diarrheal disease occurring as a result of contaminated food remains profound. It is estimated that up to 70% of the 1.5 billion episodes of diarrhea occurring in children under 5 every year may be caused by foodborne contaminants. 27 FDA works to address food safety challenges in a number of ways. For example, through regulatory efforts such as FSMA, FDA is focusing on strengthening food safety systems through efforts to ensure product safety, modernize the oversight of imported foods, guard against intentional contamination, implement preventive controls in human and animal food/feed facilities, and ensure the safe transport of food and feed. Under FSMA, FDA has developed the International Capacity Building Plan, which charts a direction for how FDA prioritizes capacity building efforts based on risk and impact on public health, as well as FDA's partnerships with counterpart regulatory authorities, industry, and other organizations to achieve lasting food safety results. 28 Among its regulatory capacity efforts, FDA contributes to, and leverages, other global food safety efforts, including through supporting WHO's Foodborne Disease Burden Epidemiology Reference Group (FERG), which is working on a definitive report on the global burden of foodborne diseases; strengthening surveillance systems, alert networks, and information platforms, such as the International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN); and working closely in the development and support of the Global Food Safety Partnership (GFSP), a public-private partnership housed at the World Bank that is dedicated to strengthening food safety systems.",27.659619635901713,13.495047520892472

It is a three-in-one strategy to help countries: (1) strengthen the generic capacities for managing emerging diseases, (2) improve pandemic readiness, and (3) build up to meet the IHR core capacity requirements for surveillance and response. APSED (2005) identified five programme areas as priorities for national capacity-building, namely surveillance and response, laboratory, zoonoses, infection control and risk communication. Through the collective efforts of countries and areas, WHO and partners, considerable progress has been made in all five APSED (2005) capacity areas. For example, most countries have now established event-based surveillance systems to detect public health events including disease outbreaks. Trained rapid response teams (RRTs) are able to conduct field investigations quickly. The capacities of the national influenza centres have been significantly improved. These capacities were tested through a realworld global public health event -Pandemic (H1N1) 2009. The pandemic response clearly demonstrated the value of regional investment in capacity-building. 15 The 2005 Strategy has been recently revised in response to requests from countries and areas following recent developments and evolving needs. The updated Strategy, now called the Asia Pacific Strategy for Emerging Diseases (2010), also known as APSED (2010), was endorsed at the sixty-first Session of the Regional Committee for the Western Pacific in October 2010. 16 It builds on the experiences and accomplishments gained from implementing APSED (2005) and takes into account the key lessons learnt from the pandemic response, the needs expressed by countries and areas and the technical advice provided by experts during the intensive country and regional-level consultations between July 2009 and October 2010. Table 1 shows the similarities and differences between APSED (2005) and APSED (2010). APSED (2010) aims to build sustainable national and regional capacities and partnerships to ensure public health security through preparedness planning, prevention, early detection and rapid response to emerging diseases and other public health emergencies.

In an economy, these services and opportunities provide employment or provide credit for investment in producing goods to generate income. In education, they include providing appropriately sited schools, making universal opportunities for school attendance, and access to the curriculum through an appropriate language policy and training suffi cient teachers.

These challenges and the attendant lessons learned were detailed in Learning from SARS: Renewal of public health in Canada -Report of the National Advisory Committee on SARS and Public Health (1) . Key among them were the need for better coordination of response actions taken by the multiple levels of government and the need for increased or renewed recognition of the public health threat posed by emerging or re-emerging infectious disease. Although the emergence of SARS was not predicted, an influenza pandemic was and still is considered inevitable in the context of public health emergency preparedness. As such, in an effort to formally recognise and widely share Federal/Provincial/ Territorial (FPT) coordinated planning, the Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan (CPIP) was first published in 2004, incorporating lessons learned from SARS. With an updated and evergreen CPIP released in 2006, Canada was much better prepared to respond to the 2009 emergence, spread and ensuing global pandemic of novel H1N1 influenza virus that originated in Mexico (2). Canada benefited from significant capacity-building investments, such as assuring access to a domestic pandemic vaccine and stockpiles of antiviral drugs. As it turned out, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic was not as severe as some of its predecessors. Hence, during and post-H1N1, national governments and the World Health Organization (WHO) recognized that a more flexible and adaptable response to future pandemics was needed to reflect local and regional circumstances (2). The Ebola virus disease outbreak that began in West Africa in late 2013 was not only a severe disease with high morbidity and mortality, it was also an epidemic of fear. This outbreak demonstrated the fatal impact of poor communications and the importance of accounting for local cultural beliefs and local leadership in the response. It was also a poignant example of the need to strengthen public health emergency response capacity in every country and to better coordinate rapid global response capacity, including research, if we are to protect others as well as ourselves (3, 4) .",15.367062853321308,8.31558647582005

Whereas it sometimes arrives at the same conclusions reached by traditional bioethical approaches, 164 employing it as a complimentary approach to the moral quandaries generated by pandemic influenza should yield additional nuances and insights visà-vis resolving the associated moral concerns. Care ethics emphasizes varying degrees of care within relational contexts ranging from the personal sphere to the realm of moral strangers. Hence, it is an other and people-centric moral lens. It has 162 Henk ten Have, Global Bioethics: An Introduction (Routledge, 2016). P. 113. 163 Peter A Singer et al., ""Ethics and Sars: Lessons from Toronto,"" British Medical Journal 327, no. 7427 (2003) . Pp. 1342-1343. 164 Edwards, ""Is there a Distinctive Care Ethics?"" P. 185. been applied to diverse relational contexts including everyday lives, professional practices, social and public policies, as well as international relations. 165 For scholars like Steven Edwards, ethics of care uses a distinct ontological commitment to realize its outcomes as well as justify its stance. 166 It is an attempt to re-conceptualize and renegotiate the moral landscape in order to give room for a plurality of values. 167 Some have argued that the removal of friendship with its altruistic emotional sequelae and the subversion of virtue ethics from the sphere of morality were some key factors that warranted the moral change which birthed the ethics of care framework. 168 While EOC is also linked with gender-based morality which undergirded campaigns for equal employment opportunities between the sexes, legal rights, reforms of family life and sexual standards, and better education 169 ; scholars like Noddings have pointed out that it is broader and deeper than feminist ethics. 170 To be sure, one of its major impetus is the call for the expression of higher capabilities. 171 Care ethics also encapsulates a spectrum of ideas. For Kittay, care constitutes an ""achievement term"" such that caring occurs only when specific acts of care have been carried out. 172 In this vein, intentionality would not qualify as part of the baggage of care rhetoric. This obviously has some pragmatic appeal. Most people, for instance, would only appreciate care if it helps contribute towards relieving their current distress. Yet, caring may also constitute a general attitude and an orientation which may provide appropriate background conditions for shaping responses to others' needs and states of distresses. Also, one may care but situational constraints may limit how a caring impulse may translate into pragmatic ends. Therefore, that someone simply ""lacked opportunity"" to show care as Apostle Paul writes in his epistle to the Philippians does not necessarily indicate the absence of care. 173 Hence, caring cannot be reduced only to materialistic terms. One way to distinguish the general caring orientation from specific acts of care is to refer to each as ""caring about"" and ""caring for"" respectively. 174 Care ethics locates morality within the ambiance of family, friends, and colleagues, and ultimately towards the public sphere. 175 It rejects the independent and atomistic notion of the self and champions an inter-dependent and inter-related view. 176 This approach grants EOC a psychological gestalt to which people brought up in caring relationships, at least in the early phases of their lives, can readily identify with. It thus partly appeals to Kohlberg's theory of moral development. Here, the emphasis is put on the foundational roles of trust and its place in fostering a deepened sense of reciprocity within a social context of inequality. 177 Not surprisingly, some ethicists describe caring as the primary virtue which offers a general account of right versus wrong actions as well as political justice. 178 Whereas the informal social contract idea underlies inter-personal and stateindividual relationships, 179 the care ethical lens may be applied to the personal sphere as well as social institutions 180 due to its multiple ways of situating relationality. 181 Indeed, EOC focuses on attentiveness and sensitivity to the needs of others 182 and offers a moral compass for teasing out delicate boundaries between obligation-based ethics and responsibility-based ethics. As such, it seeks to transcend the depersonalized realm of asking ""what obligations do I have to Mr. X"" to the humane realm of asking ""how can I help Mr. X"" in scenarios of moral crises. 183 Since caring embodies an activity, a set of activities or a labor of care from one person to the other, it presupposes that the capacity for receiving care 184 will be present in the recipient(s) of care.",14.967527548438095,8.245841284581049

Investment is a key concept in the new paradigm; it is an idea that the return on an investment in surveillance capacity and cross-border cooperation is the improved health of all nations and all global citizens.

Notable among these are the recent capacity-building efforts of the Human Heredity and Health in Africa (H3Africa) Consortium, the H3ABioNet continent-wide bioinformatics network and The World Bank (Table 1); these programmes have been discussed elsewhere (Adoga et al., 2014, Bishop et al., 2015, Folarin et al., 2014, Karikari, 2015a). In Africa, many of the BGS capacity-building efforts till date have focussed on strengthening the scientific capacity in leading universities and research institutes (Bishop et al., 2015, H3Africa Consortium et al., 2014, Karikari, 2015a). For example, since its establishment in 1996, the South African National Bioinformatics Network, the first BGS-related scientific network in Africa, established regional nodes (centres of excellence) at leading institutions to develop BGS activities in the country (Bishop et al., 2015, Masiga and Isokpehi, 2004). More recently, H3ABioNet established nodes mostly at African institutions with BGS capacities to influence the development of the field (Bishop et al., 2015, H3Africa Consortium et al., 2014). According to data from Webometrics (http://www.webometrics.info), a leading academic ranking initiative, most of these nodes are located at highly-ranked institutions (in their respective countries). Rightly, locating nodes at leading institutions provides opportunities for intra- and inter-institutional partnerships aimed at propagating BGS activities. However, while this may be an excellent approach to facilitate the expansion of the disciplines, it seems that activities of this nature mostly favour scientists who have been previously exposed to BGS, leaving behind those who may have no appreciation of these areas yet. For instance, although the H3ABioNet nodes and other scientific organisations do organise training programmes for African scientists (Bishop et al., 2015, Karikari, 2015a), these programmes often require applicants to have some level of basic or intermediate understanding in specific topics, a requirement that naturally favours applicants from institutions where BGS activities can be found. Although foundation courses are also sometimes offered, only a limited number of applicants can be accepted onto such courses. Furthermore, the existing BGS courses are often held in the cities, which is a disadvantage to scientists based at rural institutions due to transportation problems and general lack of funding.",20.5499060423121,13.964161369684417

Highly pathogenic avian influenza (Fig. 4) was the target of several multisectoral, One Health capacity building efforts by FAO, the World Bank, and other partners between 2005 and 2010 [14,15]. Projects included the provision of equipment (such as disinfectant sprayers, personal protective equipment, and sample collection equipment) at the regional level.

However, despite these challenges, efforts to create One Health linkages across ministries can provide a foundation upon which to build future capacity. For example, previous training of local environment and animal health agents to report poultry and waterfowl die-offs has established personnel linkages between the sectors at the community level which, while in need of strengthening and reinforcing, are largely still viable, based on our discussions with local-level agents across the different sectors. Efforts to strengthen capacities may be even more successful if built upon endemic diseases, for which cases will be identified with some regularity, such as brucellosis or rabies. As a direct result of the assessment, joint renewed interest between MOH and MOL to implement national rabies control facilitated their first-ever participation at the Pan-African Rabies Control Network (PARACON) meeting in June 2016 [18] and will support them in efforts to achieve WHO/FAO/OIE's Zero by 30 global strategic plan to end human deaths from dog-mediated rabies by 2030 [19]. The process of conducting the assessment itself also served as a catalyst for information-sharing between ministries on various zoonotic diseases and generated greater interest in future opportunities for closer collaboration. This outcome has also been observed with the use of other One Health tools, such as CDC's Zoonotic Disease Prioritization Tool (ZDPT), which also serves to assist countries in establishing a consensus list of priority zoonotic diseases [20,21]. While developed at approximately the same time as the methodology described here, the ZDPT uses a more formalized decision-making process, which may be advantageous in cases where there is conflict between sectors or objectivity is highly valued, or to determine more quantitatively the relative contributions of each sector.",21.923055164507918,11.385124752295178

First, there is insufficient access to antimicrobials for the millions of people who require them and are currently without them. Second, we need to conserve existing antimicrobials to retain their effectiveness. Third, innovation of new drugs and technologies is needed to reduce reliance on existing antimicrobials and to facilitate reductions in their overall use.19
19Hoffman, S. J., & Outterson, K. (2015). What will it take to address the global threat of antibiotic resistance? Journal of Law, Medicine and Ethics, 43(2), 363–368. As Figure 1 shows, these challenges are interconnected and need to be addressed simultaneously and in a meaningful way. For example, if we were to promote access to antimicrobials without conservation and innovation, then the increased use of antimicrobials would speed up the development of resistance. Conservation constrains access, meaning that millions might be unfairly denied effective treatment of their illness. Conservation alone would also further undermine innovation, as efforts to reduce antimicrobial use would result in a smaller market for them and fewer incentives for pharmaceutical companies to develop new antimicrobials. Finally, innovation without access would be unfair, while innovation without conservation would be wasteful, as new resistance would inevitably follow the development of new drugs. International law offers an opportunity to strike a bargain across these three pillars, with different countries contributing and gaining more or less in accordance to their needs, capacity, and specialization (Figure 1).",17.50992286752203,8.908757289178059

This was made possible by the substantial funding made available through international research consortia. As the situation dictated an emergency response, the plasmapheresis material introduced for use in the present trials is unlikely to be an optimal choice for the concerned national transfusion centers. A transition to simpler, nonautomated systems might be indicated. Furthermore, pathogen reduction is an expensive procedure and unlikely to be a priority for resource-constrained settings, where the prerogative is the provision of safe basic blood banking services.

This is because emergency victims often face geographical isolation as a result of damage to local infrastructure such as energy, road and communication facilities.5 Consequently, the arrival of external rescue support may experience two or more days of delay.6 But rescue efforts in the first couple of days in disastrous events are critical.7 Community and household preparedness in self-rescue efforts prior to the arrival of external assistance may result in the difference between the chance of survival and death.8 Empirical evidence shows that sufficient household preparedness can significantly mitigate the negative consequences of emergency events.9

After six decades of efforts, the mechanisms with regard to killing bacteria of macrophages were gradually elucidated, but there were still no definite answers about how macrophages became more efficient bacterial killers. In 1973, North and his colleagues found that independent cellular factors could also promote resistance of infection without involvement of pathogens 2. Almost at the same time, David indicated that lymphocytes were the major antigen-specific cells responsible for microbicidal activation of macrophages 3. Soon after that, interferon (IFN)-γ, produced by lymphocytes, was identified as the first factor for interaction between macrophages and lymphocytes 4. It transforms resting macrophages into active ones which have stronger antigen presenting capacity and complement mediated phagocytosis, and secrete more pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as toxic mediators.

Supportive evidence for this comes from studies of focal damage to the left middle temporal gyrus, suggesting that this damage results in profound language comprehension and semantic deficits (Hart and Gordon, 1990; Hillis and Caramazza, 1991; Kertesz et al., 1993; Dronkers et al., 2004) . We likewise showed that unrelated paraphasias made during connected speech-real words for which the target was unrelated or unknown-associated with left posterior temporal (especially middle and inferior temporal gyri) and left temporoparietal damage, indicating that disruption in areas recruited early on in the lexical-semantic system likely lead to verbal, but not phonological, paraphasias. Further, we demonstrate that damaged cortex in left posterior middle temporal gyrus area associated with semantically related and unrelated paraphasias made during both naming and connected speech, highlighting a role for this area of cortex in lexical selection. Our results, which evaluate verbal paraphasias for the first time in connected speech, support prior suppositions from single-word retrieval that the left posterior temporal lobe, in particular, has an early position in lexical-semantic access, at least during naming from visual recognition, and that the more anterior left temporal lobe, an area recruited downstream of the processes occurring in the left posterior temporal lobe, is an area whose role is more specific, likely for semantic entity knowledge.",13.994730335347187,8.989917754784539

We call for immediate sharing of the individual participant data from COVID-19 studies to support collaborative efforts in building more rigorously developed prediction models and validating (evaluating) existing models. The aforementioned predictors identified in multiple included studies could be considered as candidate predictors for new models.

So, it is expected that the higher the mobility and interaction among people in an area, the higher the risk of spreading infectious diseases. We can call it ""Mobility-Interaction Effect"". The reasoning behind such hypothesis is that people have the tendency to amass in an area which provides better environment, livelihood, education, and other amenities. The aggregation process continues further with the economic development, forcing people to move low density areas to high density areas. As a result, people living in high density areas have higher mobility and interaction among themselves than the people living in low density areas [9] .

Using monthly airline passenger arrivals coming from all 48 countries and territories in the Americas known to have local Zika virus transmission from 2014-2017, we did not detect any large deviations in air traffic to Cuba when Zika virus was being introduced elsewhere in the Caribbean (starting in mid-2015; Fig. 4A ) (Faria et al., 2017; Metsky et al., 2017) .

From the beginning of this emergency in Italy, the ICU bed capacity was identified as a major bottleneck and strong efforts, commensurate resources and attention have been dedicated to this direction from government, planners, media and academics. These efforts are ongoing. Italy has managed to increase its initial capacity of approximately 5200 ICU beds. Assuming that half of these beds can be exclusively used for COVID-19 patients, around 2600 ICU beds were available at baseline. As of 23 March, 3204 ICU beds were under use for these patients in Italy (17), neatly above baseline capacity under those assumptions. There is evidence that ICU capacity in Lombardy was approximately 720 beds pre crisis (16) while 1183 were used on 23 March (17) . The most difficult situation is described in Lombardy where critical care capacity has reached, according to regional government, its maximum capacity (24). There are better news in other regions which are currently increasing ICU capacity such as Veneto (n=325), Toscana (n=745), Campania (n=490) or Piemonte (n=160). Others did not report. These four Italian regions could be adding approximately 1720 new beds. This number is quite similar to numbers collected by the media, 1850 (25) .

Specifically, we use all COVID-19 genomic data available in the public domain so far to (1) underscore the importance of access to raw data and to (2) demonstrate that existing community efforts in curation and deployment of biomedical software can reliably support rapid, reproducible research during global health crises.

A significant portion of COVID-19 patients develop pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), necessitating ventilator support. Some health systems do not have the capacity to accommodate this surge in ventilator demand, leading to shortages and inevitable mortality. Some clinicians have, of necessity, jerry-rigged ventilators to support multiple patients, but these devices lack protected air streams or individualized controls for each patient. Moreover, some have not been tested under conditions of ARDS. We have developed the Individualized System for Augmenting Ventilator Efficacy (iSAVE), a rapidly deployable platform to more safely use a single ventilator to simultaneously support multiple critically-ill patients. The iSAVE enables patient-specific volume and pressure control and incorporates safety features to mitigate cross-contamination between patients and flow changes due to patient interdependencies within the respiratory circuit. Here we demonstrate through simulated and in vivo pig evaluation the capacity of the iSAVE to support a range of respiratory clinical states. By leveraging off-theshelf components that are readily available to intensive care unit (ICU) caregivers, the iSAVE could potentially be translated for human application to expand the ventilation capacity of hospitals using existing ventilators, minimizing the need to procure additional ventilators.",11.786014177484127,8.113496695289
