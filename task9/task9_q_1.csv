A first step would be for the professional colleges to create a forum to engage their memberships and encourage the exchange of views on the issue. Such an exchange could then inform the development of formal position statements on the duty to care during communicable disease outbreaks, as well as the development of clear and unambiguous guidelines regarding the professional rights and responsibilities and the ethical duties and obligations of HCPs during such outbreaks. Such statements ought to be made publicly available (e.g., prominently posted on the websites of professional health care colleges and associations) in order to encourage sustained dialogue on the issues raised by professional colleges. A next step would be to foster public debate and dialogue on the positions taken by the various health care professions. To promote this public debate, a working group at the University of Toronto Joint Centre for Bioethics has produced an ethical framework to guide preparedness planning for pandemic influenza, based in part on experiences and study of the SARS crisis [27] . The framework presents a 15-point, value-based ethical guide for pandemic planning, including the value of duty to care. This report has been made publicly available via the internet and the use of webcasting and electronic town hall meetings are being planned to facilitate an open exchange. It is of utmost importance to promote a public discourse on these issues and, most importantly, to give a voice to all those who would be directly affected by a communicable disease outbreak.

Natural PALs consist of rearranged V gene repertoires of immune or non-immune (naïve) donors. This type of antibody library has been constructed from different species including human, non-human primates, mouse, chicken, sheep, camel, and cattle. Immune libraries are considered as the most useful type of PALs for infectious diseases. They are constructed from immunized donors and typically exploited to obtain antibodies against a particular target antigen, e.g. an infectious viral or bacterial agent. A great advantage of immune PALs is that V genes harbor hypermutations and are affinity matured, though the toxicity of some antigens and ethical issues make it impossible to immunize human subjects with toxic, immunosuppressive, and life-threatening antigens. If immunization is not possible or is ethically impracticable, the construction of non-immune or naïve PALs is an alternative. These libraries are generated from rearranged V gene repertoires of B cells derived from healthy and non-immunized donors. Accordingly, ethical issues with regard to the active immunization of humans and animals are avoided. Also, specific antibodies against non-immunogenic and toxic antigens can also be obtained. However, the isolated antibodies generally show low affinity. This emphasizes the need to improve binding affinity of the selected antibodies by using affinity maturation in vitro [36, 37] . Unlike natural PALs that represent the naturally occurring diversity in the antibody repertoire, synthetic PALs harbor artificial diversity in V gene segments. In these PALs, V genes are reconstructed in vitro partially (semi-synthetic PALs) or completely (fully synthetic PALs). The in vitro reconstruction of V genes is made via randomization of complementarity determining regions (CDRs) [36] . The source of V genes for introducing diversity into semisynthetic PALs might be un-rearranged germline V genes, rearranged V genes from immune and/or naïve donors and single or multiple framework scaffolds of antibodies. The randomization of CDRs in particular VH-CDR3 is frequently used for the construction of semi-synthetic PALs. VH-CDR3 is known as the most diverse loop among six CDRs of human antibodies in terms of both length and sequence. Fully synthetic PALs are constructed by using human antibody frameworks with randomized CDR cassettes. The production of these libraries is based on in silico design and de novo synthesis. Human Combinatorial Antibody Library (HuCAL) is an inspiring example of a fully synthetic PAL that was generated by analysis of sequence and structure of frameworks and CDR loop regions [38] . In this library, nucleotide randomization was introduced into the VH and VL-CDR3 regions of different synthetic master frameworks. Fully synthetic PALs are currently being investigated for further improvement in order to achieve antibodies with favorable clinical properties. These adjustments aim to optimize synthetic binding sites with finely tuned affinity, size, and valency, as well as to minimize the number of T cell epitopes.",17.88286989729411,12.384789051913046

On the other hand, ""fast breeding"" mammals complete their reproductive cycle within their first year of life and place emphasis on fertility as their survival strategy as a species [71, 72] . Control of the population size of ""fast breeding"" animals, such as dogs [73] , is more effectiveness when relying on measures that restrict entry of new individuals into the population as opposed to subjecting animals to euthanasia, a practice that reduces adults' survival. The fast versus slow breeding rationale, the sensitive ethical issues, and the low effectiveness of euthanizing animals observed in regions where this practice has been applied [20, 61, 74] prompted us to only consider sterilization, and not culling, as an alternative control strategy in our study.

Viral stocks are susceptible to inactivation by some chemical and physical treatments. IVs consist of a concentrated viral stock that has been treated with a chemical reagent, such as binary ethylenimine or formaldehyde, which completely abolish virus replication [40] . Some viruses are difficult to attenuate because they may change their antigenic properties or they remain virulent after few passages in cell culture [41] . The latter is the case for FMDV, an animal virus from the picornavirus family. When a virus cannot be attenuated with sufficient reliability, inactivation has been proven to be a successful vaccination strategy, as documented for FMDV, influenza, or hepatitis A vaccines [41] [42] [43] [44] . Some security issues may arise however, if the chemical compound does not reach all virus particles, for example because some viral particles tend to form compact aggregates, and the preparation still contains a portion of live viruses. Inactivated viruses are usually not efficiently presented by MHC class I molecules, which stimulate the cellular immune response. IV preparations include adjuvants which are chemical compounds that act on antigen-presenting cells enhancing the immunogenicity of the vaccine [45, 46] .

Today, approximately 75% of newly emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are zoonoses that result from various anthropogenic, genetic, ecologic, socioeconomic, and climatic factors. These interrelated driving forces make it difficult to predict and to prevent zoonotic EIDs. Although significant improvements in environmental and medical surveillance, clinical diagnostic methods, and medical practices have been achieved in the recent years, zoonotic EIDs remain a major global concern, and such threats are expanding, especially in less developed regions. The current Ebola epidemic in West Africa is an extreme stark reminder of the role animal reservoirs play in public health and reinforces the urgent need for globally operationalizing a One Health approach. The complex nature of zoonotic diseases and the limited resources in developing countries are a reminder that the need for implementation of Global One Health in lowresource settings is crucial. The Veterinary Public Health and Biotechnology (VPH-Biotec) Global Consortium launched the International Congress on Pathogens at the Human-Animal Interface (ICOPHAI) in order to address important challenges and needs for capacity building. The inaugural ICOPHAI (Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 2011) and the second congress (Porto de Galinhas, Brazil, 2013) were unique opportunities to share and discuss issues related to zoonotic infectious diseases worldwide. In addition to strong scientific reports in eight thematic areas that necessitate One Health implementation, the congress identified four key capacity-building needs: (1) development of adequate science-based risk management policies, (2) skilled-personnel capacity building, (3) accredited veterinary and public health diagnostic laboratories with a shared database, and (4) improved use of existing natural resources and implementation.

However, the emphasis of reforms should be on enabling effective research and surveillance to be conducted, where common benefits are possible. In this regard, the concerns of Australian policy-makers and experts on this issue are not unique. A recent WHO review points to the need to engage with affected communities to establish the conditions and protections under which it is acceptable for surveillance to take place and develop institutional mechanisms that ensure ethical issues are systematically addressed before data collection, use and dissemination [45] . Given that these technologies are already available and have the potential to enhance the capacity of Australian and other health authorities to investigate and prevent outbreaks of infectious disease, with their attendant social and economic costs, the development of clear ethical and legal guidance is urgently needed.

Several important ethical issues are unanticipated, unacknowledged, and unplanned for.

The NISPPI also pays scant attention to use of vaccines and antivirals, border issues and cooperation with neighboring countries, justification for delineated actions, and outbreak simulations. Feedback and communication plans are nebulous, while leadership, coordination, and budgeting are quite detailed. With respect to presentation, the NISPPI's text is organized around five thematic areas. While each area implicates ethical issues, NISPPI treatment of these areas consistently fails to address them. Conclusions: Our analysis reveals a lack of consideration of ethics by the NISPPI. We contend that, while the plan's content and fundamental assumptions provide support for implementation of the delineated public health actions, its consideration of ethical issues is poor. Deficiencies include a failure to incorporate guidelines that ensure fair distribution of scarce resources and a lack of justification for delineated procedures.

The model explicitly contemplates the four primary functions of public health as regards the use of restrictive measures in infectous disease outbreaks, namely, response, enforcement, support, and oversight.

Considering the prevailing situation, it would be expected that any efforts in managing the emergence and re-emergence of infectious disease would place more attention and resources in addressing the root causes, especially in developing and low-resource countries. Additionally, one will expect that countries and regions with relatively lower capacity to detect these diseases should receive more attention as the pace with which disease outbreaks are recognized is critical for establishing effective control efforts (Kluberg et al. 2016) . However, existing evidence suggests that global resources devoted to countering the emergence of infectious diseases are poorly allocated, with the majority of the scientific and surveillance effort focused on countries from where the next important EID is least likely to originate (Jones et al. 2009 ).

Although the mechanistic explanation is not available, one mechanism which is common to some of them is by their effect on cell membrane transport through pores.

While EVD-infected expatriate health personnel were flown to their countries for treatment, local EVD-infected health personnel were not accorded such treatment. This attitude was motivated by the failure to recognize the similarity between citizens in rich and poor countries which emerging health threats has exposed us to in our increasingly interconnected interdependent world. It further reflects the discrepancy that existed in international health in the past which does not longer hold today. This calls for a paradigm shift from the charity-based approach to a solidaristic one (West-Oram and Bux 2016, 7) . An approach that acknowledges our global interdependence and shared vulnerability to global health threats such as EIDs; and recognizes that if a neighbour's home is on fire, efforts must be made by all to put off the fire, otherwise it may spread and consume more homes (including ours) that may even be further away from the initial home on fire! In fact, the WHO has proposed solidarity as one of the key ethical principles in the management of infectious disease outbreaks globally (WHO 2016) . This principle justifies engagement in collective action in the face of common threats such as EIDs, while supporting efforts to overcome inequalities that undermine the well-being of minorities and groups suffering from discrimination. One potential application of this principle globally is the provision of financial, technical, and scientific assistance by high income and developed countries to low-income and impoverished countries to boost their capacities to prevent and manage ongoing and future EIDs.

As with any new medical intervention there are safety concerns that arise which might be deleterious to the public health. Concerns regarding vaccines often follow a path that starts with the hypothesis of a potential adverse event that is impulsively announced to the public without having reproducible studies to confirm this hypothesis, and thus it would take the public several years to regain trust in the vaccine. A notable example in the recent history would be of the paper published by Andrew Wakefield in the British medical journal the Lancet in 1998, linking the MMR vaccine to autism. However, his research was discredited and the paper was retracted from the journal after it was proven that actually there is no link between MMR vaccine and autism as per the systemic review by the Cochrane library (59) . The battle against vaccines did not reach a halt, and there are still ongoing campaigns that come from religious, political, community-based, and even individual-based grounds raising even ethical issues regarding the mandatory vaccinations proposed by the government. According to the CDC, this year 95% of the children were vaccinated in the U.S., leaving 5% unvaccinated due to religious and philosophical exemptions or even parental refusal due to the fear of vaccine's side effects and concerns regarding autism from vaccines (60); this is still a critical number since the unvaccinated would pose risk of outbreaks even among the immunized, which necessitates the need for additional awareness campaigns regarding the importance of vaccination since vaccines remain the only plausible measure of protection against preventable diseases. Actually, a trend was reported in the health news lately, in the U.S., that pediatricians refuse to offer medical care for children whose parents declined their vaccination.",19.061924110483947,10.543506488920388

Many countries have implemented local training programs with guidance from local experts; however, most of these programs lack oversight from a larger governing body or society, such as the American Board of Pediatrics, the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, or the Joint Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine of Australia and New Zealand. This leads not only to discrepancies in the provision of care but also to duplication of efforts in regions already struggling with scarce resources. Attempts at creation of pediatric critical care training programs through international collaboration have begun in several places, including both Ecuador and Kenya. 1 These partnerships seek to address the issues of implementation of an educational curriculum, the applicability to the local health care systems, diseases, and culture and the long-term sustainability.

Public support for unpalatable measures is more likely if citizens understand the issues, and policy implementation reflects community values and preferences. To this end, citizens' juries have been employed in the UK, Australia, the US and elsewhere [69] [70] [71] [72] to explore similar issues and identify citizens' preferences. They represent informed public opinion better than other social research methods (e.g. surveys or focus groups) because they give participants factual information, bring them into a structured and constructive dialogue with experts, provide them with time to reflect and deliberate, and allow them to represent their views directly to policymakers. To be successful, One Health needs to be about more than disease prevention and control. The dynamic, unpredictable effects and risks to peoples' lives of EIDs necessitate a public health and biosecurity infrastructure equipped to address the ethical problems that arise. EID management must therefore be based on normative principles as well as local knowledge, operational experience and disease-specific scientific and economic evidence. This means that governments and policy-makers need to explain and justify the values that underlie decision-making and engage the public in discussions about ethical choices, so that when difficult decisions arise in the face of uncertainty, they will be accepted as fair and essential for the public good [47] . This necessitates that the guiding values and likely ethical choices need to be articulated in a formal statement in advance, as in the heat of emerging health threat, decision makers will be under pressure from many sources to 'do something quickly'.",26.020735407272305,12.55629996313628

When a new EID threat emerges there are rarely ready-made solutions and health policymakers and practitioners are often forced to make tragic choices that may contravene widely held values. Considerations must include the need to protect public health and the wider social, economic and environmental impacts of proposed interventions. Economic and political interests can complicate the decisionmakers' motives and decision-maker uncertainty is compounded by policy decisions becoming entangled in political, ethical and legal considerations [31] [32] [33] . As events surrounding the EBOV outbreak in West Africa illustrate, the importance placed on a specific EID threat at any one time also depends on who is setting the agenda [34] . Therefore to be successfully implemented, the One Health approach must address a range of socio-political, ethical and legal challenges that arise as a consequence of the spread of infection within and between species.

Initial codes matching data extracts were collated by labelling and assigning a selection of unique identifiers of text within each data item. The second phase proceeded by reviewing and refining themes in which the connections between concepts (such as planning and public health infrastructure) were explored to help build categories and interrelationships. Here, we considered whether predefined themes and sub-themes formed a coherent pattern and if not, whether this was problematic. Themes that did not fit particular data extracts were redefined or discarded. The third phase involved searching selective coding, where predefined themes were further defined and refined.

These may draw in a range of different actors and encompass a variety of diplomatic activities depending on the situation at hand. For example, when politicians and community groups in several states in Northern Nigeria ceased supporting polio vaccination in 2003, international diplomacy efforts were undertaken to restart the polio campaign, bringing together the U.S. (with representatives from the State Department, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other agencies), the United Nations, WHO, the Organization of the Islamic Conference (currently called the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation), the African Union, Bill Gates, vaccine manufacturers, and others. 19 In another example, a broad set of diplomatic actors engaged in a series of formal and informal negotiations with representatives of the Indonesian government when it refused to share H5N1 (avian influenza) virus samples with the Global Influenza Surveillance Network beginning in 2006. The Indonesian government was concerned that the country did not receive benefits from sharing these samples, but its actions threatened efforts to track the potential emergence of an H5N1 pandemic. The parties eventually resolved the immediate issue at hand, but discussions around benefit-sharing and pandemic influenza surveillance and prevention continue even today. 19 Lastly, there has been growing recognition of the important role of U.S. ambassadors in health diplomacy, largely driven by the creation of PEFPAR in 2003, which brought significant new resources, not to mention a complex new program, to U.S. overseas missions. 21 Indeed, the work of the new Office of Global Health Diplomacy at the State Department is focused squarely on the role of ambassadors, which ''will be elevated as they pursue diplomatic strategies and partnerships within countries to foster better health outcomes.'' 3",20.035235093676434,11.99698850942173

In an increasingly interdependent world, it is in the long-term interests of every country to have safe, prosperous, and healthy populations in partner countries, and the diplomatic community would do well to recognize that the global health agenda is a strong tool to achieve these goals. Likewise, global health experts could make greater efforts to understand and engage with foreign policy practitioners by keeping diplomatic leadership and embassy staff well informed of their activities and by clearly drawing the link between these activities and the broader policy objectives of foreign policy. Global health proponents also have additional opportunities to seek more visibility and to push for a seat at the table within the context of a broader set of international diplomatic issues with health implications, such as climate change and human trafficking. Still, in light of the difficult budgetary environment faced by many donor countries and some of the inherent tensions between foreign policy and global health objectives, the extent and impact of GHD going forward remain difficult to predict.

In contrast, in many instances of public health practice, collection and use of information or human biological specimens can be conducted without a written informed consent document and without obtaining permission to store the samples for future use. However, a problem could arise if an investigator wants to use these samples, collected initially for public health purposes, for research. Current research practice calls for obtaining consent for the use of specimens in future research that may not be known at the time they are collected. Samples obtained in a nonresearch context without such provisions may require going back to get consent from sampled individuals, which could be logistically difficult, if not impossible. For example, samples with no identifying information could not be traced back to the individuals from whom they were obtained. Additionally, if a considerable time has elapsed between the collection of identifiable samples and the plan to use them in research, it could be difficult to locate the individuals.

Despite the efforts at controlling this disease, it is unclear why dengue remains an issue in affluent countries. A better understanding of dengue epidemiology and its burden, and those of chikungunya virus and Zika virus which share vectors with dengue, is required to prevent the emergence of these diseases in highincome countries in the future. The purpose of this review was to assess the relative burden of dengue in four high-income countries and to appraise the similarities and differences in dengue transmission. We searched PubMed, ISI Web of Science, and Google Scholar using specific keywords for articles published up to 05 May 2016. We found that outbreaks rarely occur where only Aedes albopictus is present. The main similarities between countries uncovered by our review are the proximity to dengue-endemic countries, the presence of a competent mosquito vector, a largely nonimmune population, and a lack of citizens' engagement in control of mosquito breeding. We identified important epidemiological and environmental issues including the increase of local transmission despite control efforts, population growth, difficulty locating larval sites, and increased human mobility from neighboring endemic countries. Budget cuts in health and lack of practical vaccines contribute to an increased risk. To be successful, dengue-control programs for high-income countries must consider the epidemiology of dengue in other countries and use this information to minimize virus importation, improve the control of the cryptic larval habitat, and engage the community in reducing vector breeding. Finally, the presence of a communicable disease center is critical for managing and reducing future disease risks.",16.18124290190931,9.380093905915604

In such situations it is necessary, and in fact mandated by international law [47, 48] , to utilize methods for allocating resources that are both equitable and maximize the benefit to the population at large [45] . Such methods are referred to as triage. Human rights, humanitarian laws [48] and strict adherence to ethical practices, such as transparency and accountability, must be observed when triage protocols are being developed [46, 47] , A full exploration of the ethical issues related to triage can be found in the framework developed by the Joint Centre for Bioethics [44] . Prior to recent pandemic planning initiatives, no triage systems had been developed for use in critical care for medical illnesses. Illness severity scoring systems used in critical care research have a reasonable ability to predict ICU outcome. However, they are not intended to predict mortality in the individual patient and are cumbersome to use and impractical when human resources are scarce. Although validated for predicting outcome, they have not been validated for guiding, or more specifically restricting, treatment. Christian et al, have recently published the first comprehensive triage protocol designed for use during a pandemic [49] . This protocol has been incorporated into the Ontario Pandemic Influenza Plan [39] . The triage protocol utilizes the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score [50] and has four main components: Inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, minimum qualifications for survival, and a prioritization tool (Table 2) .",16.962862531737375,9.832327773311297

Furthermore, as the entire modeling and analysis are based on computational approaches, we can obtain the results of such analysis even within an hour. This saves huge amounts of time and reduces costs, two major factors associated with in vitro studies. However, a key issue that needs to be considered is whether in silico testing will ever be as accurate as in vitro or in vivo testing, or whether in silico results will always require non-simulated experimental confirmation. Tracqui et al. (1995) successfully developed a glioma model to show how chemo-resistant tumor sub-populations cause treatment failure. Similarly, a computational model of tumor invasion by Frieboes et al. (2006) is able to demonstrate that the growth of a tumor depends on the microenvironmental nutrient status, the pressure of the tissue, and the applied chemotherapeutic drugs. The 3D spatio-temporal simulation model of a tumor by Dionysiou et al. (2004) was able to repopulate, expand, and shrink tumor cells, thus providing a computational approach for assessment of radiotherapy outcomes. The glioblastoma model of Kirby et al.

The overall composition of this total is somewhat unclear since it is likely comprised of numerous sources such as extracts of fermentation products, natural substances, pure synthetics, etc., and statistical comparisons must be interpreted with caution. It is clear, however, that even today's heightened level of marine-derived compound and extract screening (a few thousand per year perhaps) represents only a small portion of this amount. Consideration of the scope of therapeutic areas screened shows a parallel situation. During the 1970s and early 1980s, marine screening efforts were focused, with some exceptions, in the areas of antitumor, cytotoxics, antiviral, and antimicrobials. These areas represent only a portion of the full range of human disease areas.

Refugees differ from other immigrant groups in that they have specific health care needs. In addition to a greater risk of diseases that are prevalent in their countries of origin (see above), refugees may have been exposed to unhealthy living conditions and subjected to violent acts and traumatic situations. Therefore, clinical care should be based on a multidisciplinary approach that covers infectious diseases, mental health, chronic conditions, and obstetric-gynecologic care. 24, 25 One of the main strategies for provision of medical care to refugees should be the design and application of screening protocols that can detect the more prevalent health problems early, not only in adults but also in children (infectious diseases, chronic conditions and mental health), and take into consideration the cultural and linguistic peculiarities of the population they are applied to. Such an approach should be complemented by vaccination programs for both children and adults in order to prevent epidemics, especially in vulnerable groups. Ethical considerations aside, these measures require the application of specific resources to ensure that the health of the displaced persons and the host population is not negatively affected. 26, 27 Screening programs for immigrants and refugees have been questioned from an ethical viewpoint, since they could be considered a limitation to these groups' rights. 28 However, it is important to highlight that a screening program is not a threat in itself, but that ethical considerations could arise with respect to the use made of the results.",13.43312542376708,8.70762470819778

The guidelines of the German Reich's Ministry of the Interior of 1930 reacted to the increasingly intense political debate by specifically emphasizing the necessity of explicit informed consent und the moral inadequacy of exploiting a person's difficult social situation for performing studies that pose a risk to the participant's health (Steinmann, 1975) .

Particularly clinical trials that include some form of collaboration between rich countries and developing countries are raising issues, like permissible standards of care for control groups and after-trial obligations, that need to be addressed in a fair and transparent manner.",26.71628307235275,12.853240176302313

Virtually every clinical research professional can describe implementation issues that arise during the course of a research study that may complicate the conduct of the study or negatively may impact the study's outcome. The issues most commonly encountered by investigators include recruitment difficulties, poor participant adherence to protocol requirements, and problems relating to the retention of participants in the study. Understanding the underlying or root causes of these problems is a first step toward overcoming these impediments. Whereas some of these barriers to the successful conduct of a clinical research study can be attributed to administrative and process difficulties, many of them are linked directly to participant responses to study-related issues. If one considers the conduct of clinical research from the participant's perspective, one can begin to appreciate the system and process issues that can have negative (or positive) influences on participants' experiences, and, in turn, on participants' likelihood of adherence to study requirements, as well as on the individual participant's likelihood of completing the project.",21.843554158979888,12.159522272140762

The decline in host defence mechanisms after exercise has been termed an 'open window' during which viruses and bacteria may gain entry into the body, thus increasing the risk of infection (Nieman 2000) . In theory, a chronic depression of immune function could arise over a period of time during which strenuous exercise is performed without sufficient time for recovery of immune cell function. However, although there is a great deal of evidence for a decrease in the ability of isolated immune cells to respond to a challenge following strenuous exercise (as discussed in Chs 4 and 5), a direct link between impaired immune function in vivo and subsequent infection has not yet been established. One of the reasons for this is the serious ethical issues involved in inoculating subjects with a known cold-causing virus and asking them to participate in heavy exercise. One major concern here is the potential risk of viral myocarditis (a viral infection of the heart muscle); exercising during a viral infection may increase the likelihood of developing this potentially fatal condition.",17.073804071145528,10.771115183541223

Firstly, the ethical question as to whether or not a putative biological agent to be researched ought in fact to be eliminated (or, if already eliminated, not retrieved). Here the possibility of research is removed; no possibility of research because no biological agent to be researched. We have in mind the case of smallpox and the arguments in favour or against the elimination of all samples of smallpox. (We note that in the context of the recent possibility of genome mappings of biological agents, it may not matter so much whether the organism actually exists; since it can be recreated from the sequence alone.) Secondly, the ethical question (or questions) arising from dual-use research in relation to a biological agent whose present and/or future existence is taken as a given; there is no intention to eliminate or not retrieve or not bring into existence the biological agent in question. For example, research to determine whether or not avian influenza could trigger a human pandemic might lead to the creation of dangerous new strains that could be used by terrorists. Such research might include work intentionally undertaken to create novel pathogens or synthesising existing ones, albeit work whose ultimate purpose was to develop, say, a vaccine against these pathogens.

Certainly not the major focus, R/D is an important element as emerging countries grow and develop. From the voluntary humanitarian perspective, ethical principles become a major concern. At the onset, ethical principles regarding clinical and education/training initiatives carry over into R/D. C. Rollins Hanlon, MD, 149 has nicely summarized the 6 major principles that should govern health care (Table 23 ). The ACS has carried these major principles over to the development of a ""Code of Professional Conduct."" 150 Both these elements also apply to global humanitarian efforts. There are 2 areas that volunteers must be aware of. The first involves dealings with corporate or business individuals, especially in foreign countries where local practice is at variance with the U.S. standards. Recent codes in this area have been developed by Adva Med for the United States and should be applied internationally. 151 The second area is in research involving clinical subjects. Suffice it to say, clinical studies involving human subjects outside the United States should abide by all the ethical standards established by the international community. 152, 153 The National Bioethics Advisory Commission has developed guidelines for developing countries. 153 Additionally, on-site training of clinical researchers is tremendously valuable and is sorely needed. As an example, although India has more than 250,000 practicing physicians for more than 1 billion people, less than 200 investigators have been trained to carry out efficient, safe, and effective clinical research. 154 Proceeding in a phased way is a common sense approach. Case reports, limited then expanded retrospective studies, technical reports, and prospective studies using accepted statistical methods, and abiding by investigational review board standards and approval is the usual approach or sequence for young academic or investigational physicians. This includes ethics review, a favorable risk-benefit ratio, and informed consent. The revised Declaration of Helsinki in 2000 has defined this on the international level. 155 This revision declares that any treatment being tested in clinical trials should be compared with the best universal standard and not a placebo.",16.30722987705389,9.831261938997821

The language of human rights is increasingly part of the landscape for health law in Australia and a See, for example, Public Health Act 1991 (NSW) s 23. internationally. [43] [44] [45] Given the potential for public health laws to impact upon the freedom of individuals, and the need for public health laws to balance the interests of individuals and society, public health laws will ideally have a transparent ethical framework, articulating the principles upon which state intervention will be premised. 46 The World Health Organization has acknowledged the importance of legal and ethical considerations to pandemic preparedness, noting that public health measures such as quarantine, compulsory vaccination and off-licence use of medicines 'need a legal framework to ensure transparent assessment and justification of the measures that are being considered, and to ensure coherence with international legislation (International Health Regulations)'. 47 Consideration of ethical issues is also essential for, as the World Health Organization has noted, ethical issues 'are part of the normative framework that is needed to assess the cultural acceptability of measures such as quarantine or selective vaccination of predefined risk groups'. 48 The exercise of state powers in terms of quarantine, isolation and detention during a public health emergency is likely to be particularly controversial in Western liberal democracies such as Australia. The extent to which the state can and should exercise its powers in this area has become increasingly relevant in public health, as is clear from debates over detention of tuberculosis patients, 49, 50 and from the use of quarantine during the SARS crisis. 51 Although comparable countries to Australia in Europe, the USA and Canada all have human rights charters or equivalents, which could provide procedural protections and safeguards for citizens in relation to quarantine and detention, Australia has yet to develop a Bill of Rights at the federal level. While Australian state and territory governments have begun enacting human rights legislation, 52 there is no comprehensive inclusion of human rights safeguards in the federal Quarantine Act, which raises issues about the mechanisms for ensuring procedural safeguards in the event of a pandemic. 53 Public health measures directed at implementing social distancing, quarantine or travel restrictions will not only infringe on individual liberties that are often taken for granted in Western societies, but are also likely to have a profound economic impact. As outlined above, estimates indicate that pandemic influenza will have a significant impact on the global economy. At local level, businesses may be closed or experience a reduction in their cash flow as public health measures are introduced or people stay home voluntarily. In such an environment, the economic cost to individuals and businesses may be significant, which in turn demands consideration of development of support systems and compensation systems for those affected. 54 In the USA, a great deal of work has been done on strengthening the public health laws, both generally and specifically for public health emergencies. The Turning Point Public Health Statute Modernization National Collaborative developed the Turning Point Model State Public Health Act. 55 In 2001, the Centre for Law and the Public's Health at Georgetown and Johns Hopkins Universities prepared a Model State Emergency Health Powers Act, setting out the powers for a state of public health emergency. The provisions of the earlier Model State Emergency Health Powers Act were adapted and included in the Turning Point Model Act. 56 Article V of the Turning Point Model Act deals with the powers of public health authorities, including the powers of quarantine and isolation. The Model Act provides that the principles to be applied in relation to quarantine and isolation include that they should be by the least restrictive means necessary to prevent the spread of disease (s 5-108[b](1)).

Co-development of the veterinary and human West Nile vaccines is as a potential model for other vaccines. There are a few other examples where vaccines were co-developed for animals and humans, including vaccines against Venezuelan equine encephalitis and Rift Valley fever (described below). Certain issues arise, however, that may need to be considered in the context of such integrated efforts. First, a safety problem arising during use of a veterinary vaccine could provoke regulatory concerns or a liability problem for the human analog. Although a safety issue did arise briefly due to anaphylaxis type reactions in horses, resulting in temporary withdrawal of PreveNile ® from the market [27], there were no repercussions for the human analog vaccine (ChimeriVax-WN02). This raises the interesting question whether the human and veterinary regulatory agencies are integrating information that might be of value, either during development of similar vaccines for different species or after marketing approval. This is an obvious overlooked area for application of One Health principles. Second, the immune response to veterinary vaccines generally should differentiate naturally infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA) on the basis of a laboratory test, which allows compliance with trade restrictions. This is, of course not a concern for regulatory approval of human vaccines, although it can be useful in seroepidemiological and vaccine coverage studies. An example of problems associated with DIVA is the off-label use of commercial horse vaccine to protect emus against eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), since some combination vaccines against EEE contain equine influenza antigen and such vaccines elicit cross-reactive antibodies to avian influenza resulting in quarantine. The chimeric West Nile vaccine described above potentially allows for DIVA testing (using responses to the yellow fever nonstructural proteins expressed by the vector) [28] .",16.768594110807477,8.30890070764248

The United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDG), for example, represent an effort to think globally about health and related problems (United Nations 2008). The Gates Foundation's Grand Challenges in Global Health Initiative is also global in scale: it seeks to achieve scientific breakthroughs against diseases that disproportionately affect the two billion poorest people on earth, though of course diseases like AIDS and tuberculosis can affect people everywhere. The Council of Science Editors has organized a global theme issue on poverty and human development involving more than 230 science and biomedical journals, focusing among other things on interventions to improve health among the poor (Flanagin and Winker 2007) . These are all invaluable efforts involving the many, many parts of the overall picture, and they all ""think big.""

Documents like that from WHO by Coleman, Reis, and Croisier (Coleman et al. 2007 ) articulate policies; others, like the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) document authored by Annas, Mariner, and Parmet (Annas et al. 2008) , vigorously critique policies already developed on the basis of ethical inadequacies. And a major effort has been mounted by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to look specifically at the ethical issues in the emerging concern with global health: this is the ethical, social, and cultural program that is funded under the Grand Challenges in Global Health Initiative, designed to use bioethics considerations to assess the specific Grand Challenges projects that are planned or are currently under way (Singer et al. 2008 ).

However, ultimately success and the true measure of innovation are judged by the level of adoption into the application sectors for which the technology was intended. Ultimate success depends on clear definition of the problem being addressed, as well as the capability of the end-user organization to adopt the solution. At the present time, adoption of the LOC concept has been greater in the research setting than in any other setting. While clinical diagnostics have been highlighted in the foregoing discussion, there may be other arenas where application of both LOC and POC testing offers potential benefits, e.g., in environmental, food, and material authenticity testing. Speed, simplicity, and mobility are all desirable attributes, while financial and environmental issues are equally applicable to all modalities of testing. There is no doubt that it is in these markets that the greatest volume of applications are to be found. However, we know from the experience of POC testing (see Point-of-Care Testing) that adoption has been slow, and furthermore, barriers to the adoption of new technologies in health care have been acknowledged. One of the key barriers is a poor understanding of the unmet need that might be addressed by the new technology. While it might be self-evident that an analytical device should address an unmet need, it is recognized in clinical diagnostics that there is significant over-requesting of tests, which is probably encouraged by the predominance of the fee-for-service business model. Furthermore, there is a lesson to be learned from the evolution of central laboratory analytical technology, where the early approach to ""scope"" was through the development of the ""multichannel analyzer."" It became evident after wide adoption of this technology that patients were being tested for analytes (or biomarkers) that were not necessarily relevant to their condition. This raised two issues. First, whether the patient (or the insurer) should have to pay for tests not required and second, a proportion of abnormal results were reported that were not relevant to the clinical condition being investigated. The consequence of this experience was the development of the discretionary analyzer, with a greater emphasis on ""relevant"" biomarkers or ""groups of biomarkers."" Consequently, while scope is a major attribute of the LOC concept, it presents a greater challenge to formulating the right ""group of biomarkers"" and demonstrating clinical utility. The ethical issues surrounding the generation of results not requested, referred to in the earlier discussion also has to be considered, as well as the growing demand for evidence of clinical utility as part of the patient demand for an improved quality of health care service.",13.992882685804798,9.362368366053254

We conclude by discussing the progress made in these two fields towards addressing the difficulties inherent in the numerical solution of a multi-scale computational model and outline the type of problems we expect to see in the future as we try to model increasingly complex problems.",22.23806779831126,10.872998530043326

Furthermore, it is increasingly recognized that HIDs can pose a significant threat to each country's national security. Innovative research and coordinated efforts, through the establishment of well-functioning networks, are the only way to deal with these issues, in order to improve preparedness and to react quickly: in short, to be 'prepared for the unknown'. A key role may be played by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, whose mission is, among others, to 'coordinate the European networking of bodies operating in the fields within the Centre's mission' [29] . Uncoordinated measures can lead to only partial and poor responses, and different approaches to similar health threats in various EU countries are likely to negatively affect the compliance by health professionals, and the perception of the population. Although well-functioning networks are already in place, many gaps still exist, as well as opportunities for future collaboration.

Although extra-budgetary funds can be substantial, they remain subject to the whims of major donors. Their reluctance to expand WHO's role might be attributable to the organisation's lack of strategies to tackle health and trade issues, but could also be because of the perceived threat to vested economic interests. Therefore, regular-budget funds need to be forthcoming to strengthen the organisation's capacity to engage more actively in trade and health issues. Similarly, WHO has inadequate technical expertise to analyse and advocate on trade and health matters, and the management of these issues is often fragmented, which sometimes results in competition between programmes. WHO needs to shift efforts from building their knowledge base to supporting member states to effectively participate in the governance of trade issues. Besides building analytical capacity within member states-which requires corresponding resources-WHO has to show political leadership in resisting powerful political and economic interests. So far, WHO's role has been reactive. With improved resources and high-level support, WHO could be more proactive and timely in representing health interests in trade negotiations regionally, nationally, and worldwide.",18.03861482933961,10.143502835418094

Some of those technologies, such as vaccines to prevent infections and antibiotics to prevent their transmission, are used in public health. But public health differs from clinical health care in a number of significant ways. In medicine, it is the interaction between the care provider and the patient that leads to the most ethical issues. In this interaction, medical ethics seeks to protect the autonomy of the patient. In public health, however, most ethical issues arise from the interaction between an agencysuch as a city health departmentand the population it is serving. A public health agency is often protecting some people within a population from others. For example, it may need to isolate an infectious person in order to prevent transmission to others. In so doing, the autonomy of the infected person is constrained in the interest of the community. Because of these fundamental differences between medicine and public health, the Belmont Report, and policies subsequently derived from the Report, do not adequately address a number of important issues in public health.",47.16027467632317,19.42127664103516

They have evolved out of recommendations resulting from high-profile research abuses such as Nazi war crimes and the Tuskegee study of untreated syphilis. The principal concerns in research ethics are informed consent and the protection of vulnerable individuals such as prisoners and minors. To ensure compliance with prescribed procedures in federally funded research, there exists an institutional infrastructure reaching from the federal government to individual institutions such as universities. Institutions found not to comply with the prescribed procedures can lose their license to conduct federally funded research until they are found to be compliant once again. Codes of ethics for the practice of public health do not have the enforcement structures seen in research ethics. Rather, the codes are aspirational, articulating the values and expectations of the profession. They are a means of being transparent and enabling the public they serve to hold them accountable for their actions. In addition, they serve as a tool for identifying and addressing ethical issues. For example, ethical issues in the application of genomics to public health were identified by considering genomics in light of each principle of the Public Health Code of Ethics in turn .",37.32006047090327,15.923346083086255

Philosophers typically expand on the situation to explore all the philosophical threads and identify what various schools of philosophical thought would have to say about the ethical conundrums. Public health practitioners are relatively pragmatic. They commonly seek to minimize the number of people harmed by the epidemic. Although they may not name the philosophy, this perspective is closely aligned with utilitarianism, which seeks the greatest good for the greatest number of people. In some instances, public health practitioners also appeal to human rights, another ethical school of thought, which acts as a counterbalance to a utilitarian calculus that can sideline a minority of the population; for example, the few placed in quarantine for the benefit of the community have a right to have certain basic needs met while in quarantine.",21.002177737328786,12.128654380401652

Such information is most abundant for records of human infectious disease. Whether looking across multiple diseases to glean generalizable epidemiological insight, or at specific diseases to identify important covariates predicting particular human outbreaks, previous studies have combined detailed data on human infectious disease events and environmental factors to quantify current and to predict future disease hotspots (e.g., [2 -6] ). Such baseline data provide important starting points for making projections of human disease risk, and can be effectively applied to predict the spread of particular infectious diseases to new areas that are in close proximity, or located in environments similar to historical outbreak locations (e.g., [6 , 7] ). As one example, data describing the ecology of bat reservoirs of Nipah virus can help make projections about the kinds of environments expected to support cases of human disease [5] . Such baseline data can then be applied to identify and manage similar locations where future Nipah outbreaks might be predicted to occur. However, data from past outbreaks may offer little towards efforts to predict outbreaks of completely novel diseases that punctuate the status quo -for example, the emergence of new zoonotic pathogens, such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [8] , or outbreaks of known zoonoses in unexpected areas, such as Ebola virus disease in West Africa [9] . Because of their often surprising departures from previous outbreak patterns, some argue that disease events may be inherently unpredictable (e.g., [10] ). Predicting outbreaks, caused either by novel pathogens or known pathogens in novel places, remains one of the biggest scientific challenges of our time. We agree that this is a hard problem, but disagree that it is impossible. This causes us to ask, what kind of data are available that may facilitate more effective prediction?",11.533148286322472,6.387449457399946

One explanation for this is that normative enquiries are outside of the purview of OH. The collaborative model, therefore, is not about a distinctive OH ethics per se, but an attempt to integrate ecological perspectives on the same terms as public health activism; to probe conventional wisdom to find innovative solutions. This is perhaps a practical consideration because OH otherwise would likely lose political traction under anything more concretely conceptual. The OH goal is to assemble a comprehensive set of data across a broad spectrum of expertise, and to thereby provide solutions that are of benefit to human wellbeing within ecological settings. Most recently, this idea is being framed as effectiveness gains through dynamic cooperation in environmental contexts, and has the effect of raising environmental concerns on par with concurrent efforts in public health such as in disease surveillance and animal management. This might be enough to create a vision of OH ethics: Van Rensselaer Potter, in his earliest definition of bioethics, talked about a system of human survival that included environmental, or ecological ethics (Potter 1988 ). This could easily capture the idea of OH as broadening public health into diverse fields. Potter, a pioneer in challenging parochial and non-secular ideas shaping the human condition, noted a schism between the medical-science domains and humanistic ethics, and that both were distanced from environmental ethics. The ethics of OH, therefore, may just be signalling the resurgence of bioethics as a unified endeavour (Thompson and List 2015) , allowing for reflective and critical engagement with current pandemic measures, which up to now gave little credence to solutions outside the scope of public health ethics.",21.300715543499315,10.90068386612808

In the developing OH literature, it is more commonly acknowledged that human beings are part of and dependent upon the biosphere. One way OH has developed is in a perspective that a 'healthy' environment entails healthy animals along with healthy people. It is not 'us versus them', then, but a problem of shared risk that is something concrete to act on, thus providing opportunities to maintain healthy or rescue unhealthy ecosystems (Rabinowitz et al. 2008) . However, in practice, reactions to these risks, and solutions to pathogens, still prioritise human interests, because there is no fundamental sense in which non-human animals, or the environment, matter morally. Sure, while OH in this sense creates the grounds for humans to express compassion towards animals and ecosystems and to engage in novel approaches to health problems, overall it often achieves the same goals of prevention and response so far already installed in public health; so OH, in this sense, adds nothing to the ethical debate except by broadening the factors considered in any human cost-benefit analysis.

For example, individual liberty does not apply to children in the same way as adults. Compared to adults, children lack autonomy and parents must advocate and make health care decisions on their child's behalf.

The field of medical ethics or bioethics in general is multidisciplinary because the ethical dilemma in health care requires the inputs and understanding of various professionals. Some of these moral perplexities are part of societal concerns for equity, equality, and justice in health care. A majority of these issues are sociocultural issues and general ethical or moral standards of behaviour in the society. This is why sociological insights are necessary if the ethical conundrums presented by medicine are to be successfully resolved in practice. The most vital tool in medicine is the ""human body."" The body is a place where medical practices and interventions are exercised. The human and his/her body have a significant place in sociological impetus. Sociologists collaborate in resolving moral challenges in health care practice and research. Humphreys (2008, p. 51) observed that the sociological approach has brought out some interesting perspectives, especially unintended consequences of behaviours that bioethics (and research ethics) may not have anticipated.",24.69907633693242,11.486335369755112

Indeed, beyond these organizational 'lessons learned' documents there have been several recent contributions to the bioethics literature on ethical issues and learnings from this EVD crisis (Donovan, 2014; Kass, 2014; Schuklenk 2014; Upshur, 2014; Benatar, 2015 ; Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethics, 2015). Yet, explicit attention to the ethical character of the EVD lessons and the normative challenges that will invariably exist in correcting our failures in the future is either lacking or altogether absent in the reviewed organizational 'lessons learned' documents. There is no affirmation that many of the failures, as well as the improvements required to redress them, require the embrace and promotion of ethical values that may not yet be embodied by leading actors and organizations operating in global health (Benatar, et al., 2010; Benatar, 2013) . For instance, of its 29 pages, not a single reference is made to 'ethics' in the final report of the World Health Organization Ebola Interim Assessment Panel, nor is there an explicit acknowledgment of the value-laden and rigidly contested nature of global health decision-making and activities (World Health Organization, 2015a). Furthermore, in these documents there is no recognition that many if not all of the themes identified above have been previously identified as important ethical lessons for outbreak preparedness and response. Indeed, these lessons reflect ethics knowledge that has been promulgated in various ethics guidance documents for outbreak/pandemic planning and response (even within the organizations sampled) (Kass, 2005 Control and Prevention, 2008; Calain et al., 2009; World Health Organization, 2009 ).",33.12621731231566,15.8540492706943

As a form of biological control, immunocontraception may also reduce the need for broadcast distribution of toxins for pest suppression, thereby reducing environmental contamination and nontarget mortality. This is of special concern when pests inhabit suburbs, urban parks, government and state campuses, nature reserves, military bases, or other areas where lethal controls may no longer be legal or safe (Kirkpatrick et al., 1997; Williams, 1997) . The concept of virally mediated immunocontraception has generated considerable debate on legal and ethical issues concerning releases of engineered microorgansims into the environment.

When reporting a crisis event, previous literature noted that a small number of media frames have appeared constantly in the news: conflict, economic, consequence, human interest and morality (Neuman, 1992) . With an attribution process, however, two news frames can be further identified, namely, episodic news frame, which focused on individuals or a single event, and thematic news frames, which ""placed issues and events in a general context, such as organizational or societal"" (An & Gower, 2009, p. 108) . A content analysis of crisis news coverage suggested that although all five frames (conflict, economic, consequence, human impact and morality) were present when reporting a crisis event, the usage of a specific frame differed by crisis type, as did the level of attributions (episodic and thematic) (An & Gower, 2009 ).",14.197685088327725,7.202263092958848

The first challenge surrounds the definition of human subjects. Regulatory bodies have often used interaction with human subjects as an indicator of need for institutional ethical review (Markham & Buchanan, 2012) . Since many technology-based studies, particularly passive data collection studies, do not directly engage with human subjects, these studies have been carried out without ethical review. It may be prudent, however, to engage with the institutional review board, an ethical regulatory body, or an external advisory committee to critically process the potential harms, vulnerabilities, benefits, and so forth, even if the research does not directly engage with human subjects and thus, does not explicitly require intuitional ethics review. In addition, it may be necessary to reevaluate what constitutes engaging with a human subject (Markham & Buchanan, 2012) . Direct connection with individual-level data has historically been considered engagement with a human subject, while studies with aggregated or deidentified data were not. However, recent research suggests deidentified datasets often contain sufficient personal information to potentially identify individuals (Markham & Buchanan, 2012) . As a result, it may be necessary to develop an ethical review process, with or without institutional oversight, for research that involves person-based data without direct human contact.

Background: Nurses play an essential role in all phases of disaster management. For nurses to respond competently, they must be equipped with the skills to provide comprehensive and holistic care to the populations affected by or at risk of disasters. Methods: A scoping review was conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology. The review used information from six databases: the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Ovid MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, ProQuest, Scopus and the Education Resources Information Center. Keywords and inclusion and exclusion criteria were identified as strategies to use in this review. Results: Twelve studies were eligible for result extraction, as they listed domains of the core competencies. These domains varied among studies. However, the most common domains were related to communication, planning, decontamination and safety, the Incident Command System and ethics. Conclusion: Knowledge of the domains of the core competencies, such as understanding the content and location of the disaster plan, communication during disaster and ethical issues is fundamental for nurses. Including these domains in the planning and provision of training for nurses, such as disaster drills, will strengthen their preparedness to respond competently to disaster cases.

It has also illustrated that familiar ethical issues in infectious disease management endure despite considerable efforts to understand and mitigate such issues in the wake of past outbreaks. To improve future global outbreak preparedness and response, we must examine these shortcomings and reflect upon the current state of ethical preparedness. To this end, we focus our efforts in this article on the examination of one substantial area: ethical guidance in pandemic plans. We argue that, due in part to their focus on considerations arising specifically in relation to pandemics of influenza origin, pandemic plans and their existing ethical guidance are ill-equipped to anticipate and facilitate the navigation of unique ethical challenges that may arise in other infectious disease pandemics. We proceed by outlining three reasons why this is so, and situate our analysis in the context of the EVD outbreak and the threat posed by drug-resistant tuberculosis: (1) different infectious diseases have distinct characteristics that challenge anticipated or existing modes of pandemic prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery, (2) clear, transparent, context-specific ethical reasoning and justification within current influenza pandemic plans are lacking, and (3) current plans neglect the context of how other significant pandemics may manifest.

In turn, this variation should expect to create unique ethical challenges and will therefore require novel ethical consideration. For instance, microbiological or immunological variations across infectious diseases with pandemic potential have distinct implications for an infectious disease's epidemiology and how the disease can and should be addressed through clinical medicine, public health surveillance and intervention, legal provisions, and so forth. Indeed, microbiological variations between infectious diseases can mean the difference between planning for a virus or bacterium, which has significant implications for transmissibility, pathogenicity, and immunity. An obvious example is the difference between airborne, waterborne, or direct-contact pathogens, which can each have considerable implications for which restrictive public health measures can and should be used to isolate and curb the spread of disease, in addition to the measures that should be considered necessary to protect the health and safety of health care practitioners such that they are not put at undue risk. Ethical issues and considerations associated with a pandemic involving directcontact transmission, for example, will not necessarily be adequately anticipated or addressed if the range of ethical issues considered in pandemic plans are circumscribed to those associated with an airborne influenza pandemic. Indeed, different ethical issues should be expected to arise between airborne (e.g., influenza) and direct-contact (e.g., HIV) pathogens, such as the amount of responsibility one must assume as both a potential transmitter and potential subject of transmission (Battin et al. 2008 ). Failing to anticipate potential ethical issues will render ethical guidance incomplete, which could mean the neglect of other important ethical values in decision-making.",42.5095430035117,17.856965193803404

Given that Ebola, TB, and other infectious diseases have been on the global scene for decades, with some even developing drug-resistance during that time, it seems reasonable to surmise that these problems are seen as those of 'the other' (Selgelid 2005) . On the other hand, the threat of an influenza pandemic is a threat to nearly every country, and it seems that the widespread buy-in and scope of pandemic planning reflects an acknowledgement of this fact. Yet, if we are to improve our approach to global outbreak preparedness, then this scope has to be expanded considerably to direct the attention of all countries to the shared vulnerability and shared responsibility that exists for all infectious diseases, including those that might predominantly impact the global south.

In particular, this involves strengthening the WHO's role in coordinating and supporting Member States with respect to their pandemic preparedness (World Health Organization 2015b). Central to the existing resources that Member States can utilize for preparedness and response are pandemic plans, which have been developed and installed at the WHO and by nearly every Member State (World Health Organization 2011). Given the substantial investments that have been made in the development and installation of these plans, in addition to their significance in guiding international and national preparedness and response, an important avenue for reflection on how we can improve our approach to addressing ethical issues in global outbreaks is to assess the aptitude of existing pandemic plans to anticipate and guide the resolution of both familiar and novel ethical issues in pandemic preparedness and response.",36.82942703767443,14.699818089518331

This is problematic, as the application (or applicability) of particular ethical values or principles may depend on many contextual factors. For example, the identification of reciprocity as an important ethical principle in pandemic planning and in the justified use of restrictive measures in particular, requires significant context-specific analysis in order to elucidate the parameters in which reciprocity is warranted and in what way the value of reciprocity should be realized (Viens et al. 2009; Silva and Smith 2015) . While examination of the principle of reciprocity has occurred in the context of using isolation and quarantine measures for influenza, SARS, and TB, novel ethical considerations still emerged in the context of the EVD outbreak in response to the implementation of substantially unique measures like cordon sanitaire (Silva and Smith 2015) . Thomas et al. (2007, p . S29) put it eloquently when they argued that the 'allusion to a concept cannot replace disciplined, well-informed, deliberation'. Without significant investments to facilitate these (context-sensitive) deliberations, as has occurred in some cases for influenza pandemic planning, a substantial risk exists that ethical values and principles found in existing pandemic plans will provide little practical guidance for other infectious disease pandemics. It may also be altogether unclear when to incorporate ethical values into decision-making. 2 Thus, while particular ethical values and principles may be outlined in pandemic plans (perhaps as overarching ''guiding principles''), the extent to which it is made clear when and how those values and principles apply to concrete activities in pandemic preparedness and response appears to be very limited. This ultimately limits the adaptability and applicability of this ethical guidance. This is all not to say that the ethical guidance provided in pandemic plans is of no benefit. At a minimum, it provides a point of departure for discussion of the ethical issues and considerations that may be associated with other infectious disease pandemics (Upshur 2014) . Acknowledging this is crucial, as the impression should not be that the due diligence required to think about ethics has been met simply because ethical values and principles have been identified in current pandemic plans. Rather, it should signal the need to rigorously examine ethical preparedness for infectious disease pandemics beyond influenza if we are to improve the moral quality of future global outbreak preparedness and response. In sum, it will suffice to quote the conclusions of McDougall's (2010, p. 2) survey of ethical principles and recommendations in pandemic plans: 'more practical guidance is needed about how to implement the ethical commitments and principles endorsed in ethical frameworks, which are not algorithms that mandate particular approaches or decisions, but decision-making tools that need to be adjusted to reflect both the specific biological characteristics of any actual or potential pandemic, and the specific social circumstances in which they are used as part of a coordinated response'.",28.871616445779075,13.921684580027803

However, several studies have demonstrated that this guidance suffers from considerable deficiencies. For instance, an analysis of ethical language in federal and state pandemic plans in the US found that, 'more often than not, the documents were opaque in their ethical reasoning. The implied messages were a combination of ''trust us and do as we say'' and ''ethics are self-evident, just do what is needed to preserve lives'' ' (Thomas et al. 2007, p. S29) . The pandemic plan developed by the US Department of Health and Human Services, for example, recommends priorities for the allocation of scarce resources like vaccines and antivirals, but does not describe the underlying ethical values or principles that would enable decisionmakers to refine or reinterpret those priorities under different circumstances (Thomas et al. 2007) . A similar analysis involving the review of 29 (influenza) pandemic plans from 25 European Union (EU) countries, 2 acceding countries, and 3 non-EU countries, found that the plans 'usually stated that their goal was to decrease morbidity and mortality and ensure that society still functions', but that there was a 'lack of ethical reasoning' justifying these goals (Mounier-Jack et al. 2007, p. 926) . Another review exploring the degree to which the inclusion of ethical terms were treated as sufficient in their reflection on underlying ethical issues concluded that the 'majority of pandemic preparedness plans do not contain the terms that were identified as central to ethical reasoning' (Derpmann 2011, p. 448) , and that 'ethical issues remain unobserved or treated with insufficient transparency' (p. 449). With respect to priorities for allocating resources during a pandemic, one author suggests that, while all plans reviewed mentioned priorities, most were 'not supported by a justification and/or there is no mention of the principles that priorities are based upon' (Derpmann 2011, p. 449) . For instance, 'occurrences of the term ''priority'' [were] difficult to interpret, since there are different kinds of justification for priorities in pandemic planning' (Derpmann 2011, p. 449) .",32.82453860065604,13.400819568111922

This scepticism stems from several recent analyses of pandemic plans, which have demonstrated that, while ethical considerations and guidance have been incorporated into many pandemic plans, underlying ethical reasoning and justifications remain largely absent. Pandemic planning requires numerous assumptions to be made regarding, among other things, the severity of the pandemic, the supply and availability of health care resources, and the availability of information regarding who is at risk and who can benefit (Prehn and Vawter 2008) . Variations in these underlying assumptions can have profound implications for ethical reasoning and justification, which may ultimately affect the nature and scope of ethics guidance included in a plan. As such, it is not surprising that considerable variety exists among plans in the attention paid to guidance for ethical decision-making (Prehn and Vawter 2008; McDougall 2010) . Indeed, many pandemic plans do not contain any ethical guidance at all (Prehn and Vawter 2008) . Of course, this is problematic not only for ethics preparedness for infectious disease pandemics beyond influenza, but for influenza pandemics as well. And while numerous ethics guidance documents and a substantial scholarly literature exist that can be drawn upon in the event of a pandemic (e.g., University of Toronto Joint Centre for Bioethics 2005; Kinlaw and Levine 2007; National Ethics Advisory Committee 2007; World Health Organization 2007 , 2008b Jennings and Arras 2008) , this should not be seen as a replacement for the integration of robust ethics guidance within pandemic plans themselves, as many of the decisions governments and health practitioners will make in preparing for and responding to pandemics will ostensibly be derived from their own jurisdiction's pandemic plan and the ethical guidance therein.",26.774460807099004,12.826022081701874

As such, many assumptions must be made in order to appropriately, yet feasibly, plan for a pandemic. Due to the persistent threat of variant influenza viruses and the historical frequency of influenza pandemics, it is prudent that national pandemic plans attend to considerations specifically related to the threat of an influenza pandemic. Moreover, a number of considerations, both operational and ethical, should ostensibly be applicable irrespective of the particular pandemic threat. However, other infectious diseases, despite being historically controlled or contained, remain as pandemic threats, may raise distinct challenges for preparedness and response, and should therefore not be neglected in pandemic planning (World Health Organization 2015b). The current EVD outbreak serves as a prime cautionary tale. The emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome-coV (MERS-coV) and its recent spread beyond the Arabian Peninsula further exemplifies the need to think about novel operational and ethical issues that would be associated with a more wide-spread outbreak of similar pathogens (World Health Organization 2015c).",22.24535777501411,11.107989617350214

This shortcoming, we argue, challenges our ethical imperative to anticipate and plan for pandemic threats. We begin this paper by briefly describing the current state of pandemic plans.

For instance, consideration of the ethical parameters and justifications for intervention that directly stem from, or correspond to, particular characteristics of infectious diseases, like a low or high rate of mortality, degree of virulence, or mode of transmission, could lead to the development of adaptable ethical guidance that is responsive to important variations in these characteristics, but is also broadly applicable.",22.143300563708806,10.379256938612016

For instance, the WHO's Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) aims to provide rapid identification, confirmation, and response to outbreaks of international importance through a technical collaboration of existing institutions and networks (World Health Organization 2015e). However, despite such networks and mechanisms, the preparedness of individual nations (both operational and ethical) will continue to rely significantly on their own national pandemic plans. This is problematic, as GOARN's mission is to support Member States for the implementation of national capacities for epidemic preparedness and response in the context of the IHR, which were 'designed to prevent the international spread of disease' (World Health Organization 2005b, p. 1). The IHR are unique in that their application are not meant to be limited to specific diseases in order to 'maintain their relevance and applicability for many years to come even in the face of the continued evolution of diseases and of the factors determining their emergence and transmission' (World Health Organization 2005b, p. 2). This, we believe, is an appropriate and laudable goal, but is one that is not necessarily reflected in the preparedness of Member States vis-à-vis their pandemic plans. Member States are called upon by the IHR to implement its regulations (in accordance with the purpose and scope set out in Article 2 and the principles embodied in Article 3), so the fact that pandemic planning efforts at the national level have focused almost entirely on influenza pandemic preparedness points to an important area for improvement in global outbreak preparedness both in regards to traditional concerns that take on new points of emphasis (e.g., restrictions on freedom of movements and the use of novel public health measures) and altogether new ethical issues (e.g., testing investigational agents in vaccine trials).",20.50795972898551,9.73095070912671

Although assembly against a reference genome is helpful, this approach can't be used with environmental samples full of unknown microbial species. These issues of genome misassembly and lack of reference genomes also complicate gene prediction, which impedes accurate genome annotation. Furthermore, metadata is often left out of annotations, yet it is required for the data to be put into a useful, comparable, biological context.

Not only this but the researches are ongoing to provide plant based vaccines for autoimmune diseases like diabetes and cancer which has risen the need of these vaccines for developed countries also which till now were emphasized to be important majorly for developing countries. Apart from many advantages of these vaccines there are some very relevant social, environmental and ethical issues concerning them which are need to be addressed. Besides future research is needed to overcome limitations like low expression, immunotolerance, glycosylation, immunogenicity, and stability of the transproteins if the practical application of these vaccines is to be realized. One very important point is the proper coordination between academia and industry to help these vaccines reach people. Both technical and regulatory hurdles have to be overcome. It will be a challenge to create a positive public perception regarding safety and effi cacy of these vaccines after all the fuss created over the safety issues of transgenic crops during last few years. Lastly timely funding for this research and participation of corporate giant will certainly help in making this dream a reality soon.",17.183051244688535,8.68738971918362

Therefore, M-Eco was not the first instance to detect the public health event, because there were local actors who had already detected and reported the event. But, M-Eco brought such reports quickly to a broader attention. It was not possible to present an example where M-Eco was the first to detect an outbreak by a clustering of social media contributions with similar symptoms in space and time, and where the outbreak was afterwards confirmed by the traditional notification system. Another lesson learnt is not to underestimate the legal and ethical issues related to IT solutions for digital epidemiology.

The authors themselves are members of the public; hence, the concerns expressed in the novel may represent the concerns of the public as a whole. The novel gives insights into their concerns and informs public dialogue on many issues (Nathan 2013) . Given that genetic enhancement technologies are still largely the domain of science fiction, such novels provide speculative imagination or thought experiments on these technologies, including their ethical and social implications through the rich narratives of the settings, characters, and actions (Van Dijck 1999; Pethes 2005; Smart 2012 ). By using their imagination about the future, the authors express their hope and fear of science and technology in science fiction novels (Bova 1974; Brem and Anijar 2003) . Therefore, science fiction novels are important in enhancing communication between scientists and the public, allowing inclusive ethical dialogue (Delgado et al. 2012) .",18.794312961700804,10.492632236809667

For example, Neuromancer, a novel about human enhancement written by William Gibson, raises ethical questions about what it means to be a human (Delgado et al. 2012 ). Likewise, Michael Crichton's novel The Terminal Man raises fear of a technology that has potential to become a threat to humanity. Even though this novel is about artificial intelligence, the issues raised are similar to biotechnology and may have influence on the debate of the latter (Pethes 2005) . These novels present hypothetical situations which may allow inclusive and contextualize debates and later can be used as a tool in developing robust guidelines (Delgado et al. 2012) . Science fiction novels have an impact on forming public opinion towards bioethical issues, especially on applications that have not yet been realized. Such an influence may even be more influential than the academic discussion on the same matter (Chan 2009 ). Both proponents and opponents of the new applications sometimes refer to imagery described in science fiction novels in the public debate. Mulkay (1996) explains that negative imagery from the Frankenstein novel was used by the opponents in British Parliament and press to criticize human embryo research. The same imagery was also used by the supporters to explain that the opponent's argument was weak because the imagery was only fictional and could or should not be used as a justification to ban the research.",19.11381843321251,9.621691176508412

To start, we consider the meaning of two words: ethics and morals. The use of these two words is not uniform. For some, ethics is the study of behavior between people in relationships in accordance with their cultural values, whereas morals takes into account some wider principles that govern personal behavior, independently of others but often in relation to transcendental principles or beliefs or concept of deity. In this chapter, we use the two words morals and ethics synonymously. This claim is based on the origins of both words-one from ancient Greek (ethos) and the other from classical Latin (mores)-both meaning the accepted customs and values to which societies and cultures aspire. As transplantation becomes increasingly globalized, it is important to consider whether the values that are brought to bear on transplant issues are determined by local cultures or are universal (held by all world cultures). There is a lack of uniformity. We claim that all cultures share some values (e.g., it is wrong to abuse children, it is wrong to torture the innocent, and life is of utmost value to each individual). It also is true, however, that some values are held in a different way in different cultures (e.g., individual autonomy versus Utilitarianism: The other well-known tradition in ethics.",17.39601252543137,8.590592139199593

All activities concerning the health of populations are within the PH domain. Given the consequentialist nature of PH, its main goals are to preserve and promote the health of populations and reduce inequalities in health outcomes. 1 The characteristics of the multidisciplinary field of PH, lead to ethical issues being at the heart of the subject: it is a common good, with a preventative approach that is provided by the government. 2 PH is a collective effort, as its goals cannot be achieved by individual efforts; thus, it requires government action in addition to community participation. 2, 3 Public health ethics is a sub-branch of bioethics, which help PH professionals and health-related organizations to make some necessary trade-offs so that public health goals can be realized. The objectives and activities of PH make this area unique in terms of applying and overcoming ethical principles and moral norms. 4 The objectives of PH are related to moral norms, in particular, prevention of harm and beneficence, producing utility (optimization of benefits over harms) and justice. 5 Some PH interventions are still a threat to other moral norms, such as individual freedom and autonomy, privacy, and confidentiality. 5, 6 With the increasing threats of communicable and non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and populations with chronic health problems, such as diabetes and obesity, it is necessary for PH professionals and other health-related institutions to address ethical conflicts in their policies and practices. 5 Given the objectives of PH, providing universal health coverage requires informed and correct decision-making, based on empirical evidence and moral judgment. For example, the goal of ending the AIDS epidemic by 2020 is only possible if people are being informed about their illness through voluntary testing and access to healthcare services. In addition, the elimination of stigma and discrimination is one of the key topics that should be addressed when planning for the prevention and control of the disease worldwide. 7 Moreover, the socio-economic burdens of NCDs are particularly severe in developing countries, accounting for 75% of all NCD-related deaths. Thus, in order to achieve sustainable development goals, the WHO has established global governance to address complex issues that could not be managed alone. These interactions have raised a range of ethical challenges, including conflicts of interests and governance issues. Transparency, accountability, and management of conflicts of interests are ethical issues requiring attention to prevent NCDs and chronic diseases. Therefore, policy-makers and governments have been working closely with food and drink industry partners to address a number of determinants and processes, which today are tackled by a set of institutions globally. These new challenges call for tools and methods for overcoming ethical conflicts and maximizing benefits. 8 The American Public Health Association identified 10 essential functions for the effective implementation of PH programs, 9 which resulted in the development of a variety of ethical frameworks. Initially, the following two concerns led to the formation of practical frameworks for ethical evaluation of PH: (i) public involvement rather than individual autonomy; and (ii) prioritization and allocation of scarce resources, especially in developing countries, which has raised the debate on justice. 10 So far, several practical frameworks have been proposed for the ethical evaluation of PH programs, but none are universally approved. 11e13 Most of these frameworks were based on common underpinning assumptions, but they were formed to address ethical issues either theoretically or practically. Kass 11 was the first pioneer who proposed a primary practical framework for ethical evaluation of PH, including six steps, based on two key values of social rights and social justice. Childress et al. 14 conceptualized general moral considerations in PH practice and introduced six justificatory conditions to solve conflicts in the context of PH. In the stewardship model proposed by the Nuffield Council on Bioethics 2007, 15 only practical recommendations for ethical decision-making were mentioned. On the other hand, given the debates raised about priority setting, especially in developing countries, ethical frameworks based on fundamental values of fairness and accountability have been proposed, which combine normative and empirical methods, and the involvement of all stakeholders and partners in policy decisions. 16e18 Thus, to enable legitimate and fair decision-making when considering priority setting in PH policy, the 'accountability for reasonableness' 19 framework was created, which was then developed by health system stakeholders in developing countries specifically for their requirements. 20e22 Given the evolution and specialization of these frameworks, Ten Have et al., 12 proposed a practical framework to evaluate overweight and obesity interventions, after providing an inventory of relevant moral norms. At the heart of the framework is a list of eight questions on the morally relevant features of a program, which is then followed by procedural recommendations for applying the ethical framework. Marckmann et al., 13 proposed an ethical framework to guide professionals in planning, conducting, and evaluating PH interventions. Their proposed framework contains an explicit normative foundation with five substantive criteria, five questions on the morally relevant features of a PH program, and seven procedural conditions to guarantee a fair decision-making process. However, the authors did not assess its practical application to determine the efficiency of the framework.",24.84779736994853,11.53693231105509

In implying that infection risk may be equally distributed across populations, handwashing campaigns exclude the insights of decades of research on the social determinants of health and diseases. In this context, rhetoricians of health and medicine and health humanities scholars contribute meaningful investigations of the rhetoric of personal responsibility and specifically of its emphasis on fear, anxiety, distrust, stigma, and blame.

Health humanities scholars and rhetoricians of health and medicine share a common concern for the ethical issues that arise from risk-management exercises undertaken in the name of public health. 3 Practitioners, too, have a stake in more detailed understandings of the impact of risk discourse on the formation of health subjectivity. However, as Keränen (2014b) explains in the Health Humanities Reader, Ba rhetorical perspective focuses on how specific symbolic patterns structure meaning and action^in health and public-health contexts (37). Writing for this journal, for example, Ding (2014b) stresses the economic and sociocultural effects of media portrayals of Bat risk^populations during severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). 4 My essay contributes to this scholarship with an account of how messaging that seeks to engage publics in outbreak management shapes their perceptions of responsibility and risk, not to mention of public health. As I argue, handwashing campaigns reinforce an individualistic model of public health, one premised to a significant extent on the necessity of behavior change rather than structural intervention. Some scholars-for example, Peterson and Lupton (1996) -term this model the Bnew public health.P ersonal responsibility serves essential functions in response to the threat of infection. However, the mandating of personal responsibility for infection risk has the potential to galvanize a culture of stigma and blame. Too narrow a focus on personal responsibility may also diminish perceptions of the effectiveness of improved structural supports for those infected. During H1N1, for example, universal paid sick leave became a topic of debate, serving as a reminder of the need for an environment supportive of individual efforts to manage infection risk. In this essay, I characterize hand hygiene promotion as both a Bconstitutive rhetoric^and a Bstigmatizing rhetoric.^Whereas a constitutive rhetoric encourages action through the cultivation of subjectivity, a stigmatizing rhetoric uses stigma to shape perceptions-also typically for the sake of influencing behavior change. I also describe how scholars of rhetoric of health and medicine have employed these two theories and explain their value to health humanities practitioners and scholars. I then examine the uses of constitutive and stigmatizing rhetoric in a U.S. state-level campaign to enforce Bhygienic norms^(including, importantly, hand hygiene) within the workplace. My analysis reveals the centrality of stigma and blame to these efforts to encourage the assumption of personal responsibility.",24.079725447189187,13.246306089572094

These often depend on operation scale, type of farming practices et cetera. The risks associated with conventional cropping systems are bound to differ from those of systems that combine intensive livestock farming with arable farming. In addition to general studies, a case-by-case approach should be considered where possible (if financial and technical resources, as well as other circumstances, permit) because farming operations vary widely from farm to farm and this influences the potential for pathogen occurrence, survival, proliferation and dissemination.",14.483583415557309,11.38668283199596

IBCs and other bodies such as the Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had approval authority, and the RAC process could be of optimal value as a means of informing the deliberations of these other groups.

With the advent of recombinant DNA techniques in the early 1970s, a debate arose in the scientific community regarding the potential health and environmental risks of genetically manipulated organisms. The public also became involved in this debate. The concern about the dangers of emerging recombinant DNA technologies led to the scientific community calling for an unprecedented voluntary moratorium on certain experiments with recombinant DNA until the risks could be further characterized and procedures developed to minimize those risks. Scientists called for the formation of a national oversight body to ensure public discussion and ongoing oversight of this emerging technology [3] . One of the outcomes of this process was the formation of the National Institutes of Health Recombinant In the mid-1970s, recombinant DNA was a nascent and poorly understood technology, but was emerging as an important tool for conducting biomedical research. The public was apprehensive about this novel technology, related to the potential impact on the environment and public health, as well as a host of ethical and social issues due to its capacity to modify the molecular centerpiece of life. The debate over safety captured congressional attention, resulting in over a dozen legislative proposals that would have statutorily imposed a number of restrictions on the development and use of this technology [4] . A number of local jurisdictions were also considering similar ordinances that would have precluded the use of recombinant DNA altogether. Most notable among these was the city of Cambridge, Massachusetts, that in 1977 became the first jurisdiction in the United States to directly regulate basic scientific research using recombinant DNA [5] . The Cambridge Recombinant DNA Technology Ordinance also established strict oversight of university and commercial laboratories that engaged in recombinant DNA research. The requirements set forth in that city ordinance were based on the NIH Guidelines and the Cambridge Biosafety Committee carried out enforcement.

Thus, since the inception of RCTs, researchers have acknowledged that until an intervention has been proven benefi cial, randomisation is the most ethical approach and provides the best answer soonest. 7, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] The idea that RCTs are ethically unjustifi ed in the present Ebola outbreak might be based on several widespread misconceptions.",13.81574540123406,8.696847062058966

Currently, countries such as Thailand are experiencing an increase in tourism demand due to sex tourism (tourism activities which lead to sexual activity, particularly involving children). 'In 1998, the International Labour Organization reported its calculations that 2-14 per cent of the gross domestic product of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand derives from sex tourism. In addition, while Asian countries, including Thailand, India and the Philippines, have long been prime destinations for child sex tourists, in recent years, tourists have increasingly travelled to Mexico and Central America for their sexual exploits as well' (Nair, 2006) . Countries which are starved for hard foreign currency often look the other way as the cash flows in (Nair) . Western governments, including the United States, are now enacting laws which allow prosecution for sex tourism and the tourists despite the crimes taking place in foreign soil. Existing laws make it illegal to travel with the intent to have sex with a minor. Proposals for new laws that would make it illegal to have sex with a child in another country are now being pursued. Policy creation and implementation is complex and difficult to implement as the activities are international in scope, with victims and perpetuators coming from different countries. Further complicating this situation is the fact that each country, in many cases, has jurisdiction over only part of the criminal activity. To give more force to existing laws, a bill was introduced in the US Government on 28 April 2005, entitled the 'End Demand for Sex Trafficking Act of 2005.' The bill included a provision that would amend the language specifically to state that individuals engaging in sexual activity can be charged with a criminal offense as 'a purchaser of commercial sexual activities'. Passage of this amendment would clarify for federal prosecutors that enforcement of the law can and should be used to prosecute US-based sex tour operators (Equality Now, 2006) .

The EVD outbreak in 2014 generated concerns at the global level, and prompted WHO to declare an international health emergency. While WHO did not recommend a closing of borders, it warned that every traveler should be screened (WHO, 2014b) . Mandatory screening at airports and borders negate the principle of autonomy and privacy. On any suspicion of high fever, a traveler might be subjected to further screening, denied right of movement at that moment, and if there is any other positive indication, the traveler might be quarantined.",33.202406535986526,14.2870483732772

Although there is no known cure for Ebola virus, there is some evidence that the severity of the disease can be curtailed using plasma from survivors. Although there is a general consensus on the importance of research, methodological and ethical challenges for conducting research in an emergency situation have been identified. Performing clinical trials is important, especially for health conditions that are of public health significance (including rare epidemics) to develop new therapies as well as to test the efficacy and effectiveness of new interventions. However, routine clinical trial procedures can be difficult to apply in emergency public health crises hence require a consideration of alternative approaches on how therapies in these situations are tested and brought to the market. This paper examines some of the ethical issues that arise when conducting clinical trials during a highly dangerous pathogen outbreak, with a special focus on the Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa. The issues presented here come from a review of a protocol that was submitted to the Global Emerging Pathogens Treatment Consortium (GET). In reviewing the proposal, which was about conducting a clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of using convalescent plasma in the management of Ebola virus disease, the authors deliberated on various issues, which were documented as minutes and later used as a basis for this paper. The experiences and reflections shared by the authors, who came from different regions and disciplines across Africa, present wide-ranging perspectives on the conduct of clinical trials during a dangerous disease outbreak in a resource-poor setting.",25.82386548750164,12.655169500921136

Cell culture tests largely solve the ethical issues and are cheaper to perform, and recent efforts to compare sensitivity and specificity with animal tests have been promising [3] .

I came away from the experience convinced that Stephen Toulmin had it right in his now quarter-century old article, ""The Tyranny of Principles"" (Toulmin 1981) . Neither absolute adherence to principles, nor relativistic acceptance of all ""moral"" views, is likely to result in a set of ethical guidelines that most people in a highly diverse society can accept as substantially their own. Rather, any such set of ethical guidelines is likely to be built ""taxonomically, taking one difficult class of cases at a time and comparing it in detail with other clearer and easier classes of cases"" (Toulmin 1981, 31) . The NC IOM/DPH Task Force stalled when it tried to agree on abstract definitions of terms like ""duty,"" ""obligation,"" and ""responsibility,"" but it made substantial progress as soon as Task Force members began to share cases in which it was clear to them, for example, that a physician had a duty/obligation/responsibility to work and cases in which it was not clear. By comparing and contrasting clear and unclear cases, the Task Force was able to write ethical guidelines that, in its collective estimation, would help decisionmakers handle, fairly and compassionately, all but the hardest cases-the kind of cases which tragically result in someone or some group being harmed despite everyone's best intensions and efforts to avoid this state of affairs. I left my role as co-Chair of the NC IOM/DPH Task Force convinced that when an influenza pandemic arrives, the kind of ethics most likely to persuade people to do their duty and more is not a rights-based, duties-based, or utility-based ethics, but a care-based ethics. We human beings are a very vulnerable lot. We are radically dependent on each other for survival and we need to view ourselves as folks in a lifeboat in the middle or the ocean with no visible sign of rescue. If there aren't enough supplies to go around until help arrives, we can do several things: we can ask for volunteers to jump off the boat; we can start drawing straws for who gets pushed off the boat; we can have a majority vote about which lives are most dispensable; or we can look in each others' eyes and see ourselves-fearful, hopeful, and in need of compassion. Then start paddling together to get to shore, knowing that although we might not all make it, we did not turn on each other in our panic.

The author discusses the threat of a pandemic in the twenty-first century, comparing a potential pandemic with past flu pandemics as well as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Canada and parts of Asia. Also discussed are the ways in which influenza would spread, be treated, and hopefully contained. Addressed are the ways in which one becomes ethically prepared for an influenza pandemic, as well as the challenges to incorporating ethical guidelines in preparations. Tong also addresses the role of a duty/obligation/responsibility to work by health care personnel, the role of volunteers, and when health care personnel may refuse to treat someone. Also taken into consideration are such issues as the distribution of food and vaccines, quarantines, work stoppage, both physical and social infrastructure, the role of military and police forces, and the effect of a pandemic, isolation, and quarantine on various industries. Tong shows the complicated nature of working on a task force and the complexity of incorporating ethics into logistical planning.",16.651056890900826,10.510964580203655

A large number of drugs are toxic in nature, requiring careful dosing and monitoring when used therapeutically. Others have undesired effects if taken in the absence of a particular pathology or antigen. Safety issues include not only the side effects and toxicity of drugs, but adverse drug interactions, contraindications, off-label use, and black market trade in pharmaceuticals. It is also important to remember that in virtually every medical encounter, a value judgment is made about whether the side effects or toxicity of the treatment is outweighed by its positive therapeutic effects. Often, clinicians and patients differ about that value equation. It is an ethical mandate that drugs be safe within the medical meaning of that term (i.e., if taken appropriately and with knowledge of possible side effects and toxicities). However, the standards for drug safety, the evaluation of drug safety, and the regulation of safe pharmaceutical development do not inherently raise ethical questions unless they violate some reasonable standard of ethical competence. A clear ethical issue does arise, however, in the attempt to avoid or minimize safety standards, especially in the pursuit of profits or market share. In a broader sense, there is also an ethical discussion to be had about taking the risk of ingesting drugs for life style or enhancement purposes, or under duress. Is it ethical to prescribe psychopharmaceuticals for people without diagnosed mental illness simply because they seek to alter their personality or sense of self? 5 Is it acceptable to make psychopharmaceutical treatment a condition of employment or release from jail? Is it ethical, for that matter, to mandate treatment for those facing trial or on death row in order to try them or to execute them? 6 Balancing the risk of life style pharmaceuticals with a growing consumer demand is one of the biggest ethical challenges of drug development in the coming decades (see Section 1.22.6.1).",23.67910981461098,11.999544430768903

In the American survey, 21 25% of 664 adults who had major responsibility for children 17 years old or younger reported that a child in their household gets free breakfast or lunch at school or daycare. 34% of these 166 recipients of free meals said that not getting them during a 3-month closure would be a problem.

The FDA has been accused of ignoring scientists' concerns about the dangers of some approved products on the market (e.g., Vioxx) and avoiding internal debates about drug safety factors. Critical discussions have been discouraged under the combined pressures of recent approval process acceleration mandates funded by the very (pharmaceutical) corporations whose efforts the agency is judging (i.e., the 1992 Prescription Drug User Fee Act). 47 Similarly, the UK's National Health Service has recently been accused of lapses in their drug approval and monitoring role, and in allowing the pharmaceutical industry's influence to sway providers' and consumers' increased reliance on medication. 48 The example regarding the lack of new antibiotic development efforts is indicative of a broader issue of ethical concern underlying the motives and rationale often driving the direction of pharmaceutical R&D.

Whereas it sometimes arrives at the same conclusions reached by traditional bioethical approaches, 164 employing it as a complimentary approach to the moral quandaries generated by pandemic influenza should yield additional nuances and insights visà-vis resolving the associated moral concerns. Care ethics emphasizes varying degrees of care within relational contexts ranging from the personal sphere to the realm of moral strangers. Hence, it is an other and people-centric moral lens. It has 162 Henk ten Have, Global Bioethics: An Introduction (Routledge, 2016). P. 113. 163 Peter A Singer et al., ""Ethics and Sars: Lessons from Toronto,"" British Medical Journal 327, no. 7427 (2003) . Pp. 1342-1343. 164 Edwards, ""Is there a Distinctive Care Ethics?"" P. 185. been applied to diverse relational contexts including everyday lives, professional practices, social and public policies, as well as international relations. 165 For scholars like Steven Edwards, ethics of care uses a distinct ontological commitment to realize its outcomes as well as justify its stance. 166 It is an attempt to re-conceptualize and renegotiate the moral landscape in order to give room for a plurality of values. 167 Some have argued that the removal of friendship with its altruistic emotional sequelae and the subversion of virtue ethics from the sphere of morality were some key factors that warranted the moral change which birthed the ethics of care framework. 168 While EOC is also linked with gender-based morality which undergirded campaigns for equal employment opportunities between the sexes, legal rights, reforms of family life and sexual standards, and better education 169 ; scholars like Noddings have pointed out that it is broader and deeper than feminist ethics. 170 To be sure, one of its major impetus is the call for the expression of higher capabilities. 171 Care ethics also encapsulates a spectrum of ideas. For Kittay, care constitutes an ""achievement term"" such that caring occurs only when specific acts of care have been carried out. 172 In this vein, intentionality would not qualify as part of the baggage of care rhetoric. This obviously has some pragmatic appeal. Most people, for instance, would only appreciate care if it helps contribute towards relieving their current distress. Yet, caring may also constitute a general attitude and an orientation which may provide appropriate background conditions for shaping responses to others' needs and states of distresses. Also, one may care but situational constraints may limit how a caring impulse may translate into pragmatic ends. Therefore, that someone simply ""lacked opportunity"" to show care as Apostle Paul writes in his epistle to the Philippians does not necessarily indicate the absence of care. 173 Hence, caring cannot be reduced only to materialistic terms. One way to distinguish the general caring orientation from specific acts of care is to refer to each as ""caring about"" and ""caring for"" respectively. 174 Care ethics locates morality within the ambiance of family, friends, and colleagues, and ultimately towards the public sphere. 175 It rejects the independent and atomistic notion of the self and champions an inter-dependent and inter-related view. 176 This approach grants EOC a psychological gestalt to which people brought up in caring relationships, at least in the early phases of their lives, can readily identify with. It thus partly appeals to Kohlberg's theory of moral development. Here, the emphasis is put on the foundational roles of trust and its place in fostering a deepened sense of reciprocity within a social context of inequality. 177 Not surprisingly, some ethicists describe caring as the primary virtue which offers a general account of right versus wrong actions as well as political justice. 178 Whereas the informal social contract idea underlies inter-personal and stateindividual relationships, 179 the care ethical lens may be applied to the personal sphere as well as social institutions 180 due to its multiple ways of situating relationality. 181 Indeed, EOC focuses on attentiveness and sensitivity to the needs of others 182 and offers a moral compass for teasing out delicate boundaries between obligation-based ethics and responsibility-based ethics. As such, it seeks to transcend the depersonalized realm of asking ""what obligations do I have to Mr. X"" to the humane realm of asking ""how can I help Mr. X"" in scenarios of moral crises. 183 Since caring embodies an activity, a set of activities or a labor of care from one person to the other, it presupposes that the capacity for receiving care 184 will be present in the recipient(s) of care.",20.122355258517334,11.073522985595964

P. 72. tion that it is not possible to integrate and apply justice to care, 192 such a limitation hardly applies to the context of a public health disaster such as pandemic influenza. For instance, the different conflicting priorities that arise during influenza outbreaks such as rationing of limited resources will be easier if some people are at least willing to forgo their interests for others. In non-familial carer and cared-for relationships involving at-risk government representatives and at-risk members of the society and familial relationships involving parents and children living in the same house, an appeal to a care ethical lens may help drive the moral sensitivity to the needs of others, enabling some vaccine-eligible persons (under the standard rationing criteria) to forgo their ration, preferring rather that other at-risk people (for example, ordinary people and younger family members) have them. This kind of selflessness approximates some form of humanitarian act in that person A decides to overlook their interests for others ""without expecting rewards"". 193 However, because human beings naturally seek their own personal interests, there may be some difficulty in achieving this other-centric goal in as many people as possible in a public health disaster situation. This implies that the care ethical lens may have some limitations in relation to sufficiently engaging the ethical dilemmas raised by pandemic influenza in particular and other types of public health disasters, in general.

The ANA code of ethics does not explicitly detail the obligation of nurses to report to duty during emergencies; however, it does address nurses' responsibilities to the public. One such responsibility outlined in the ANA code of ethics is that nurses have an obligation to ""participate in institutional and legislative efforts to promote health and meet national health objectives."" 17 In an effort to examine ethical issues that arise during a pandemic disaster, Ehrenstein and colleagues 41 completed a quantitative survey design study. Surveys were sent to 1898 health care workers (HCWs) at a university hospital in Regensburg, Germany. Only 644 surveys were returned and of the 644 returned surveys, 264 of these HCWs were nurses. The purpose of the study was to solicit opinions of employees on professional ethics of proper response to pandemic influenza. Researchers discovered that 182 (28%) of the 644 HCWs surveyed believed that it was professionally acceptable to abandon the workplace to protect themselves and their family during a pandemic. 41 In addition, 77% of the respondents disagreed that HCWs should be permanently dismissed for not reporting to work during a pandemic, and 21% of the participants believed that HCWs without children should care primarily for the influenza patients. The researchers concluded that HCWs would benefit from further education regarding efficacy and availability of medications during a pandemic. It was also recognized that professional ethical guidelines are needed to help HCWs fulfill their duties in cases of pandemics. 41 Although this study revealed interesting information regarding the HCW's willingness to report to work during a pandemic, the survey used to complete the study was a newly developed instrument, and reliability and validity have not been established.",35.248867599683244,15.18090015151206

The transition to a health care system based on electronic information will require changes in expectations and create varying degrees of confusion as new patterns of practice are developed. The availability of substantially complete information about patients at most clinical encounters will be a dramatic change from current practice, for example, and is likely to require significant adaptations in the methods that physicians use to review and evaluate patients. Clear understanding of NHII including its benefits and progress will be essential to address the anxieties that will naturally arise from this change process. Concerns about privacy are particularly sensitive. Since clinical practice will change, training programs for health professionals must also incorporate modern information systems to prepare trainees for practicing with NHII. There will also be substantial demands for health informatics professionals to lead and coordinate NHII development activities, so steps must be taken to strengthen and expand specialized training programs to assure an adequate supply.

This is because the mass media -print, television, radio and internet -is able to reach such a large and diversified audience, [1] [2] [3] and is crucial to getting public messages out in a crisis. 4 However, it also exerts a powerful influence on the way a pandemic is represented or 'framed'; for example, as crisis, or mere beat up; or as well or poorly managed. These frames influence people's reactions. 5 Health experts are not immune to such 'framing effects', and in previous respiratory illness crises, such as the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, were both reliant on and influenced by mass media reporting on events. 4, 6 Most commentators feel that it is therefore important that in addition to its commercial functions, the mass media does and should serve key civic functions. These include ensuring that citizens are sufficiently informed about significant issues as to be able to make appropriate decisions and to engage in forms of collective action against threats, such as infectious disease. Many studies of media ethics concentrate on identifying the ways in which coverage falls short of this ideal. The limitations of mass media reporting, mostly resulting from its commercial imperatives, have been repeatedly described since the 1960s. Among them are claims that the media is prone to sensationalism, sins of omission and sheer inaccuracy 7, 8 ; that in seeking to provide 'both sides of a story', it may perpetuate a problem or give unwarranted validity to wholly untenable views; that it leaves out complexity 8 and is the reverse of 'evidence based'. 9, 10 The perennial challenge for health policymakers, advocates, clinicians and researchers who respond to influenza and other infectious diseases is communicating extensively while avoiding these pitfalls. The unavoidable and critical effects of mass media coverage of epidemics and pandemics make it important that health experts who may play a role in responding to such events have a clear understanding of the factors that shape media reporting.",12.46018220977044,7.803256578233039

The controversy over the HPAIV GOF experiments has led to calls for another Asilomar-like conference. The goal of such a conference would be to bring the parties interested in the issues related to GOF experiments together with the hope of finding common ground and finding a way to allow GOF research to go forward with minimal risk and maximal benefit. We think this is a good idea, and this was our primary intent in signing the CWG document. However, we caution that the times are very different now than in 1975, when the Asilomar meeting took place. Today, communication by e-mail and Twitter is instantaneous, and the information conveyed by these new media is different than the phone conversations and mail correspondence of that time. In fact, to date, much of the discussion between the interested camps on GOF research has been “Twitter-like,” with statements made via general media or e-mail messages to supporters. This type of communication reduces complex issues to terse, often definitive-sounding statements that can be polarizing. Thus, we think that there must be a broad-based, rational, face-to-face discussion. Hence, if such a conference is to be convened, we call on the organizers to assemble groups with wide representation of individuals with a direct stake in this research as well as thoughtful scientists with no skin in the game, to tackle such issues as risk-benefit, ethics, biosafety, biosecurity, etc. Ideally, just like treaty negotiations between countries, much of the work should be done by smaller groups that explore the various issues and identify areas where consensus is possible and those where both sides must agree to disagree. The conference would then function to inform on areas that hopefully have been agreed to, or explored and found to have no common ground, as well as involving all participants in more focused discussions. Interestingly, a similar call for discussion of the risks and benefits was recently raised with respect to the rapidly advancing use of gene drives, a research area ripe with risk-benefit uncertainties similar to those of the influenza virus GOF experiments (25, 26).",13.821034025767815,8.611294759379605

The first factor relates to concerns regarding the inefficiency of the peer review process [2]. It can take months or even years to publish an article presenting research findings. Most conventional journals determine whether to publish an article or to require further revisions through a peer review process, which involves evaluation of an article by two or three peer reviewers (researchers who are working in similar fields), revision by the author, and further assessment after the revision in order to ensure ethical and scientific reliability. Hence, it is inevitable for the peer review process to take considerable time. In situations like the Ebola, Zika, and COVID-19 outbreaks, early and transparent dissemination of research findings may lead to more expedited prevention and treatment efforts [3]. Traditional peer review is not compatible with the time constraints imposed by such circumstances, and preprints can therefore be considered as a supplementary method to address these issues.",14.02868016138531,6.495280435196558

Good prevention requires good predictive diagnosis. Gene analysis or hypercoagulability of plasma might be earlier methods to predict ON development, although dynamic perfusion MRI is another advanced and promising bioimaging approach. Chinese herb and statins treatment produced significantly lower incidences of SAON both in humans and animal models, implying that they might be promising alternatives for prevention and eventually treatment of SAON. The apoptosis of osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and osteocytes suggested a new mechanism for the effect of steroids, giving a new insight into mechanisms responsible for bone loss in patients with SAON. Core decompression combined with bone grafting, bone marrow or cells transplantation, and growth factors is the best documented therapy for early SAON stage(s). The newly tested osteopromotive porous composite scaffolds were also promising for enhancing repair of ON lesions after core decompression [88], [87].

While informed consent ought to be obtained before taking any specimen, caring for very ill people focused on survival in often suboptimal treatment units makes this difficult. Also, there are concerns about obtaining informed consent from minors who may not have parents or guardian present while quarantined, or the parents may have died as a result of the epidemic. In the case of deceased people, the USA regulations do not require consent before taking biospecimens. It is, however, recognized that deceased people may have had interests and values regarding the use of their specimens that should be respected.86 Similarly, the USA does not require consent for use of deidentified specimens, but the ethical concerns still hold, since genomic research, where data cannot truly be deidentified given that every human genome is unique, is possible.48 Jecker et al87 therefore identified the need for additional guidance on the challenges of obtaining informed consent for collecting and sharing biospecimens in the context of a public health emergency.",17.09027036338797,9.56879960803601

Scholars paid particular attention on anticipatory measures (eg, advance model protocols),7 alternative consent models or procedures to streamline the work of ethics review committees.8 In August 2014, when the Ebola epidemic was escalating, anticipatory measures were not in place. The questions put to the WHO panel represented predictable but unresolved challenges to established ethical and regulatory norms of clinical research. The panel's main recommendations have not fundamentally been disputed by the scientific community. Yet serious criticisms were expressed by some ethicists about procedural issues, such as the process of the meeting, the scientific legitimacy of the panellists9 or the legitimacy of international ethical guidance in general.10 Some have also argued that the focus of the meeting on clinical research ethics was inappropriate, considering that more pressing public health issues were left unanswered.11

Ethical Aspects of (Visions of) Preventive Forensic Screening,"This return of the Lomrosian vision in contemporary science has attracted some critical attention in mass media (Cohen, 2011; Tallis, 2013), but has so far received sparse scrutiny from ethical standpoints. Horskötter has commented on versions of the Lombrosian vision targeting children and psychopathy (Horstkötter and de Wert, 2013; Horstkötter et al., 2014), and there has been some interest from scholars within the rapidly growing field of neurolaw (e.g. Søbirk Petersen, 2014). Most of this latter field, however, focus on the possible impact of neuroscientific findings on legal responsibility and legal practices more generally (Aharoni et al. 2008; Vincent, 2013, 2014). The lack of research on ethical implications of the new Lombrosian vision may be due to the intricacies of applying standard bioethics perspectives to areas where health care and medicine is put to serve the legal system, such as forensic psychiatry (Appelbaum, 2008; Munthe et al., 2010). However, the general notion of broad screening programmes for the purpose of advancing general societal values actualize particular ethical complexities (Juth and Munthe, 2012), and the very idea of basing both penal and preventive criminal policy on forensic psychiatric risk assessment brings both scientific and ethical hazards of its own (Nilsson et al., 2009). At the same time, just as it did in the 19th century, the idea of switching said policy to a mode of prevention rather than one that is met within the range of criminal sanctions, may seem the logical step given that crimes can be explained by factors outside the offenders’ control and thus be used to challenge the very idea of retribution (Gray, 1858; Raine, 2013; Glenn and Raine, 2014). This article aims to facilitate further specific inquiry into this intersection of bio, legal and social ethics by providing a critical overview of the new Lombrosian vision from a public health perspective and to review some central ethical issues actualized by its general idea of forensic screening programmes2 for early detection of individuals who are at risk of committing crimes to target with preventive or mitigating measures.",20.638899709596057,9.861890444194113

On this basis, we describe 27 strategy types for how the new Lombrosian vision may take concrete form and, in section 3, analyse these from the perspective of general ethical concerns regarding screening and the intersection of medicine and criminal law policy. We hereby identify an underlying nest of general ethical issues, further discussed in section 4. This concerns the balancing of risks of negative side effects—well known from the bioethical discussion of screening programmes—against possible benefits described mostly in non-health terms and linking to the institutional values of criminal law.

It is deemed a cost-effective investment in preventing losses and is considered one of the four priority areas in the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030 which has been endorsed by the third United Nations World Conference in Japan.4 Over the past few decades, emergency response efforts have evolved from a focus on top-down relief assistance to a more comprehensive strategy with a greater emphasis on community participation and pre-event preparedness for better risk management. This is because emergency victims often face geographical isolation as a result of damage to local infrastructure such as energy, road and communication facilities.5 Consequently, the arrival of external rescue support may experience two or more days of delay.6 But rescue efforts in the first couple of days in disastrous events are critical.7 Community and household preparedness in self-rescue efforts prior to the arrival of external assistance may result in the difference between the chance of survival and death.8 Empirical evidence shows that sufficient household preparedness can significantly mitigate the negative consequences of emergency events.9

Three of the exposed loops consist of variable sequence domains while a fourth loop near the COOH terminus of the protein is highly conserved. The differential binding of Opa proteins to CD66 receptors is likely a reflection of the ability of these variable domains to interact with the receptors. As we pointed out previously 10, it is remarkable that Opa proteins, such as OpaB, OpaC, and OpaI, that contain heterologous variable domains recognize the same subgroup of CD66 family members. However, our present data showing differences in binding of mutant molecules by these Opa proteins may indicate that they actually bind with slightly different characteristics, which would be expected from proteins with such divergent binding domain sequences. The opa gene family is thought to have arisen from recent gene duplication events and genetic reassortment of variable sequence domains between members of the gene family 25

29. Interestingly, the CD66 family also appears to have arisen recently by duplication of at least one ancestral gene. Sequence comparisons between the rodent and primate CD66 gene families show higher interspecies than intraspecies variation, suggesting that the duplication occurred after mammalian radiation took place 30
31. In addition, the mutation rate in the CD66 N-domain exons is twice as high as that of the adjacent intron, suggesting that the CD66 family is still undergoing rapid evolution 30. It is tempting to speculate that the extensive evolution of the opa gene family in the strictly human pathogen Ngo has taken place in response to the rapidly evolving family of primate-specific CD66 molecules. The observed differential Opa–CD66 binding patterns may be a reflection of this process.",8.047313752015294,3.5811990894714505

This will require simple, robust designs with limited/no connections, moving parts or electronics, and designs that rely only on available equipment or components within an intensive care unit or parts that can be 3D printed locally. Thirdly, development of standard protocols for controlling/calibrating the systems to deliver desired tidal volumes and pressures to each patient is required. To this end, it might be necessary to add check valves directly after the variable resistances in order to prevent flow from one patient to the other; it is possible that cases exist where there is flow from one patient to the other if check valves are not inserted. Though these check valves would involve adding components, it significantly simplifies the analysis and design of control protocols. Future work would need to establish if control protocols can be developed to allow selection of the appropriate variable resistances/PIP combinations to achieve target tidal volume for both patients, or whether additional patient monitoring is required to facilitate this proposed solution. Finally, the process for triaging, selecting and consenting pairs of patients to be supported by one ventilator needs to be established. This consideration raises ethical issues.

There is no plausible path by which two non-overlapping genes could re-encode an equivalent protein sequence as overlapping; instead, an overlapping pair arises either when a second gene is born de novo within an existing gene, or when the boundaries of an existing gene are extended to create overlap [38] . In the latter case of ""overprinting"" [7] , [19] , [36] , the extended portion of that gene, if not the whole gene, is born de novo. One overlapping protein-coding sequence is therefore always evolutionarily younger than the other; we refer to these as ""novel"" versus ""ancestral"" overlapping genes or portions of genes. Genes may eventually lose their overlap through a process of gene duplication followed by subfunctionalization [19] , enriching overlapping genes for relatively young genes that have not yet been through this process. However, gene duplication may be inaccessible to many viruses (in particular, many RNA, ssDNA, and retroviruses), due to intrinsic geometric constraints on maximum nucleotide length [6] , [9] , [11] .",12.464586973838118,7.232744628417727

However, if we don't take deliberate efforts to formally facilitate this intersection across our research communities, we risk producing a series of disparate individual efforts, limited in interoperability, transparency, reproducibility and scalability. The EMEWS (extreme model exploration with Swift) framework 100 was developed to directly address this issue and to provide a broadly applicable cyberinfrastructure to lower the barriers for utilization of advanced, large-scale model exploration on HPC resources. The EMEWS paradigm allows for the direct exploitation of cutting edge statistical and machine learning algorithms that make up the vibrant ecosystem of free and open source libraries that are continually added to and updated as research frontiers are expanded, all while controlling simulation workflows that can be run anywhere from desktops to campus clusters and to the largest HPC resources.",9.27849933363621,6.667298437159941

Also, our strategy will become more efficient when more IC facilities become available, as control can then be lifted simultaneously in multiple areas. In addition, new drugs may reduce the proportion of infected cases requiring IC or the duration of their admission, allowing further shortening of the strategy. We are working on a user-friendly version of the model to support strategy design.
