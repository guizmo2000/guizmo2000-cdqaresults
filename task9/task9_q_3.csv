The lack of apparent correlation between different-omics types (protein and transcript) described above has also emerged when networks of multiple data types are constructed. Despite this hurdle, approaches that effectively integrate data across different technological platforms and biomolecular classes are likely to become more important as multi-omics data becomes easier to generate. Platforms such as mass-spectrometry and RNA-seq also result in missing values when molecules fall below an abundance threshold, and attempts have been made to develop methodologies to incorporate these data types when building networks using mutual information scores [40, 41] . With the goal of creating improved integrated networks, we examine here a number of network inference tools using several types of-omics data (mainly transcriptomic and proteomic) and identify those inference tools that create the most integrated networks, defined as those having the maximum number of edges connecting different types of-omics data, termed cross-type edges. Previous studies have focused on ranking network inference methods based on accuracy and have found that GENIE3, a random forest method, created the best network in terms of its ability to link known regulator-target pairs in Escherichia coli [42] . However, there has been no corresponding analysis that systematically ranks network inference methods by their ability to create integrated networks of transcripts and proteins. We perform this ranking here and find that, in most cases, GENIE3 is also the best inference method to create integrated networks of proteomic and transcriptomic data. We show that these networks, including the cross-type edges in the network, are accurate, and we use this approach to interrogate and compare networks inferred from data derived from antibodymediated entry of Dengue virus into cells and from receptor-mediated entry. The methods presented here provide important guidance for constructing multi-omic networks representing host responses to infection, and offer strategies for inferring networks that can act as highly accurate and robust models of cellular systems.",21.454900333332372,9.316964543031228

Lessons from the case of a Zika virus human challenge trial,"As the potential funders of such a trial, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research were concerned that Zika virus HCTs were ethically complex. They therefore assembled an independent, multidisciplinary expert panel to address the question of whether a Zika virus HCT could be ethically justified, and if so, under what conditions. The panel included ethicists with expertise in several subfields of research ethics (i.e. the ethics of human challenge trials, study design, translational and early phase research, and research with pregnant women), a neurologist, two obstetrician/ gynecologists, and an infectious disease physician. Panel members were vetted to ensure there were no conflicts of interest. The panel was charged with making recommendations to NIH about the ethical considerations for Zika HCTs in general. Unlike standard ethics review committee or institutional review board processes, the panel members did not review a study protocol. The panel's deliberations were not meant to supplant existing review processes, but to supplement them. Accordingly, the panel considered the latest scientific and epidemiological information about Zika virus, existing ethical frameworks for HCTs, and ongoing research into Zika vaccines.",19.435968084360166,8.431937345990292

The largescale spatiotemporal spreading of diseases transmitted person to person via droplets or direct contact in real population is ultimately denominated by the population interaction which could be described by a social contact network and by interplay with the virus itself [3, 4] . Networks have provided a unified way to think about the daily interaction between individuals, are especially helpful when each individual is in direct contact with only a small proportion of the population [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] , and thus have been powerful tools for understanding the transmission of infection in the population due to either social contact or sexual contact. Several types of classical networks have been frequently used in epidemiological literatures, which are random networks [10] , lattices [11] , small world networks [12] , spatial networks [13] and scalefree networks [14] . Recently, researchers have incorporated demogeographic information into the contact network and integrated it with metapopulation model based on human mobility data [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] to pursue a better understanding of the role of real population structure and human mobility in the large-scale transmission of the diseases. The long-distance travel, which is the primary driving factor for the intersubpopulation pervasion of the contagion [20, 22] , has been explored a lot. However, when evaluating the risk of infection for long-distance travellers, present studies have arbitrarily neglected the travel types and assumed all the infectious individuals in targeted population will lead to equivalent risk to the travellers, which results in an underestimation of the risk.",19.518939000132,9.162840121603818

An ASP can be defined as a process that enhances the effectiveness of treatment by sharing the decision-making stage in the treatment of ID among a multidisciplinary team of experts. In this study, conflicts related to scopes of responsibility and interpretation of the treatment guidelines were found not only inter-professionally, between primary care physicians and pharmacists, but also intra-professionally, between ID specialists and primary team physicians. Since antimicrobials articulate important inter-professional asymmetries, pharmacists should be positioned as delimited negotiators within the context of medical prescribing power. A nuanced understanding of the characters of inter-professional negotiations is crucial for improving the use of antimicrobials within and beyond the hospital. Pharmacist participation is the starting point of ASP team building and can facilitate consensus among multidisciplinary healthcare professionals regarding prescription rights. In our study, non-ID specialists, ID specialists, and pharmacists understood the necessity of ASP and demanded the support of a central system and interrelated team action. However, they had drawn their own boundaries within the scopes of practice and the allowed collaborative share. Our in-depth interviews (IDIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs) suggest that the primary responsibility of patient care by the primary team physician should be respected, but at the same time, the antimicrobial treatment decision by the ASP should not be contestable.

We have shown that the definition of an EID strongly affects our understanding of how and why diseases emerge, which in turn informs efforts to prevent and mitigate emergence. Ultimately, what the scientific and health communities want to understand is what causes pathogens and infectious diseases to become increasing threats so that they can either be prevented or mitigated quickly and efficiently. Having a consistent, operational, and transparent definition of emergence and related concepts is critical for this purpose, yet the current definition has drifted, becoming less operational and less consistent. The framework we propose suggests a prioritization scheme that focuses on pathogens with realized or likely imminent public health impact, but the impact threshold remains elusive. We suggest that EIDs should be prioritized for adaptation and mitigation, emerging pathogens for preventive measures, and novel potential pathogens for intensive surveillance.

Enhanced surveillance measures with an emphasis on innovation, transparency and incorporation of the One Health model are critical to epidemic preparedness measures in the future. It is also crucial to encourage research during outbreaks through rapid data sharing to facilitate rapid response efforts, as is promoted through organisations such as the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC) [9] .

Coleman (1988) described social capital as being imbedded in social relationships and serving as resources for people to achieve their goals. Coleman introduced various forms of social capital such as obligations, expectations, and trustworthiness that exist in social structures, information channels imbedded in social relationships, and norms and effective sanctions against deviant behavior. Bourdieu (1986) , by contrast, introduced three types of capital: human capital (i.e., education), cultural capital (i.e., language), and social capital, defined as a form of group resources that accrue to individuals as a result of their membership in social networks.

The One Health concept brings together human and animal funding sources and it should be robustly promoted. On the applied side and for diagnostics the alignment of federal government funding is important.

Globally, high-consequence pathogens that impact livestock and have the potential for human transmission create research paradoxes and operational challenges for the high-containment laboratories that conduct work with them. These specialized facilities are required for conducting all phases of research on high-consequence pathogens (basic, applied, and translational) with an emphasis on both the generation of fundamental knowledge and product development. To achieve this research mission, a highly-trained workforce is required and flexible operational methods are needed. In addition, working with certain pathogens requires compliance with regulations such as the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Select Agent regulations, which adds to the operational burden. The vast experience from the existing studies at Plum Island Animal Disease Center, other U.S. laboratories, and those in Europe and Australia with biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) facilities designed for large animals, clearly demonstrates the valuable contribution this capability brings to the efforts to detect, prepare, prevent and respond to livestock and potential zoonotic threats.

By sharply reducing the retail prices of ACTs, the initiative hoped to displace oral artemisinin monotherapies and other medicines, such as chloroquine and sulfadoxinepyrimethamine, to which resistance had emerged. UNITAID, the Gates Foundation and DFID supported the piloting of this intervention with US$216 million while the Global Fund complemented this, committing up to US$127 million towards supporting interventions for scaling up ACT use effectively [12] . The premise and preliminary findings behind this pilot illustrate the complexity of delivering even existing innovations to those in need. Early findings from the Health Action International pricing survey in six African countries showed that the AMFm price bested the originator brand and the lowest-priced generic, approaching but not yet consistently beating the prices of irrational alternatives, like chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine [13] . In less than a year though, six out of eight pilot countries met or exceeded benchmarks for availability, price and market share of quality-assured ACTs, both in rural and urban areas [14] . Efforts in Tanzania showed that accredited drug dispensing outlets could complement these upstream interventions by increasing access to and dispensing of subsidized artemisinin combination therapy [15] . However, the volatility in artemisinin supply upstream has caused significant price fluctuations in the pricing of the active pharmaceutical ingredient of this drug. Though it may not offset entirely the greater demand for artemisinin from an expanded AMFm, the anticipated advent of artemisinin, sourced from microbial production, by late 2012 is a technology that may help stabilize and secure the supply of this critical drug for ACT [16] .",16.33143427416319,7.509545596993188

In recent years, many researchers have studied how interconnections between networks produce phenomena that are absent in isolated networks [2] . A system composed of interconnected networks, often called a network of networks [3] [4] [5] [6] , retains connectivity links within each individual network but adds dependency links that connect each network to other networks in the system. This interdependency is the cause of many realworld multiple network phenomena, such as failure cascades [7] , avalanches [8] , and traffic overloads [9] . Very recently physicists have begun to consider a particular class of network of networks in which the nodes have multiple types of links across different layers [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . These so-called multiplex networks were introduced in the social sciences several years ago [17] and provide a new way to advance the study of network complexity. They enable us to determine how the interplay between layers affects the dynamic processes running through them. This multiplex network approach has proven to be a successful tool in modeling a number of real-world systems, e.g., the European air transport system [18, 19] and the global cargo ship network [20] .",36.173998328647976,14.519884237061627

The search included peer-reviewed articles available todate in the U.S. National Library of Medicine's PubMed database that were searched using specified MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) terms. Although the multidisciplinary research team has extensive experience in One Health, they were not trained in sensitive search strategies [26] . The research team thus elected to work with a University of Minnesota research librarian to develop MeSH terms for this study. Table 1 provides a list of the key terms used to identify articles discussing multisectoral health events and collaborations. To avoid tautology, it was a deliberate decision to not use ""One Health"" as a search term. Instead, drawing upon the researchers' extensive experience in One Health, various terms were used to describe One Health and similar multidisciplinary and cross-sectoral health collaborations. The underlying assumption was that any articles explicitly addressing One Health would be captured using these key terms. This initial MeSH search identified 2,630 non-duplicated articles. This scoping review was an inductive study of the literature and was conducted in order to support more hypothesis driven research for One Health. By design, the authors elected to limit this literature review to the PubMed database at the outset of the study. PubMed is peer-reviewed and peer-led database. Articles are selected and included based on scholarly and quality criteria by literature review committees and are tagged by keyword and by article structure, contributing to more accurate retrieval than other databases (e.g. Google Scholar); accurate retrieval supports the search results are reproducible and reportable, which is critically important for a scoping review of the literature in which it is important for other researchers, no matter their location, to repeat the study. The decision to use one database reflects the exploratory nature of this study and the Author's intent to propose further hypothesis-driven research that may include additional databases. This methodological choice is in line with Arksey and O'Malley (2005) who attest that decisions must be made at the outset of a study to clarify reasons for the coverage of the review in terms of time span and language [26] [p.

As infectious disease threats have changed, several interdisciplinary networks that were first established to react to specific pathogen threats have subsequently been adapted and used for additional surveillance and response activities not within their original remit. The global network of laboratories established through the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, for example, have since expanded their scope to cover a range of other emerging pathogens, including the haemorrhagic fevers, Japanese encephalitis and SARS, and this network has also contributed resources to national responses to H5N1 influenza [11] . Similarly, efforts are being made to maintain and extend the international collaborations that fostered communication between organizations such as the FAO, World Bank, OIE, WHO and UNICEF during the spread of H5N1 to create a framework that can help reduce a range of disease risks at the animal-human interface [6, 7] .

Knowledge management theory has the potential to support research into problems such as HIV, antibiotic resistance and others, particularly in terms of aspects of scientific research related to the contribution of social science. To date, however, these challenges remain with us, and theoretical contributions that can complement natural science efforts to eradicate these problems are needed. This paper seeks to offer a theoretical contribution grounded in Kuhn's paradigm theory of innovation, and in the argument by Lakatos that scientific research can be fundamentally non-innovative, which suggests that social science aspects of knowledge creation may hold the key to more effective biomedical innovation. Given the consequences of ongoing and emerging global crises, and the failure of knowledge systems of scientific research to solve such problems outright, this paper provides a review of theory and literature arguing for a new paradigm in scientific research, based on the development of global systems to maximise research collaborations. A global systems approach effectively includes social science theory development as an important complement to the natural sciences research process. Arguably, information technology and social media technology have developed to the point at which solutions to knowledge aggregation challenges can enable solutions to knowledge problems on a scale hitherto unimaginable. Expert and non-expert crowdsourced inputs can enable problem-solving through exponentially increasing problem-solving inputs, using the 'crowd,' thereby increasing collaborations dramatically. It is argued that these developments herald a new era of participatory research, or a democratisation of research, which offers new hope for solving global social problems.

EcoHealth appeared to emphasize more on including all living creatures down to microscopic levels, while Planetary Health seemed more concerned with human health at global scale. This article documents that despite all being holistic approaches, they emerge from different core values. Interestingly, a bibliometric study investigating studies on dynamic disease modeling, substantiated similar silos previously, even within the One Health community (1). Duboz et al. inferred that the common holism is grounded in systems thinking and enabled by participatory modeling, which is why they advocate for the systematic incorporation of specialists in systems science and social engagement for all integrated approaches to health.

We provide, here, an ecological perspective on the EBOV multi-host system to provide a hypothesis-driven framework for future work. There is still a possibility that bats are not part of or that non-bat species are involved in the EBOV maintenance system and alternative scenarios should be considered and explored ( Figure 1 ) [46] .

Although an extensive literature exists on progress toward visions of ultimate eradication (see Burman, Aphane, & Delobelle, 2016) , challenges such as ongoing societal stigma (Gilbert, 2016) , poor infrastructure and treatment delivery issues (Koto & Maharaj, 2016) and continued risk-taking behaviours (Ngidi, Moyo, Zulu, Adam, & Krishna, 2016) persist. This article makes the argument that certain recent developments in knowledge management enabled by technological advances offer hope for the ultimate eradication of HIV/ AIDS, and offers insights into how these novel developments might contribute to this end. HIV/AIDS, however, is not alone among a host of global disease threats. Rapidly spreading antibiotic resistance heralds a post-antibiotic era (Gallagher, 2015) , or antibiotic apocalypse (Ash, 1996) ; a world in which childbirth, even minor surgery, minor injuries and exposure to tuberculosis or other bacterial infections can be life-threatening. Similarly, climate change has been discussed in apocalyptic terms, or as a phenomena that, if not addressed, can result in large-scale loss of life (Feinberg & Willer, 2011) , and HIV antiretroviral resistance (Herman, 2016) might also have catastrophic consequences if it follows the same trend as that associated with antibiotic resistance.

The variant nature of the human-macaque interface may present such contexts and thereby influence parasite acquisition by altering the structure and connectedness of macaque social networks. For instance, higher frequencies of interactions with humans and/or changes to macaque movement or foraging behavior in landscapes altered by anthropogenic disturbance, by constraining the time available for macaques to engage in social interactions (Dunbar 1992; Kaburu et al. 2019; Marty et al. 2019) , may lead to more modular, substructured social networks which may present bottlenecks to parasite transmission. On the other hand, such interactions or anthropogenic changes may present environmental stressors to the macaques (e.g., Barbary macaques: Carne et al. 2017; Marechal et al. 2011 Marechal et al. , 2016 , in which individuals possessing strong and diverse social networks may benefit by being socially buffered against infection.

The first mathematical models of parasite transmission did not implement social network approaches: virtual individuals moved and interacted randomly in their environments (Wilensky and Stroup 1999) . From individual characteristics (e.g., age, sex, hierarchical rank) and basic interaction rules (social contact, spatial proximity, conflicts, etc.), these tried to assess how the more global phenomena of parasite prevalence and outbreak potential emerge in a system Rushmore et al. 2014) . In these models, only the R 0 , the initial number of infected agents and their interaction rates, mattered. R 0 is the basic reproduction number used to quantify the transmission potential of a parasite, defined as the number of secondary infections caused by a single infected individual introduced into a population made up entirely of susceptible individuals. However, following the acknowledgment that individuals do not move or interact randomly, social networks have been integrated into these models during the last decade or so (Griffin and Nunn 2012; Huang and Li 2007; McCabe and Nunn 2018; Nunn 2009 ).",19.665884132839093,9.255533008257446

Yet by themselves, they are somewhat limited in not capturing heterogeneity at higher organizational scales, for instance, across interactions between different components of a social or ecological system. This may be the reason why most epidemiological studies implementing network approaches to model heterogeneity in contact patterns have focused on either human systems or more recently wildlife systems (reviewed above), but almost never at the human-wildlife interface. Bipartite and multimodal networks, which establish connections between different interlinked components of a system, may prove especially useful in this regard (Dormann et al. 2017; Kane and Alavi 2008; Latapy et al. 2008; Finn et al. 2019) . Recently, bipartite networks are beginning to feature in ecological and evolutionary research (reviewed in Bascompte and Jordano 2014; Cagnolo et al. 2011; Dormann et al. 2017) , as illustrated by their being used to model marine food webs (Rezende et al. 2009 ), mutualistic interactions between flowers and seed-dispersing animal pollinators (Spiesman and Gratton 2016; Stang et al. 2009; Vazquez et al. 2009) , and, more pertinently, host-parasitoid relationships (Laliberte and Tylianakis 2010; Poulin et al. 2013) .

In essence, this information can be accessed by anyone, so that they are global. However, at the same time, Tweets are primarily shared among contacts that 'follow' each other, which defines local information. In addition, Facebook contacts are not necessarily close in a geographical sense, such that 'local' relates more to the possibility of clustering, moving beyond geography. This evolution reinforces the need for having distinct networks in the same model. While social media require reconsidering how information spread is modelled, they also present an opportunity to gather data on behaviour and behavioural changes.

We propose that further integration of both disciplines with the social sciences can produce further benefits. Added value can come from working with other disciplinary approaches; for example, for the natural sciences, understanding of the social factors shaping the dynamics of interest, as well as more explicit and effective addressing of policy issues within the research framework are obvious benefits from working with social sciences; for the social sciences, more detailed understanding of the biological processes of interest can both raise vital new questions and beneficially refine research approaches. We suggest that holistic, integrated and interdisciplinary studies, as proposed here, could produce a step change in our understanding of how best to deal with the complex issues surrounding disease emergence, especially from wildlife. This framework was developed during a series of international multi-disciplinary workshops supported by an Environmental and Social Ecology of Human Infectious Diseases (ESEI) catalyst grant. They were also informed by subsequent discussions in the development of an Ecosystem Services for Poverty Alleviation (ESPA) funded consortium, Dynamic Drivers of Disease in Africa. This (grant no.

Despite the necessity and importance of this approach, objectives, strategies and resources were not aligned, which resulted in some disparities and underestimation of the potential contribution of some countries and networks. In this sense, governance, coordination, integration of efforts and alignment of financing strategies among countries, as a systemic global institutional arrangement (and not a contingency action) are strategic to enhance preparedness for future epidemics.

During the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, many health care workers contracted Ebola, some fatally. However, no members of the Chinese Anti-Ebola medical team, deployed to provide vital medical care in Liberia were infected. This study aims to understand how this zero infection rate was achieved. Methods: Data was collected through 15 in-depth interviews with participants from the People's Liberation Army of China medical team which operated the Chinese Ebola Treatment Center from October 2014 to January 2015 in Liberia. Data were analysed using systematic framework analysis. Results: This study found numerous bio-psycho-socio-behavioural risk factors that directly or indirectly threatened the health of the medical team working in the Chinese Ebola Treatment Center. These factors included social and emotional stress caused by: (1) the disruption of family and social networks; (2) adapting to a different culture; (3) and anxiety over social and political unrest in Liberia. Exposure to Ebola from patients and local co-workers, and the incorrect use of personal protective equipment due to fatigue was another major risk factor. Other risk factors identified were: (1) shortage of supplies; (2) lack of trained health personnel; (3) exposure to contaminated food and water; (4) and long working hours. Comprehensive efforts were taken throughout the mission to mitigate these factors. Every measure was taken to prevent the medical team's exposure to the Ebola virus, and to provide the medical team with safe, comfortable working and living environments. There were many challenges in maintaining the health safety of the team, such as the limited capability of the emergency command system (the standardized approach to the command, control, and coordination of an emergency response), and the lack of comprehensive international protocols for dealing with emerging infectious disease pandemics. Conclusions: The comprehensive and multidisciplinary measures employed to protect the health of the medical team proved successful even in Liberia's resource-limited setting. The global health community can learn valuable lessons from this experience which could improve the safety of health care workers in future emergencies. These lessons include: establishing capable command systems; implementing effective coordination mechanisms; providing adequate equipment; providing training for medical teams; investing in the development of global health professionals; and improving research on ways to protect health care workers.",26.61077439769715,10.414514461851253

This model proposes that health is the interaction of biological factors (genetic, biochemical, etc), psychological factors (mood, personality, behaviour, etc.), and social factors (cultural, familial, socioeconomic, medical, etc.). These factors interact with one another and function as both protective and risk factors for health and disease. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines health as a ""state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of infirmity"" [26] .

These policies drive away stigmatized subgroups and make it harder to engage them in the vital therapeutic and prevention alliances that enable implementation of successful health programs. Just as some health ministries outside the MENA region have adopted best practices from countries like Iran and Morocco, 5 the MENA region could also learn lessons from countries with similar cultural conditions on how to best engage and reduce high-risk behaviors among key populations within their borders. One notable example comes from Nigeria, where homosexuality remains criminalized, 19 yet also has well-established programs that collect data from and provides services to MSM populations. 20 Given the cultural climate and standing laws in Nigeria, it is not surprising that this group has been difficult to contact, trace and recruit into research and treatment cohorts. Hence, researchers and public health practitioners have recruited key community leaders to lead the outreach efforts to members of their communities. It is likely that, in MENA countries, high-risk social and sexual networks are also best accessed and followed with the help of community leaders and/or peers already integrated into these networks; and that these efforts can be best operationalized with respondent-driven sampling, snowball sampling strategies or post-testing counseling of newly diagnosed persons.",22.25663894981213,9.958422594264384

This led to a partnership to develop information and communication technology (ICT) tools, including animated training materials and a web-based information system to systematically reinforce surveillance of workplace conditions and workforce health. The research conducted in line with this concern illustrated the need for better workplace inspections, and an integrated workplace audit tool was then developed to supplement worker questionnaires and the ICT innovations.

Our models reveal drivers explaining host importance and demonstrate how these drivers vary by pathogen taxa. Host importance is further integrated into ensemble models to predict reservoirs of zoonoses of various pathogen taxa and quantify the extent of pathogen sharing between humans and mammals. We establish predictors of reservoirs of zoonoses, showcasing host influence to be a key factor in determining these reservoirs.

Several articles highlight how the capacities and assets of the GPEI have been supporting other immunization and global health priorities and how this support must continue or risk negative consequences to immunization and health systems. Williams et al describe how the polio surveillance system serves as a platform for vaccine-preventable disease surveillance [87] . The associated support, experience, and lessons learned have played a key role in the development of the global and regional networks for vaccine-preventable diseases [88, 89] . The GPEI has contributed substantially to efforts to eliminate measles and rubella globally and nationally [90, 91] . GPEI-initiated social mobilization networks and polio-funded global positioning system mapping activities to support microplanning have had their use extended to other health priorities [92, 93] . The Stop Transmission of Polio program has expanded its workforce development activities far beyond polio to now include RI activities, vaccine-preventable disease surveillance, measles and rubella elimination, communications and social mobilization, and immunization data quality [94, 95] .

One Health is grounded in a recognition that human, animal and environmental health are interdependent [9] , that animal species provide a shared reservoir for pathogen exchange and spread, and that many EIDs are driven by varied and dynamic human-animal interactions [9, 10] . The response One Health offers is to deconstruct the disciplinary silos [11] which have separated biomedical and social sciences devoted to the study of human disease from those devoted to nonhuman disease and ecological concerns [12, 13] . Inter-disciplinary research is called for and required, as is interventionist practice at local, national and international levels involving: policymakers, planners, regulators, physicians, veterinarians, ecologists, public and animal health officials, environmental health officers, microbiologists, and other allied natural and social scientists [10, 14] .",22.233032582819533,10.147683512684727

Whereas the natural sciences tend to frame infectious disease threats narrowly as matters of biological integrity and security, such that barrier technologies and hygiene practices dominate the logic of interventions [59] , social science approaches go beyond this. Building social scientific evidence for use in conjunction with natural scientific evidence about EIDs aligns with the growing realization that EID emergence is as much about the social and economic configuration of capital flow as it is about the biological features of host-pathogen interactions. Current approaches to the economic and structural drivers of EID emergence still presume that state and market neoliberalism is part of the natural order, even as evidence is mounting that these systems of development are central to the problem [60, 61] . Moreover, the current emphasis on microbiology and focus on newer molecular techniques to characterise pathogens, is drawing attention away from developing better understandings of the environmental, economic and social drivers of EIDs. While this is understandable given the desire for vaccines and drugs to solve EIDs, if One Health researchers and practitioners broaden their approach to causality to include upstream, social and economic systemic causes, questions and issues that have been traditionally bracketed or thought best avoided will become central to the cross-sectoral collaboration implied by One Health.",24.32115583813114,10.056300836986034

At the same time as the literature on the ethics of pandemic responses and preparedness continues to grow, the One Health approach to EIDs has received little formal ethical consideration. Even the most ethically attuned existing frameworks for biosecurity and infection prevention and control provide only general operational principles that do not guide actions in times of uncertainty. If One Health is to be meaningful − let alone successful − more attention must be paid to how these different types of knowledge are brought together and brought to public attention. Effective responses to EIDs are likely to be delayed or precluded unless all the socio-political, ethical and legal implications are articulated, publicly debated and − as far as possible − resolved in advance.

This paper explores policy implementation in two exemplar public health programs -chronic disease prevention and sexually-transmitted infection prevention -in Ontario, Canada. It examines public health service providers' , managers' and senior managements' perspectives on the process of implementation of the Ontario Public Health Standards 2008 and factors influencing implementation. Methods: Public health staff from six health units representing rural, remote, large and small urban settings were included. We conducted 21 focus groups and 18 interviews between 2010 (manager and staff focus groups) and 2011 (senior management interviews) involving 133 participants. Research assistants coded transcripts and researchers reviewed these; the research team discussed and resolved discrepancies. To facilitate a breadth of perspectives, several team members helped interpret the findings. An integrated knowledge translation approach was used, reflected by the inclusion of academics as well as decision-makers on the team and as co-authors. Results: Front line service providers often were unaware of the new policies but managers and senior management incorporated them in operational and program planning. Some participants were involved in policy development or provided feedback prior to their launch.

Given this complexity, understanding the conditions that create zoonotic risk requires a research approach that links both animal and public health sectors and natural and social sciences. Other researchers have stressed the need for integration in this area (Brownlie et al. 2006; Dry and Leach 2010; Parkes et al. 2005; Scoones 2010; Wilcox and Kueffer 2008) . However, few efforts have been made to translate the research agenda into novel methods and concepts that can sustain and guide empirically informed scien tific work (Waltner-Toews et al. 2008; Wilcox and Gubler 2005; Wood et al. 2012) . In contributing to these efforts, we suggest that inter disciplinary research on zoonotic risk should be able to account for the complexity of ""risk environments"" (Barnett and Blaikie 1992) , rather than simple linear causal relations between risk drivers and disease emergence and/or spread. From this perspective, the key scientific challenges are a) to correctly define and understand the risk environment as part of a larger system that creates risk; and b) to deploy a method that combines insights along the full extent of the chain of evidence from viral genome sequencing to animal keeping and on to animal market economics and the politics of food industry regulation. To address such complex inter actions and develop effective policy, we need integrated research that operates at different levels of analysis, from the study of risk environments to the development of risk scenarios and identification of policy options for risk management.

The health implications of this development are uncertain. Intensification creates cheaper products, allowing more people to access animal-based foods. However, some practices associated with intensification may contribute to zoonotic disease emergence and spread: for example, the sustained use of antibiotics, concentration of animals in confined units, and long distances and frequent movement of livestock. oBjectives: Here we present the diverse range of ecological, biological, and socioeconomic factors likely to enhance or reduce zoonotic risk, and identify ways in which a comprehensive risk analysis may be conducted by using an interdisciplinary approach. We also offer a conceptual framework to guide systematic research on this problem. discussion: We recommend that interdisciplinary work on zoonotic risk should take into account the complexity of risk environments, rather than limiting studies to simple linear causal relations between risk drivers and disease emergence and/or spread. In addition, interdisciplinary integration is needed at different levels of analysis, from the study of risk environments to the identification of policy options for risk management. conclusion: Given rapid changes in livestock production systems and their potential health implications at the local and global level, the problem we analyze here is of great importance for environmental health and development. Although we offer a systematic inter disciplinary approach to understand and address these implications, we recog nize that further research is needed to clarify methodological and practical questions arising from the integration of the natural and social sciences. key words: emerging diseases, integrated ecology and human health, livestock production, risk characterization, risk management, zoonoses.

In assortatively mixed networks, nodes of high degree preferentially connect to each other and form a highly connected core group. Therefore, for low link density, a larger GC size is found than for either disassortatively mixed or random networks. Link density within the GC is higher than in the network as a whole. In contrast, in disassortatively mixed networks at low link density, the links are more dispersed, forming many isolated components of small size (figure 3). As link density increases, the probability that a link with one node in the GC will only connect to another node already in the GC also increases; this is a finite size effect that is exacerbated by assortative mixing since high-degree nodes are relatively few. Thus, at higher link densities, assortatively mixed networks have a smaller GC size compared with disassortatively mixed networks, as in the latter, added links are more likely to result in smaller components being absorbed into the GC (figure 2).

One approach to most efficiently leverage this collective expertise and quickly share knowledge across scientific disciplines is to tap into existing scientific networks. The multiple bat research networks of the world ( Figure 1 ) pose a unique resource and opportunity in this regard. However, these networks currently have differing levels of coordination, resources, and active participation, making this approach more difficult in some geographic areas. Creating a combined bat conservation and infectious disease research network de novo would allow for full integration of these two disciplines from the start by supporting efforts to conserve bat populations and their critical roosting and foraging habitats and helping to safeguard human health from bat-associated viruses.

There are a number of advantages that coordinated, regional bat research initiatives have over country-specific efforts, specifically the ability to take effective action on shared threats spanning geographical, temporal, and disciplinary scales [21] . Bats are highly mobile, and often have geographic distributions that extend across political boundaries. Without regional collaborations, conservation efforts in one country may be insufficient to counteract the threats towards a species elsewhere in its range [57] . In just the same way, viruses with mobile hosts can be easily spread across borders and require cooperation among a broad array of experts to ensure the reduced risk of spillover and spread [78] . Moreover, bats are long-lived and therefore require long-term studies that can withstand funding shortages and changes in government priorities and policies [21] . Finally, bats are ecologically and taxonomically diverse, and known reservoir hosts for a diverse range of viruses with zoonotic potential [34] .

Yet, population sizes are decreasing (22%) or unknown (57%) for a vast majority of bat species [2] , and there is limited capacity to manage and protect bat populations in much of the world [3, 4] . Bats are increasingly recognized as important reservoirs for zoonotic diseases, and as a result, research effort on bat-associated viruses and other pathogens has grown dramatically in recent years [5, 6] . Bats are reservoir hosts for several notable groups of viruses that pose significant threats to human and livestock health, including filoviruses [7] , paramyxoviruses [8] , and coronaviruses [9] . Given the importance of protecting human health and global economies, disease surveillance has been the focus of a large body of bat research over the past 15 years. While bat conservation and virus surveillance may appear at odds due to conflicting objectives and research priorities [10] [11] [12] [13] , these two endeavors can be complementary and synergistic, especially if properly linked early on through collaborative research networks. Adopting an ecologically-minded One Health approach to proactively identify bat-associated zoonoses and the specific human activities that contribute to increased spillover risk will also contribute to our understanding of the diversity and distribution of bat species in understudied regions. One Health is the concept that the health of humans, animals, and the environment are inextricably linked, and requires multidisciplinary research and collaboration when put into practice [14] . Inclusion of bat experts in initiatives to monitor bat-associated viruses will enhance our ability to derive and communicate meaningful information about potential risks to human and animal health but also inform intervention measures to reduce opportunities for virus spillover in degraded environments.",18.8728577223097,6.761050300855055

In considering this, it is important to locate the analysis with respect to the two broad models of risk used in the social sciences. The first is the 'realist' approach, where risk is seen as an objective threat or danger that can be measured independently of the social context within which it occurs (Kahneman, Slovic, & Tversky, 1982) . The second is the 'social constructionist' approach, which sees risk as a threat or danger that is constructed through social and cultural processes, and cannot be demonstrated to be independent of such processes (Joffe, 2003; Lupton, 1999; Washer, 2006) . The latter is increasingly seen as a key conceptualisation; indeed, the term 'risk society' has been coined to describe the apparent perception of the postindustrial post-modern society as being at constant 'risk' of something, from credit-card fraud to terrorist attack (Beck, 1992) . Although this has been challenged in some cases (e.g. Kitzinger & Reilly, 1997) , what is important in this conceptualisation is not necessarily that populations are in permanently heightened states of anxiety, but how populations develop defence mechanisms to control their anxiety (Joffe, 1999) . In this paper a more 'material-discursive' position is adopted that views both conceptualisations as having some validity; that a 'risk' contains both a materially measurable element of the probability of an event, and a socially constructed element of how that probability/event is perceived by the individual and society (Yardley, 1997) . In this way a contrast can be seen through the examination of the impact of SARS between what is understood from a realist perspective (the materially measurable probability of, for instance, infection with SARS, various outcomes of infection and the effectiveness of different strategies to prevent infection) versus the social constructed perception of those probabilities as 'risk'.",20.34194353319242,7.432314215565344

The crowning moment frequently comes with the proclamation, 'I am a scientist, I want nothing to do with politics. ' The phrase 'science-based' infers that the underlying justification of animal/human health policy is derived from knowledge gathered through the systematic observation of, or experimentation with, phenomena. Scientific knowledge implies the compilation and analysis of data by individuals with advanced education in specific disciplines. Scientists seek facts, the fundamental truths which explain the world around us. At face value, the 'science, not politics' paradigm has a great deal of appeal. However, the very notion of fundamental truth is illusory, as scientific knowledge changes frequently with new observations and experiments. Furthermore, conjecture and refutation characterize the scientific method, with disagreement and debate the recognized features of scholarly pursuit. Scientists often reach conflicting interpretations of observational and experimental data. Consequently, individual scientists may champion different, even diametrically opposed, sets of ideas and principles, so that any number of alternatives may be justified as 'science-based'.

The research conducted by these networks is competitive in the global arena and bridges the gaps between Asia and Western countries. However, compared with research collaboration in Europe and North America, Asian genomics networks face more challenges than their counterparts in the West. The emerging economies and the developing countries in Asia have not established consistent and robust regulatory frameworks to govern the conduct of genomic research. Furthermore, their ELSI practice and regulation is often influenced by local sociopolitical and cultural concerns and tends to be heterogeneous. This has been a disincentive to regional collaboration on genomic science and technology, which requires the harmonization of ELSI practice and regulation across Asia. Therefore, in the future, it will be helpful to place more emphasis on research into ELSI of genomics and develop regulatory infrastructures, which could become a tool to secure the public's trust in science. It is also important to encourage both north-south collaborations and south-south collaborations.

Because many ordinary citizens were inattentive to international affairs and foreign news, public opinion about foreign policy issues often was activated through elite discourse (e.g., policy-making elite and opinion leaders) and by the media (Page 1996) . Extensive research has shown that the media is most able to activate opinion when these elite debates are presented as ""frames"" to which people are particularly receptive and which seem to have an impact on people's lives (Powlick and Katz 1998) . The concept of ""framing"" and ""framing effects"" has been studied widely in the social sciences (Scheufele and Tewksbury 2007; Scheufele 2006) . Studies of agenda setting and framing as developed in research on social movements, communication, and foreign policy all suggest that public opinion may be shaped by the way in which an issue is framed (Gamson and Modigliani 1987) . Framing may be seen as an attempt by leaders and other actors to insert into the policy debate-organizing themes that will affect how the public and other actors such as the media will perceive an issue. 4 Framing effects occur when the media's decision to highlight or emphasize only certain aspects of an issue causes individuals to base their views and opinions on these salient aspects (Gamson and Modigliani 1987) .",22.078492643277983,8.746415919705628

For example, 56% of astronomy articles have international representation among coauthors, while chemistry, social sciences, and other life sciences stand at only 17-21%. Thus, some fields need a concerted effort to encourage international collaboration (Board 2014). In addition, group efforts involving multiple disciplines facilitate outcomes that transcend what can be accomplished in isolation and are increasingly needed to approach complex global health problems. We, therefore, issue a call for the US and China to lead efforts to improve the global environment for collaborative, transdisciplinary infectious disease research using a One Health approach. To successfully achieve useful outcomes, we need to have substantial advances in three areas: (1) transdisciplinary research with a One Health focus, most crucially the fields of micro and molecular biology, medicine, veterinary medicine, epidemiology, ecology, economics, engineering, genetics, mathematics, policy, systems analysis, and agricultural and environmental sciences; (2) integration of technology for data collection, analysis, and communication, including information technology and geospatial technologies; and (3) broader participation of scientists and motivated citizens for data collection and evaluation, individual-based decision making, and human behavioral change. We hope to see collaboration among all relevant disciplines to holistically assess the drivers of infectious disease emergence that are key to global health and economic security. The World Bank estimates that economic losses from fatal animal-origin infectious diseases between 1997 and 2009 totaled at least US$80 billion and that, had a severe influenza pandemic emerged, the costs could have approached US$3 trillion. Costs for the 2015 West Africa Ebola epidemic are still rising and estimated to reach more than $32 billion for just the one outbreak (World Bank). Further, they estimate that, in addition to millions of lives, $6.7 billion per year could be saved globally by preventing emerging disease outbreaks (Bank 2012) . To be most efficient and successful, a joint China-US led effort should focus on socio-ecological systems changes facilitating and forcing pathogen evolution and emergence, rather than on specific infectious agents or geopolitical regions. Significant multi-lateral investment in pathogen discovery and characterization, agent-host dynamics, multi-organismal diagnostic technologies, and mathematical forecasting for risk identification and disease prevention and control are specifically encouraged.",25.668377753246546,12.202619795652282

It is estimated that less than 100 consortia are in the United States, of which about 20% to 30% are involved in global health. Several of them are well established and linked to prestigious universities with 5 to 10 institutional members. APACPH and the Global Health Education Consortium (GHEC) are the more established consortia, which have been functioning for nearly 25 and 20 years, respectively. Consortia are dynamic, even unstable at stages in their development, and are constantly challenged for resources. Leadership issues are not uncommon and are more linked to resources than policy, country, or affiliations. Economics of scale and complementarities of skills in organizations tend to form partnerships or mergers, providing resources and stability. The recently founded Consortium of Universities for Global Health (CUGH, 2008) is one of the larger university alliances in the United States. Besides the traditional fields of medicine, nursing, and public health, CUGH has the potential of accelerating advocacy for global health and involving several other disciplines such as engineering, law, agriculture, veterinary medicine, and social sciences. Responding to the increase in DAH funding in the United States, there has been a striking increase in the overall number of universities and their top leadership promoting university-wide involvement in global health (CUGH, 2009). 34 Global health training in universities across the United States has accelerated, and this trend is a giant step in bringing contentious professions to serve synergistically together in DAH. Some of these developments may be cosmetic and opportunistic but nevertheless they have provided stimulus and momentum to a field that was overwhelmed by global crises, burnout, and a growing paralysis because of lack of resources.",21.099361687618142,11.430483816465909

The early efforts of the consortium was to disperse Stabilizing South-South Academic Collaboration a large number of small grants on operational research and problem-solving capacities related to infectious disease control, MCH, and family planning. The emphasis was to use simple techniques and culturally appropriate strategies to ensure sustainability. These practices also leveled the academic exchanges between the north and south. During the epidemics and pandemics of SARS, avian flu, Nipah virus, swine flu, and H1N1, APACPH members provided leadership in research training and services, showing south competency. The north members supplemented the efforts through technical support and other resources. The south leadership was critical in promoting health equity and addressing sensitive issues such as neglect of female children, abuse of elderly people, and stigmatized health conditions such as HIV/AIDS. In poor countries, efforts to control or eradicate major infectious diseases by medication alone without addressing underlying social conditions and investing on infrastructure have limited success. Success requires a comprehensive primary health care approach, with involvement of key ministries besides health. In this challenge, APACPH has supported lead institutions and national and regional networks to network with NGOs to achieve common goals. For instance, the Collaborating Centers of Excellence for Oral Cancer Prevention in Asia Pacific emerged as a response to the fast-growing problem of oral cancer (in epidemic proportions in some countries) related to betel nut chewing in Asia. 54 The center is linked to cancer prevention and humanitarian organizations that rehabilitate individuals with major disfigurements and stigma. These challenges have also helped revitalize the organization's own values and commitment to redefine collectively what is unacceptable for health in the south societies as well as what is feasible with limited resources. In the context of oral cancer, the reduction of betel nut chewing is our top priority. Similarly, networks based on problem-solving efforts such as in injury prevention, indigenous health, and peace through health initiatives are being promoted. The model of health as a bridge to peace is being expanded in curricula, conferences, and publications. 55, 56 SUMMARY Twenty-five years is a benchmark for any organization, more so in fragile international partnerships. Limited resources, rapid turnover in leadership in south universities, growing disinterest in north universities as control and power shifts to the south, slow membership growth and uneven resource support, which is largely voluntary, and organizational changes have all had a negative effect to various degrees. Despite those limitations, there is an overall sense of achievement particularly in the ability of the south's capacity to take over and manage APACPH successfully and contribute through the collective partnership. The boundaries of north and south have really almost completely blurred. From small beginnings, the annual conferences have grown to become a major global health event attracting university presidents, ministers, global health organizations, and local communities together in reinforcing policy initiatives and improving efficacy. The development of Collaborating Center and ICUH has created small but vibrant networks. In-country networks and south-south partnerships have stabilized as membership levels reached a healthy functional level of 3 to 5 in-country members. An ongoing strategy to revitalize in-country and regional networks is built in through national and regional conferences and partnership in national public health and medical organizations. Member university presidents have also begun to use APACPH networks and the Global Health Conferences to foster the social responsibility of universities whether in indigenous health, urbanization, or MDG-related goals. There have been sustained efforts to recognize and retain south leadership. Over the past 25 years, a total of 65 APACPH awards for excellence in leadership, research, teaching, and services have been given to leaders from the south. A Global Health Ambassadors program to retain the influence of leadership has been instituted. Capacity building has been slow but sustained, and has become south driven. Nearly 100 faculty and students received scholarships for their Masters and doctoral studies in the first 10 years through the WHO Collaborating Center at APACPH member universities, mostly in the north. It is estimated that more than 1000 faculty and students have been supported in short-term programs at member universities in the last 20 years. More than 60% of that support came from south universities, including the 4 APACPH Collaborating Centers. Each year, 10 to 15 APACPH travel grants are awarded to students and junior faculty to attend annual and regional conferences. APACPH members provide additional matching awards. The APACPH Global Health Conferences have therefore become a real opportunity for learning and exchange. Global health leaders and university presidents from many countries add their perspectives on global health equity across nations, the founding values of APACPH, reenergizing the commitment to primary health care and the MDGs. These acts of rededication of the social responsibility of universities to local and global communities touch the cornerstone of the social and environmental constructs in health. The beliefs and actions that emerge are value laden. In imperfect organizations like a university consortium there have been significant compromises and accommodation both by the north and the south. Yet the common goals and core activities have been revitalized by the members, especially the leadership of young global health professionals, whose dedication in serving the populations in need will sustain the collaboration.",24.662069199039642,11.358490680797832

Human behavior such as contact precautions and social distancing clearly influence disease prevalence, but disease prevalence can in turn alter human behavior, forming a coupled, nonlinear system. Moreover, in many cases, the spatial structure of the population cannot be ignored, such that social and behavioral processes and/or transmission of infection must be represented with complex networks. Research on studying coupled disease-behavior dynamics in complex networks in particular is growing rapidly, and frequently makes use of analysis methods and concepts from statistical physics. Here, we review some of the growing literature in this area. We contrast network-based approaches to homogeneous-mixing approaches, point out how their predictions differ, and describe the rich and often surprising behavior of disease-behavior dynamics on complex networks, and compare them to processes in statistical physics. We discuss how these models can capture the dynamics that characterize many real-world scenarios, thereby suggesting ways that policy makers can better design effective prevention strategies.

Despite its tragic health consequences and strong social, economic, and political impact, SARS was fortunately not the feared ""Big One,"" appearing to spread primarily by droplets during close contact. The SARS outbreak uncovered both strengths and weaknesses in global disease detection and response efforts and can therefore serve as a strong warning as well as an opportunity to prepare for future threats [12] . SARS clearly showed the unpredictability of emerging infectious threats and the vulnerability of even the most developed nations. The virus did not respond to treatment, and no vaccine was available. The use of strict isolation and quarantine precautions -some involving tens of thousands of individuals -proved the best means of stopping the epidemic. Box 2.

The same interconnected world that enables microbes to rapidly cross borders can also work to effectively stop their spread, providing an opportunity for establishing surveillance systems that can approach real time. For SARS, the internationally coordinated response led by WHO allowed clinical, research, and public health experts around the world to exchange information on the new disease as quickly as it evolved. Part of this effort included the WHO Collaborative Multi-center Research Project on SARS Diagnosis, a network involving more than a dozen laboratories and 10 countries. In less than a month, three of these laboratories determined the cause of the illness -a previously unrecognized coronavirus. Also playing a major role in the response was WHO's Global Outbreak and Response Network (GOARN), a surveillance and response system of more than 120 organizations worldwide. Although GOARN responds to dozens of outbreaks in developing countries each year, the SARS outbreak represented its first response to an internationally spreading illness [13] . Among GOARN's most visible partners are the National Influenza Centers (http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/ centres2004/en/). Established in the 1950s, this expansive network of more than 100 institutions in over 80 countries is responsible for tracking influenza viruses to guide vaccine development and to recognize variants that may be capable of producing a pandemic.",19.32666601462205,7.3804524511403224

One lens is political ecology, which focuses on political and economic factors and the way they change ecological conditions that affect relationships between humans and other species that cohabit common landscapes, environmental practices and policy, and representations of environments. In terms of scale, medical anthropologists frequently analyze biosocial phenomena on a continuum extending from the local to the global to document how social and economic relations play out in space and time. Medical anthropology's approach to environmental health begins with how human beings populate and move within and between environments, considers how their presence affects and is affected by ecosocial conditions within these environments, and considers how these conditions are shaped by local, regional, and global factors that span religion and cosmology, science and technology, economics and politics. This perspective expands the framing of environment beyond that of a discrete physical space in which humans reside, to nested and overlapping environments that synergistically affect each other in the context of rapid globalization. Today, local communities and economies are increasingly subject to pressures and opportunities associated with emerging global markets, changing patterns of consumption, and expanding networks of transportation and communication. Local environments are modified, manipulated, and affected by regional and global processes such as changing agricultural patterns and practices, industrial development and resource extraction, demographic trends associated with transitions from rural to urban economies, and the movement of goods, humans, and microorganisms.

At the international level, a review of the literature in the PubMed database showed the diversity of these networks. Several transitory or virtual physician networks were then established during outbreaks, with the aim of collecting data on patients to improve the clinical response and/or to conduct real-time clinical research (SARS crisis-WHO [9] , REVA GRIPPE-SRLF [10] , (H1N1)pdm2009 -HPA [11] ). The experience of the 2003 SARS crisis and the 2009 pandemic flu suggested that patient care needed to be integrated into the response preparation. This concept was adopted at the international level for the recent MERS-CoV and EVD epidemics, with the creation of the Emerging Disease Clinical Assessment and Response Network (EDCARN) [12] in which the French SCE group participated. Here again, there was strong evidence to suggest that biological and epidemiological networking organizations should better address clinician expertise. Indeed, the main objectives and actions of healthcare system managers needed to focus on ensuring and improving timely and adjusted patient care and appropriate infection control measures [13] . Since then, several European initiatives have created multidisciplinary structures with the aim of sharing information on EBR-associated IDs to enhance preparedness and response (EUNID [14] [15] [16] ) or to establish a framework for integrating clinical research into epidemic response (collaborations named PREPARE [17] , ISARIC [18] , REACTING). Another initiative is the European Training in Infectious Disease Emergencies program (ETIDE), conducted since 2006 which aims to ""enhance European capacity to recognize and respond in a coordinated fashion to any infectious disease emergency, whether accidental or deliberate in origin"" and which was opened to multidisciplinary professionals including frontline HCWs in Europe [19] .

The old system centered on control and planning has gradually been shaken up, while the system centered on regulation and market has not yet been fully established.

The existence of hundreds of millions of migrant workers due to China's unique household registration (hukou) system and urban-rural dualism from cities to their rural homes, the large-scale movement of people driven by the tradition of family reunion and the heavy dependence of modern rail transportation on power grids made the ""chain effect"" of the winter storm more complicated and augmented the disastrous consequences, and these could hardly be explained by natural factors and the linear path of the traditional ""disaster chain"" theory.

The theoretical framework should ultimately provide valuable analytical tools for disaster management in China, and whether the tools are effective depends on how well they can be used to explain China's problems. This, however, does not mean rejecting international dialogues. The existing conceptual system and theoretical paradigm in China's disaster research are not capable of addressing the three questions at the same time. Because of the classification of academic disciplines, disaster research in the field of social sciences lacks a holistic approach. Representative studies fall into three different fields and span three different periods. First, beginning in the early 1990s, sociologists paid attention to social risks in China's reform and opening up. Some focused on quantitative risk analysis and prediction, and some on diagnosis and criticism of structural transformation. Second, given the challenges faced by governments around the world after the September 11 attacks in 2001, researchers in political science showed growing interests in how the Chinese government conducted crisis management against the backdrop of governance reform in the transition period. Third, after the SARS outbreak in 2003, researchers and practitioners in administrative management, driven by national needs, carried out intensive and large-scale research on the institutions, mechanism and legal framework governing government crisis management. Research in these three fields has different focal points: sociological research, on the basis of observation of social phenomena, tries to predict trends through the index system and structural diagnosis; research in the political sphere, on the basis of international comparison, pays close attention to how policy makers could benefit from international good practices and how the political consequences of disasters would propel governance reform; and research in administrative management, driven by the practical needs, emphasizes the design and operation of general rules and principles and the immediate control of disasters.

We suspect the reason that public research institutions are designed to be a cost effective and resilient, as do their infrastructure networks. However, as national research structures can be affected by government policies (Hossain et al., 2011) , the network efficiency also changes over time. The drastic fluctuation in the share of drivers would be related to changes in the relevant institution's strategy or operation. For example, the GRIs underwent a restructuring to remove redundancy, and began operating under the research councils after 1999. We can capture drastic changes at the same time in our results because their structural efficiency significantly increased between the second and third periods between 1998 and 2003. The results would imply that the organizational rearrangements in the GRIs worked well. Besides, the research subjects of the NLs were revamped in the 2001-2006 period due to several events, i.e. the September 11 attacks and the outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the NLs have made greater efforts to reinforce national security by working on nuclear weapons or intelligent detection of potentially dangerous events. Moreover, a sudden epidemic of SARS accelerated multidisciplinary research in the NLs on vaccines, therapeutics, bioinformatics, or bioterrorism. We also find that the structural efficiency of the NLs were severely affected during the readjustment period. These changes in portfolio composition would cause temporary disarray in the structure of the networks. On the other hand, the property of stable fluctuations in the MPG would be attributable to internal transitions for scientific advances rather than external impact.

This realization requires a fundamental shift in our approach of novel virus discoveries. The contributions in this issue illustrate the challenges of assessing the public health relevance of these findings, which typically requires a risk assessment approach. The authors have listed important data gaps, for which research is needed before we can move from response to outbreaks to prediction and prevention. This will require a systems approach to understand virus ecology and the role of humans as potential targets.

For example, there is no 'pure' natural disaster; the casualties from natural disasters like floods and earthquakes hinge on the quality of social systems, including self-help activities at the level of neighborhood communities, as well as the quality of environmental planning and civil engineering. Climate change occurs at the level of the physical system but is clearly an outcome of industrial activities of humans. It is also known that a large proportion of the deaths during famines and violent conflicts is due to the outbreak of infectious diseases in relief camps. 2 Despite these entanglements, as Akihiko Tanaka indicates in Chapter 2, we have a clear division of academic disciplines corresponding to the three systems: the physical system is the subject of physical and chemical sciences and engineering; the living system is studied by biological, medical and ecological sciences; and the social system is researched by the social sciences and the humanities. Human security provides a powerful raison d'etre for multidisciplinary collaboration between experts with those academic backgrounds. Although the three systems (the earth, the ecosystem and human society) can be harmful to individual human beings, it must be noted that they are also beneficial and even indispensable for the prosperity and well-being of the entire human race: natural energy, biodiversity and robust human institutions are all parts of the three systems.

The increased responsibility is based partly on recent USG policy expanding its review role for DURC with the 15 BSAT. Our view is that IBC review of DURC should be expanded even further than mandated by the 2015 DURC Policy to include all of life sciences research. Although this would further increase the workload of the IBC, it would result in a more comprehensive picture of DURC in life sciences research, especially research carried out in laboratories that have low to no biosafety containment and biosecurity. An example of this type of research leading to DURC is the immune-contraceptive ectromelia-ZP-GP-3 recombinant and the vaccine proof ectromelia-IL-4 recombinant described above. IBC expanded review would also eliminate the gaps in current 2015 DURC Policy by regulating research with all pathogens with pandemic potential, not just pathogens currently on a ""list.""

The ASP team met initially to determine how to implement this program, then again during each cycle, and a final time at the conclusion of our research. During these meetings, we discussed the findings and identified areas in need of future interventions using PDSA cycles. Decisions were made by consensus between stakeholders and suggestions communicated during our meetings and/ or via e-mails. The ASP was carried out in a series of PDSA cycles that assessed the impact/effectiveness of each intervention in real time, which was then used to spearhead the next step. This process was continuous and was divided into cycles 1, 2, and 3. The ""Do"" phase consisted of the development of the specific pediatric asthma ASP multidisciplinary team and institutional antibiotic guidelines. The ""Study"" phase determined whether our last cycle intervention was effective. Evaluation was carried out by the concurrent determination of antibiotic justification, performed by reviewing the daily patient census and meeting with the multidisciplinary team. The pharmacy resident performed weekly audits and feedback. In this case, the resident reviewed the admissions on a weekly basis, assessed antibiotic justification according to the guidelines, and had a discussion with the health care team if needed. Then, feedback was provided to the prescriber to discontinue the antibiotic if it was unjustified. In addition, periodic reminders of the ASP results were placed on the bulletin board in the general pediatrics and PICU areas. This involved a brief reminder of our guidelines, reviewing the asthma exacerbation cases for that week, and providing feedback to prescribers regarding justification of antibiotic prescribing. Findings from this phase served as the aim for the next intervention. This process may consist of several PDSA cycles to ultimately achieve our study goal.",21.48289237249912,8.182524326345893

The United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDG), for example, represent an effort to think globally about health and related problems (United Nations 2008). The Gates Foundation's Grand Challenges in Global Health Initiative is also global in scale: it seeks to achieve scientific breakthroughs against diseases that disproportionately affect the two billion poorest people on earth, though of course diseases like AIDS and tuberculosis can affect people everywhere. The Council of Science Editors has organized a global theme issue on poverty and human development involving more than 230 science and biomedical journals, focusing among other things on interventions to improve health among the poor (Flanagin and Winker 2007) . These are all invaluable efforts involving the many, many parts of the overall picture, and they all ""think big."" At the same time that practical efforts are converging in the effort to control infectious disease, there is an efflorescence of efforts to consider the ethical issues involved. With the exception of those directed to HIV/AIDS, most date from 1999 or later, and recent attention to the ethics issues in pandemic influenza planning has been particularly extensive. Documents like that from WHO by Coleman, Reis, and Croisier (Coleman et al. 2007 ) articulate policies; others, like the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) document authored by Annas, Mariner, and Parmet (Annas et al. 2008) , vigorously critique policies already developed on the basis of ethical inadequacies. And a major effort has been mounted by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to look specifically at the ethical issues in the emerging concern with global health: this is the ethical, social, and cultural program that is funded under the Grand Challenges in Global Health Initiative, designed to use bioethics considerations to assess the specific Grand Challenges projects that are planned or are currently under way (Singer et al. 2008 ).

Social insurance was more than state-sponsored insurance, which had been gaining adherents at the turn of the century. State insurance provided for government-funded medical care of the poor and sick through municipal clinics, free hospitals and convalescent homes. Countries such as Germany, France and Russia were early innovators in such practice. Despite such efforts, however, care was fragmentary. State efforts were frequently small compared to private care provided by charitable or religious organizations or private fee-for-service care that precluded the poor. Social insurance, or social welfare, expanded the notion of state insurance to include other social aspects. It is a social safety net which includes income support, nutritional support, provision of housing and access to medical care for highly vulnerable populations such as the elderly (who no longer earn income), women, children and the poor whose physical or social circumstances prevent equal ability to access essential goods. Deficiencies in these goods make people more susceptible to death and disease; those highly vulnerable groups have fewer resources with which to mitigate harmful outcomes. In some cases, they are less able to respond to risks because of physical reasons. For example, women of childbearing age may be particularly vulnerable to physical conditions associated with childbearing, such as nutritional deficiencies, which can compromise their immune systems and make them susceptible to other diseases. These populations may be more vulnerable because of social or institutional structures as well. Consider the legal status of women in some areas following World War II where women were not allowed to enter the work force either because of formal rules or informal social norms. Those women who had engaged in work as part of the war effort were expected to return home at war's end. Their means of economic support was tied to spousal income or family wealth. In some regions, women were not allowed to own property. With no independent means of support, women were dependent upon the largess of men or upon social policies which would provide access to material support.",18.254839298465342,7.330903466610582

Its founders define this theory as a simple toolbox to explain social transformation. The main principles of this approach can be summarized in the following points. First, ANT is a collection of explanations about social reality in which the analyst looks and defines relations and not essences, fixed entities or taken-forgranted categories. Second, these explanations do not respect either the mainstream academic frontiers (sociological, psychological or historical, given the questions are mixed) or methodological frontiers. Another frontier it breaches is that of mainstream social sciences dualisms: social versus natural, molar versus micro or agency versus structure (Krarup and Blok, 2011) . Third, ANT accounts are based on conventional ethnographies, discursive analyses, interviewers, etc. Fourth, ANT talks about social reality in terms of practices. Finally, in these practices the activity of human beings is as important as the action of materiality. In fact, ANT is very well known in social sciences thanks to the role and relevance that materiality has in its explanation (Latour, 1999 (Latour, , 2005 Law, 2004; Law and Mol, 1995 , 2001 , 2002 .",34.187224472440185,13.962946068949417

A second area of rapidly developing interest is dynamic networks which account for the possibility that the structure of the contact networks might not remain constant over time, maybe partly as a consequence of the disease outbreak itself. More importantly, empirical research has lagged behind the pace of theoretical work made possible by increased computational power. Matching efforts to develop laboratory experimental systems are urgently needed to explore the interaction between network structure and disease dynamics. Integration of behavioral biology and physiology to the already existing framework of ecology, evolution, and mathematical modeling would also be critical to our understanding of the structural and functional properties of biological networks.",22.620443534957275,11.375761444605804

Stakeholders need to negotiate intellectual property contracts and agree ments to facilitate the sharing of pathogen sequences, 15 clinical samples, and diagnostic platforms before outbreaks occur. 16 For example, the Pandemic Influenza Pre paredness Framework 17 was negotiated over 4 years and resulted in a cooperative approach to benefit sharing, as well as substantial cost sharing of the laboratorybased surveillance system.

Promoting creativity is harder than it appears, often requiring researchers and decision-makers to think differently than they were taught. For example, many scientists, especially life scientists, approach research from a discovery science standpoint, i.e., they develop and test hypotheses to generate knowledge, create new products (e.g., high-throughput drug discovery and pre-clinical vaccine development), and/or develop new technologies to improve research efforts or as product platforms. On the other end of the spectrum are engineers, who often conduct design-based research, which involves identifying the specific product needs before developing the methodological approach to achieve the desired output (e.g., synthetic organisms designed to produce industrial chemicals). Both approaches enable innovation within fields and sometimes across fields, but they also may contribute to conceptual barriers to identifying solutions from high-level need.

However, a significant challenge seems to be the translation of operational or strategic need to specific research requirements that can be used to generate information and develop new products. Shortly after 2001, the U.S. government, philanthropic organizations, and universities supported research, education, and communication efforts. In the early 2010s, interest in continuing these efforts waned as time has progressed without the occurrence of a major biological attack. However, during the past few years, particularly since the 2014-2016 Western African Ebolavirus and 2016 Zika virus outbreaks, concern about catastrophic natural and man-made threats have met with renewed interest in funding research on risk assessment, prediction of future infectious disease threats, trends in biotechnology (specifically, horizon scanning 1 ), and decontamination. This increased interest in research has not necessarily been met with increased investment in education and training. Although a few formal, degree-granting programs in biodefense have existed, the only known programs that exist today are the Biohazardous Threat Agents and Emerging Infectious Diseases of Georgetown University [154] and Masters in Biodefense at George Mason University [155] . Furthermore, the number of universities that provide laboratory biosecurity training to graduate students in the life sciences has decreased during the past decade, but in their place programs through educational service providers, such as CITI [156] , have emerged. In addition, the American Biological Safety Association provides laboratory biosafety and biosecurity training to biosafety professionals [157] the International Federation of Biosafety Associations has a certification program for biorisk management (i.e., methods for analyzing and managing accidental and deliberate biological risks) [158] , three organizations host leadership in biosecurity or health security programs [159] [160] [161] , and the U.S. government supports training activities. Despite these efforts, most scientists are not taught about biosecurity or biodefense issues (the exceptions are researchers working with Biological Select Agents and Toxins or in synthetic biology). This lack of training results in scientists who may not be able to evaluate the broader impact of their research, whether that impact is increased risk of research activities or enhanced benefits to meet national security needs. Without such knowledge, scientists and engineers may not be able to identify and transition knowledge or technologies that can address outstanding biodefense needs, or to identify potential risks associated with their research. This difficulty is pronounced with pathogen research compared to research that does not involve pathogens (e.g., creating synthetic organisms to develop platforms for synthetic antimicrobial products). However, the ability to translate biodefense needs to research projects appears to be more challenging than similar capabilities for translating needs to improve human health, agriculture, or environmental health.",20.03130403499598,9.381661355190259

The RAPIDD program supported international teams of researchers to develop community-based and/or environmental models and to generate and/or collect the necessary data to study infectious disease dynamics. Some models integrated clinical data with data on local population migration, and hospital location and capacity.

The research on explicit collaboration between scientists has emphasized the value of cross-company alliances, informal networks, and social capital (Gittelman 2003) .

The reason for the increasing number of runaways was more dependent on the social position of the individuals affected in their social network than on their individual personalities and motivations. Sociometric techniques were used to elicit and graphically present the individual's feelings such as 'like' or 'dislike' of the other individuals. In the 1940s and 1950s the concept of social networks was developed in two ways. First, matrix algebra and graph theory were used for discovering emergent groups in network data to formalize basic socialepsychological concepts. Second, laboratory experimentation of networks programs was developed (Borgatti et al., 2009) . The effects of different communication network structures on the speed and accuracy of problem-solving were studied by researchers from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) (Borgatti et al., 2009) . They found that a more centralized network structure outperformed decentralized structures (Leavitt, 1951) . In human networks, information tends to be conveyed from peripheral members to the most central nodes, so those systems with the shortest distance between all nodes from the distinct integrator nodes performed fastest (Borgatti et al., 2009) . In 1978 Pool and Kochen published the 'small world' concept that determined the chance that randomly selected pairs of people will know each other. Based on mathematical models half of the total number of pairs among USA population could be linked with not more than two mediators (Pool and Kochen, 1978) . Concordance with this finding, the famous concept called six degrees of separation was developed by Milgram (1967) . Network analysis was also used by sociologists to study the concrete relations between people, as well as to represent community structure (Borgatti et al., 2009) . Community network structure analysis has become an increasingly significant research tool in social sciences (Wellman et al., 1996) . Social network application has been successfully used in anthropology to study patterns or networks of relationships, kinship and for the network-based explanation of a wide range of outcomes (Borgatti et al., 2009 ). According to strong or weak ties theory close contacts between persons form cluster(s) of strong ties which subsequently leads to the redundancy of information sharing (Granovetter, 1973) . Social capital theory was derived from this idea to determine whether these connections enable people to access resources leading them to a better situation. In the 1990s network analysis research increased in a number of fields, including physics and biology, and also to various applied fields such as management consulting, public health and crime/war fighting (Borgatti et al., 2009 ).",23.670950350215932,10.067932965326126

Attributes are the nodes' properties, qualities or characteristics that belong to them as an individual or group. Nodes are connected to each other through different types of relationship (Dubé et al., 2011) . These links also called ties, edges or arcs and can be classified into four basics types of dyadic relations: similarities, social relation, interactions and flows (Borgatti et al., 2009) . These ties can be informal or formal, and multiplexity occurs when actors have multiple ties with other nodes. Edges refer to reciprocal or undirected links, whereas arcs refer to the links that are unidirectional or directed (Wasserman and Faust, 1994) . Edges and arcs describe the network representation as undirected or directed networks and are defined by binary or other values based on their relationships as characterized by the study considered.

Examining the dynamic consequences of this possibility would be fruitful for future research. We also studied how the ''endogeneity'' of a cluster affects its growth and impact. While endogeneity is positively associated with research fronts that are growing, it is negatively associated with research fronts whose knowledge is being absorbed via increased citation. Further, endogeneity is highest among new and growing clusters. This lends support to Kuhn's speculations, and the work of Crane and Pfeffer, on the importance of intellectual cohesiveness or paradigm strength in creating a distinct research perspective, since high endogeneity can be seen as a crude sign of a more comprehensive, explanatory intellectual framework (Crane 1972; Kuhn 1970) . These observations in aggregate provide insight into how science changes. In our two models the characteristics of research fronts that are associated with front growth are very different from the characteristics that are associated with front impact. Research fronts that grow are associated with multidisciplinarity and tend to be more endogenous. Research fronts that receive increased citations, on the other hand, tend not to be endogenous, and the coefficient for multidisciplinarity is not significant when controlling for other factors.",21.2004431184398,6.653028280903239

The thrust of social psychiatry is on the social and cultural context of mental health and illness. Social psychiatry is concerned with the cultural and social factors that engender, precipitate, intensify, or prolong maladaptive behaviour and complicate the management of mental disorders. It is also defined as a field of psychiatry based on the study of sociocultural and ecologic influences on the development and course/trajectory of mental diseases. Because of evidence-based social aspects of mental health, social psychiatry is perhaps the most visible aspect of mental health management. It also leads to the emergence of subprofessionals in psychiatry, known as social psychiatrists. Mental health has much to do with lifestyles and social conditions. In fact, most manifestations of mental disorders depict the contravention of normal standards of behaviour in the society. This implies that in most cases, a mental disorder is recognised through excessive abnormal behaviour within the social system. Hence, there was a shift in psychiatric ideology to the patient's behaviour and social relationships (Pilgrim and Rogers 1994) .",23.46365566806251,11.114125570800791

The calculations the 'expert' provides about risk tend to be treated as if they were value-free, unbiased 'objective' facts (Lupton, 1999) . Another model of risk is the Social Constructionist approach, which sees risk as an objective hazard, threat or danger but one that is inevitably mediated though social and cultural processes. This approach does not argue about the realities of the risk, but rather focuses on how they are politicised. Beck (1992) coined the term the Risk Society to characterise what he sees as this constant perception in late industrial or post-modern society of risk everywhere.

Furthermore, network statistics can be used to derive novel quantitative measures that characterise social structure at the level of the individual, and these measures can then be used alongside other standard statistical variables (i.e. measures of relatedness or repro-ductive success). However, the appeal of the networks approach goes well beyond sociology and psychology and has widespread technological applications as well. Anything from transport networks (Sen et al. 2003) to communication systems such as the internet (Tadic 2001) can be considered as a system of interacting components. In biology, the network approach has been used in various areas, as biologists have realised that to better understand complex systems, we need to study interactions between components of the system not in isolation but as part of a network of interactions. Such an approach has made important contributions across biological disciplines and across different levels of biological organisation. For example, work on gene and protein interaction networks has provided unique insight into the functional organisation of the cell (Barabasi and Oltvai 2004) , work on neural networks has demonstrated how cells are interconnected to control complex processes (Laughlin and Sejnowski 2003) and considering trophic interactions between organisms as a food web has provided insight into how stable communities are to perturbation or the invasion of a new species (Dunne et al. 2002) . Surprisingly, in the discipline of animal behaviour, this approach has received relatively little attention despite its enormous potential.",24.77215195965406,10.093528591047454

We stated above that information flow or disease transmission in networks might be influenced by network structure, and communities are an important part of this structure. Figure 3 shows a network of the Trinidadian guppy, Poecilia reticulata, that was found to subdivide into five communities (Croft et al. 2006 ). One of the first predictions that one could make is that information flow or disease transmission might predominantly occur within communities before it spreads between them. Given that communities are based on the interconnectedness of individuals, this seems a plausible assumption. In this context, one could study for instance how the absence or presence of community structures in networks influences transmission processes in the network. Other aspects of interest are the individuals inter-connecting communities (Lusseau and Newman 2004) . If there was a disease outbreak in a human population, presumably the first individuals one would want to vaccinate would be the ones inter-connecting communities so that the spread of the disease could be contained within the community where it first arose. Clearly, the individuals that inter-connect communities occupy a key position in this context. One could further investigate why these particular individuals inter-connect communities and what makes them different from others in the network (Lusseau and Newman 2004) . This would raise questions such as whether they occupy these interconnecting positions only temporarily or over long time periods (potentially all their lives), and this could be linked up with the study of behavioural syndromes (Sih et Fig. 2 Social networks of Trinidadian guppies with males in black and females in white (Croft et al. 2006 ). The original network (a) in which all interactions are displayed was filtered so that (b) only those interactions are shown that occurred twice or more or (c) thrice or more. The latter (c) was a good indicator of cooperative interactions between pairs of individuals during predator inspection behaviour al. 2004). Network position could also be linked to social status and hierarchies, and one could test whether individuals that inter-connect groups are of particularly high or low rank in their group.",22.950580279447017,9.067840167031767

Reflected through the ""new mobilities paradigm"" identified by Mimi Sheller and John Urry (2006) this binary becomes a polarity between stasis and movement. Place has mostly been associated with dwelling and ""home,"" in turn given what Doreen Massey calls ""totemic resonance"" (2005, 5) against the threat of homogenising flows brought by globalisation. Thus place-space, stasis-movement, become associated with fears for cultural preservation in the face of cultural absorption into the global. Connected to the broader spatial turn in the social sciences and humanities, Sheller and Urry's designation of the new mobilities paradigm was both a descriptive response to a world ""on the move,"" and also part of a larger theoretical project to upset a ""sedentarist"" social science (2006, 208) . These authors point out that, ""issues of movement, of too little movement or too much, or of the wrong sort or at the wrong time, are central to many lives and many organisations"" (ibid.). In other words, the new mobilities paradigm is inherently critical of a discourse that ""treats as normal stability, meaning, and place, and treats as abnormal distance, change, and placelessness"" (ibid.). The call for greater attention to the study of movement in everyday life is indeed a logical response to the proliferation of mobility in the twenty-first century as described in the beginning of this chapter, however, it also entrenches a particular polarity. That is, a romantic ideal of groundedness, dwelling, and continuous attachment inherited from classical anthropology on one side, and an equal romanticisation of networks, contingencies and flows on the other. 10 In her article ""Choreographies of Tourism in Yosemite Valley"" Sally Ann Ness uses her own experiences of hiking in Yosemite National Park to challenge the rubric of place and its influence on the ways cultural meaning is constructed. Concerned that cultural identity is understood too narrowly as always place-oriented-""perhaps in a plural, multi-sited sense, but still place/site-defined"" (2007, 79)-she instead poses that tourism, like any practice based in mobility rather than dwelling, needs to account for contexts of movement.",20.93199497705159,8.610068709511658

The initial denial is over because the theoretical and empirical refinement revealed a new social landscape in the making (see for many Held et al. 1999) . Its dominant features include interconnectedness, which means dependency and interdependency of people across the globe. Virtually the entire span of human experiences and practices is in one way or another influenced by the overwhelming interconnectivity of the world. (This should not be confused with world system and dependency theories.) The third phase uncovers the core unseen and unwanted consequence of this global interconnectivity: really existing cosmopolitization-the end of the 'global other'.

Individuals exchange information with their neighbors which construct their social relations.

An earlier phase of modernity was organized primarily in terms of nationstates, which sought to manage many of the risks people faced, although markets and other phenomena did cross state boundaries. 2. Modern social and political theory grew with the dominance of nation-states and internalized the nation-state as the tacit model for the ideal-as-societyinfluenced by the actual power of nation-states, but also by the widespread aspiration to organize the world on the basis of nation-states. 3. An earlier philosophical cosmopolitanism developed in Europe in this context, calling on people ethically to transcend narrow nationalist views, as though the sociological conditions of their lives did not really matter. 4. Today we have to make a clear distinction between the norms of cosmopolitanism (which you find as a normative concept already in the sociology of Auguste Comte and Émile Durkheim) and the facts of cosmopolitization which are a genuine issue of empirical-analytical social sciences. Cosmopolitan sociology neglects the Durkheim/Parsons model of 'value integration' of national society. It neglects also theories which declare the death of the social. But it emphasizes the transformation of the social and a new methodological cosmopolitanism to study the ambivalences of the cosmopolitization of intermediated institutions. 5. The same applies to the international level: consider global free trade and financialization, corporate deterritorialization and transnationalized production, globalized labour use, internet communication, globally orchestrated bio-scientific manipulation of life forms and, last but not least, globally financed and managed regional wars. As stated earlier, recent world history seems to dictate that surviving these new civilizational forces, let alone benefiting from them, requires every nation to actively internalize them and one another. This is what I call '(reflexive) cosmopolitization'; and the civilizational condition shared across the globe I call 'reflexive' or 'second modernity'. 6. I do not see the nation-state as disappearing, but rather see it as only one of many actors in a global power game. The focus needs to be on that global power game and not on the nation-state. Importance could accrue to regional powers like 'Cosmopolitan Europe', ('Cosmopolitan Asia' etc.). 7. Such a shift in focus requires the restructuring of the social sciences not only conceptually, theoretically, and methodologically, but also in the very organization of research. All their fundamental concepts-especially those of social class, family, work and the nation-state-need to be re-examined. Many are 'zombie concepts' that continue to live on even though the world they related to at one time no longer exists. 8. Cosmopolitan sociology is just at its beginnings. It entails more questions than answers [British Journal of Sociology 2006, 57(1); 2010, 61(3); Soziale Welt 2010, 61(3-4)]. But it does involve a fundamental re-organization of the social sciences, and a dramatic shift in focus-from methodological nationalism to methodological cosmopolitanism. And it must also be critical in its orientation. One critical focus must be on the increasing inequality in the world and its social explosiveness. The focus on the nation-state has led to a shameful subordination of 'objective' and 'value-free' sociology to the imperatives of the nation-state which blinds even empirical sociology to the fundamental transnational transformations of domination and inequality. 9. Another critical focus: problems of social inequalities and justice in first industrial nation-state modernity were once pursued and fought over as the 'goods' of modern society (things like incomes, jobs, social security etc.); in the cosmopolitical age, those 'goods' are off-set by conflicts over the 'bads'. These include the very means by which many of the old goods were in fact attained. More pointedly, they involve the threatening and incalculable side effects and so-called 'externalities' produced by nuclear and chemical power, genetic research, the extraction of fossil fuels, and the overriding obsession with ensuring sustained economic growth. The social and psychic volatility wrought by cultural relativism, on the one hand, and recognition of risk, on the other, generate an enormous discontent, which in turn inspires various political and social movements for reform and resistance.",27.43419169945867,10.434290328593779

They formed a loosely coupled system in itself, being loosely connected to the SARS GCN. They responded very quickly and cooperatively while at the same time they were able to preserve their distinctiveness and competitive orientation. The labs agreed that they would exchange research data, and figure out by themselves the most efficient way to divide up the work. The very fact that the labs were working independently appeared also to be a particular strength in their search for identifying the SARS virus. This situation closely resembles the functioning of academic networks as described by Orton and Weick [58] . Loose coupled systems, like the academic networks, exhibit properties of both decoupled and tightly coupled systems [12] . The emphasis on knowledge specialization contributes to the distinctiveness of the research labs, while this specialized knowledge is only useful when it can be integrated into common knowledge base of the academic network. From a knowledge creation perspective the SARS case provides an extreme case of dynamic knowledge specialization and integration.

Different media platforms can affect what people talk about and share (Berger & Iyengar, 2013) and thus may explain the discrepancies in those findings. Email and Facebook networks involve a great number of pre-existing social relations (Ellison, Steinfield, & Lampe, 2011) , while Twitter network may involve a larger number of strangers or very weak ties as following a Twitter user typically does not require a mutual agreement from both relational parties (Hansen, Arvidsson, Nielsen, Colleoni, & Etter, 2011) . Social bonding is an important motivation when sharing information with pre-existing social relations (Berger, 2014) . Sharing positive emotions helps build a positive self-image and maintain positive interpersonal relationships. However, when communicating with very weak ties, it may be less important to be a positive or a nice person. Instead, sharing negative-tone messages may attract more attentions from others. Information that arouses negative emotion may signal danger and thus are more urgent and useful (McLaughlin et al., 2016) . In addition, passing along negative tweets may show a person's discriminating judgement and heightened cynical sophistication (Cappella et al., 2015) , just like we tend to perceive book review writers as more intelligent and competent when they provide negative as opposed to positive reviews (Amabile, 1983) .

For instance, the WHO's Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) aims to provide rapid identification, confirmation, and response to outbreaks of international importance through a technical collaboration of existing institutions and networks (World Health Organization 2015e). However, despite such networks and mechanisms, the preparedness of individual nations (both operational and ethical) will continue to rely significantly on their own national pandemic plans. This is problematic, as GOARN's mission is to support Member States for the implementation of national capacities for epidemic preparedness and response in the context of the IHR, which were 'designed to prevent the international spread of disease' (World Health Organization 2005b, p. 1). The IHR are unique in that their application are not meant to be limited to specific diseases in order to 'maintain their relevance and applicability for many years to come even in the face of the continued evolution of diseases and of the factors determining their emergence and transmission' (World Health Organization 2005b, p. 2). This, we believe, is an appropriate and laudable goal, but is one that is not necessarily reflected in the preparedness of Member States vis-à-vis their pandemic plans. Member States are called upon by the IHR to implement its regulations (in accordance with the purpose and scope set out in Article 2 and the principles embodied in Article 3), so the fact that pandemic planning efforts at the national level have focused almost entirely on influenza pandemic preparedness points to an important area for improvement in global outbreak preparedness both in regards to traditional concerns that take on new points of emphasis (e.g., restrictions on freedom of movements and the use of novel public health measures) and altogether new ethical issues (e.g., testing investigational agents in vaccine trials).",21.38063585379935,9.275302051173904

Thus even for a disease with low probability of transmission and where the disease has been identified within a few generations of infection after its introduction, it would be difficult to identify and isolate subgroups of individuals who are at higher risk of becoming infected. Localisation is exemplified by spatial spread, such as found in lattice models, where nodes are positioned on a regular grid of locations, and neighbouring individuals are connected. Such lattice models/networks exhibit homogeneous contact but have much longer average path lengths and diameters than Poisson networks. Empirical measurements confirm that many real-world networks are characterised by greater localisation of connections-i.e. the tendency for links to occur with greater probability than average amongst subgroups of nodes, but have small average path lengths very similar to that of Poisson random networks. Motivated by social structures where most individuals belong to localised communities composed of work colleagues, neighbours or people sharing similar interests, but some individuals also have connections with individuals that belong to other localised communities (e.g. relatives living considerable distances away and thus likely to belong to distant social communities as well) and old acquaintances, Watts and Strogatz [71] proposed the famous ""small-world network"" (SWN) model, which uses a one-parameter model to interpolate between a regular lattice model and a Poisson network. Their model starts with a ring lattice with N nodes where each node is connected to an arbitrary fixed number K of its closest neighbours. Two types of SWNs have commonly been studied. In the original version, a random rewiring of all links is carried out with probability q. A variant with similar properties does not rewire, but adds long range links randomly, with probability q to generate the same number of long range links as in the original model ( Fig. 4.1 ). Both approaches produce on average qKN/2 ""long-range"" links (or more correctly, they connect nodes at random). As the latter approach simplifies some calculations but has the same key properties as the original model, it will be referred to 1 An example small-world network, with each node connected locally to its four nearest neighbours later in the chapter. For a broad range of q, the SWN generates average path lengths approaching those observed in Poisson random graphs, yet with much greater localisation. The smaller average path length driven by the limited number of longrange connections (shortcuts) makes the network more connected, with fewer edges needed to connect any two nodes. A smaller average path length also means a smaller number of infectious generations with a shorter epidemic time scale, and a lower threshold for a large epidemic. The critical idea put forward by this model is that a relatively few ""long-distance"" connections are important for the transmission and persistence of disease. This has long been established, for example, within the metapopulation paradigm developed in the 1960s [50] where occasional migration between habitat patches was invoked to explain the persistence of species that would otherwise go extinct-in the case of epidemiology, the metapopulation is the pathogen operating on the host (or communities of hosts), which represent the habitat patches, such as the cities and towns in the previously mentioned measles models [7, 28] . Where the model of Watts and Strogatz' differed, however, was showing in an elegantly simple model, and in a quantifiable way, how simple couplings defined only as a property of individuals could be weak, yet produce dramatic effects in communities.",17.581674778156966,8.100232964051486

First, on the specific research methodologies employed in this study, despite the efforts of the authors during the analysis stage, content analysis has long been criticized for its neglect of semantic structure, inflation of the theme count, and lack of sensitivity (Neuendorf, 2002) . Also, due to time, financial and social network constraints, the limited access possessed by the authors to data sources for this study may have undermined the validity of the research results. While the amounts of text units out of the 45 collected documents have been deemed sufficient pursuant to the research purposes of this study, the validity of the research results of this study would be greatly enhanced if more primary research resources could be secured. In addition, the lack of established criteria for evaluating research objective 3 may have weakened the subjective conclusions reached by the authors. Thus, the research design required the use of more rigorous research methodologies that could better accommodate the research objectives and more credible data sources. Third, with regard to the conceptual framework for the study, taking into account the growing influence of external factors on the Chinese policy subsystem, which has been undergoing a fundamental transformation with the deepening of the reform and opening-up of the economy and the establishment of a socialist market economy, the introduction and due investigation of foreign components may further complement the existing framework by giving a more comprehensive picture of contemporary Chinese policy making, especially the 2007 mechanism.

We firmly believe that in the future biology and biomedicine will greatly take advantage of a multilayer representation, although these two fields of research have until now lag behind. This is mainly due to the difficulty associated with the recording of real data in living organisms, especially with the high resolution needed to discriminate the physical layers. This is, for instance, the case of the human brain: while the human cortex is composed of six layers, each one processing information in a distinctive way, actual recording technologies (e.g. EEG or MEG) can only detect the activity of the top-most layers. When functional representations (i.e. representing the activity of the brain in terms of information processing) will be merged with structural ones (e.g. the connectome, that is, the structure of fibers connecting different parts of the brain), the result will be a complex multilayer network, describing both how and why information moves. Beyond the brain, it is commonly accepted that cells are composed of different networks interacting between them: from the RNA, mRNA, up to proteins and metabolites. While these networks have been deeply studied in separated and isolated fashion, many pathological conditions generate from the wrong interaction of the different networks (layers). Adopting the multilayer paradigm will then provide an elegant mathematical way of representing these cross-interactions, paving the way for a deeper comprehension of the structure and function of cells.",22.087148275901335,10.33064617556861

The WTO TRIPS, discussed in the section entitled 'The World Trade Organization,' ushered in a new era of powerful international intellectual property law that has had a critical impact on access to medicines, particularly in low-income countries. TRIPS is also at the core of a wave of international legal instruments and processes seeking to redefine the law of international intellectual property. Dissatisfaction with TRIPS and shifting power bases at the WTO has led those who support stronger and weaker intellectual property protections in search of alternative and more favorable venues to promulgate treaties and other legal instruments. For example, some countries, along with nongovernmental organizations, have undertaken efforts since 2005 to initiate the development of a proposed treaty on medical research and development under the auspices of the WHO. While public health efforts to shift debate and codification to WHO have thus far stalled, other global health actors have undertaken steps to establish more robust intellectual property than provided by TRIPS in a number of forums. Most well-known are the so-called 'TRIPS-plus' bilateral and multilateral agreements that establish intellectual property rights and obligations that are more stringent than required under TRIPS. A significant recent example of a TRIPS-plus agreement is the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement among 12 Pacific Rim countries that was adopted in October 2015 and, at the time of this writing, has not yet entered into force. Less well-known than TRIPS-plus agreements are a range of global standard-setting initiatives that act below the level of formal international law through global networks of international regulators. Although not formally international law, such standard-setting initiatives, can at times have a powerful impact in harmonizing state practice.

There are several reasons. First, CT is transdisciplinary (Albrecht et al., 1998) ; many of the leading exponents are those with training in the physical sciences but who are now working across the physical and social sciences. Traditionally, health geographers have drawn upon many disciplines (including epidemiology, statistics, sociology, ecology, cultural studies) to inform their work and so any post-disciplinary perspective that applauds this fuzziness of boundaries is something to which we might be expected to warm. Second, according to Urry (2003, p. 111) CT subverts the distinction between agency and structure; if we want to gain some understanding of the emergence of structure, we need to understand the behaviours of the agents that form part of the system. However, while this has obvious appeal across much of the social sciences, not exclusively the geography of health, it is a feature shared with other perspectives (for example, the structurationist accounts of Giddens, or Bourdieu's relational sociology).",27.3879177066079,11.208246430986813

Rather, he wishes to 'consider whether complexity could generate productive metaphors for the social analysis of various ''post-societal'' material worlds ' (2003, p. 121 ). Thrift, like Urry, considers CT to be 'deeply metaphorical' (Thrift, 1999, p. 36 ), but, interestingly, the metaphors 'nearly all strongly depend upon the visual register' (Thrift, 1999, p. 37) . Thrift further notes (1999, p. 49) that 'the use of ''scientific'' metaphors adds a touch of legitimacy' for some knowledge networks (such as New Age practices)-echoing the more trenchant (and controversial) critique of Sokal and Bricmont (1998) . These authors consider that 'examples of scientism can be found in the alleged ''applications'' of the theories of chaos, complexity and self-organisation to sociology, history and business management' (Sokal & Bricmont, 1998, p. 181 ). They are not against 'extrapolating concepts from one field to another, but only against extrapolations made without argument-or throwing around scientific jargon in front ofynon-scientist readers without any regard for its relevance or even its meaning' (Sokal & Bricmont, 1998, pp. ix-x) . The importing of concepts must have some conceptual or empirical justification. They observe that 'a metaphor is usually employed to clarify an unfamiliar concept by relating it to a more familiar one, not the reverse' (Sokal & Bricmont, 1998, p. 9 ). Further, 'The natural sciences are not a mere reservoir of metaphors ready to be used in the human sciencesyin a scientific context these words (chaos, non-linearity, for example) have specific meanings' (Sokal & Bricmont, 1998, p. 177) .

Further, at the time of the SARS outbreak, the NIH CC's clinical environment was in a buildingd constructed in the 1950sdthat posed significant infrastructural hurdles to providing safe care to patients infected with highly infectious (and in this instance, possibly airborne) pathogens. In this complex clinical context, investigators from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases submitted protocols requiring the provision of care for highly infectious SARS patients. Subsequently, these proposals were presented to the NIH community. As one might have anticipated, several investigators who provide care for patients who have severely compromised immune function were adamantly opposed to admitting patients with SARS or other highly contagious respiratory illnesses electively to the NIH CC. However, because of the clearly urgent public health need, as well as the potential unprecedented scientific opportunities, the leadership of the NIH CC approached the issue not by asking: ""Can we safely provide care to patients with SARS?"" but rather by asking the question, ""How can we care safely for all of our patients?"" As the protocols were being reviewed for human subjects' protection, the leadership of the NIH CC set out to identify the critical clinical functions that they felt must be present and operating at optimal levels to admit and care for SARS patients safely. This assessment required the collaboration of the research team, the leadership of the NIH CC, and the active participation of key clinical departments such as hospital epidemiology, nursing, critical care medicine, pharmacy, and housekeeping. Using flowcharting techniques, 17,18 the team carefully cataloged each step in the research process and identified clinical care functions necessary to support the research requirements. Clinical and operational functions that were identified as being essential to the successful care of these patients are outlined in Table 36.2. This exercise was eye-opening in that both the clinical care providers and the investigators were astounded by the breadth of hospital functions that required flawless orchestration to assure that the protocols could be implemented safely. Following the identification of the key clinical and operational requirements, a team was charged with assuring that appropriate policies, procedures, staff, equipment, and physical infrastructure were in place and functioning optimally and efficiently prior to the admission of the first SARS patient. The clinical care team worked closely with the research team as well as with the community of NIH investigators to assure alignment with the study requirements and to time, appropriately, the admission of the first protocol participant. • The frontline nursing, infection control, laboratory, transport, housekeeping and other ancillary staff were key members of the planning team from the beginning of the initiative. • Frontline staff were active participants at the daily leadershipled huddles. • A challenge was managing the well-intentioned ""directives"" of leadership staff who were removed from day to day bedside care but have a vested interest in the care of Ebola patients.",18.27593782401439,7.416800620652485

''Ecosystem approaches'' to health (Waltner-Toews, 2001; Lebel, 2003; De Plaen and Kilelu, 2004) offer examples of research methods that explicitly engage with the ecological and social systems within which health is created and challenged, although these approaches were not developed specifically for EID investigation. However, these and other systems-based approaches provide some common principles with which to help understand the nested, interdependent systems in which diseases emerge, maintain themselves, and evolve on a multitude of levels-molecular, organismal, communal, national, and global (Wilcox and Colwell, 2005) . Understanding of these ''nested hierarchies'' is complemented by the idea of coupled human-natural systems, in which humans are both part of nature and fundamentally conditioned by social activity. This recognition, in turn, encourages researchers to incorporate into their methods and research design the idea that ''delineation between social systems and ecosystems is artificial and arbitrary'' (Berkes et al., 2003, p 2) . Research that explicitly engages with the complexity of systems' interactions (Kay et al., 1999) , and the associated concepts of adaptation and resilience (Holling, 2001) , offer valuable precedents and fertile ground for understanding the social, ecological, and economic contexts in which EIDs occur. Yet, despite these developments, systematic formulation, development, and application of approaches that integrate the social and ecological aspects of disease emergence into research paradigms has not yet occurred.

This can occur in several ways, including the coproduction of knowledge (eg, coordinated research question generation) and, where findings are not interpretable to direct action, translating relevance to a given sector(s). For example, health scientists could take risk projection findings further to calculate the cost of inaction or the gains of solution scenarios or the scientific community could examine the cumulative health impacts associated with ecosystem alteration, and help to identify and refine implementation strategies to address these challenges in a more coordinated fashion. Even within the scientific community itself, however, collaboration is not routine, despite potential research, understanding, and intervention efficiencies. To promote collaboration across scientific disciplines and bridge research and policy oriented toward sustainability solutions, the Future Earth scientific platform was established in 2014, merging international global change projects representing atmospheric sciences, ecosystem services, health, urbanization, and other disciplines. For this model to be optimized, some baseline challenges will need to be overcome: common metrics and data sharing systems do not currently exist, research investments typically are still oriented to single-discipline approaches, understanding of long-term trends is limited by the short-term nature of research funding, and (outside of clinical medicine) pathways are generally not yet in place for wide-scale research-to-solution processes. Industry and private-sector collaboration are also crucial for multidisciplinary solutions, but programmatically, health organizations face resource challenges in raising awareness and combatting the ill effects of fossil fuel-related pollution. For example, the WHO's entire 2014-2015 approved budget (US$3.98 billion) is a stark contrast to the almost $550 billion granted in annual global fossil fuel subsidies. 66 The short-term societal focus on profits derived from fossil fuel extraction and consumption have overall represented a major barrier to stronger climatechange regulation.

Methods: The objective of this research was to evaluate the impact of a reformulation in the unit, completed in May 2018, which modified the facilities with availability of hermetic balconies in each room, with a view of an internal garden. There was also the addition of a screen in the corridor of the floor with images -technology known as videoowall, interconnected to motion sensors (kinects) that allow interaction between patients and families, besides facilitating physiotherapy and physical exercise. There was re-training of the multidisciplinary team with emphasis on the practice of humanization. The methodology consisted in the application of questionnaires of satisfaction to patients and their families during the period of hospitalization in a bone marrow transplant unit in the third quarter of 2018. The items evaluated ranged from the quality of the information provided by the medical team and nursing, to the cordiality and agility with which the patient and his patient were treated by the global team.

The programs incorporate aspects of contemporary science practice and demonstrate to students many aspects of the nature and processes of science that may not be apparent in school science activities including inquiry-based learning. These aspects include characteristics of scientific inquiry; the role, status, and characteristics of the scientific knowledge it generates; how scientists deal with uncertainty; how scientists work as a social group; and how science impacts, and is impacted by, the social context in which it is located (Osborne et al., 2003; Clough, 2006; Wong et al., 2009) . Because astrobiology is multidisciplinary, it is applicable to many strands of school science syllabi and exemplifies for students the interrelationship between science disciplines. These two programs have a similar goal of engaging students in the process of science, but differ in methodology. In the case of Pathways, the ultimate goal is to identify and encourage students who are interested in space-related courses and careers, and it is part of an effort to provide future skills for an emerging Australian space program. Pathways includes a 140-square-meter scientifically accurate Mars Yard and robotics lab in the public space of the Powerhouse Museum, and it also serves as a ''living lab'' in which Mars robotics and science research are undertaken and undergraduate and doctoral students undertake research projects. The high school education program element is integrated into the robotics and science research aspect of the project. In a 1-day program, the high school students use Thinkspace-the museum's digital learning studio-to plan a rover mission to Mars and then execute it in the Mars Yard assisted by a university robotics research engineer. They also consider the evidence for the origins of life on Earth and the relationship to looking for the geological and environmental evidence for the possibility of past or present life on Mars. Students who subsequently ''self-identify'' as being interested in further exposure to the project are offered the opportunity to undertake a NASA student research project run by the Mars Education team at Arizona State University in conjunction with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

For example, Folke et al. (2005) explore the need to build linkages between a diversity of actors at multiple levels to be able to successfully deal with nonlinear social-ecological change (see also Pahl-Wostl 2009); Pearson and Clair's (1998:13) synthesis of organizational crises identify resource availability through external stakeholders as key for successful responses (see also Boin et al. 2005 ; Van Baalen and van Fenema 2009); Galaz et al. (2010a:12) synthesis also indicate that cross-level and multiactor responses are key for overcoming institutional fragmentation in responses to abrupt human-environmental change; and Edelenbos et al. (2013) explore the features of ''connective capacities,'' which allow coordinating actors to constructively connect to actors from different layers, domains, and sectors. Therefore, we propose that global networks need to build a capacity to coordinate actors at multiple levels and from different networks as they attempt to respond to potential ''tipping points'' of concern. It also seems reasonable that responses could focus on producing either a set of outcomes (regulation, polices, or supporting infrastructure) or outputs (behavioral changes with direct impacts on the system of interest, including coordinated action) (Young 2011).",25.939334154451558,11.397496664636964

Secondly, we explore the interplay between perceptions of human-environmental ''tipping points,'' international institutions, and collaboration patterns here operationalized as global networks. This perspective allows for a more cohesive view that combines both exogenous (i.e., perceived ''tipping point'' dynamics) and endogenous (i.e., information sharing mechanisms) factors (sensu Young 2010). We will return to this point in the end of the article. Note that, our ambition is not to ''test'' the proposed features in a statistical sense, but rather to combine in-depth analysis of the case studies, with tentative suggestions that bring to light a number of intriguing and poorly explored issues. While the selection of cases does not provide the generalizability of larger-N studies, it does allow us to examine how the theoretically derived propositions play out in the three different cases, and also provides an opportunity to explore around the potential interplay between variables and causal mechanisms. Our ambition in the longer term is that the analysis presented here can underpin more systematic cross-case comparisons (cf. Gerring 2004) .

However, integrating the best practices of disciplines which embody both prediction and explanation offers a possible solution. The combined perspectives of evolutionary ecology and social ecology can provide a basis for associating qualitative levels of risk with quantifiable factors from pathogen mutation rate to patterns of land use change. Evolutionary ecology focuses on how interaction between phenotype and environment generates differences in Darwinian fitness among different phenotypes (Pianka, 2000) . For example, an evolutionary ecological focus on life-history trade-offs that maximize pathogen transmission and determine optimal levels of virulence renders it particularly relevant to infectious disease epidemiology (Galvani and Slatkin, 2003) . Social ecology focuses on the social, institutional, and cultural contexts of human-environment relationships of particular relevance to public health, the behavioral sciences, and medicine (McLaren and Hawe, 2005) .

While the impacts of foodborne illness may have been overshadowed by a host of other emerging infectious diseases in the past 3 decades, the impact of diarrheal disease occurring as a result of contaminated food remains profound. It is estimated that up to 70% of the 1.5 billion episodes of diarrhea occurring in children under 5 every year may be caused by foodborne contaminants. 27 FDA works to address food safety challenges in a number of ways. For example, through regulatory efforts such as FSMA, FDA is focusing on strengthening food safety systems through efforts to ensure product safety, modernize the oversight of imported foods, guard against intentional contamination, implement preventive controls in human and animal food/feed facilities, and ensure the safe transport of food and feed. Under FSMA, FDA has developed the International Capacity Building Plan, which charts a direction for how FDA prioritizes capacity building efforts based on risk and impact on public health, as well as FDA's partnerships with counterpart regulatory authorities, industry, and other organizations to achieve lasting food safety results. 28 Among its regulatory capacity efforts, FDA contributes to, and leverages, other global food safety efforts, including through supporting WHO's Foodborne Disease Burden Epidemiology Reference Group (FERG), which is working on a definitive report on the global burden of foodborne diseases; strengthening surveillance systems, alert networks, and information platforms, such as the International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN); and working closely in the development and support of the Global Food Safety Partnership (GFSP), a public-private partnership housed at the World Bank that is dedicated to strengthening food safety systems.",19.305219003816458,9.569574332476659

Millennials and youth, as discussed above, are more likely to use online digital sources including social media, blogs, online news platforms, comedy/news commentary shows but also use traditional media sources including television, radio, and print newspapers (Environics 2017). CPIP (PHAC 2015) incorporates a risk communication approach which includes social marketing and social media. The emergence of social media platforms both challenge preparedness and response while representing immediate communication channels for transmission of updates and messages (Rossmann et al. 2018) . Social media platforms can also amplify risk messages; however, the communication dynamics is multidirectional. Risk communication using Twitter, for example, will include postings and responses from experts, stakeholders, journalists, general public, and possibly automated bots (Mønsted et al. 2017 ). Journalists will use Twitter to gather new information and to disseminate news stories (Fellenor et al. 2017) . Social media represents not only an opportunity to transmit information and update the public, but also to track inquiries, rumours, and myths by monitoring various social media platforms (Panagiotopoulos et al. 2016; Fellenor et al. 2017) . Twitter now occupies an established space for crisis communication and discussion, given the immediacy of message communications and updates regarding situational emergencies (Fellenor et al. 2017) . The digital divide, however, also suggests that social media can contribute to further marginalization of high-risk populations. Age, socio-economic status, rural and remote geography, and disability may all contribute to decreased use of social media, such that public health organizations will still require multimedia risk communication strategies including outreach, traditional media, and social media platforms.",19.00766588238414,11.476525381660835

Successful behaviour change can well by explained by applying the theory of Ecological Perspective, which is based on two key ideas: a) behaviour is viewed as being affected by and affecting multiple levels of influence; b) behaviour both influences and is influenced by the social environment. Levels of influence for health-related behaviours and conditions include intra-personal, inter-personal, institutional, and community factors, as well as administrative support. Intra-personal factors are individual characteristics that influence behaviour such as knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and personality traits. Inter-personal factors include inter-personal processes and primary groups-family, friends, and peers-that provide social identity, support and role definition. HCWs can be influenced by or are influential in their social environments. Behaviour is often influenced by peer group pressure. Social Cognitive Theory states that people learn not only through their own experiences, but also by observing others' actions and the results of those actions, as well as through modelling. Institutional factors to be considered to promote change include the availability and easy access to rules, policies, as well as technical and informal structures that help to promote recommended behaviours. Responsibilities for each HCWs' individual group must be clearly recognised and defined. Community factors are social networks and norms that exist either formally or informally between individuals, groups, and organisations. For example, in the hospital, the community level would be the ward. Community-level models are frameworks for understanding how social systems function and change, and how communities and organisations can be activated. The conceptual framework of community organisation models is based on social networks and support, focusing on the active participation and development of communities that can help evaluate and solve health problems. Public policy factors include local policies that regulate or support practices for disease prevention, control, and management. The institutional administration must openly support the creation of a multidisciplinary task force to address the problem of infection cross-transmission within the ward or the hospital. By this, it mandates representative members of the multidisciplinary institutional team to come together to identify the problem and to develop strategies to resolve it; it also endorses the choice and options taken and mobilizes the hospital resources needed to implement the strategies.",22.676398047410323,10.323723611246551

For instance, protein-interaction networks may provide useful information on the dynamics of complex assembly or signaling.

In so doing, a common basis for value is established (Stark, 2011) . 2. Relevant processes are multidirectional. They do more than apply established theoretical frameworks derived from management research into the social and practice domains; they integrate the value of practitioners' and social stakeholders' experiences as contributors to new knowledge. In doing so, they stimulate researchers and students to generate unique adaptations of theory that stretch beyond established foundations, reframing them into unique clientspecific outcomes. In the process, they also challenge social and practice stakeholders to engage with theory in hands-on interactions that deepen their portfolio of mental models. 3. They require a core team of research-practitioners willing to experiment across the three domains (Posner, 2009 ). This is often at personal cost to individual careers because efforts devoted to the goals of 'other' domains, or leading initiatives that bridge domains, attracts little career recognition. But as the value of shared outcomes becomes more visible, bridging these domains is recognised as a solution to the individual pressures each domain faces, rather than as a competing resource demand.

Indeed teaching has its own perceived failings, exacerbated by growing expectations of universities as vocational training centres. The authors of this paper importantly have no bias against deriving knowledge-throughtheory. We believe basic theory does have value and some concepts, even in business, can be derived through more abstract pursuits. We also concur with increasing calls for utilising the abductive paradigm, and acknowledge that it offers an important form of middle ground Dubois & Gadde, 2014) . Proponents of more participatory academic intervention are not new and include Kurt Lewin, Reg Revans and more recently Evert Gummesson. Gummesson's standing in marketing theory and advocacy of techniques such as action research has been fundamental in shining a light on the critical nexus between practice, research and teaching (Gummesson, 2014) . He understands that methodologies bringing researchers closer to marketing experience are likely also to better reflect the real ""truth"". Falsifying social or business-related phenomena is at best transitory with the likes of Popper acknowledging that social sciences are human-centred with people-related systems dynamic and constantly changing (Teece, 2009 ). Flyvbjerg (2001) explains the difference between the theoretical researcher and expert practitioner, articulating the role of technical skills. Flyvbjerg draws on the Dreyfus model (Dreyfus, 2004) of skills development incorporating: (1) novices (programmed in basic tasks and operational rules); (2) advance beginners (understand context specific operations needed to function adequately); (3) competent performers (programmed in varying situational aspects but simplify complexity to function most effectively); (4) proficient performers (tackle more advanced positive and negative situational challenges while still growing in competency); and (5) experts (advanced understanding and can sense, seize and adjust at a skill level). One could argue that master be added as a sixth level, where experts take on a sage-like capacity to train others, such as Master Black Belts in Six Sigma. Flyvbjerg (2001) , drawing on Aristotle, identifies that this mastery of knowledge in academic and professional pursuits requires phronesis or practical wisdom. The late polymath Peter Drucker is an example of more practical wisdom, rarely relying on logical empiricism. As a more rare counterpoint, Joseph Schumpeter created theoretical accuracy by embedding himself in extant and historical literature. However, equally it could be argued that Schumpeter's underperformance as Austrian Finance Minister and in banking was in part due to his lack of previous practical exposure. On that level he was at best a competent performer. The late Clayton Christensen made the combination of good theory and good practice part of his forte, and is one of the exemplars for others to follow.",21.288639130470862,9.130583978491225

INTRODUCTION: DISCOVERING ISSUES AND CHALLENGES IN LOW-AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES,"What is social pharmacy? Social pharmacy is a discipline driven by social needs (Fukushima, 2016) and more focus on the society at large. It is interdisciplinary subject, which helps to understand the interaction between drugs and society. Experts have defined social pharmacy as a discipline concerned with the behavioral sciences relevant to the utilization of medicine by both consumers and healthcare professionals (Wertheimer, 1991) . Sørensen, Mount, and Christensen (2003) defined social pharmacy as studying ""…the drug/medicine sector… from the social scientific and humanistic perspectives. Topics relevant to Social Pharmacy consist of all the social factors that influence medicine use, such as medicine-and health-related beliefs, attitudes, rules, relationships, and processes."" Almarsdottir and Granas (2016) also agree that social pharmacy is a discipline where there is use of the social sciences in pharmacy to add its usefulness to the society. It is also known as ""pharmacy administration"" or ""social and administrative pharmacy."" It has two components: the social sciences and the administrative sciences. The social sciences component includes demography, anthropology, psychology, social psychology, sociology, political sciences, and geography (Mount, 1989) , while the administrative sciences component includes areas such as management, marketing, finance, economics, organizational behavior, law, policy, ethics, information technology, and statistics. Social and administrative pharmacy is the integration and application of the social and administrative sciences disciplines in pharmacy, i.e., education and practice. Social pharmacy scientists utilize both sciences to improve clinical practice, enhance the effectiveness of pharmaceutical regulations and policy, advocate political awareness, and promote improvements in pharmaceutical health services and healthcare delivery. Social pharmacy applied a biopsychosocial or socioenvironmental method to understand health and illness conditions (Claire, 2008) . Many types of research use either the quantitative or qualitative or a mixed method approach, from simple to complex statistical methods and modeling in pharmacy practice to make changes and improvement in the healthcare system, quality of care, and patient's quality of life. In addition, there are many useful tools from the social and behavioral sciences literature that researchers could use, for example, in helping with patient-pharmacist communication and compliance enhancement efforts.",35.073289227701544,12.85093824245141

The book includes topics such as the contribution of the social sciences; pharmacy, pharmacist, and the professions; the contribution of psychosocial aspects; the contribution of sociology; and behavioral aspects of drugs and medication use, ethics, pharmacist and public health and the future of pharmacists. In the United Kingdom, according to Harding and Taylor (2015) , social pharmacy was introduced in the pharmacy curriculum of UK colleges sometime in the early 2000. The Mills Commission Report in 1975 recognized the importance to develop the behavioral and social sciences aspects in pharmacy (Study Commission on Pharmacy, 1975) . But, actually, the social pharmacy components were first experienced in the United States in the 1950s (Wertheimer, 1991) .

In his study of UK think tanks, Jordan Tchilingirian suggests that policy think tanks operate on the periphery of more established networks and enjoy fluctuating levels of support and interest in their ideas. Ideas and knowledge do not simply flow within the network, given that dominant paradigms and political, social and cultural norms privilege better established knowledge communities (Tchilingirian, 2018) . This is reminiscent of Meyer's work on the boundaries that exist between ""amateurs"" and ""policy professionals"" (Meyer, 2008) . Moira Faul's research on global education policy networks proposes that far from being ""flat,"" networks can augment existing power relations and knowledge hierarchies (Faul, 2016) . This is worth considering when one observes how ERAP's supply of research knowledge and the SAGE sub-committee for anthropologists only increased the homophily of the social science sub-community, leaving it weakly connected to the core policy network (Fig. 4.) .",26.896639132189705,10.669330477009995

However, there is some indication of different groups or networks favouring different narratives. The International Development Select Committee (IDC) was very clear in its final report that social science had been a force for good in the response and recommended that DFID grow its internal anthropological capacity (IDC, 2016a, b) . This contrasts to the report of the Science and Technology Committee (STC), which despite including evidence from at least one anthropologist, does not make a direct reference to anthropology in its report (STC, 2016) . This is perhaps the public health officials in their core domain of infectious disease outbreaks reasserting their established authority. This sector has been described as the UK's ""Biomedical Bubble"" which benefits from much higher pubic support and funding than the social sciences (Jones and Wilsdon, 2018) . Just the presence of anthropologists in an evidence session of the STC is a very rare event in contrast to the IDC which regularly reaches out to social scientists. Not everyone agrees that the threat of under-investing in social science was the primary issue.

At the crossroads of unprecedented global population mobility, Canada has worked hard to prevent the levels of social tension found in other countries and to achieve a remarkable degree of social cohesion. Diversity is formally recognised and protected in Canada through relatively extensive settlement services, social rights, and protections against discrimination. At a time when many Europeans are declaring multiculturalism a failure, and the vision of an interconnected world is under political retreat, the Canadian experience offers important lessons. 82 Canadians with lived experience of such diversity should be nurtured as valued assets for their leadership skills, cultural sensitivity, and openness of perspective that are ideal for advancing global health equity. Yet there is little room for complacency. Canada ranked third in the world on the Migrant Integration Policy Index until 2015, but then dropped to sixth after changes that restricted immigration and refugee policy by the former Conservative government. 83, 84 Under the current Liberal government, planned increases in immigration, including from countries listed on the US Trump Administration's travel ban, will require ongoing and concerted efforts at nation building. Canada has been far from immune from the social tensions felt in other countries.

In 1990, the Commission's groundbreaking report 31 spurred debate about health equity by demonstrating that only 5% of funds (US$30 billion in 1986) were spent on research addressing problems of poor countries whose citizens bore 93% of the global burden of preventable disease. Building on the Commission's finding of inequitable funding and the fragmentation of international efforts, WHO passed a resolution at the 43rd World Health Assembly recommending greater funding and better coordination to support LMIC researchers to enable them to do essential national health research. Despite leadership by Canadians on the Commission, the Canadian Government was slow to respond to these recommendations. 32 However, since 2000, funding by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)-the main federal funder of health research in Canada, akin to the US National Institutes of Health-for global health has increased from less than CAN$3 million to more than $30 million. Furthermore, over the past decade, annual global health research funding has targeted health equity more than any other primary focus (figure 2). CIHR is unique among national health research funders for viewing global health research as directly serving its mandate to improve the health of Canadians, based on the premise that ""we can't be healthy in an unhealthy world"". 33 IDRC and CIHR form part of a broader global health research funding landscape in Canada that is fragmented. 34 To improve coordination, in 2001 the federal government created the Global Health Research Initiative (GHRI), a funding partnership of CIHR, IDRC, Health Canada, and the Canadian International Development Agency, 35 aiming to develop joint funding programmes, influence policy, and improve information sharing. More than CAN$60 million was invested via the GHRI in health system strengthening and increasing research capacity, including the Teasdale-Corti Research Program and the Africa Health Systems Initiative-African Research Partnership Program. 36 This collaborative approach to global health research facilitated collective action on shared problems. To advance this same approach among researchers, in 2003 GHRI helped to create the Canadian Coalition for Global Health Research, which has advocated for research grounded in equity-based South-Canada partnerships 34, 37, 38 and in 2015 released the Principles for Global Health Research, emphasising equity. [39] [40] [41] The Canadian approach has focused on building capacity among researchers and research users to promote equity, including the creation of tools such as reporting guidelines for assessment of health equity evidence in systematic reviews, 42,43 training on equity-oriented research for LMIC researchers, 44 and mobilisation of evidence to help policy makers make decisions based on equity. 45, 46 Despite the promising model and initial successes of GHRI, it has now all but disappeared. A decade after its creation, GHRI faced substantial cutbacks as the government shifted its funding strategy. 30 In 2008, Prime Minister Stephen Harper's Conservative federal government made a 5-year investment of CAN$225 million to establish a new research funder, Grand Challenges Canada, which was launched in 2010. 47 Using an integrated-innovation approach, Grand Challenges Canada has been lauded for its focus on impact (eg, supporting 800 innovations in 80 countries), direct funding to LMIC researchers, and investment in mental health. 30, 48 However, some people criticise it for pursuing an overly technocratic approach and for neglecting the social determinants of health. 30, 49 Moreover, the creation of a separate funding arm that is independent of the GHRI's four partners has not contributed to coherence.",21.195155790680605,9.754295879534766

For example, newer approaches to funding the development of necessary drug agents have partnered private and public organizations. In one instance, the pharmaceutical giant Novartis has joined with the government of Singapore to establish the Institute of Tropical Diseases. The Institute's initial goals will entail tackling remedies for dengue fever and drug-resistant tuberculosis. 80 Direct donor gifts of philanthropy are also making a difference. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has provided $168 million in grant funding for treatment and research targeting malaria. Overall, the Gates Foundation has contributed over $3 billion to global health research. 81 Today's international health inequities can be minimized through the equitable development and distribution of crucial pharmaceutical research agents. The increasing influence of the global economy coupled with the growth of population migration and international travel have created a climate of multinational interdependence that is difficult to ignore. 50 As a consequence, the health and productivity of all communities represents the vested interest of each nation in one another.

While One Health is often and rightly presented as economically beneficial, through costsharing and synergies in action (Zinsstag et al. 2015b ), we believe that many potential benefits lie at the analytical level and in enriched conceptual frameworks (Godfroid et al. 2013; Binot et al. 2015) . However, the One Health concept often remains a promise due to barriers in collaboration (Gibbs 2014 ). Yet, the cooperative behavior of practitioners and scientists depends on their expectations, themselves under multiple influences, including the issue's framing.

This feedback loop reflects the intrinsic complexity of framing. The role of policy may be to modify actors' expectations in agreement with a desired behavior (Nyborg et al. 2016) , which may also be a role of scientific production and communication.

The substantially revised International Health Regulations, or IHR (2005), serve as a legal instrument to ensure global health security through a collective approach. 13 Global health security depends on all countries being well equipped to detect, assess, report and respond to any public health events that threaten health security. As infectious diseases do not respect national borders, there is recognition that no single country alone -no matter how capable, wealthy or technologically advanced -can prevent, detect and respond to all acute public health threats. Effective regional and international surveillance and response systems are vitally important to ensure health security for all. Within this collective defence system for health security, WHO has several comparative advantages, including its ability and mechanisms to work with countries and areas to develop health policies, strategies and standards and to connect global experts and technical resources through networks such as the National IHR Focal Points, the WHO Collaborating Centres, the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) and the Global Influenza Surveillance Network.",17.994267506972534,8.48973712648099

Political economy as a broad perspective has been widely applied in the social sciences, but it is only occasionally applied to tourism (Bramwell, 2011) . It assists in understanding how economic and political conditions help shape power relationships among actors (Jessop, 2008) and how government operates within society (Bramwell, 2011; Jessop, 2008; Pierre, 1999) . In this perspective governments are considered to help to regulate society in order to mitigate various economic and social crises and to promote the system's resilience (Bevir, 2009) . Such regulation is important as Marx argues that market forces are inherently unstable and lead to capital over-accumulation and unstable social relations (Wang & Bramwell, 2012) . Stability in capitalist economic systems is also considered to depend on securing economic returns on capital and on establishing the societal conditions to further this end. Governments also need to maintain political legitimacy in the context of unstable social relations. Without that legitimacy governments can fail to retain the authority required to regulate the economy and maintain social order. Concerns about legitimacy may encourage governments to respond to popular pressures, pursue welfare policies, or to form alliances or partnerships with some social groups. In such ways, therefore, the economic and political conditions can substantially influence the government's activities and policies, although such conditions are not determinant because of the vital importance of the agency of actors and the contingency of particular circumstances (Bramwell, 2011) .",19.106672354645504,7.589663338499705

The wide available data (e.g., sensor networks, twitter) can provide more reliable estimation on the critical locations than critical individuals with high degree or high betweenness. Thus, public health workers should focus on those critical locations with their close neighbor locations first in a timely manner. The proposed location-based social network framework also suggests several directions for future research. First, the estimation of population flows among different locations is still based on the existing census data and travel survey reports. Gao et al. (2014) found that large-scale social media data can provide reliable estimates of regional origin-destination trips on weekdays compared with the community survey data in greater Los Angeles area. It shows great promise to build location-based social networks with large-scale social media data to provide real-time estimation and prevention strategy design in a timely manner. Second, the location-based social network framework is built on population interaction and movement patterns in a normal situation, but people may adjust their behaviors accordingly during an epidemic outbreak. Thus, human preventive behaviors caused by inter-personal influence (Mao & Yang 2012) and mass media could be incorporated to refine the framework. Third, this research focuses on the impact of vaccination strategies on geo-social interactions patterns, but has not evaluated such impact of other prevention strategies such as travel restrictions and case isolation.

However, conscious of the metamorphosis that is occurring in the experimental method, and faced with a particularly inventive and all-conquering technology, fundamental research in the life sciences must come to terms. A century ago, fundamental research and technological research interacted all the more directly because they were both in their infancy. This is no longer the case. Management of the ever-increasing amount of knowledge in the life sciences, and the degree of sophistication achieved by bioengineering techniques and instruments, is widening a gap that makes dialogue increasingly laborious. However, dialogue appears to be a guarantee of future progress. The solution can only come from an increase in cross-disciplinarity, which should begin with university teaching and the establishment of a recruitment policy that advocates the cohabitation of talents from different educational backgrounds in the same laboratory. Fortified by such hybrid expertise, while maintaining its share of originality and liberty in the choice of problems to be studied, fundamental research on living beings can only be enriched by a marriage of reason with biotechnology. Convinced of the necessity for such a marriage, Stanley FIELDS, the inventor of the double hybrid method (Chapter IV-4.1), in an article entitled ""The interplay of Biology and Technology"" (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA, 2001, vol. 98, pp. 10051-10054), concludes,: ""It is at the interfaces of biology and other sciences that many of the future discoveries will be made, at the interfaces of biology and engineering that these discoveries will come to be exploited, and at the interfaces of biology and ethics and law that their consequences for society will be decided.""",21.08335914296903,10.792086066097509

Modern science, based on the principles of the experimental method, came to the fore much later in the East than in the West. The globalization of knowledge has meant that at present experimental science, in all domains, including that of the life sciences, has spread throughout the world, with even those countries that had become relatively backward in these domains because of their isolation catching up rapidly. Nevertheless, it is true that the progress of the experimental sciences in the USA and in the United Kingdom has been distinguished by pragmatic management of these countries' science policies, based on the excellence and the high degree of autonomy of their Universities and Research Institutes with respect to recruitment and choice of subjects of study. The efficacy of this policy in the life sciences may be judged by the number of researchers who have won Nobel prizes since the second world war (at the time of writing, more than 80 in the USA and twenty or so in Great Britain as opposed to only 4 in France).",18.672828736919108,10.140864739871303

In real communities, the possible edges may be active or not for variable periods of time. These so-called temporal networks typically result from an endogenous social dynamics, usually coupled to the process under study taking place in the community. For instance, disease spreading may be affected by local information that makes individuals aware of the health status of their social contacts, allowing them to reconsider maintaining or not their social contacts. Here we investigate the impact of such a dynamical network structure on disease dynamics, where infection occurs along the edges of the network. To this end, we define an endogenous network dynamics coupled with disease spreading. We show that the effective infectiousness of a disease taking place along the edges of this temporal network depends on the population size, the number of infected individuals in the population and the capacity of healthy individuals to sever contacts with the infected, ultimately dictated by availability of information regarding each individual's health status.

All projects involved high-throughput protein selection, expression and purification of the target proteins, and research into the three-dimensional structures and functions of such proteins using current technology for structural biology. At the same time, efforts were made to establish high-throughput technology platforms for gene cloning, protein expression and purification, crystallization, structure determination and drug screening.

Regarding the first, there have been several recent initiatives to improve foreign policy coherence for health. The Foreign Policy and Global Health initiative launched in 2006 by the foreign ministers of Brazil, France, Indonesia, Norway, Senegal, South Africa, and Thailand and renewed in 2011, as one example, encourages nations to broaden the scope of national foreign policies to integrate health concerns in a sustainable way and not as a crisis driven 'one-off' (Ministers of Foreign Affairs, 2007). Resolution 63/33 'Global health and foreign policy' adopted by the UN General Assembly in November 2008 further recognizes the ""close relationship between foreign policy and global health and their interdependence"" and urges ""member States to consider health in the formulation of foreign policy"" (United Nations General Assembly, 2009). Several nations have pursued this aim through the development of coherent strategies (Labonté and Gagnon, 2010) or efforts to create platforms for a 'health-in-all-policies' approach to their foreign affairs. Despite its recent global prominence, however, health is still not typically prioritized in the foreign policy agenda of most countries, and when it is, it is driven by traditional 'high politics' of security or economic risks due to pandemics or the spread of drug-resistant diseases. The continuing funding crisis of the WHO, and its reliance on extrabudgetary (nontithed) funding from governments and private sector donors for much of its operational budget, weakens its ability to provide leadership on global health governance initiatives that may go against the short-term interests of powerful nations or corporate actors (Vaughan et al., 1996) .",21.19461506933119,7.538731087402016

One global health physician working in internal medicine responded that their work abroad led to a broader sense of why their patients are ‘how they are, so it is not just they are uneducated, it is also their father is an alcoholic and also that they are addicted to pain pills, and also that they are overweight’. Here, global health work ‘helps you connect the dots between seemingly unconnected psychosocial things’ (GHP #3, interview).

After those mortality studies, several studies have reported that social networks are related to infectious diseases, such as sexually transmitted disease [7-9], tuberculosis [10], severe acute respiratory syndrome [11], and pneumonia [12]. Additionally, evidence suggests that emotions and related behaviors such as depression [13], suicide [14], and happiness [15] are also associated with social networks. Social networks affect health through several mechanisms, including the provision of social support (both perceived and actual), social influence (e.g., norms, social control), social engagement, person-to-person contact (e.g., pathogen exposure, secondhand cigarette smoke), and access to resources (e.g., money, jobs, information) [16].",21.28927094045364,7.501806386868944

We reached out to 159 individuals and programmes, 30 opened the questionnaire link, and only 12 completed the questionnaire (7.5% response rate). The study’s small sample size was most likely a result of physician and programme leadership survey fatigue—which, the research team was told directly by several who declined to participate—limiting the generalisability of our findings. Future qualitative research on this or similar participant demographics should consider survey fatigue and explore ways to increase response rates, such as more in-person interviews and, if ethically feasible, participant observation. A more grounded research design that develops interview guides based on initial questionnaire responses will likely improve the scope and focus of participant responses, as well. While thematic saturation was not achieved, we hope that our identified themes can act as a starting point for future research on the topic of how global health work is perceived to impact USA patient care. One example might be an experimental study investigating global health physician spending patterns compared with physicians who have not practiced abroad. We also feel that future research seeking to understand the growing interest in the global health field could investigate how perceived conflict of values between altruistically driven physicians and the USA healthcare system could act as a potential force in generating more interest in global health, and how the USA healthcare system or individual institutions could decrease physician discontentment associated with a conflict of care values.",18.088091241920814,6.888020804685045

We intentionally derived our approach from an assessment tool that is well established in the social sciences to display different characteristics, which in its sum will give a pictorial and semiquantitative impression through an overall profile. Although our application is based on biological and epidemiological criteria, the challenge is similar to that used in social sciences since the outcome of one measurement alone will not force, like in many dichotomous structures, a decision but will allows it to weigh in other factors. It is rather a combination of conditions which characterise a specific situation that may lead the decision towards a certain direction. A numerical computation of individual scores could also cope with the combination of different criteria, but it tends to suggest a precision not supported by the available evidence. Thus, the visual impression resulting from the connecting lines between the ticked values of the epidemiological criteria is likely to give enough of a tendency to quickly support decision-making while leaving enough room for the decision-makers to take other important issues into account.

Unfortunately, most of the existing models are either too fine-grained to be efficient or too coarse-grained to be reliable. Here we propose a computationally efficient hybrid approach that uses SIR model for individual cities which are in turn coupled via empirical transportation networks that facilitate migration among them. The treatment presented here differs from existing models in two crucial ways: first, self-consistent determination of coupling parameters so as to maintain the populations of individual cities, and second, the incorporation of distance dependent temporal delays in migration. We apply our model to Indian aviation as well as railway networks taking into account populations of more than 300 cities. Our results project that through the domestic transportation, the significant population is poised to be exposed within 90 days of the onset of epidemic. Thus, serious supervision of domestic transport networks is warranted even after restricting international migration.",13.816111570831248,7.022433050654966

Social rejection may thus evoke a craving response similar to effects of social isolation. However, we suggest that social rejection (being deliberately and specifically excluded from social interaction) is conceptually distinct from social isolation (being unable to access social interaction). By contrast to the under-studied effects of social isolation, there is extensive research on the behavioural and neural sequelae of social rejection(108, .

Unexpected and undeserved deliberate rejection or exclusion is painful, and evokes a pattern of neural response associated with processing of aversive states like physical pain, including bilateral anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (108, 109, for reviews). These brain areas were not recruited by social craving in the current task (see Supplemental material table S2). Rejection and isolation are also likely to have different emotional and behavioural effects. Social rejection can lead to increased motivation to affiliate with others but also to withdrawal and anger (110, 111) ; whereas isolation may be more likely to cause approach and a motivation to re-connect. Thus, while both social isolation and social rejection are aversive to humans, these states are likely distinct both behaviourally and neurally.",13.643722445607567,6.060412247771158

To differentiate between pre-existing individual differences and the direct effects of isolation, we needed to induce isolation experimentally in a within-subject design, similar to the experimental studies of rodents(43, 46). However, human loneliness is not a simple product of objective isolation: people can be alone without feeling lonely, or feel lonely even in a crowd(47). Moreover, experimentally induced isolation would necessarily be brief, relative to the human lifespan, and for ethical reasons, human participants (unlike rodents) would be able to predict when the isolation would end. In all, the first challenge of this research was to develop an experimental induction of objective isolation that created the subjective experience of unmet social needs in human participants. To address this challenge, we had socially-connected healthy human adults spend ten hours (9 am to 7 pm) alone, with no social interaction and no other social stimulation (e.g. social media, email, fiction). We used self-report questionnaires to assess people's resulting subjective experience of loneliness and social craving.",13.476645442825458,4.71682590498891

The second issue-underutilization of existing, community supported tools and analysis frameworks-may be due to the lack of sustained efforts to educate the biomedical community about best practices in (genomic) data analysis.
