However, it is important to note this is not specific to COVID-19. Indeed, one review stated that the WHO does not currently recommend corticosteroids in other viral diseases, like Dengue as the 'glucocorticoid-mediated stimulation of the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal axis can also drive lymphocytopenia, or it may promote exaggerated pro-inflammatory responses that eventually cause a worsening of the pathogenic condition'. These are unprecedented times for the medical community and although evidence suggests a potential role for the use of NSAIDs and corticosteroids in COVID-19 treatment, caution should be exercised until further evidence, specific to this infection strain, emerges. The same guidance stands for cancer patients who are not advised to change their medication routine unless told otherwise by their doctor.",15.129684413311015,6.561260024898246

In 2008, Israel passed a law banning the sale, purchase, and brokerage of organs, both in Israel and abroad; and it has arrested brokers. As a result, transplant tourism to China from there seems to have ceased [31] . Despite these regulatory efforts in reducing organ tourism, the issue remains a complex, conflicting, ethical/legal challenge in many Asian countries. Politicians, patients, doctors, brokers, and other stakeholders have engaged in a power struggle to protect their respective interests, which in turn has made ethical and effective legislation difficult to accomplish. Comprehensive and enforceable national and international regulatory frameworks within Asian regions, which could be similar to the Convention against Trafficking in Human Organs (2014) by the Council of Europe, are indeed needed yet lacking.

Prevalence of Underlying Diseases in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19: a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"In late 2019, a novel corona virus (first: 2019-nCov, then: SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases, which infected a lot of people in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei province of China (1) . SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread and led to an outbreak in China and then became a global health emergency. Although control measures and isolations have been applied for prevention, the infection has increased and caused a pandemic (2) . Although this virus belongs to a relatively well-known viral family, Coronaviridae, and is similar to viruses that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which had an outbreak in 2002, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which had an outbreak in 2012, in some characteristics, there are a lot of uncertainties and unknown specifications about this virus such as its origin and source of infection, its emergence, and its mechanism of action and transmission (3, 4) . Since the number of COVID-2019 cases is rising around the world and it has been associated with a large number of mortality and morbidity, it has led to a new global phobia called Coro phobia (5) . Based on recent reports, the novel Corona virus can be identified through various symptoms (Fever, Cough, Dyspnea, Myalgia, and Fatigue) (6) (7) (8) . Similar to other viral respiratory infections, SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 can be transmitted through the respiratory tract. It mainly causes respiratory tract infections and develops severe pneumonia in infected patients who may require intensive care. Severe disease may result in death due to progressive respiratory failure (9, 10) . Everyone is susceptible to this virus, but the elderly and those with underlying diseases are more at risk of adverse outcomes. Current knowledge has shown that death rate is high in people with chronic underly-ing diseases (11) . Therefore, special attention should be paid to the elderly and immunocompromised patients. Infections might progress rapidly in these groups and timely clinical decisions are needed (12) . Currently, information on the prevalence of predominant chronic diseases is rare. Moreover, knowing the underlying diseases in COVID-19 infected patients is important for healthcare workers. In the current study, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted on the prevalence of underlying diseases in confirmed hospitalized COVID-19 cases. and World Health Organization (WHO) portals as the national public health institute were evaluated. Due to the huge number of articles in Chinese language, the abstracts were evaluated in these studies.",17.86422291655869,7.989976009138779

The focus of the meetings was on planning for a highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza; however, the H1N1 influenza was running its course during the Asian meeting and discussion of that epidemic entered the conversation. Information was presented on the 2007 WHO 18 and 2007 CDC 14 ethics guidance documents as a starting point for discussing how ethical considerations may differ between countries. In addition, there were presentations on the basic principles of public health ethics and how it differs from more traditional clinical and research ethics approaches, and discussion of ethical challenges that are likely to arise in response to planning for and responding to pandemic influenza. The Latin America meeting also included a session on human rights. Out of respect for local partners, somewhat different processes were used in the four meetings to generate discussion of ethical issues. In the African meeting, participants met in small groups to discuss pre-developed case studies addressing the topics of non-pharmaceutical interventions, obligations of healthcare workers, and equitable access to treatment and prophylaxis. Participants were asked to consider the case in light of specific challenges they may face in their countries. In the Asian meeting, participants met in small groups and were asked to develop their own short narratives about the ethical issues they thought would be important in a pandemic influenza and how the values and cultural consideration in their counties would impact approaches for addressing these ethical issues.

This attitude was motivated by the failure to recognize the similarity between citizens in rich and poor countries which emerging health threats has exposed us to in our increasingly interconnected interdependent world. It further reflects the discrepancy that existed in international health in the past which does not longer hold today. This calls for a paradigm shift from the charity-based approach to a solidaristic one (West-Oram and Bux 2016, 7) .

This principle justifies engagement in collective action in the face of common threats such as EIDs, while supporting efforts to overcome inequalities that undermine the well-being of minorities and groups suffering from discrimination. One potential application of this principle globally is the provision of financial, technical, and scientific assistance by high income and developed countries to low-income and impoverished countries to boost their capacities to prevent and manage ongoing and future EIDs.

Considering the prevailing situation, it would be expected that any efforts in managing the emergence and re-emergence of infectious disease would place more attention and resources in addressing the root causes, especially in developing and low-resource countries. Additionally, one will expect that countries and regions with relatively lower capacity to detect these diseases should receive more attention as the pace with which disease outbreaks are recognized is critical for establishing effective control efforts (Kluberg et al. 2016) . However, existing evidence suggests that global resources devoted to countering the emergence of infectious diseases are poorly allocated, with the majority of the scientific and surveillance effort focused on countries from where the next important EID is least likely to originate (Jones et al. 2009 ).

First, several online mental health services have been constructed across different areas, however, unified national management and coordination policies are still inadequate, which could result in uneven distribution and wastage of medical resources, let alone evaluating the efficacy of these services. Second, online mental health services are the predominant assistance measure and therefore, some people (e.g., older adults) who may have limited access to smartphones and the broadband internet, may benefit less from the services [42] . Third, frontline health professionals may have limited time and energy to access to these services due to heavy workload. Fourth, based on experiences of SARS outbreak, some patients and health professionals would be traumatized by the COVID-2019 outbreak and still suffer from persistent psychiatric symptoms even after the outbreak [43] .

On the 7 th January, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) identified and isolated this novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted between persons via close contacts [2] leading to COVID-19. Infected patients may develop severe and even fatal respiratory diseases (e.g., acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute respiratory failure) ending up in intensive care [2, 3] . Due to potentially serious health outcomes brought by COVID-19, from 23 rd January, 2020, Wuhan and other regions in China have adopted strict quarantine measures to prevent and control the disease epidemic [4, 5] .

Three of the four pregnant women gave birth by cesarean section due to concerns about symptomatic maternal infection. The other infant was born by vaginal delivery to a mother experiencing fever (highest temperature 38.3 • C), with a diagnostically confirmed infection. The most important question is whether the COVID-19 could be transmitted vertically to the fetus from the pregnant mother and cause a clinically significant infection. Recently, a finding from nine other cases suggested that there is no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy (1) .

Affective components were rated as more divergent than cognitive components. Crossculturally, Americans and Canadians gave higher valence ratings to the salient valence of each emotion, and lower ratings to the non-salient valence of an emotion, compared to Chinese and Koreans.

Public support for unpalatable measures is more likely if citizens understand the issues, and policy implementation reflects community values and preferences. To this end, citizens' juries have been employed in the UK, Australia, the US and elsewhere [69] [70] [71] [72] to explore similar issues and identify citizens' preferences. They represent informed public opinion better than other social research methods (e.g. surveys or focus groups) because they give participants factual information, bring them into a structured and constructive dialogue with experts, provide them with time to reflect and deliberate, and allow them to represent their views directly to policymakers.

First, community members were given details about a pandemic flu scenario and how scarce medical resources could potentially be distributed. This information was provided via an extended background document that participants read beforehand and an expert-led presentation at the start of the forum. Second, community members then met in groups of 4-7 where they engaged in a moderated discussion around the question: ""What should we do in situations where there are more patients needing ventilators than there are ventilators to use?"" During the discussion, participants were prompted to consider six ethical principles for prioritizing ventilator use: those most likely to survive the current illness; those most likely to live longest; those who have lived the fewest life stages; those with value to others in a pandemic; first come, first served; and a lottery. Third, at the discussion's end, each group developed 1-2 questions that they then asked to a panel of subject matter experts that included clinicians, ethicists, and disaster experts. Fourth, after this Q and A panel, and a break for lunch, moderated group discussions continued, this time focusing on the question: ""Should healthcare providers be allowed to take a ventilator away from one patient who needs it to survive and give it to another patient who also needs it to survive?""",16.80550153918942,6.824185517964344

Nevertheless, a large increase in the scope of growing energy crops linked to an easier and more lucrative conversion to biofuels by ""synthetic"" organisms may make these issues more pressing. Similarly, broad patents and patent thickets -the number of which may increase as a result of synthetic biology approaches [103, 104] -already pose a challenge in the biopharmaceutical industry [143] . Curbing negative consequences of this kind on a global scale may require products or applications to be subjected to broadly applicable and effective environmental, socio-economic and ethical standards, irrespective of the exact nature of the underlying technical approach.

Coronavirus disease 2019 has spread rapidly around the globe, including Asia, North America, Europe, and Africa. 1 The 2019 novel coronavirus is likely similar to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. They belong to the Betacoronavirus genus and can cause severe respiratory disease, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary oedema, and respiratory failure. 2 Tracheal intubation for invasive mechanical ventilation is the mainstay therapy to correct hypoxaemia. Preoxygenation with the standard bag-valve mask oxygenation followed by rapid-sequence intubation has been proposed in non-severely hypoxaemic critically ill patients requiring tracheal intubation to reduce the risk of aspiration and desaturation. However, a previous study reported that 23% of patients had SpO 2 <90% during intubation. 3 Thus far, more than 80000 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in China. Person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 has been described, including in many healthcare workers. 4, 5 Rapid-sequence fibreoptic bronchoscopic tracheal intubation in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia may reduce the risk of viral spread. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of high-flow nasal oxygenation (HFNO) during fibreoptic bronchoscopic intubation in critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia compared with standard mask oxygenation (SMO).

Although our analysis focused on search trends and news media data as a measure for general discourse, it is likely that preprints are also influencing policy making discussions, given that WHO announced on Jan 26, 2020, that they would be creating a repository of relevant studies-including those that have not yet been peer-reviewed. 20 Nevertheless, despite the advantages of speedy information delivery, the lack of peer review can also translate into issues of credibility and misinformation, both intentional and unintentional. This particular drawback has been highlighted during the ongoing outbreak, especially after the high-profile withdrawal of a virology study from the preprint server bioRxiv, which erroneously claimed that COVID-19 contained HIV ""insertions"". 21 The very fact that this study was withdrawn showcases the power of open peer-review during emergencies; the withdrawal itself appears to have been prompted by outcry from dozens of scientists from around the globe who had access to the study because it was placed on a public server. 22 Much of this outcry was documented on Twitter (a microblogging platform) and on longer-form popular science blogs, signalling that such fora would serve as rich additional data sources for future work on the impact of preprints on public discourse. 22 However, instances such as this one described showcase the need for caution when acting upon the science put forth by any one preprint.",15.870285593547177,6.224762977488053

Most agencies responsible for setting standards for the care and use of experimental animals require investigators to consider the justification of the experiment and to implement the concept of the 3Rs (Reduction, Replacement and Refinement). The general principle of the 3Rs namely ""Reduction, Replacement and Refinement"" was developed many years ago and has become widely accepted as ethical principles (Balls et al., 1995) . The 3Rs have been defined as ""all procedures which can completely replace the need for animal experiments, reduce the numbers of animals required, or diminish the amount of pain or distress suffered by animals in meeting the essential needs of man and other animals"" (Smythe, 1978) . In general, the 3R measures can be implemented to improve the welfare of animals. The 3Rs also contribute to the quality of research findings through improved study design, reduced variability and increased statistical power.

Abstract: Background: The rapid spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a zoonotic beta-coronavirus entitled 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), has become a global threat. Awareness of the biological features of 2019-nCoV should be updated in time and needs to be comprehensively summarized to help optimize control measures and make therapeutic decisions. Methods: Based on recently published literatures, official documents and selected up-to-date preprint studies, we reviewed the virology and origin, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathology and treatment of 2019-nCoV infection, in comparison with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. Results: The genome of 2019-nCoV partially resembled SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and indicating a bat origin. The COVID-19 generally had a high reproductive number, a long incubation period, a short serial interval and a low case fatality rate (much higher in patients with comorbidities) than SARS and MERS. Clinical presentation and pathology of COVID-19 greatly resembled SARS and MERS, with less upper J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, and more exudative lesions in post-mortems. Potential treatments included remdesivir, chloroquine, tocilizumab, convalescent plasma and vaccine immunization (when possible).",17.90388017791324,8.337892007472462

For example, as described above systems biology examines complex biological systems as interacting and integrated complex networks. The new and developing fi eld of study known as synthetic biology explores how to build artifi cial complex biological systems employing many of the same tools and experimental techniques favored by system biologists. Synthetic biology looks at both the strategic redesign and/or the fabrication of existing biological systems and the design and construction of biological components and systems that do not already exist in nature (Khalil and Collins 2010 ) . Synthetic genomics is a subset of synthetic biology that focuses on the redesign and fabrication of new genetic material constructed from raw chemicals. The focus of synthetic biology is often on ways of taking parts of natural biological systems, characterizing and simplifying them, and using them as a component of a highly unnatural, engineered, biological system. Synthetic biology studies may provide a more detailed understanding of complex biological systems down to the molecular level. Being able to design and construct a complex system is also one very practical approach to understanding that system under various conditions. The levels a synthetic biologist may work at include the organism, tissue and organ, intercellular, intracellular, biological pathway, and down to the molecular level. There are many exciting applications for synthetic biology that have been explored or hypothesized across various fi elds of scientifi c study including designed and optimized biological pathways, natural product manufacturing, new drug molecule synthesis, and biosensing (Ruder et al. 2011) . From an engineering perspective, synthetic biology could lead to the design and building of engineered biological systems that process information, modify existing chemicals, fabricate new molecules and materials, and maintain and enhance human health and our environment. Because of the obvious societal concerns that synthetic biology experiments raise, the broader science community has engaged in considerable efforts at developing guidelines and regulations and addressing the issues of intellectual property and governance and the ethical, societal, and legal implications. Several bioethics research institutes published reports on ethical concerns and the public perception of synthetic biology.

They are not laws, but standards by which a resident physician may determine the propriety of his conduct in his relationship with patients, with colleagues, with members of allied professions, and with the public. 1. The principal objective of the medical profession is to render service to humanity with full respect to the dignity of man. Physicians should merit the confidence of patients entrusted to their care, rendering the full measure of service and devotion. 2. Physicians should strive continually to improve medical knowledge and skill, and should make available to their patients and colleagues the benefits of their professional attainments. 3. The medical profession should safeguard the public and itself against physicians deficient in moral character or professional competence. Physicians should observe all laws, uphold the dignity and honor of the profession, and accept its self-imposed disciplines. They should expose, without hesitation, illegal or unethical conduct of fellow members of the profession. 4. A physician should not dispose of his services under terms and conditions that tend to interfere with or impair the free and complete exercise of his/her judgment and skill, or tend to cause a deterioration of the quality of medical care. 5. A physician may not reveal the confidences entrusted to him in the course of medical attendance, or the deficiencies he may observe in the character of patients, unless he is required to do so by law or unless it becomes necessary to protect the welfare of the individual or of the community. 6. The honored ideals of the medical profession imply that the responsibilities of the physician extend not only to the individual but also to the society where these responsibilities deserve his interest and participation in activities that have the purpose of improving both the health and well-being of the individual and the community. recognizing bioethical issues and applying ethical principles and virtuous behavior is preparation for both their obvious and their subtler presentations.

In that regard, as well as a matter of literature searching, it has helped neither researchers nor news organizations (and meeting and conference organizers) that the name for the virus and disease has constantly changed over the past few weeks, and indeed days. The WHO decided to prefer the name ""2019-nCoV"" hours before release of the previous report by the present author in January 2020 [2] , although the final decision on the virus' official name still awaited the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. At the time of final writing of this text, the WHO named the disease COVID-19, so one can reasonably speak of the ""COVID-10"" or ""Covid-19 virus"". The above previous report by the author [2] was early in pointing out that the (Wuhan seafood market isolate) virus surface protein of particular interest below is closely related to that of human and bat SARS, and at the time of rewriting the present paper, the Coronavirus Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses decided that 2019-nCoV was a variant of the coronavirus that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002-03. However the new name SARS-CoV-2 is not universally popular, and the nomenclature 2019-nCoV virus or just 2019-nCoV is used throughout this text. Chinese researchers and government have worked industriously to publish their determination of the early detected Wuhan virus on several web sites. At the time of writing, there were some concerns expressed, often outside the mainstream peer reviewed scientific literature, that what is seen as the current 2019-nCoV pandemic is not due to the same virus as that specified as ""Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus isolate"" (e.g. Ref. [3] ), i.e. GenBank entry MN908947, which is used here. On January 17th , 2019, MN908947.3 replaced MN908947.2, and probably represents an adequate stable description of the sequence for research into that strain isolate [3] . The entry describes an RNA virus with an RNA sequence of 29033 bases. Despite the above concerns, it is believed that MN908947.3, available at the time of the present study, is essentially the Wuhan seafood market isolate and 2019-nCoV except for any genome changes due to accepted mutations, as is typically the case in the course of a viral epidemic.

The ACS has carried these major principles over to the development of a ""Code of Professional Conduct."" 150 Both these elements also apply to global humanitarian efforts. There are 2 areas that volunteers must be aware of. The first involves dealings with corporate or business individuals, especially in foreign countries where local practice is at variance with the U.S. standards. Recent codes in this area have been developed by Adva Med for the United States and should be applied internationally. 151 The second area is in research involving clinical subjects. Suffice it to say, clinical studies involving human subjects outside the United States should abide by all the ethical standards established by the international community. 152, 153 The National Bioethics Advisory Commission has developed guidelines for developing countries. 153 Additionally, on-site training of clinical researchers is tremendously valuable and is sorely needed. As an example, although India has more than 250,000 practicing physicians for more than 1 billion people, less than 200 investigators have been trained to carry out efficient, safe, and effective clinical research. 154 Proceeding in a phased way is a common sense approach. Case reports, limited then expanded retrospective studies, technical reports, and prospective studies using accepted statistical methods, and abiding by investigational review board standards and approval is the usual approach or sequence for young academic or investigational physicians. This includes ethics review, a favorable risk-benefit ratio, and informed consent.

Clinically, patients with COVID-19 present with respiratory symptoms, which is very similar to the presentation of other respiratory virus infections. Radiologically, COVID-19 is characterised by multifocal ground-glass opacities, even for patients with mild disease. 3 Knowledge of virus dynamics and host response are essential for formulating strategies for antiviral treatment, vaccination, and epidemiological control of COVID-19. However, a systematic study on these aspects has not been done. In The Lancet Infectious Diseases, Kelvin To and colleagues 4 report the viral load and antibody profiles of a cohort of 23 patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. In these patients, the viral load peaked during the first week of illness then gradually declined over the second week. Viral load was also shown to correlate with age. Furthermore, both IgG and IgM antibodies started to increase on around day 10 after symptom onset, and most patients had seroconversion within the first 3 weeks. Finally, the IgG and IgM antibody level against the SARS-CoV-2 internal nucleoprotein and the surface spike receptor binding domain correlated with neutralising activity.",15.996319809108972,6.925448568157851

Many coronaviruses infect humans and other mammalian hosts. Coronavirus can be divided into four genera (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta), of which alpha and beta coronaviruses are known to infect humans. 2 Human coronavirus infections are typically mild and rarely associated with severe diseases. However, the epidemics of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) caused alarming morbidity and mortality. 3 While coronaviruses are often zoonotic, person-to-person transmission has been confirmed for SARS-CoV-2, similar to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. 4 As of March 5, 2020, there are more than 95 333 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and at least 3282 reported deaths, indicating that it is a severe public health threat. 5 There is no clinically approved antiviral for coronavirus therapy. 6 Although remdesivir, an experimental antiviral drug candidate by Gilead currently advanced into human clinical trials to treat COVID-19 in both China and the U.S., was reported to improve patient outcomes in a recent study, 7 it is still critical and urgent to search for other effective inhibitors for the potential treatment of COVID-19.",14.081784484643947,6.7256419859833745

At present, there are no specific antiviral drugs or vaccine against COVID-19 infection for potential therapy of humans. The only option available is using broad-spectrum antiviral drugs like Nucleoside analogues and also HIV-protease inhibitors that could attenuate virus infection until the specific antiviral becomes available [7] . The treatment that have so far been attempted showed that 75 patients were administrated existing antiviral drugs. The course of treatment included twice a day oral administration of 75 mg oseltamivir, 500 mg lopinavir, 500 mg ritonavir and the intravenous administration of 0·25 g ganciclovir for 3-14 days [26] . Another report showed that the broad-spectrum antiviral remdesivir and chloroquine are highly effective in the control of 2019-nCoV infection in vitro. These antiviral compounds have been used in human patients with a safety track record. Thus, these therapeutic agents can be considered to treat COVID-19 infection [27] . Furthermore, there are a number of other compounds that are in development. These include the clinical candidate EIDD-2801 compound that has shown high therapeutic potential aganist seasonal and pandemic influenza virus infections and this represents another potential drug to be considered for the treatment of COVID-19 infection [28] . Along those lines, until more specific therapeutics become available, it is reasonable to consider more broad-spectrum antivirals that provide drug treatment options for COVID-19 infection include Lopinavir/Ritonavir, Neuraminidase inhibitors, peptide (EK1), RNA synthesis inhibitors. It is clear however, that more research is urgently needed to identify novel chemotherapeutic drugs for treating COVID-19 infections. In order to develop pre-and post-exposure prophylaxis against COVID-19, there is an urgent need to establish an animal model to replicate the severe disease currently observed in humans.

The first cases were reported in December 2019 [4] . From December 18, 2019 through December 29, 2019, five patients were hospitalized with acute respiratory distress syndrome and one of these patients died [5] . By January 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection, less than half of these patients had underlying diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease [6] . These patients were presumed to be infected in that hospital, likely due to nosocomial infection. It was concluded that the COVID-19 is not a super-hot spreading virus (spread by one patient to many others), but rather likely spread due to many patients getting infected at various locations throughout the hospital through unknown mechanisms. In addition, only patients that got clinically sick were tested, thus there were likely many more patients that were presumably infected. As of January 22, 2020, a total of 571 cases of the 2019-new coronavirus (COVID-19) were reported in 25 provinces (districts and cities) in China [7] . The China National Health Commission reported the details of the first 17 deaths up to January 22, 2020. On January 25, 2020, a total of 1975 cases were confirmed to be infected with the COVID-19 in mainland China with a total of 56 deaths [8] . Another report on January 24, 2020 estimated the cumulative incidence in China to be 5502 cases [9] . As of January 30, 2020, 7734 cases have been confirmed in China and 90 other cases have also been reported from a number of countries that include Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Japan, Singapore, Republic of Korea, United Arab Emirates, United States, The Philippines, India, Australia, Canada, Finland, France, and Germany. The case fatality rate was calculated to be 2.2% (170/7824) [10] .

This includes the patient's initial mild symptoms at presentation and progression to pneumonia on day 9 of illness [11] . Further, the first case of human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 was reported in the US on January 30, 2020 (https://www.cdc.gov/media/ releases/2020/p0130). The CDC has so far screened > 30,000 passengers arriving at US airports for the novel coronavirus. Following such initial screening, 443 individuals have been tested for coronavirus infection in 41 states in the USA. Only 15 (3.1%) were tested positive, 347 were negative and results on the remaining 81 are pending (https:// www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov).

The United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDG), for example, represent an effort to think globally about health and related problems (United Nations 2008). The Gates Foundation's Grand Challenges in Global Health Initiative is also global in scale: it seeks to achieve scientific breakthroughs against diseases that disproportionately affect the two billion poorest people on earth, though of course diseases like AIDS and tuberculosis can affect people everywhere. The Council of Science Editors has organized a global theme issue on poverty and human development involving more than 230 science and biomedical journals, focusing among other things on interventions to improve health among the poor (Flanagin and Winker 2007) . These are all invaluable efforts involving the many, many parts of the overall picture, and they all ""think big."" At the same time that practical efforts are converging in the effort to control infectious disease, there is an efflorescence of efforts to consider the ethical issues involved. With the exception of those directed to HIV/AIDS, most date from 1999 or later, and recent attention to the ethics issues in pandemic influenza planning has been particularly extensive. Documents like that from WHO by Coleman, Reis, and Croisier (Coleman et al. 2007 ) articulate policies; others, like the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) document authored by Annas, Mariner, and Parmet (Annas et al. 2008) , vigorously critique policies already developed on the basis of ethical inadequacies. And a major effort has been mounted by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to look specifically at the ethical issues in the emerging concern with global health: this is the ethical, social, and cultural program that is funded under the Grand Challenges in Global Health Initiative, designed to use bioethics considerations to assess the specific Grand Challenges projects that are planned or are currently under way (Singer et al. 2008 ).

To illustrate this fact, we calculated that to be able to discriminate differences in metastastic progression between two groups of animals displaying a level of variability similar to that of our SPF animals (i.e. SD=20.8; see experiment 1) we would need a minimum sample size of 8 mice (see Material and methods).

This hypothesis has led some European countries to produce initial policies relying on decreased transmission rates during the summer months, 3 and the belief that African countries will face smaller epidemics than their European counterparts.

Of particular concern are Burkina Faso and Senegal, which saw sharp increases in the number of cases soon after the initial cases were confirmed in these countries. Cases in both countries might evolve in a similar way to what was observed in European countries with the most expansive epidemics (ie, Italy and Spain, where SARS-CoV-2 spread quickly after case number five was detected).

Homeless populations might be more transient and geographically mobile than individuals in the general population, 8 making it difficult to track and prevent transmission and to treat those who need care. COVID-19 was recently found to be transmittable via the oral-faecal route. 9 Some major US cities with large homeless populations, like San Francisco, have experienced issues with public defecation, which might pose an additional transmission risk for people experiencing homelessness and other individuals.

First, it has shown that the global condition, which an epidemic may reach, is not solely determined by biological or medical elements. Many other factors are involved, among them institutional actors, scientific representation materials and the action of laboratories and monitoring systems etc. When we refer to a phenomenon, which has a global scale, we are not describing a situation present in every corner of the planet. On the contrary, we are referring to the constitution of a heterogeneous network of entities, which has the capacity to cause generalizable and homogenized effects. For this reason the first conclusion that should be drawn by One World One Health is that epidemics are much more than health problems. Our article suggests conceptualizing epidemics as a socio-technical phenomenon, which means that the analysis should simultaneously include e in their entirety e dimensions related to medicine, politics, science, technology, public opinion, etc. In the case of A(H1N1) influenza, it has been shown how its global condition can be explained on the basis of the action and articulation of different operators that has nothing to do with the biological component of the problem. Secondly, our work has shown that these operators have given A(H1N1) its global status in a very short time, and their observation shows that they all share a common denominator: they produce panoramas. These in turn have the ability to represent and contain totality in a simple, manageable locality. As suggested by Latour (2005) , the production of panoramas has been a privilege of science, and they have articulated themselves in special spaces, such as laboratories. The A(H1N1) influenza outbreak shows that certain institutions, such as the WHO, generate and use panoramas. They produce and articulate them within their activity in order to represent certain phenomena, and they end up establishing them in our everyday life, presenting them as assumptions, or truths that are difficult to question. From this fact there immediately arises a second conclusion for the One World One Health focus; the Manhattan Principles, the studies and statistical models that support it and the general demands made on the international community may themselves operate as panoramas and articulate themselves on specific occasions with other elements to contribute to producing a global condition in certain phenomena related to health. Thus the One World One Health should be capable of reflecting on and analyzing the type of networks, which involve all the demands and materials of various sorts that are being generated. In fact, all of this can be summarized in the necessity for an internal ethical reflection that would examine the consequences of the simple existence and activities of the movement itself. That is, the One World One Health movement should start to regard itself as a new way of understanding our daily life and our relation with our planet.",15.071871112133886,6.780077449104228

The impetus for developing a Public Health Code of Ethics originated within a group of public health practitioners, including providers of public health services, staff of public health nonprofit organizations, government officials, and academics. They had come together for leadership training by the Public Health Leadership Institute. As a leadership exercise, they sought to identify ethical principles that aligned with the issues they were encountering in their work more closely than the common principles of medical ethics. The group began by identifying typical ethical challenges and responses that had surfaced over time from their experiences in public health.

In addition, most investigators who applied human factors principles and methods to infection prevention issues assessed only one human factors element such as training, technology evaluations, or physical environment design. The most significant gap pertains to the limited use and application of formal HFE tools and methods. Human factors engineers have developed, tested, and validated rigorous formal techniques and tools in numerous domains. However, investigators assessing usability and those assessing the physical environment were the only ones who used rigorous HFE methods to address infection prevention issues. Moreover, few investigators have evaluated the interaction among human factors variables [57••] as described by the systems engineering initiative for patient safety (SEIPS) model. This model posits that people (e.g., healthcare workers) interact in a system that includes other people, the tasks they are doing, the organization (e.g., healthcare facility), the environment, and the available technology and tools [127, 128] . Pressure or change in one portion of the system causes pressure or change in the other portions. Thus, if people designing infection prevention interventions do not take into account the effect the intervention has on all portions of the system, the interventions are likely to be ineffective. For example, if well-designed, usable hand hygiene technology is placed in a location where healthcare workers cannot see it or access it, the device will not promote use. If this device is placed where healthcare workers can see it and access it easily but they have not been trained to use it or trained when to use it, the device is unlikely to increase compliance.",12.637764182703608,5.445583168125072

The field of medical ethics or bioethics in general is multidisciplinary because the ethical dilemma in health care requires the inputs and understanding of various professionals. Some of these moral perplexities are part of societal concerns for equity, equality, and justice in health care. A majority of these issues are sociocultural issues and general ethical or moral standards of behaviour in the society. This is why sociological insights are necessary if the ethical conundrums presented by medicine are to be successfully resolved in practice. The most vital tool in medicine is the ""human body."" The body is a place where medical practices and interventions are exercised. The human and his/her body have a significant place in sociological impetus. Sociologists collaborate in resolving moral challenges in health care practice and research. Humphreys (2008, p. 51) observed that the sociological approach has brought out some interesting perspectives, especially unintended consequences of behaviours that bioethics (and research ethics) may not have anticipated.",21.14645848651542,8.248740835169302

Methods: Online pandemic plans from national, provincial and territorial government websites were reviewed to identify: plans for children and families, and psychosocial and ethical issues. A survey was administered to gather participants' perspectives on the needs in pediatric planning, as well as important elements of their organizations' and regions' pandemic plans. A thematic analysis was conducted on qualitative survey responses. Results: The majority of existing plans did not adequately address the unique needs of pediatric populations, and mainly focused on medical and policy concerns. Several gaps in plans were identified, including the need for psychosocial supports and ethical decision-making frameworks for children and families. Similarly, survey respondents identified parallel gaps, in their organization's or region's plans.

There is a compelling argument that the lives saved and suffering prevented by vaccination outweigh the potential infringement on personal autonomy created by school mandates.

Regulators and professional associations have proposed several systematic measures to assess shortage problems (Beck et al., 2019; Bochenek et al., 2018; EMA, 2019c; Jia and Zhao, 2017; Panzitta et al., 2017; PDA, 2014) .

Such strategies cannot be applied to solve all shortage types, and the communications/cooperation among stakeholders may be limited. However, in the end, the existing problem-solving strategies aimed to face the same issue: the medicine unavailability for the patients and the increased risks for their health (Phuong et al., 2019) . Consequently, in the estimation of the shortage impact on the patient needs, this aspect should be primary for harmonizing the existing metrics and rationalizing the problem-solving strategies to be adopted.

Perhaps even prior to this we must acknowledge that global health itself is a moral enterprise (Benatar, 2013) .

However, there are a few important points that need consideration-1. As caregivers, it is our utmost responsibility to protect ourselves from getting infected while managing these patients. Therefore, all heathcare personnel engaged in the care of COVID-19 patients must observe necessary precautions at all times. All of them should be trained in donning, usage, and doffing of the personal protective equipment in accordance with the existing practice guidelines. 2. The hospital systems need to ensure preparedness for dealing with large volume of COVID-19 patients, many of whom would need ICU care and/or acute cardiac care. Appropriate protocols for rapid diagnosis, triage, isolation, and management of COVID-19 patients with CV complications should be developed and well-rehearsed. Rapid triaging and management of these patients is crucial, not only to allow efficient utilization of healthcare resources but also to minimize exposure to caregivers. There are already reports highlighting delays in delivering acute cardiac care due to extra precautions that need to be observed in view of COVID-19 [14] . Efforts should be made to minimize such delays. 3. Strong emphasis should be placed on avoiding unwarranted diagnostic tests (e.g. cardiac troponin, echocardiography, etc.) in these patients. This is required to minimize unwarranted downstream diagnostic/therapeutic procedures which would further strain the already stretched healthcare resources and would also subject caregivers to added risk of exposure to the infection. The American College of Cardiology has released an advisory discouraging random measurement of cardiac biomarkers such as troponins and natriuretic peptides [15] . It urges all the clinicians to reserve these assays for circumstances in which they would actually meaningfully add to the management of the patients with COVID-19. The American Society of Echocardiography has also issued a similar advisory regarding the use of echocardiography in these patients [16] . 4. The individual hospitals may also have to reconsider risk-benefit ratio of primary percutaneous intervention vs fibrinolysis in patients with COVID-19 who present with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. 5. There has been a concern regarding the safety of ACE inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. These agents upregulate expression of ACE2 in various tissues, including on cardiomyocytes [17] . Since SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 to gain entry into human cells, there is a potentially increased risk of developing COVID-19 or developing more severe disease in patients who are already on background treatment with ACEi/ARB. However, to date, no experimental or clinical data have emerged to support these concerns. At the same time, the risks of discontinuing these therapies are well known. Therefore, several leading professional societies have strongly urged to not discontinue clinically-indicated ACEi/ARB therapy in the event the patient develops COVID-19 [18, 19] . 6. Clinicians caring for these patients also need to be fully aware of the potential CV side-effects of various therapies used for treating the viral infection. Additionally, various anti-retroviral drugs have significant interactions with cardiac drugs, which need to be considered and appropriate dose modification done. More recently, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and azathioprine have been proposed as potential therapeutic options, based on preliminary evidence [20] . Both these drugs are known to prolong QT interval and due caution must be exercised when prescribing these agents. Their combination is best avoided and even when using chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine alone, daily electrocardiogram for monitoring QT interval is warranted, esp. in patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction and in those receiving another drug with potential to prolong QT interval.",16.036440834252907,7.492081988550331

To transcribe something is to rewrite it, and transcription is the process of creating a temporary RNA copy of an original DNA sequence.

As Zagzebski and Fairweather argue, ""virtue epistemologists prefer to leave skeptical worries aside in order to pursue a program that is not dominated by these worries"" ( 2001 , p. 5). And one might easily understand why they chose to do so as skepticism tends toward inaction rather than action, the primordial object of any ethical inquiry. Virtue epistemology purports to assess the relation between knower and knowledge or, more precisely, between a knower and her alethic ends (Fairweather 2001 , p. 64) . Th rough this assessment, it proposes to re-articulate the quest for knowledge as a virtue, an epistemic obligation in itself. Virtue epistemology therefore introduces the notion of responsibility into the act of belief itself. In 1877 already, W.K.

Any claim to ""knowledge"" thus signals the impossibility of error, error being the privileged territory of belief. In other words, knowledge cannot abide error without being immediately transformed into something else. Postmodernist readers will instantly perceive how problematic this notion may be. Indeed, postmodernism's primary claim has tended to be a positioning of truth and knowledge as violently normative notions, a normative dimension surprisingly often openly recognized by epistemology itself. From its traditional reliance on an ""ideal"" epistemic agent-or as Bonjour puts it, one ""with faculties that are identical to those of a normal human being"" ( 2002 , p. 255, my italics )-to its object itself-that is, a quest for an ideal and unique endepistemology is suff used with normative principles whose primary eff ects are the silencing of any alternative claims to its own precious creations.

In other words, plans 'provide only minimal specific guidance on how to actually realize [ethical] requirements' (McDougall 2010, p. 2) . This is problematic, as the application (or applicability) of particular ethical values or principles may depend on many contextual factors. For example, the identification of reciprocity as an important ethical principle in pandemic planning and in the justified use of restrictive measures in particular, requires significant context-specific analysis in order to elucidate the parameters in which reciprocity is warranted and in what way the value of reciprocity should be realized (Viens et al. 2009; Silva and Smith 2015) . While examination of the principle of reciprocity has occurred in the context of using isolation and quarantine measures for influenza, SARS, and TB, novel ethical considerations still emerged in the context of the EVD outbreak in response to the implementation of substantially unique measures like cordon sanitaire (Silva and Smith 2015) . Thomas et al. (2007, p . S29) put it eloquently when they argued that the 'allusion to a concept cannot replace disciplined, well-informed, deliberation'. Without significant investments to facilitate these (context-sensitive) deliberations, as has occurred in some cases for influenza pandemic planning, a substantial risk exists that ethical values and principles found in existing pandemic plans will provide little practical guidance for other infectious disease pandemics. It may also be altogether unclear when to incorporate ethical values into decision-making. 2 Thus, while particular ethical values and principles may be outlined in pandemic plans (perhaps as overarching ''guiding principles''), the extent to which it is made clear when and how those values and principles apply to concrete activities in pandemic preparedness and response appears to be very limited. This ultimately limits the adaptability and applicability of this ethical guidance. This is all not to say that the ethical guidance provided in pandemic plans is of no benefit. At a minimum, it provides a point of departure for discussion of the ethical issues and considerations that may be associated with other infectious disease pandemics (Upshur 2014) . Acknowledging this is crucial, as the impression should not be that the due diligence required to think about ethics has been met simply because ethical values and principles have been identified in current pandemic plans. Rather, it should signal the need to rigorously examine ethical preparedness for infectious disease pandemics beyond influenza if we are to improve the moral quality of future global outbreak preparedness and response. In sum, it will suffice to quote the conclusions of McDougall's (2010, p. 2) survey of ethical principles and recommendations in pandemic plans: 'more practical guidance is needed about how to implement the ethical commitments and principles endorsed in ethical frameworks, which are not algorithms that mandate particular approaches or decisions, but decision-making tools that need to be adjusted to reflect both the specific biological characteristics of any actual or potential pandemic, and the specific social circumstances in which they are used as part of a coordinated response'.",34.249005525508714,14.18583213808111

It has also illustrated that familiar ethical issues in infectious disease management endure despite considerable efforts to understand and mitigate such issues in the wake of past outbreaks. To improve future global outbreak preparedness and response, we must examine these shortcomings and reflect upon the current state of ethical preparedness. To this end, we focus our efforts in this article on the examination of one substantial area: ethical guidance in pandemic plans. We argue that, due in part to their focus on considerations arising specifically in relation to pandemics of influenza origin, pandemic plans and their existing ethical guidance are ill-equipped to anticipate and facilitate the navigation of unique ethical challenges that may arise in other infectious disease pandemics. We proceed by outlining three reasons why this is so, and situate our analysis in the context of the EVD outbreak and the threat posed by drug-resistant tuberculosis: (1) different infectious diseases have distinct characteristics that challenge anticipated or existing modes of pandemic prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery, (2) clear, transparent, context-specific ethical reasoning and justification within current influenza pandemic plans are lacking, and (3) current plans neglect the context of how other significant pandemics may manifest.

As the name suggests, all-hazards planning seeks to prepare for many different types of hazards, including infectious disease pandemics, hurricanes, bioterrorist attacks, and myriad other threats to public health and safety. This shift from hazard-specific planning reflects a recognition that public health emergency preparedness and response can, at least to some extent, be installed and implemented in a uniform, yet adaptable, manner by establishing baseline capabilities (e.g., sheltering, evacuation) that must exist to effectively prepare for and respond to a multitude of hazards (United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2013). Thus, it seems that the focus on pandemic (influenza) planning has in some respects been expanded in scope through all-hazards planning. While this is a praiseworthy innovation for public health emergency preparedness and response, the all-hazards approach may prove too broad to adequately anticipate and critically evaluate the nuanced ethical considerations that will be required for robust ethical preparedness for pandemics beyond influenza. That is, while some baseline capabilities, like the capability of communities to shelter populations from all kinds of hazards, can plausibly be established due to the isomorphic relationship between the mitigation strategy (i.e., sheltering) and the common threat posed by many different hazards (i.e., the risk of harm if not sheltered), it seems less plausible that ethical considerations will function in the same manner. For instance, ethical justifications for setting priorities for the allocation of health care resources during a surge in health care need following an earthquake could differ dramatically from a surge stemming from an infectious disease pandemic due to the imperative to curb the spread of disease that exists in the latter but not the former. This necessitates careful analysis and deliberation about the appropriate ethical values and principles, in addition to the ethical reasons, justifications, and context for permissible application that should guide different preparedness and response activities. Some have argued that 'different types of hazards-epidemic, weather related, environmental, radiologic-present special circumstances for ethical decision making and reflection, but they do not require tailor-made ethical principles or goals' (Jennings and Arras 2008, pp. 8-9) ; however, as will be demonstrated in the next section, it is precisely the neglect of special circumstances for ethical decision-making and reflection that renders current pandemic plans, and also all-hazards approaches, illequipped to anticipate and facilitate the navigation of ethical issues in non-influenza pandemics.",26.272039408161532,11.403230057295165

However, several studies have demonstrated that this guidance suffers from considerable deficiencies. For instance, an analysis of ethical language in federal and state pandemic plans in the US found that, 'more often than not, the documents were opaque in their ethical reasoning. The implied messages were a combination of ''trust us and do as we say'' and ''ethics are self-evident, just do what is needed to preserve lives'' ' (Thomas et al. 2007, p. S29) . The pandemic plan developed by the US Department of Health and Human Services, for example, recommends priorities for the allocation of scarce resources like vaccines and antivirals, but does not describe the underlying ethical values or principles that would enable decisionmakers to refine or reinterpret those priorities under different circumstances (Thomas et al. 2007) . A similar analysis involving the review of 29 (influenza) pandemic plans from 25 European Union (EU) countries, 2 acceding countries, and 3 non-EU countries, found that the plans 'usually stated that their goal was to decrease morbidity and mortality and ensure that society still functions', but that there was a 'lack of ethical reasoning' justifying these goals (Mounier-Jack et al. 2007, p. 926) . Another review exploring the degree to which the inclusion of ethical terms were treated as sufficient in their reflection on underlying ethical issues concluded that the 'majority of pandemic preparedness plans do not contain the terms that were identified as central to ethical reasoning' (Derpmann 2011, p. 448) , and that 'ethical issues remain unobserved or treated with insufficient transparency' (p. 449). With respect to priorities for allocating resources during a pandemic, one author suggests that, while all plans reviewed mentioned priorities, most were 'not supported by a justification and/or there is no mention of the principles that priorities are based upon' (Derpmann 2011, p. 449) . For instance, 'occurrences of the term ''priority'' [were] difficult to interpret, since there are different kinds of justification for priorities in pandemic planning' (Derpmann 2011, p. 449) .",24.37277354910492,9.688923470577416

This scepticism stems from several recent analyses of pandemic plans, which have demonstrated that, while ethical considerations and guidance have been incorporated into many pandemic plans, underlying ethical reasoning and justifications remain largely absent. Pandemic planning requires numerous assumptions to be made regarding, among other things, the severity of the pandemic, the supply and availability of health care resources, and the availability of information regarding who is at risk and who can benefit (Prehn and Vawter 2008) . Variations in these underlying assumptions can have profound implications for ethical reasoning and justification, which may ultimately affect the nature and scope of ethics guidance included in a plan. As such, it is not surprising that considerable variety exists among plans in the attention paid to guidance for ethical decision-making (Prehn and Vawter 2008; McDougall 2010) . Indeed, many pandemic plans do not contain any ethical guidance at all (Prehn and Vawter 2008) . Of course, this is problematic not only for ethics preparedness for infectious disease pandemics beyond influenza, but for influenza pandemics as well. And while numerous ethics guidance documents and a substantial scholarly literature exist that can be drawn upon in the event of a pandemic (e.g., University of Toronto Joint Centre for Bioethics 2005; Kinlaw and Levine 2007; National Ethics Advisory Committee 2007; World Health Organization 2007 , 2008b Jennings and Arras 2008) , this should not be seen as a replacement for the integration of robust ethics guidance within pandemic plans themselves, as many of the decisions governments and health practitioners will make in preparing for and responding to pandemics will ostensibly be derived from their own jurisdiction's pandemic plan and the ethical guidance therein.",22.694625640236083,8.914698469154994

In particular, this involves strengthening the WHO's role in coordinating and supporting Member States with respect to their pandemic preparedness (World Health Organization 2015b). Central to the existing resources that Member States can utilize for preparedness and response are pandemic plans, which have been developed and installed at the WHO and by nearly every Member State (World Health Organization 2011). Given the substantial investments that have been made in the development and installation of these plans, in addition to their significance in guiding international and national preparedness and response, an important avenue for reflection on how we can improve our approach to addressing ethical issues in global outbreaks is to assess the aptitude of existing pandemic plans to anticipate and guide the resolution of both familiar and novel ethical issues in pandemic preparedness and response.",22.04948422656232,8.611906948397763

In turn, this variation should expect to create unique ethical challenges and will therefore require novel ethical consideration. For instance, microbiological or immunological variations across infectious diseases with pandemic potential have distinct implications for an infectious disease's epidemiology and how the disease can and should be addressed through clinical medicine, public health surveillance and intervention, legal provisions, and so forth. Indeed, microbiological variations between infectious diseases can mean the difference between planning for a virus or bacterium, which has significant implications for transmissibility, pathogenicity, and immunity. An obvious example is the difference between airborne, waterborne, or direct-contact pathogens, which can each have considerable implications for which restrictive public health measures can and should be used to isolate and curb the spread of disease, in addition to the measures that should be considered necessary to protect the health and safety of health care practitioners such that they are not put at undue risk. Ethical issues and considerations associated with a pandemic involving directcontact transmission, for example, will not necessarily be adequately anticipated or addressed if the range of ethical issues considered in pandemic plans are circumscribed to those associated with an airborne influenza pandemic. Indeed, different ethical issues should be expected to arise between airborne (e.g., influenza) and direct-contact (e.g., HIV) pathogens, such as the amount of responsibility one must assume as both a potential transmitter and potential subject of transmission (Battin et al. 2008 ). Failing to anticipate potential ethical issues will render ethical guidance incomplete, which could mean the neglect of other important ethical values in decision-making.",23.250980414837535,8.52862735814003

The GCP guidelines aim to ensure not only ethical conduct of studies, but generation of credible data. The guidelines' objectives of documenting informed consent, participant safety and data integrity are worthy. However, it has been argued that these GCP guidelines are based on consensus of expert opinions and not on evidence. 43 Not surprisingly, the individual standards as well as the concept of standardization of clinical trials of pharmacological interventions are not free of controversy. There have been increasing calls for the guidelines to be made more scientific, up-to-date, flexible and simple through collaborative and evidence-based efforts. 43, 44 For trials in developing countries, rigid adherence to GCP standards as they are now formulated, have both positive and unfavorable consequences. 45 The complexity and expense of clinical trials has risen rapidly in recent years. A portion of this increased expense arises from the extensive documentation and auditing requirements demanded by GCP guidelines. This constitutes a disincentive to the clinical testing of drugs and vaccines for diseases mainly affecting developing countries and for which profitable markets are not foreseen. Furthermore, compliance with the stringent GCP requirements often requires the engagement of expensive policy. This may require development of both detailed 'investment cases' , as well as much shorter policy briefs. Presentation of the information in scientific journals is important, but it is also important to arrange presentations of study findings in both small and large meetings attended by policy-makers. The onus of assuring the attendance of policy-makers at such meetings is on the investigators. Finally, because the WHO has the ear of policy-makers, presentation of the findings at relevant WHO meetings, at both the regional and global levels is critical. An illustration of this approach was provided by efforts to synthesize and communicate the evidence on cholera and oral cholera vaccines. Synthesis of these findings into a white paper, and subsequently an investment case, for WHO's Scientific Advisory Group of Experts led to a greatly strengthened recommendation on oral cholera vaccines by WHO, 48 and provided the background for a recent World Health Assembly resolution, recommending the use of vaccines in the public health armamentarium against cholera. 49",22.9200103526335,10.354989835198458

Indeed, Ayuda Urbana represents the latest development of a broader initiative at the World Bank to focus on knowledge as a key lever in the fight against poverty. The Bank started an initiative in 1998 to support the development of communities internally, and since then the number of communities has grown from twenty-five to more than a hundred -and the influence of several has been considerable.

Strengths and weaknesses are mainly internal factors while opportunities and threats generally relate to external factors. For the analysis, we collected answers to the following questions ( • Content is unbalanced with respect to information provider (younger persons) • Risk of manipulation/spam • Availability of internet access is a mustdifficult in rural areas • Data privacy: people are sharing personal information in the web, but when coming aware of privacy and security issues they might stop sharing • Reliability of information • Technology needs to be able to resolve ambiguities and filter out irrelevant information • New standards or laws could forbid the use of social media for monitoring purposes • Ethical issues might hamper the use It can be seen that there are many positive aspects supporting the use of social media for disease surveillance and crisis communication. More timely information and networking among the ""helping hands"" could become the most driving factor. Challenges are related to the increased information overload, including the amount of unauthorized information which is information not officially confirmed by health officials, which might be addressed by technology, e.g., by including sophisticated filtering algorithms to prefilter the information before showing to the user. A challenge is the high risk of manipulation, in particular the risk of analyzing postings containing wrong or misleading information. The usefulness of social media for disease surveillance depends clearly on the willingness of people to share (correct) information online and to use online tools. In particular, we will need in future ethical and legal standards to ensure that people will continuously use these tools for reporting on disease activity.

However, the significant heterogeneity and less critical outcomes of such trials may be leading to a waste of research resources. This study aimed to develop a core outcome set (COS) for clinical trials on COVID-19 in order to tackle the outcome issues. The study was conducted according to the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) handbook (version 1.0), a guideline for COS development. A research group was set up that included experts in respiratory and critical medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, evidence-based medicine, clinical pharmacology, and statistics, in addition to medical journal editors. Clinical trial registry websites (chictr.org.cn and clinicaltrials.gov) were searched to retrieve clinical trial protocols and outcomes in order to form an outcome pool. A total of 78 clinical trial protocols on COVID-19 were included and 259 outcomes were collected. After standardization, 132 outcomes were identified within seven different categories, of which 58 were selected to develop a preliminary outcome list for further consensus. After two rounds of Delphi survey and one consensus meeting, the most important outcomes for the different clinical classifications of COVID-19 were identified and determined to constitute the COS for clinical trials on COVID-19 (COS-COVID).

In the MERS cases, 40% had C-section and this is much lower than 100% C-section rate in the case of COVID-19. This difference may reflect a variance in the practices between different countries. Another difference is the high fetal demise rate of 30% among pregnant women with MERS compared to 0% among COVID-19. The fetal demise rate among 12 pregnant women with SARS was 25% [8] . Thus, similar to the difference in the clinical presentation and course among SARS, MERS-CoV and COVID-19, there is also differences in the outcome and course of pregnant women with these coronaviruses' infection. Understanding the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy and outcome would guide healthcare authorities and public health on further risk mitigation and advise for pregnant women around the world.

Other CT features included vascular dilatation (n=83, 89.2%), interlobular septal thickening (n=29, 31.2%), bronchodilatation (n=44, 47.3%), the crazy-paving sign (n=34, 36.6%), the sieve-hole sign (n=12, 12.9%), pleural thickening (n=21, 22.6%), and pleural effusion (n=8, 8.6%). Multiple lobe involvement, including the presence of consolidation, the crazy-paving sign, interlobular septal thickening, pleural thickening and pleural effusion, was more common in critical patients with heavy/critical infection (p<0.05), whereas the presence of GGO, involvement of one or two lobes, and the halo sign were more common in patients with mild/common-type infections (p<0.05). Moreover, older age, higher body temperature, complaints of chest tightness and breathlessness, and lymphopenia was associated with heavy/critical infections. CONCLUSION: The CT and clinical appearances of COVID-19 are variable and reflect the severity of COVID-19 to some extent.",15.12213743348529,8.288129910000796

All activities concerning the health of populations are within the PH domain. Given the consequentialist nature of PH, its main goals are to preserve and promote the health of populations and reduce inequalities in health outcomes. 1 The characteristics of the multidisciplinary field of PH, lead to ethical issues being at the heart of the subject: it is a common good, with a preventative approach that is provided by the government. 2 PH is a collective effort, as its goals cannot be achieved by individual efforts; thus, it requires government action in addition to community participation. 2, 3 Public health ethics is a sub-branch of bioethics, which help PH professionals and health-related organizations to make some necessary trade-offs so that public health goals can be realized. The objectives and activities of PH make this area unique in terms of applying and overcoming ethical principles and moral norms. 4 The objectives of PH are related to moral norms, in particular, prevention of harm and beneficence, producing utility (optimization of benefits over harms) and justice. 5 Some PH interventions are still a threat to other moral norms, such as individual freedom and autonomy, privacy, and confidentiality. 5, 6 With the increasing threats of communicable and non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and populations with chronic health problems, such as diabetes and obesity, it is necessary for PH professionals and other health-related institutions to address ethical conflicts in their policies and practices. 5 Given the objectives of PH, providing universal health coverage requires informed and correct decision-making, based on empirical evidence and moral judgment. For example, the goal of ending the AIDS epidemic by 2020 is only possible if people are being informed about their illness through voluntary testing and access to healthcare services. In addition, the elimination of stigma and discrimination is one of the key topics that should be addressed when planning for the prevention and control of the disease worldwide. 7 Moreover, the socio-economic burdens of NCDs are particularly severe in developing countries, accounting for 75% of all NCD-related deaths. Thus, in order to achieve sustainable development goals, the WHO has established global governance to address complex issues that could not be managed alone. These interactions have raised a range of ethical challenges, including conflicts of interests and governance issues. Transparency, accountability, and management of conflicts of interests are ethical issues requiring attention to prevent NCDs and chronic diseases. Therefore, policy-makers and governments have been working closely with food and drink industry partners to address a number of determinants and processes, which today are tackled by a set of institutions globally. These new challenges call for tools and methods for overcoming ethical conflicts and maximizing benefits. 8 The American Public Health Association identified 10 essential functions for the effective implementation of PH programs, 9 which resulted in the development of a variety of ethical frameworks. Initially, the following two concerns led to the formation of practical frameworks for ethical evaluation of PH: (i) public involvement rather than individual autonomy; and (ii) prioritization and allocation of scarce resources, especially in developing countries, which has raised the debate on justice. 10 So far, several practical frameworks have been proposed for the ethical evaluation of PH programs, but none are universally approved. 11e13 Most of these frameworks were based on common underpinning assumptions, but they were formed to address ethical issues either theoretically or practically. Kass 11 was the first pioneer who proposed a primary practical framework for ethical evaluation of PH, including six steps, based on two key values of social rights and social justice. Childress et al. 14 conceptualized general moral considerations in PH practice and introduced six justificatory conditions to solve conflicts in the context of PH. In the stewardship model proposed by the Nuffield Council on Bioethics 2007, 15 only practical recommendations for ethical decision-making were mentioned. On the other hand, given the debates raised about priority setting, especially in developing countries, ethical frameworks based on fundamental values of fairness and accountability have been proposed, which combine normative and empirical methods, and the involvement of all stakeholders and partners in policy decisions. 16e18 Thus, to enable legitimate and fair decision-making when considering priority setting in PH policy, the 'accountability for reasonableness' 19 framework was created, which was then developed by health system stakeholders in developing countries specifically for their requirements. 20e22 Given the evolution and specialization of these frameworks, Ten Have et al., 12 proposed a practical framework to evaluate overweight and obesity interventions, after providing an inventory of relevant moral norms. At the heart of the framework is a list of eight questions on the morally relevant features of a program, which is then followed by procedural recommendations for applying the ethical framework. Marckmann et al., 13 proposed an ethical framework to guide professionals in planning, conducting, and evaluating PH interventions. Their proposed framework contains an explicit normative foundation with five substantive criteria, five questions on the morally relevant features of a PH program, and seven procedural conditions to guarantee a fair decision-making process. However, the authors did not assess its practical application to determine the efficiency of the framework.",18.960111639124335,7.923101152407888

The discussion becomes more controversial when the key concern is about communicable disease transmission. There is an inherent risk of exposure to communicable diseases in health care. Do healthcare professionals assume that risk when they choose to enter the field? Primacy of patient welfare is a core principle for healthcare officials; however, it must be balanced with personal risk to the healthcare professional. The risk can and should be mitigated by strong infection control policies and procedure to minimize the risks. However, in situations of uncertainty, particularly with emerging infectious diseases, a common-sense risk reduction approach should be taken into account. For example, during the severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS) epidemic in Toronto, Canada, 90% of the reported cases of SARS were associated with exposure at a single hospital. Healthcare workers, including students, comprised almost 40% of the cases. In a situation in which students have very little to offer with respect to patient welfare but are at significant personal risk, it is reasonable to question whether it is ethical to expose them to the risk [17] .",16.867568863728355,5.082727474127759

In such a scenario, differentiating whether the cause of death is specifically due to COVID-19 or the result of treatment limitations can be difficult. Among patients who die before reaching the hospital, some will present too late in the course of the disease to be saved, whereas end-of-life care will be viewed as preferable for others because little chance of survival with a meaningful quality of life exists. In some patients, this decision might be influenced by known individual preferences. Similarly, not all critically ill patients in hospital will be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), because the chances of meaningful survival for some will be viewed as too low; 8 for these patients, non-invasive ventilation and perhaps even some vasopressor support could be provided in so-called middle care units, but in case of further deterioration, mechanical ventilation will not be considered and death will occur because of severe hypoxaemia. As noted by Phua and colleagues, 1 a quarter of patients who died early in the Wuhan, China, outbreak did not receive invasive ventilation. 9 Patients who deteriorate despite mechanical ventilation can be placed on resource-intensive ECMO systems (figure). 10 The decision not to use ECMO might be made because the support system is not available or because such care is considered to be disproportionate in the context of limited staff numbers. The same considerations might apply to patients who develop renal failure.

More than 70% of disease outbreaks worldwide occur in fragile and conflict-affected settings. 8 Yemen has experienced the largest cholera outbreak in history. 9 During the second half of 2019, there were six concurrent disease outbreaks in Sudan. 10 Wild polio virus returned to Syria due to conflict, 11 while Afghanistan and Pakistan are two of three countries where the virus remains endemic. 12 The average International Health Regulations (IHR) core capacity score is much lower for the 12 conflict-affected countries than for the other countries in the region, 6 placing them at greater risk of spread and public health consequences of the ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and other epidemic-prone diseases. WHO's global COVID-19 strategic preparedness and response plan 13 therefore prioritises countries with weak health systems for technical and operational support from international partners. COVID-19 has already affected ten countries in the region, as of Feb 28, 2020, including Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan.",12.218920709974794,6.3417777367438175

First, under Article 43.2, countries cannot implement additional health measures exclusively as a precaution but must rather ground their decision making in ""scientific principles"", ""scientific evidence"", and ""advice from WHO"". 1 Many of the travel restrictions being implemented during the COVID-19 outbreak are not supported by science or WHO. Travel restrictions for these kinds of viruses have been challenged by public health researchers, [4] [5] [6] and WHO has advised against travel restrictions, arguing they cause more harm than good. 7, 8 Second, under Article 43.1 any additional health measures implemented by countries ""shall not be more restrictive of international traffic and not more invasive or intrusive to persons than reasonably available alternatives"". 1 In this case, even if travel restrictions did work, there are so many other more effective measures that countries can take to protect their citizens. WHO has issued COVID-19 technical guidance on several such measures, including risk communication, surveillance, patient management, and screening at ports of entry and exit. 9 Third, and most importantly, Article 3.1 strictly requires all additional health measures to be implemented ""with full respect for the dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms of persons"", 1 which in turn must reflect the international law principles of necessity, legitimacy, and proportionality that govern limitations to and derogations from rights and freedoms. 10 Under no circumstances should public health or foreign policy decisions be based on the racism and xenophobia that are now being directed at Chinese people and those of Asian descent. 11 Many of the travel restrictions implemented by dozens of countries during the COVID-19 outbreak are therefore violations of the IHR. 12 Yet, perhaps even more troubling, is that at least two-thirds of these countries have not reported their additional health measures to WHO, 12 response to public health emergencies and prevents countries from holding each other accountable for their obligations under the IHR. Some countries argue that they would rather be safe than sorry. But evidence belies the claim that illegal travel restrictions make countries safer. [4] [5] [6] In the short term, travel restrictions prevent supplies from getting into affected areas, slow down the international public health response, stigmatise entire populations, and disproportionately harm the most vulnerable among us. In the longer term, countries selecting which international laws to follow encourages other countries to do the same, which in turn undermines the broader rules-based world order. Effective global governance is not possible when countries cannot depend on each other to comply with international agreements. 13 Of course, the IHR is far from perfect. For example, the IHR only governs countries, not corporations and other non-governmental actors. Thus, some countries are finding themselves with de-facto travel restrictions when airlines stop flying to places affected by COVID-19.",12.468106419636925,5.909167690851233

However, lasting behaviour change is a result of decisions made at the individual level. To facilitate voluntary behaviour change a campaign must appeal to the values and cost-benefit evaluation of each audience group targeted, emphasising near-term salient benefits rather than long-term, abstract, collective benefits. Likewise, veterinary public health messages must be customised in such a way that they are interesting, relevant and captivating to their audience. Messages should be clear, easy to understand and easy to act on. Unless it is easy for people to remember how, when and what to do it is unlikely that a veterinary public health communication campaign will be successful. Social marketing techniques applied to emerging zoonosis communication campaigns have been shown to be effective in crafting health messages that 'speak' to target audiences [6] . Successful communication campaigns are based on systematic planning efforts and on objectives that are attainable, measurable, clear and time-bound. Successful campaigns develop and deliver health messages that are tailored to specific target audiences. Disseminating generic veterinary public health messages widely and increasing knowledge about certain emerging zoonoses issues and healthy behaviours have been shown to be less effective than more targeted efforts. Audience-centred health communication efforts with a consumer perspective are much more effective in motivating target audiences to change their behaviour. This requires designing and delivering messages that are adapted to the needs, perceptions, preferences and situations of the intended audiences rather than the needs and goals of the message designers or institutions. Communicators in veterinary public health practice therefore need to know as much as possible about their target audience(s) in order to stimulate voluntary behaviour change [7] .",13.123655288167077,5.200949851732996

Security dangers are associated with fast-moving infectious disease outbreaks that overwhelm response capacity and cause chaos. In 2007, the World Health Organization described pandemic influenza as 'the most feared security threat', 8 and former US President George W. Bush suggested that a military response may be necessary in the event of a flu pandemic. Security may also be jeopardized for economic reasons in the case of slower-moving epidemics. HIV/AIDS, for example, has brought numerous African societies to the verge of economic collapse. Historical studies reveal that factors such as high infant mortality, low life expectancy and decreasing life expectancy -especially salient in sub-Saharan Africa at present, largely as a result of HIV/AIDS -are among the most reliable indicators of societal upheaval. 9 Given the ethical importance of infectious disease, it is encouraging that public health ethics has emerged as a rapidly growing subdiscipline of bioethics, and that an increasing body of literature is focusing on ethical issues associated with infectious disease in particular. A majority of the ethics and infectious disease literature has focused on HIV/AIDS, SARS, pandemic influenza and bioterrorism. This article will review four major ethical issues associated with pandemic influenza: the obligation of individuals to avoid infecting others, healthcare workers' 'duty to treat', allocation of scarce resources, and the use of coercive social distancing measures.

However, Huang and colleagues' report mainly focused on non-pregnant adults. The clinical characteristics and vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women is unknown. Urgent questions that need to be addressed promptly include whether pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia will develop distinct symptoms from non-pregnant adults, whether pregnant women who have confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia are more likely to die of the infection or to undergo preterm labour, and whether COVID-19 could spread vertically and pose risks to the fetus and neonate. Answers to these questions are essential for formulating the principles of obstetric treatment for pregnant women with COVID-19 infection. Therefore, to facilitate efforts, both in China and glo bally, to prevent and control COVID-19 pneumonia in children and pregnant women, 3 we retrospectively collected and analysed detailed clinical data from pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.

This suggests that those concerned with health ethics should, in addition to engaging in philosophical analysis, play a greater role in identifying ethically important empirical questions and advocating that relevant research gets done. A message for scientists is that there are many empirical questions which are not only scientifically important but also crucial to the making of ethically sound policy.

The interests of the public are protected by regulators such as the Food and Drug Administration whose role is to approve vaccines only if the proven benefits outweigh any measurable risks [147] . Assessment of vaccine risk-benefit is more complex than for therapeutic interventions, as benefits of vaccination can accrue to the population through herd immunity, while the risks of any adverse reactions are suffered by individuals, potentially raising complex ethical issues [148] . Hence, perceptions of risk-benefit at the individual level, i.e. ""I do not want immunization because any benefits do not justify the risk of a vaccine reaction"" [149] , can sometimes be difficult to reconcile with risk-benefit assessments at the public health level, i.e. ""if we allow too many individuals not to be immunized, herd immunity will be lost and serious infectious disease outbreaks may eventuate"" [150] . Hence, policy makers and vaccine recipients might have very different perceptions of immunization risk-benefits [151] . This is also likely to shape the publics' view of adjuvant risk-benefits, particularly in situations where both adjuvanted and unadjuvanted vaccines are available for the same indication. For example, an approved seasonal influenza vaccine in Europe contains MF59 squalene emulsion adjuvant, but the vast majority of influenza vaccines used in Europe are not adjuvanted [152] . Factors influencing consumer and practitioner utilization of adjuvanted versus unadjuvanted influenza vaccines could thereby be a useful area of study. No adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines are currently available in the US, which could potentially reflect differences in regulatory and consumer views across continents [141] . During the 2009 influenza pandemic both adjuvanted and unadjuvanted pandemic vaccines were utilized in Europe, with consumers not always given a choice regarding which vaccine was used [153] . By contrast, only unadjuvanted pandemic vaccines were used in the US [154] . This imposed lack of consumer choice in some European countries may have acted to reinforce negative perceptions of adjuvanted vaccines, particularly when it was subsequently revealed that a squalene-adjuvanted vaccine used during the pandemic was associated with an increased risk of childhood narcolepsy [8] . Given potential public apprehension around the term 'adjuvant', there is a need for more research to identify the source of such fears and develop strategies to alleviate them [155] . The origins of consumer apprehension surrounding adjuvants is likely to be multifactorial, with potential contributors being general mistrust in governments and public health policy, perceptions of lack of choice, media coverage of rare adverse reactions, confusion between issues of aluminum, thiomersal and other vaccine excipients, and citing of papers on the role of adjuvants such as oil emulsions in autoimmune disease in animal models. In respect of the latter, scientists know animal model findings may not always translate to humans, as reflected in the saying 'mice lie'. However, in the absence of adequate education many consumers are unlikely to appreciate this point and may place undue emphasis on such data when making risk-benefit assessments in respect of adjuvanted vaccines. It is also important that more research is undertaken to better understand such adverse effects in animal models and how they relate to the human context.",12.445393523896769,6.791504667663338

Nevertheless, a number of reports have been published highlighting CT appearances in COVID-19, raising the possibility of a role for CT in patient management. 1e5 In response to these reports, the BSTI published a preliminary consensus statement on 6 March 2020. 6 We discuss below what role, if any, CT would play in the detection and management of COVID-19 infection in the UK, and the logistics of imaging delivery. This role is heavily predicated on the clinical context as well as the timing of its intended use within the diagnostic pathway, especially relative to the current reference standard diagnostic test, real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of a pharyngeal swab, 7 and other clinical and laboratory investigations. Although it may not be feasible or desirable for isolation purposes to perform a chest radiograph (CXR), we should acknowledge that pragmatically patients with a respiratory complaint are likely to present via any number of routes (primary care, emergency departments [EDs] or outpatient clinics) having already had a CXR, other than to isolation pods outside a hospital, and work-up of a respiratory complaint would usually include a CXR in such settings. Cognizant of this fact, in the following discussion we have considered how a CXR would also fit into diagnostic algorithms, and in particular, how the use of CT would alter management in settings where a CXR was or was not available.",13.423593999757319,5.542062026892982

Currently, countries such as Thailand are experiencing an increase in tourism demand due to sex tourism (tourism activities which lead to sexual activity, particularly involving children). 'In 1998, the International Labour Organization reported its calculations that 2-14 per cent of the gross domestic product of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand derives from sex tourism. In addition, while Asian countries, including Thailand, India and the Philippines, have long been prime destinations for child sex tourists, in recent years, tourists have increasingly travelled to Mexico and Central America for their sexual exploits as well' (Nair, 2006) . Countries which are starved for hard foreign currency often look the other way as the cash flows in (Nair) . Western governments, including the United States, are now enacting laws which allow prosecution for sex tourism and the tourists despite the crimes taking place in foreign soil. Existing laws make it illegal to travel with the intent to have sex with a minor. Proposals for new laws that would make it illegal to have sex with a child in another country are now being pursued. Policy creation and implementation is complex and difficult to implement as the activities are international in scope, with victims and perpetuators coming from different countries. Further complicating this situation is the fact that each country, in many cases, has jurisdiction over only part of the criminal activity. To give more force to existing laws, a bill was introduced in the US Government on 28 April 2005, entitled the 'End Demand for Sex Trafficking Act of 2005.' The bill included a provision that would amend the language specifically to state that individuals engaging in sexual activity can be charged with a criminal offense as 'a purchaser of commercial sexual activities'. Passage of this amendment would clarify for federal prosecutors that enforcement of the law can and should be used to prosecute US-based sex tour operators (Equality Now, 2006) . Further efforts to eliminate child sex tourism are being pursued by the tourism industry itself.",14.55256036668919,7.628747279569167

For instance, a review of reimbursement decisions in 14 OECD countries found that both the severity and the rarity of a condition were used to justify higher incremental cost-eff ectiveness ratios or higher prices than would be the norm. 217 Balancing the various considerations and justifi cations that could be used in such decisions highlights the necessity of explicitly defi ning ethical principles to guide the use of economic analyses in the selection of medicines.",15.933563856806625,7.282638953951939

One of the peculiarities of the target study is the need to manage two populations ethically, that is, the population that provides the intervention therapy (CEP) and the population that receives the intervention therapy (study participants). There are multiple ethical guidelines about human study participation in trials, and thus, handling the ethical discussions on study participants for the target study was not as tricky as handling the ethical discussion on EVD survivors as blood donors for the trial. We did not come across ethical guidelines on dealing with humans who provide study intervention products. However, we considered potential convalescent plasma donors as having the same vulnerability as EVD research participants as they also may have to deal with the issue of potential exploitation, coercion and/or undue influence.",22.35528573906873,8.76943237812081

Additional information on chloroquine will soon be released in the context of the evolving outbreak. Timely release of this information can be of importance due to the growing number of infected patients, and the absence of licensed specific drugs. Meanwhile, the recommendations for ""Clinical management of severe acute respiratory infection when novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection is suspected"", published by the WHO, confirm that there is currently no evidence from RCTs to inform on specific drug treatment of COVID-19 and that unlicensed treatments should be administered only in the context of ethically-approved clinical trials or the Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered Interventions Framework (MEURI), under strict monitoring [17] . The WHO therefore seems to view chloroquine as experimental. The authors tend to agree with this viewpoint. But even off-label use of chloroquine may be accompanied by several concerns; the first is patient safety. Such use should be accompanied by close monitoring. An epidemic is hardly the ideal setting to do this. The ethical approach to off-label drug use also differs between countries, raising questions regarding equity. Finally, chloroquine remains a pivotal drug in the treatment of Malaria in many places in the world. Off label drug use can create major drug shortages [18] .",18.806446606221137,8.715473056838729

However, these numbers are probably underestimated as not all patients are tested, especially those who are asymptomatic, or with only mild symptoms and no associated comorbidities. The standard of reference for confirming COVID-19 relies on microbiological tests such as real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or sequencing [3] . However, these tests might not be available in an emergency setting and their results are not immediately available. Computed tomography (CT) can be used as an important complement to RT-PCR for diagnosing COVID-19 pneumonia in the current epidemic context [4, 5] . Indeed, when the viral load is insufficient, RT-PCR can be falsely negative while chest CT shows suggestive abnormalities [4, 5] . A large series based on 1014 patients reported a 97% sensitivity of chest CT for the diagnosis of COVID-19, while the mean time interval between initial negative and positive RT-PCR was approximately 5 days [5] . Thus, CT can play a pivotal role in the early detection and management of COVID-19 pneumonia [6] , at least for patients who have been symptomatic for more than three days [4] .

For pediatric patients, fever and mild cough are common symptoms at disease onset. For mild case, fever is brief and resolved rapidly. A few of patients presenting with/without cough also showed radiographic evidence of patchy infiltrate at symptom onset.

Radiographic evidence of pneumonia was a characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection at the earliest stage of infection, thus, close observation is very necessary for a child with either mild symptomatic or asymptomatic infection. We don't recommend use of antiviral agents for the treatment of self-limited non-severe COVID because no evidence has shown the effectiveness of antiviral agents currently available.

I came away from the experience convinced that Stephen Toulmin had it right in his now quarter-century old article, ""The Tyranny of Principles"" (Toulmin 1981) . Neither absolute adherence to principles, nor relativistic acceptance of all ""moral"" views, is likely to result in a set of ethical guidelines that most people in a highly diverse society can accept as substantially their own. Rather, any such set of ethical guidelines is likely to be built ""taxonomically, taking one difficult class of cases at a time and comparing it in detail with other clearer and easier classes of cases"" (Toulmin 1981, 31) . The NC IOM/DPH Task Force stalled when it tried to agree on abstract definitions of terms like ""duty,"" ""obligation,"" and ""responsibility,"" but it made substantial progress as soon as Task Force members began to share cases in which it was clear to them, for example, that a physician had a duty/obligation/responsibility to work and cases in which it was not clear. By comparing and contrasting clear and unclear cases, the Task Force was able to write ethical guidelines that, in its collective estimation, would help decisionmakers handle, fairly and compassionately, all but the hardest cases-the kind of cases which tragically result in someone or some group being harmed despite everyone's best intensions and efforts to avoid this state of affairs. I left my role as co-Chair of the NC IOM/DPH Task Force convinced that when an influenza pandemic arrives, the kind of ethics most likely to persuade people to do their duty and more is not a rights-based, duties-based, or utility-based ethics, but a care-based ethics. We human beings are a very vulnerable lot. We are radically dependent on each other for survival and we need to view ourselves as folks in a lifeboat in the middle or the ocean with no visible sign of rescue. If there aren't enough supplies to go around until help arrives, we can do several things: we can ask for volunteers to jump off the boat; we can start drawing straws for who gets pushed off the boat; we can have a majority vote about which lives are most dispensable; or we can look in each others' eyes and see ourselves-fearful, hopeful, and in need of compassion. Then start paddling together to get to shore, knowing that although we might not all make it, we did not turn on each other in our panic. What we need most to weather a pandemic is an ethics of trust, reciprocity, and solidarity.

A large number of drugs are toxic in nature, requiring careful dosing and monitoring when used therapeutically. Others have undesired effects if taken in the absence of a particular pathology or antigen. Safety issues include not only the side effects and toxicity of drugs, but adverse drug interactions, contraindications, off-label use, and black market trade in pharmaceuticals. It is also important to remember that in virtually every medical encounter, a value judgment is made about whether the side effects or toxicity of the treatment is outweighed by its positive therapeutic effects. Often, clinicians and patients differ about that value equation. It is an ethical mandate that drugs be safe within the medical meaning of that term (i.e., if taken appropriately and with knowledge of possible side effects and toxicities). However, the standards for drug safety, the evaluation of drug safety, and the regulation of safe pharmaceutical development do not inherently raise ethical questions unless they violate some reasonable standard of ethical competence. A clear ethical issue does arise, however, in the attempt to avoid or minimize safety standards, especially in the pursuit of profits or market share. In a broader sense, there is also an ethical discussion to be had about taking the risk of ingesting drugs for life style or enhancement purposes, or under duress. Is it ethical to prescribe psychopharmaceuticals for people without diagnosed mental illness simply because they seek to alter their personality or sense of self? 5 Is it acceptable to make psychopharmaceutical treatment a condition of employment or release from jail? Is it ethical, for that matter, to mandate treatment for those facing trial or on death row in order to try them or to execute them? 6 Balancing the risk of life style pharmaceuticals with a growing consumer demand is one of the biggest ethical challenges of drug development in the coming decades (see Section 1.22.6.1).",21.363602875308324,9.240800657394175

Each of these disciplines works in systems that face ethical dilemmas, making it important that public health workers have motivation to understand and practice within the ethical guidelines of their profession, thus making ethics an important component of training and practice. The dangers of ethical lapses are overwhelmingly apparent in the case of the Eugenics movement of the early 20 th century which metamorphosed from forced sterilizations in many liberal democratic countries into mass murder of physically and mentally handicapped children and adults in Nazi Germany. Between 1939 and 1941, 180 thousand psychiatric patients along with an equivalent number of handicapped children and adults were killed in an organized extermination program in Germany by lethal gassing. This method was then applied to the industrialized murder or Holocaust of six million Jews and millions of other ""untermenschen"" (sub human) in the greatest genocide in human history. Shortly after World War II ended the Nuremberg Trials of Nazi war criminals were conducted including medical doctors, and some were executed for crimes against humanity. This was followed by the 1948 United Nations Declaration on Human Rights and by the World Medical Association's Helsinki Declaration. Both are widely accepted as cornerstone documents-the latter specifically governing ethical standards related to human experimentation-and are revised regularly since being issued in 1964. But genocide has not disappeared, nor has unscrupulous experimentation such as the Tuskegee experiment on black Americans infected with syphilis and left untreated even after the availability of a cure, penicillin. Ethical standards are now required by ""Helsinki Committees""ethical review boards-in most medical facilities worldwide. Ethical frameworks have evolved in part due to bitter experience of ethical failures later recognized and affecting public health standards of practice.

The Helsinki Declaration was first adopted by the World Medical Assembly in 1964, and amended in 1975, 1983, 1989, 1996, and 2013 .

As of 00:00 on March 6, 2020, approximately 98,332 persons have been infected across the world(NHC, 2020), the figure that has already far exceeded the numbers for SARS in 2003 and MERS in 2012 (Huang et al., 2020; Wong et al., 2015) . Moreover, other than a certain degree of progress in the control and prevention of the epidemic in China, the situations in other countries have deteriorated. Without proper protective measures, COVID-19 may be transmitted through airborne droplets from coughing and sneezing, as well as close contact. Furthermore, air transmission and feces-mouth transmission have not yet been verified, though there are signs that such transmission means are possible (WHO, 2020). As people gain more knowledge about the disease, the prognosis for the majority of patients infected by COVID-19 has been relatively promising, but the prognosis for a small number of patients in critical conditions, especially seniors and patients with chronic diseases, are less optimal (Zhu et al.,2020) . The enclosed management model employed at most psychiatric hospitals represents a daunting challenge for effective control of infectious disease and thwarting outbreaks within institutions. The Fourth People's Hospital of Chengdu is the ninth most influential hospital in terms of scientific research and one of the largest psychiatric medical care centres in southwest China. We propose the following suggestions and strategies for psychiatric hospitals during the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic. At present, COVID-19 symptoms mainly include fever, dry cough, and fatigue, but some infected patients may not show any symptoms. Therefore, preliminary screening, pre-examination and triage, and fever clinic management at psychiatric hospitals are particularly crucial. Medical care staff should earnestly document patient information such as name, gender, age, job, home address details and phone number. In case of possible violent behaviors exhibited by psychiatric patients, security personnel should be garrisoned at clinic zones to maintain order. All staff at the clinic should be equipped with the appropriate protective equipment. Signs should be posted to remind patients to protect their respiratory system and frequently wash hands. During the epidemic period, patients who match critical psychiatric illness standards and who are considered as potential carriers of COVID-19 shall be kept within the infection quarantine ward to receive treatment according to potential virus carrier protocol. For patients who match critical psychiatric illness standards but are not considered as potential carriers of COVID-19, they should be kept within the psychiatric transition and observation ward for 14 days, as per clinic and emergency room protocol, before being transferred to a regular ward when relevant conditions are met.",14.370088145555911,6.048245335516979

The first factor relates to concerns regarding the inefficiency of the peer review process [2]. It can take months or even years to publish an article presenting research findings. Most conventional journals determine whether to publish an article or to require further revisions through a peer review process, which involves evaluation of an article by two or three peer reviewers (researchers who are working in similar fields), revision by the author, and further assessment after the revision in order to ensure ethical and scientific reliability. Hence, it is inevitable for the peer review process to take considerable time. In situations like the Ebola, Zika, and COVID-19 outbreaks, early and transparent dissemination of research findings may lead to more expedited prevention and treatment efforts [3]. Traditional peer review is not compatible with the time constraints imposed by such circumstances, and preprints can therefore be considered as a supplementary method to address these issues.",19.067564795271988,8.61422460123872

There is no shared language or methods common to all the frameworks, and none articulate the philosophical principles on which they are based. Furthermore, they emphasise global-level, technical perspectives, and tend not to consider political issues or variation in state capacity, which can run from strong to absent, as in humanitarian settings. This is limiting, and sometimes becomes problematic. A main limitation is that the frameworks explain only the part of nutrition governance on which they are focused, but do not illuminate the larger landscape. Additionally, the lack of a philosophical basis means that they have difficulty explaining their priorities or defending their boundaries, should the need arise. For instance, the frameworks by Morris et al and Mejía Acosta and Fanzo do not include participation or transparency among their central elements. This choice may reflect that the dominant historical problem in undernutrition is inadequate food, and in this perspective the most basic citizen view can be presumed—the demand for more food. It may also reflect a strong focus on the multilateral architecture of aid, which tends to neglect crucial factors such as domestic political commitment. A full-text search of the Sacks et al framework article does not find a single mention of either ‘cooperation’ or ‘coordination’.

As of February 16, there were 29 COVID-19 patients in Korea, placing Korea in fifth place internationally in terms of the number of COVID-19 patients, after China, Singapore (72 patients), Japan (53 patients), and Thailand (34 patients). Deaths have almost exclusively occurred in China (1666 patients; 3.3%), rather than outside China (3 patients; 0.4%). The discrepancy in the death rate between China and other countries might be due to differences in the disease manifestation of COVID-19 pneumonia or in other countries' capacity to manage a limited number of cases, in contrast to the overwhelming numbers of cases in China.",18.111015878084597,7.687738360650494

Firstly, rapid urbanisation and industrialisation and changing patterns of interactions between people and pathogens have altered the pattern of infectious diseases,15 a feature of the covid-2019 outbreak. Geographical disparities raise questions around access to healthcare, other medical and educational resources, public health programmes, and infrastructure in rural and remote areas. Not surprisingly, the western regions of China with poor resources and a special geographical environment and culture face a burden from multiple infectious diseases, with Qinghai, Tibet, and Xinjiang having higher incidence of vaccine preventable diseases, bacterial infections, and sexually transmitted diseases and bloodborne infections. However, the epidemiological characteristics of infectious diseases are also affected by densely populated urban regions,55 which might contribute to higher rates of sexually transmitted diseases and viral gastrointestinal infections, at least in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai. Different factors apply in rural and remote areas, where livestock based lifestyles increase the risk of zoonotic infections and where climate might be an additional factor, particularly for vectorborne diseases. Seasonal variation in infectious diseases, with the example of peaks of influenza and rubella, measles, and scarlet fever in winter and spring suggests the high vulnerability of Chinese children to infections transmitted by aerosol droplets. Furthermore, the rapid increase in HIV/AIDS, especially in adolescent males, requires a much wider set of social and educational responses than for less sensitive behaviours and stigmatised diseases. The resurgence of some diseases that were previously under control (eg, scarlet fever, mumps, syphilis, and brucellosis) and imported cases (eg, Zika virus infection, Rift Valley fever, yellow fever, and Ebola) have put greater pressure on the public health system, as has been seen with the current covid-2019 outbreak that began in Hubei province, China. Although in most cases of covid-19, mortality appears to be higher in older people,10 although the immediate impact of this on children and adolescents is nonetheless immense. A global pandemic of covid-19 could bring about multiple impacts, such as economic recession, food crisis, price fluctuations, constraints on resources, which will have immediate or indirect negative effects on children in the near or long term. In addition, the exact impact has not yet been determined in further studies, but there could be physical and psychological effects on children who have been deprived of concentrated effort of care as a result of the guardian’s illness, which need further studies post-covid-19.",18.028070956309566,6.816591705419347

This is because emergency victims often face geographical isolation as a result of damage to local infrastructure such as energy, road and communication facilities.5 Consequently, the arrival of external rescue support may experience two or more days of delay.6 But rescue efforts in the first couple of days in disastrous events are critical.7 Community and household preparedness in self-rescue efforts prior to the arrival of external assistance may result in the difference between the chance of survival and death.8 Empirical evidence shows that sufficient household preparedness can significantly mitigate the negative consequences of emergency events.9

Better reagent polymerases have been developed from thermophilic DNA-dependent DNA polymerases by adapting their catalytic activity to function with RNA templates (39–41), or derived from existing RT polymerase by genetic engineering (42). Though the derived enzymes have the beneficial quality of lower base mis-incorporation due to higher accuracy for substrate selection (39), their indel fidelity remains to be explored.",8.838807507189925,5.1256747070366995

In Australia, for example, bush fires impose a regular risk for many households. The preparedness of individual households can make a difference between life and death. The National Partnership Agreement on Natural Disaster Resilience in Australia therefore emphasises the significance of involving multiple parties including individuals.41 Emergency response systems are often complex and adaptive. A highly participatory strategy would encourage individuals to take more responsibility, become less dependent on the government and leave more resources for others.42 Trust in the government is important given that it is most likely to play a coordinating role in emergency events.43 However, over-reliance on the government and professional workers could dampen household efforts for future disasters.44 A study of postearthquake survivors in China showed that high expectations of the public on the government are associated with high trust in the government, leading to increased complacency in individual efforts in preparedness.16 In China, governmental response to disasters from the military force has often been extraordinarily rapid and efficient. For example, an earthquake-relief headquarter was established by the army 18 min after the earthquake strike in Ya’an and 5000–6000 rescue workers were deployed on the same day but people need to realise that there is always a gap before the full functioning of external rescue assistance, a gap which needs to be filled by the survivors of disasters.7 Poor cooperation from those being rescued can also jeopardise professional efforts.",7.4940753318129865,4.573035234018228

About one-third of the world population is currently under lockdown to arrest the spread of this highly infectious disease. COVID-19 is caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, for which there is no specific medication or vaccine approved by medical authorities yet. This disease is transmitted by inhalation or contact with infected droplets or fomites, and the incubation period may range from 2 to 14 days [1] . Though the overall fatality rate is estimated to range from 2 to 3%, the disease can be fatal to elderly people (about 27% for 60+ age groups) and those with an underlying medical history.
