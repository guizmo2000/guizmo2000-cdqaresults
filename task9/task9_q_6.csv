The past decade has seen significant growth in studies concerning the interaction of media, human behaviour and infectious disease dynamics, and there now exists a substantial body of work on this topic [2, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Despite this growth, empirical studies of prevalence elastic behaviour due to mass media have until recently been difficult due to the lack of availability of data directly measuring media engagement and relating it to behavioural change. As such, the vast majority of studies in this area can be broadly classified into two groups, with slightly different motivations. First, pure mathematical models of behavioural change, in which a model is formulated that accounts for how dynamics are influenced by disease awareness or prevalence, typically facilitated through media-these are often either in the form of introducing new states which account for the behavioural status of individuals [15] , by allowing modification to the contact structure [3, 16] , or by allowing modification to the model parameters [17, 18] -and the consequences are then explored. Collinson et al. [13] model behavioural change due to media by explicitly including a compartment for individuals influenced by mass media into an SEIR-type model, also incorporating effects like vaccination and social distancing [13] . This study is of particular interest due to the fact that it incorporates a 'media fatigue' effect during the 2009/2010 H1N1 pandemic by fitting to news report data collected from newspaper homepages during the pandemic. Second, pure statistical models of media and prevalence are used on large datasets to produce statistical regression models relating some measure of volume of media concerning epidemics to the prevalence of infection [9, 10] or reproductive number [19] . Such models have recently become popular due to the rapid increase in new data streams coming from Internet and online social media usage [20, 21] . The study of Signorini et al. [11] is an exception to this trend: while it is a pure statistical model, it includes an investigation of the relationship between 'tweets' on Twitter and public sentiment with respect to H1N1 [11] . The FluOutlook platform [14] is also particularly interesting; by using a variety of data sources, including Twitter, to initialize a global agent-based epidemiological model it is able to produce real-time forecasts of an evolving influenza season.",22.885529601518684,8.599837751071185

Modification to the effective transmission rate is via a so-called media function. Three distinct media functions have been introduced, and recently compared, in the literature [22] . A potential criticism of pure mathematical model-based studies, as described above, is that the usefulness of the model when analysing real data is uncertain. In fact, as we will show here, some of these models have only very limited use in describing data coming from historical influenza outbreaks. On the other hand, while pure statistical models of media and prevalence are potentially of use for detecting and tracking disease incidence, they are subject to typical criticisms of 'big data' analyses [23] as containing biases and tending towards overfitting.

When incorporated into a deterministic SEEIIR model, this media function describes incidence data better than a model without media effects, and better than previously proposed media functions. We observed a relationship between outbreak size and media awareness, with a quadratic model becoming more likely as the final size of the outbreak increased. This suggests that the relationship between media coverage and infection rates is nonlinear, especially in more severe seasons. Future extensions to the media function could incorporate extra reductions in disease transmission due to factors such as early media coverage, pre-existing immunity or seasonality. Public awareness campaigns could lead to an increase in early-season social media activity and sharing of news articles, and could be implemented in the current model via a time lag. Indeed, we observed such an effect for the 2014/2015 season, where changes in retweeting activity preceded ILI rates by a number of weeks. Mass media campaigns have been shown to increase flu-related hospital visits [ [34, 35] . It is further possible that any potential reduction in transmission in one season due to the effects of mass media could decrease pre-existing immunity for the next season, an effect which could be modelled by conditioning the media function on the total amount of media engagement from the previous season. Identifying any such potential process is of course confounded by the presence of multiple influenza strains circulating in any particular season with differing levels of pre-exisitng immunity; modelling such a hierarchy of time-lagged effects requires a more sophisticated strategy and is left for future work.",18.051355336690165,8.45761044333823

They do not happen in a vacuum but are influenced by social norms, cultural values and political agendas. This implies that scholarly rumours can be reflections and, moreover, reinforcers of social realities. The norms and values of a culture can be drivers and subjects of scholarly rumours. Scholarliness can, hence, be misused as a tool in daily social and political games. The scholarly language can be spoken to gain social sympathy. A concern is that, when scholarly rumours are well incorporated into the surroundings, they then become 'naturalised' and hidden in the landscape (Bernardi et al. 2012) , resulting in neglect of the politics exercised by them. Scholarly rumours can be implicitly objectified in, and 'wrapped' into, social media, penetrating the social fabric and moving across generations. If scholarly rumours are documented and written down, they act as archives and therefore spaces in which certain kinds of power are codified and justified. With these observations in mind, it would be politically naïve to attempt to conceptualise scholarly rumours in isolation from the political intentions behind them. To interpret and discuss scholarly rumours as isolated elements is to risk treating them as being outside the social fabric. It is therefore well worth considering both the 'culturalisation' of scholarly rumours and the 'rumourisation' of cultures.",27.923452959522546,14.062838555497656

The HASI-P is a validated 33-item scale that measures stigma among HIV/AIDS patients in the past 3 months [43] . This instrument was validated among HIV/AIDS patients in five African countries: Lesotho, Malawi, South Africa, Swaziland and Tanzania. It consists of the following subscales and this includes verbal abuse (eight items, α = 0.886); healthcare neglect (seven items, α = 0.832); social isolation (five items, α = 0.890); fear of contagion (six items, α = 0.795); and workplace stigma (two items, α = 0.758) all of which measures enacted stigma. The final subscale called negative selfperception (five items, α = 0.906) measures internalised stigma [43] . We decided to use HIV/AIDS related stigma scale (HASI-P) because HIV/AIDS patients share similar psychosocial challenges with EVD survivors in terms of social isolation, fear of contagion and family and community stigma and discrimination [44] . In addition, there is widespread misinformation about HIV/AIDS and EVD. For instance, EVD and HIV/AIDS only affects certain groups of people in society (the poor for EVD and promiscuous adults or homosexuals for HIV/AIDS) and the unfounded community fear of being infected with the virus through means that have not being scientifically proven [44] . To adapt to our setting, the HASI-P was reviewed by two experts in sociology and EVD as well as piloted among 10 EVD survivors. Based on their feedback, we decided to remove the two items that measure workplace stigma since the majority of EVD survivors did not have any paid job before or after EVD. We also removed the statement ""At the hospital, I was left in soiled bed"" from the healthcare neglect subscale since majority of survivors were not admitted at the clinic/hospital. In addition, the wording of some statements were changed to fit the local EVD survivorship context. Further, we decided to assess stigma experienced by EVD survivors since their discharged from Ebola treatment centre instead of the past 3 months, as was the case when the instrument was validated among HIV/AIDS patients [43] .

That points to the necessity of using a full arsenal of tools and technologies to improve IPC interventions globally [28] . In recent times, trends in infectious diseases have become detectable in populations via the Internet and social media; they function as new and available sources of health-related data [29, 30] . This ability of the Internet and social media was further illustrated in a study of distribution of emojis used on Twitter around the world [31] . The aforementioned study indicated that South-Eastern Asia and South America had the highest, while the USA and Japan had the lowest rates of using emojis on Twitter. It has also been possible to detect the emojis used most often by various countries; based on the results of this study, developed countries used less face emojis than developing countries. It was further concluded that emojis could reflect the living conditions of different counties around the world using correlation analyses between emoji distribution and world development indicators including life expectancy, tax rate, trade, and gross domestic product per capita. According to another study by Kim et al. [32] , policy makers should benefit from online information including emoticons along with proven scientific data, since these symbols can represent public feelings like frustration about an infectious disease such as H1N1. Emoticons and Internet slang were also targeted in the process of extracting emotional contents from social media regarding public reaction to the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome in Korea in 2015 [33] . Pointing out the impact of an infectious disease outbreak on public emotions, it was suggested that understanding interactions between a disease, mass media and public emotions might be effective to avoid from excessive fear and overreactions to infectious diseases. Conceivably, by using digital surveillance with the Internet, disease outbreaks could be detected earlier in every part of the world, providing an opportunity to react more quickly [34, 35] .",24.870954738817137,11.46933779256198

Stigma can lead to experiences and feelings of blame, shame, worthlessness, loneliness, isolation, social exclusion and discrimination in accessing social amenities and healthcare services [8, 9] . Socially undesirable manifestations (prejudice and discrimination) expressed against those with the stigmatizing attributes are known as enacted stigma whereas the feeling of shame, guilt or worthlessness experienced as a result of having the stigmatising attribute is referred to as internalised stigma [10] . EVD-related stigma is largely based on community fear that EVD survivors are still contagious [11] . Such fear is profound if EVD survivors experience post-Ebola sequelae [12, 13] or are aware that the Ebola virus can be present in certain immune-protective parts of the body after convalescence (for example, the semen, breast milk, ocular (eye) fluid, and spinal column fluid) [14, 15] . EVD-related stigma has led to EVD survivors being mocked by their communities [16, 17] , being evicted from their homes by their property owners [13, 17] , losing their former jobs [11] and being divorced by their spouses [12, 13] . Some EVD survivors have been prevented from visiting public places such as public toilets and have experienced difficulty in trading commodities at their local market due to a community reluctance to touch their items or money [12, 13] . EVD-related stigma has been reported by EVD survivors and their communities in DR Congo (35%), Guinea (26%) and Liberia (3%) [18] [19] [20] , and may be more common among female rather than male EVD survivors [12] . Other factors, which have been reported as predictors of EVD-related stigma, are age, level of education, and having accessed medical care [21] . Liberian research also suggests EVD survivors are reported to be more likely to experience stigma compared to their close contacts who were not infected with EVD virus [22] however the degree of EVD-related stigma may decline among survivors over time [21, 23] . In Sierra Leone, stigmatisation is reported in approximately one third of EVD survivors [24, 25] .",25.531397365404572,11.023789860810531

One key finding from our study is that EVD survivors report high levels of internalised and enacted stigma since discharge from an Ebola treatment centre which is in line with findings from a longitudinal Liberian study that reported high levels of stigma at baseline but lower levels at subsequent follow-up visits [21, 23] . Our finding also resonates with similar short term and smaller sample size cross-sectional studies in Sierra Leone [24, 25, 48] , Liberia [20] , Guinea [49] , and DR Congo [19, 40] ,which reported that EVD survivors experience several forms of internalised and enacted stigma. Our result identifies higher occurrence of internalised stigma when compared with the occurrence of total enacted stigma experienced by EVD survivors. Our result contrasts to findings reported in a Liberian longitudinal cohort study that employed a different stigma instrument [23] but is in line with a South African study that employed the same stigma tool to measure stigma among HIV/AIDS patients to that employed in our study [50] . The higher frequency of internalised stigma (negative self-perception) among EVD survivors in our study is a cause for concern and warrants further research attention as it can lead to low self-esteem, low self-efficacy, loss of hope for the future and can interfere with life goal achievement [51] . The findings for EVD studies appear to be similar to some other infectious diseases. For example, similar sequelae have been reported among HIV/AIDS patients in Hong Kong [52] and Uganda [53] , in which HIV/ AIDS patients reported to feel less worthy of themselves, guilt, shame and self-blame for having HIV/AIDS. The common types of enacted stigma faced by EVD survivors in our study were social isolation, verbal abuse and fear of contagion, all of which are congruent with the common forms of stigma reported by EVD survivors in the wider literature [6] . These findings may be applicable to other emerging infectious disease survivors more generally, as similar forms of stigma from the public and healthcare staff have also been reported among SARS survivors in Hong Kong [54] . Social isolation, verbal abuse and fear of contagion can lead to increased levels of psychological distress, delayed access to medical care, low adherence to medical therapy and reduced quality of life as it has also been reported among HIV/AIDS and mental health patients [55, 56] . Drawing from lessons learnt from HIV/AIDS-related stigma, several EVD survivor-centred and community-driven strategies have been suggested that could contribute to EVD survivors' recovery and community re-integration. These include community long-term psychosocial counselling for EVD survivors to enhance their coping skills, community education and social support programs for EVD survivors, recruitment and training of trusted opinion leaders that can spread accurate de-stigmatising messages within communities, minimising social isolation and promoting economic empowerment of EVD survivors and EVD affected communities [44, 57] . The mental health impact of surviving Ebola is enormous, and previous studies have reported that psychological distress, anxiety and depression are widespread among Ebola survivors [4, 6] . Although the impact of Ebola -related stigma on mental illness among Ebola survivors is not well understood, stigma induced psychological distress and anxiety have been found to be associated with adverse mental health outcome among HIV/ AIDS patients [58] . Since HIV/AIDS and Ebola virus disease share similar stigmatizing attributes [44] , it is possible that Ebola -related stigma maybe contributing to the mental health complications among Ebola survivors. Thus, it likely that stigma reduction strategies will help reduce the mental health burden among EVD survivors.",26.468870281432515,10.7496533242256

It was also recommended that utilization of social media improves hand hygiene programs by providing a safe environment that enables public awareness and includes patient participation. The aforementioned results are consistent with previously performed studies describing the emotional content that is available on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media sites as ""contagious"" [52, 53] . Therefore, health-related interventions could also be influenced by the emotional cascade effect from one person to others, leading to improved efficacy and increased costeffectiveness of medical interventions [53] .

Social Impacts. SARS caused a very large impact on society, particularly in China. During the early period of the SARS outbreak, tension surged in the community. Due to a lack of trustworthy official information, folk tales about the epidemic situation spread through word of mouth, mobile phone short messages, social media transmission, and other ways. The spread of all kinds of rumors exacerbated the spread of social panic, reflected in an escalation of panic buying of drugs in Guangdong province [9] . One rumor was that Banlangen (Radix isatidis) and vinegar could prevent and control SARS, but whether they were effective for SARS was not scientifically established at this time. In early January 2003, the first wave to purchase antiviral drugs occurred in Heyuan city. After half a month, the drug purchasing spree had spread to Zhongshan city; then the buying spree gradually spread through Guangdong province [10, 11] , as mentioned by a community resident:",23.59968451219048,8.792232783586146

The act of cleaning hands could be only demonstrated using a sequence of any of the existing hand emojis with the ""bar of soap"" ( ) emoji, which makes communication more complicated than using a single emoji. For example, some people may interpret the combination of the ""clapping hands"" and ""bar of soap"" ( ) emojis as applauding the use of soap and it may not directly demonstrate hand washing with soap. The development of hand hygiene-related emojis will enable health professionals to communicate more specifically regarding their discoveries and concerns in this field. In addition, the hand hygiene compliance of different places in the world could be better notified by detecting relevant emojis in the social media to predict compliance or even identify problems caused by low adherence.

As of June 10, 2015, amid the MERS epidemic, people were isolated in 17 cities nationwide. There were nearly 500 people in isolation in areas where there was a major outbreak, and entire villages in some areas were isolated. At that time, the number of people isolated at home reached 3,000 nationwide, and there was a trend increasing by 200 to 300 people per day. With the rapid spread of MERS into Korean society, it is likely that people who were to be isolated had fears of infection and anxiety over MERS which had over a 20% mortality rate, concern over social isolation, and anxiety over the possibility of spreading infection to family members if isolated at home. Since community health care center staff members were monitoring the state of isolation to prevent MERS spreading further, it is likely that those isolated had high levels of anxiety over the fear of their isolation becoming a stigma among their neighbors. During the MERS epidemic, 80.2% of the general public reported fear of being infected, and 46% reported emotional distress. Risk factors associated with increased rates of fear were the following: concern about public transportation use, difficulty going outside, perception that the state is not protecting the people, helplessness in situations that cannot be controlled, and fear of infection [10] .",28.991269618110245,12.157314281108713

This is exacerbated by people's reluctance to be vaccinated [28] . With more than 300 infectious diseases emerging within less than a century [29] , the threat of pandemic influenza is only the latest out of many public health threats posed by infectious diseases in a globalized world. Unlike pharmaceutical interventions, non-pharmaceutical interventions like social distancing may be effective in halting or at least mitigating an epidemic independent of the specific biology of a pathogen, and thus provide a reliable set of strategies to combat infectious diseases that warrant further attention [30] . Our results that people do not rely on social networking tools to the extent that they rely on other media may have implications for CDC strategies for spreading public health information via social media [19] . In particular, public health messages spread via social media will need to backed up by information spread via more traditional channels, which respondents list as being common sources of trusted information on the outbreak. Our study is subject to a number of weaknesses. The advantage of our internet-based sampling strategy is the ability to quickly deploy a survey and thereby track responses in near real-time. The clear disadvantage of this strategy is a sacrifice of population representativeness.

These biases clearly limit the generality of our results, but the large number of respondents filing out the survey as information on the potential pandemic changed nonetheless provides a uniquely valuable data source.

In general, media coverage was influenced by several factors, and only to a lesser extent by the progression of the epidemic. Although from a journalist's perspective, it may be expected that news did not necessarily follow the number of ZIKV cases, such result highlight the limitations of several behavioral epidemic models that incorporate media effects. Indeed, choices made by journalists regarding newsworthiness of specific aspects related to ZIKV infection affected the level of knowledge and familiarity in the US population [39] . Also, the media narrative around ZIKV evolved over time, as found in a recent study by Yotam Ophir [40] . The content of the ZIKV news coverage shifted from focusing on scientific themes, at the beginning of the outbreak, to the description of social disruptions during the Summer Olympics. Since we did not examine the textual content of news items in our dataset, further research should identify specific themes emerging from media outlets that are most significantly associated to Wikipedia viewership during epidemic outbreaks. Also, we relied on the automatic tagging system provided by GDELT to identify news items mentioning Zika. However, the classification algorithm may have limitations and some items could be less relevant than others. Further research should assess the quality of the GDELT news tagging algorithm in the specific case of epidemic outbreaks [41] . Another limitation of our analysis is that we considered the content of mass media outlets only, and did not look into other news sources, such as online social networks. However, social media often provide an amplification channel for traditional media sources and online users consume information that is not very different from what appears on mass meda [42] .",23.849781417513547,10.018638920071353

In the scenario, the new system picks up a post on Facebook from Bob, a 25-year-old high school teacher from Sydney. His post suggests that he may have contracted highly pathogenic avian influenza on a recent holiday to Indonesia. Online discussion of symptoms and work absences also suggests that Bob might have spread the infection to several of his colleagues. Delphi participants proposed a number of responses to this scenario. While the mandate to respond to a potential public health risk was seen to be clear, Delphi panellists disagreed about how to do this and how to contact those most at risk (particularly Bob and his colleagues). After reading each other's comments and suggestions on the merits and risks of different strategies for addressing this acute situation, in rounds 2 and 3 we asked the panel to nominate which approach to contacting Bob they thought was the most appropriate. Figure 1 shows that, while a direct approach (speaking to Bob in person) was strongly favoured, a majority of panel members questioned the acceptability of using a social media platform for this communication, even though Bob had posted information about his health status in a public forum. Others were concerned that an online intervention could create panic by identifying Bob as a public health risk. As one panellist noted: DP #12: ""Where individuals have already disclosed information themselves, then one can make a reasonable assertion that the information is therefore not private.

As an example, a meta-analysis showed that perceived risk likelihood and severity judgements predict vaccination behavior and that the relationship was stronger with better measures of perceived risk [4] . Precautionary behavior may also be influenced by the perceived costs and benefits of such behavior [8, 9] , and the perceived impact of an individual's behavior on other individual's health outcomes [10] . Consequently, when predictors of precautionary behaviors, such as perceived risks and benefits change over time, we might expect the precautionary behavior to follow suite. An unexpected outbreak of infectious disease provides an opportunity to examine how new information affects risk perceptions and, hence, how changes in risk perceptions influence behavior.

For some seasonal drivers, such as seasonal changes in host immunity, we would, however, still be tasked with understanding the mechanism of action within the host. The effects of seasonal drivers are multi-layered. To better understand seasonality, we must work at multiple organizational levels of science. Geophysical factors, host population ecology, and within-host biology will need to be integrated in the practice of studying seasonality. As previously mentioned, many infectious diseases, which might differ greatly in multiple aspects of their biology, can share the same seasonal driver(s). An immediate way to advance the field of disease seasonality is to leverage the rich weekly and/or monthly datasets available for notifiable diseases and combine them with models and data on potential drivers. By coupling models and data, hypothesis testing can be done to assess seasonal drivers and their modes of action. These data and models can be applied to multiple disease systems in parallel. For instance, parallel study of the seasonal drivers of (a) flu, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), bacterial pneumonia, and pertussis, or (b) polio, typhoid, and rotavirus, or (c) Zika, dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever would be a logical start. Uncovering the mechanisms of seasonality for disease systems would empower the public health community to better control infection. This sentiment was shared in 1949 by polio epidemiologist H. Gear, who wrote: ""It must be admitted that the reasons for the seasonal incidence of poliomyelitis remain obscure. When they have been elucidated perhaps much of the epidemiology of this disease will be solved"" [100] . ",15.736716834251936,7.915716589133639

Relevant host phenology includes, but is not limited to, seasonal changes in reproduction, seasonal restructuring of immunity, cycles of metabolism and body condition, hibernation, and migration. Phenology is not only a feature of hosts but also of reservoirs, vectors, and some parasites themselves (particularly helminths). Unlike environmental drivers and host behavior, which can affect diseases dynamics by (i) seasonally forcing transmission in hosts, reservoirs, and vectors, phenology can drive seasonality via additional mechanisms of action, which include the modulation of (ii) susceptible recruitment (via reproduction), (iii) susceptibility to infection, (iv) infectiousness, (v) the recovery rate, (vi) the mortality rate (both natural and disease-induced), and (vii) symptomatology and/or pathology. Each of the seven mechanisms of action could leave a unique imprint in long-term incidence data, as proposed in [94] . These mechanisms and their drivers, therefore, would have different consequences for disease dynamics. Using models, such as that schematized in Fig 1, statistical inference and simulation studies could be conducted to identify the dynamical effects of various seasonal mechanisms acting in isolation and/or in combination. Simulation studies could provide a foundation for determining the types of data required for distinguishing among seasonal mechanisms and/or drivers and how factors such as resonance can influence the ability to detect seasonal drivers. For example, Martinez-Bakker and colleagues [94] used a simulation study to demonstrate the demographic and transmission regimes under which human birth seasonality is expected to have a meaningful impact on measles incidence in the face of strong seasonal forcing from transmission during school terms.",16.657406705832113,7.4453057829295295

But this presumption was profoundly challenged by the emergence of social media. For instance, Leung and Nicoll argued that the 2009 H1N1 pandemic was the first pandemic in which social media ""challenged conventional public health communication"" [35] . In China, online messages were published ahead of the official statement in the 2008 Sichuan Earthquake [36] . Social media enabled people under crisis to share information and experience and to seek message credibility and confirmation via multiple media platforms and social networks [34] . Our study demonstrated that official data released by health authorities, whether in Beijing or Geneva, received strong reactions in the Chinese online community.

Methods: Keyword searches were performed in Weibo data collected by The University of Hong Kong's Weiboscope project.

Knowledge management theory has the potential to support research into problems such as HIV, antibiotic resistance and others, particularly in terms of aspects of scientific research related to the contribution of social science. To date, however, these challenges remain with us, and theoretical contributions that can complement natural science efforts to eradicate these problems are needed. This paper seeks to offer a theoretical contribution grounded in Kuhn's paradigm theory of innovation, and in the argument by Lakatos that scientific research can be fundamentally non-innovative, which suggests that social science aspects of knowledge creation may hold the key to more effective biomedical innovation. Given the consequences of ongoing and emerging global crises, and the failure of knowledge systems of scientific research to solve such problems outright, this paper provides a review of theory and literature arguing for a new paradigm in scientific research, based on the development of global systems to maximise research collaborations. A global systems approach effectively includes social science theory development as an important complement to the natural sciences research process. Arguably, information technology and social media technology have developed to the point at which solutions to knowledge aggregation challenges can enable solutions to knowledge problems on a scale hitherto unimaginable. Expert and non-expert crowdsourced inputs can enable problem-solving through exponentially increasing problem-solving inputs, using the 'crowd,' thereby increasing collaborations dramatically. It is argued that these developments herald a new era of participatory research, or a democratisation of research, which offers new hope for solving global social problems. This paper seeks to contribute to this end, and to the recognition of the important role of social theory in the scientific research process.",21.326052019350406,7.6513790010397

However, at the same time, Tweets are primarily shared among contacts that 'follow' each other, which defines local information. In addition, Facebook contacts are not necessarily close in a geographical sense, such that 'local' relates more to the possibility of clustering, moving beyond geography.

U.S. Federal health agencies are leveraging these platforms to 'engage' social media users to read, spread, promote and encourage health related discussions. However, different agencies and their communications get varying levels of engagement. In this study we use statistical models to identify factors that associate with engagement.

We use the hurdle regression model to identify factors associated with the level of engagement and Cox proportional hazards model to identify factors associated with duration of engagement. Results: In our analysis we find that agencies and accounts vary widely in their usage of social media and activity they generate. Statistical analysis shows, for instance, that Facebook posts with more visual cues such as photos or videos or those which express positive sentiment generate more engagement. We further find that posts on certain topics such as occupation or organizations negatively affect the duration of engagement.

It too was plagued by conspiracy theories, rumours, and misinformation for many years, with the effects still visible in regions to this day. Many people continue to argue that HIV does not exist, or cause AIDS, and that its therapies are toxic to human health. All the arguments proposed by these deniers have been rebuked through a multitude of scientific publications and debate. Yet, they continue to persist. The influence of these false arguments can be so infectious that it can influence governmental policy, which has the potential to be fatal. This was particularly highlighted by the Mbeki South African government's denialism of HIV in the early 2000s and their infamous rejection of the evidence surrounding the efficacy of HIV medication. In turn, thousands of mothers were denied access to antiretroviral therapies. Instead, the government promoted the unsubstantiated use of herbal remedies including garlic, beetroot, and lemon juice for AIDS treatment [2] , leading to unnecessary HIV transmission, especially to children from pregnant mothers. This costs more than 300,000 lives [3] . It is important that we learn from past mistakes, and the media has a large role to play in this. It seems in a bid to increase viewership, major media organisations are creating dramatic headlines but are instead inciting panic amongst the public.

In a meta-analysis of 21 studies, public stigma towards HIV/ AIDS is the greatest compared to genital herpes, hepatitis, drug abuse and cancer. 10 The high level of stigma towards PLHIV can be due to several causes. First, a high level of self-responsibility is attached to HIV as the acquisition of HIV is due to behaviours that can be preventable, such as unsafe sex and needle sharing. 11, 12 Some behaviours associated with HIV, such as same-sex behaviours, are also considered immoral and are thus condemned by the society. 5 Misconceptions about HIV transmission routes and overestimation of the perceived contagiousness and risks through casual contact further evoke stigmatization towards HIV. 12 These cause an intensive level of blame and disapproval against PLHIV, resulting in social rejection, discrimination and prejudice. 13, 14 It is contended that stigma against PLHIV is even more intense in the Chinese context, as the behaviours related to HIV infection, such as same-sex behaviours, multiple sex partnership and injecting drug use, are generally perceived as defying acceptable social norms and culture. [15] [16] [17] High level of ignorance, misconception and fear of HIV also contribute to the high level of stigma towards PLHIV in the Chinese context. 18, 19 Furthermore, face concern, which refers to social image and social worth that are garnered based on one's performance in an interpersonal context, is particularly important in the Chinese society. 20, 21 Yang and Kleinman 22 proposed that while the concept of ""face"" represents social power, capital and a person's value in society, PLHIV experiences loss of face as a result of violation to cultural norms, which greatly affects their access to social capital and closely parallels how stigma works in Chinese society. In Hong Kong, studies have documented a high level of unfavourable attitudes and stigmatizing behaviours towards PLHIV. For example, a population-based study among Hong Kong adults reported that nearly half of them exhibited discriminatory attitudes towards PLHIV. 23 A comparative study on the public's attitude towards different types of infectious diseases have shown that the level of public stigma towards HIV was the highest compared to other infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and tuberculosis (TB). 24 PLHIV are also disadvantaged in terms of economic and social opportunities. For example, a local study reported that 20% of the studied companies would dismiss an employee if he or she was HIV+, and only a few companies indicated that they would provide counselling and support to an HIV+ employee. 25 Comparative study on employer attitudes towards PLHIV in Beijing, Hong Kong and Chicago revealed the trend of reluctance to hire PLHIV are most pronounced among employers from Beijing and Hong Kong. 26 Study among PLHIV in Hong Kong has also shown that over 50% felt that they were discriminated in different settings such as in the workplace and in social relationships. 27 HIV stigma poses a significant impediment to public health across the globe and a key obstacle to HIV treatment, prevention, care and support. 28, 29 It is noticeable that many PLHIV have internalized the negative labels attached to them and experienced a high level of selfstigma. In one study among 322 PLHIV in China, 78% of them had the feeling of negative worth and 58% of them were unwilling to disclose their HIV status. 30 It is also reported that the level of internalized stigma was similar between PLHIV diagnosed less than 1 year ago and more than 1 year, indicating that level of self-stigma did not reduce across time. 31 Self-stigma is significantly associated with various negative outcomes such as worse psychosocial well-being, 32 showed that attribution of perceived controllability of the disease, personal responsibility to the cause of the illness and self-blame was significantly associated with higher levels of self-stigma. 45, 46 However, one local study looking at factors associated with self-stigmatization using the attribution model for PLHIV, including self-blame, responsibility for contacting HIV and internal controllability for contracting HIV, showed that although attributions of control predicted attributions of responsibility which, in turn, predicted self-blame, the linkage between self-blame and self-stigma was not significant. 47 Other factors have also been proposed. Recent studies in adults living with HIV have found that optimism predicts lower levels of HIV-related stigma indirectly through increasing psychological well-being 32 and also that personal meaning predicts lower level of HIV-related stigma indirectly through increasing social support. 48 These mechanisms have not been explored in the local context. Furthermore, mass media has often been used to shape public attitudes and knowledge about HIV. It has been suggested that Chinese individuals are more likely to obtain HIV information from mass media than from interpersonal sources. 49 A content analysis of articles about HIV published in Chinese newspapers over a decade revealed that individuals who contracted HIV through socially unacceptable means were devalued as non-descript members of a deviant and dangerous group. 50 However, from our understanding, how mass media might lead to self-stigma among PLHIV in the Chinese context has not been examined.",27.847978371170257,12.422189676985624

While public stigma is the reaction that the general population has to the individuals who are considered different, self-stigma occurs when ""people with devalued status who internalize the discriminatory beliefs and experience diminished selfesteem and self-efficacy"". 7 Corrigan suggested that both public stigma and self-stigma comprise three components: stereotype (negative belief about the group/self), prejudice (agreement with belief and/or negative emotional reaction) and discrimination (behaviour response to prejudice). 8 Self-stigma has further been explained by the cognitiveaffective-behavioural model. 9 According to the model, the stigmatized individuals perceive their stigmatized identity as a burden and taint of their life, which lead to negative sense of self (self-stigmatizing cognitions). Such conceptions might lead to a myriad of negative affective responses, encompassing feelings of anger, fear and shame (selfstigmatizing affect) which, in turn, resulting in identity concealment, social avoidance and self-denigration (self-stigmatizing behaviours).",25.70349096078356,9.421349856620411

Prodromal surveillance tools could be very timely and vital in the realm of emergency communication, advice, behavior change, hygiene and sanitation, and provide an integrated grassroots-based participatory approach. This could lead to more effective prevention, thus curbing the spread and containing the outbreak at the different levels of the disease, and at different places in time and space [3, 6] . (3)Outbreak detection systems urgently require reliable, effective, and cost-effective tools and interventions which allow for constant access to diagnostic tools and personal protective equipment in healthcare centers across the region [7] . (4)Information system-based sentinel surveillance. (5)Biosurveillance systems are used in practice to augment classical outbreak investigations. The major advantages of syndromic systems include sensitivity, timeliness, and flexibility, and being able to provide data for situational awareness. However, biosurveillance precincts lack in specificity, rely on chief complaint data, and lack formal training for users. Linking syndromic data to triage notes and medical chart data would substantially increase the value of biosurveillance in outbreak investigations and thus reduce the health burden [8, 9] . (6)Laboratory-guided detection of disease outbreak surveillance systems relies on detection and monitoring of biothreats enabled by laboratory methods of diagnosis and identifies trends in biosurveillance research. It is based on three approaches, namely: (1) laboratory-initiated infectious disease notifications, (2) SS based on health indicators, and (3) genotyping-based surveillance of biothreats. The insufficient and delayed support for biosurveillance alerts for public health users and the inadequate integration of surveillance signals into action plans remain the major barriers, and require coordination between syndromic and laboratorybased surveillance for efficient public health outbreak monitoring and response [10] . (7)Health indicator surveillance provides authorities with vital health indicators such birth rates, motility rates, and life expectancy. However, trustful and reliable information and communication, health education on preventable fatalities and cautious behavior are also required in order to prevent fear, panic and community resistance to stem out the spread of the disease outbreak. (8)Digital or electronic bio-epidemiology surveillance systems, including social media networking and web-based systems, provide valuable channels for timely collection of public health data; give information on the early detection of, and response to, disease outbreaks; and enhance situational awareness to communities. The creation of blogs and user-generated content has turned social networking into a conversation space in which everyone can participate. However in West Africa, the low level of literacy and high inequality indices compromised the usefulness of such tools to trace and map the Ebola outbreak, as compared to their usefulness and effectiveness in a community with high literacy, for example during the SARS and H9N7 influenza outbreak in Hong Kong and mainland China. Social media (e.g., Twitter, Facebook) and web-based communication provide epidemiological knowledge dissemination, and creates virtual communities based on shared values about critical outbreak perceptions, seriousness of the crisis, and population evidence-based guidance. However, it is not subject to experts or authorities' advice and assessment, and doesn't receive guidance from associated communication or information risk management and security. This requires further development and attention. The implications of social media and web-based information and communication in creating fear, anxiety and stigmatization about Ebola in some communities in West Africa are noteworthy. During this outbreak, web-based activities were also responsible for fuelling rumors that led to counter-productive behaviors. Improved communication between reliable health officials and the media, community leaders, health professionals, and the general public is necessary to reduce misinformation and improve compliance with Ebola prevention and control measures that have proven effective. These include population dynamics of emerging infections and the optimal design of monitoring and management strategies in prevention, control, and containment of Ebola in other countries in Africa [11] .",27.142220740205985,9.95767863853815

Environmental drivers such as seasonal fluctuations in rainfall, temperature, vegetation coverage or mosquito abundance will help guide surveillance and control efforts targeted mostly towards the mosquito vector and its ecology [68] . Once infection occurs, an important and unresolved question for dengue is how to best optimize the delivery of intervention strategies to reduce disease incidence, which is largely determined by R 0 . Our analysis shows that the interaction between mixing parameters and force of infection has potentially large implications for optimizing targeted intervention, particularly in countries where transmission is high and resources are scarce [69] . In fact, this may be even more important in areas of low transmission where incidence appears to be rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org J. R. Soc. Interface 12: 20150468 more focal [70] . Again, however, more attention is needed to determine the spatial and temporal resolution of appropriate intervention strategies and the effects of key covariates and model parameters [62] . Empirical understanding of the spatial scale that is most appropriate for carrying out large-scale interventions remains unknown. Once transmission has occurred in one place, understanding not only spatial heterogeneity in transmission dynamics but also their subsequent spread in mechanistic stochastic models would help to empirically determine the propagation of the disease [71] . Interest in spatial spread dynamics has risen with increasing importation of dengue into heretofore non-endemic areas due to travel and trade continentally and internationally [72] . Exploration of the case data in Pakistan that we analysed here suggests that the virus spreads along major transport routes from Lahore to Karachi and north to Rawalpindi. Using results presented here on mixing coefficients and environmental drivers will help pinpoint areas of major risk of importation more accurately, especially in the case of recurring epidemics. We explored the consequences of a spatially differentiated mixing coefficient in the context of transmission potential within this analysis. Using the fitted relationships of the environmental drivers of transmission and R 0 will enable future analyses and comparisons between diseases and geographical regions. In this context, it will be instrumental to integrate a variety of movement and social network models with the evidence presented here to infer more accurately how the geographical spread of dengue is determined.

Such shared awareness reflects the multiple and complex drivers behind health problems. In reference to the social determinants of health identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) commission (13), social drivers for integrated approaches include lack of participation, cohesion, and welfare, as well as the presence of ignorance, poverty, poor governance, inequality, violence, mental and physical illness, or high risks for these. Environmental drivers include climate change, land degradation, reduced biodiversity, and ecosystem changes rooted in both natural phenomena and human actions. Economic drivers are mostly related to the globalization process, dominated by market deregulation and financial capital, and largely irrespective of social needs at the local level (14, 15) . In this context, the capacity of nations to support public health services and welfare has been progressively eroded and the increasingly scarce resources require enhancement of inter-sectoral synergies, establishment of adequate governance structures, and effective achievement of multiple outcomes simultaneously. Human, animal, and plant populations are affected in many different ways by this process, potentially further widening the gap in human's access to health and welfare. These examples are by no means exhaustive, and there is clearly an interplay between different drivers. For example, globalized trade agreements may lead to land acquisition by large multinational companies, thereby creating land shortages for local populations who are pushed to intensified extraction of available natural resources. Increased poverty in conjunction with close contact to previously unexploited environments puts human and animal health at risk (16) . At the same time, economic crises and financial deregulation reduce public resources for interventions, thereby reinforcing negative environmental, economic, and social drivers and exacerbating negative health outcomes (17) .",19.854258272508417,8.107043102096391

The AVMA Guidelines clearly state that high concentrations of CO 2 are associated with pain, but suggest that the potential distress associated with exposure to low concentrations of CO 2 over prolonged periods of time is not well characterized. Yet, the distressing effects of prolonged exposure to low concentrations of CO 2 for rats are well documented [8] . Homeostatic regulation of blood CO 2 concentrations is critical as CO 2 alters blood pH by combining with water to form carbonic acid, and even a small change in blood pH can be fatal (for review, see [9, 10] ). Initial elevations of arterial CO 2 (i.e., hypercapnia) lead to an increase in respiration rate and tidal volume to help ""blow off"" excess CO 2 (see review [11] ), but when arterial pH continues to decrease, a feeling of dyspnea and anxiety begin to emerge. This is followed by a feeling of fear and panic with moderate hypercapnia, and sedation and loss of consciousness during severe hypercapnia. For example, exposing humans to 5% CO 2 increases respiration responses without increasing anxiety, while exposure to 7.5% CO 2 increases anxiety symptoms (e.g., self-reports of fear and panic [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] ). Exposure to 20% CO 2 induces a strong sense of suffocation (dyspnea) that is accompanied by symptoms strongly associated with panic attacks (e.g., fear of dying, shortness of breath, cardiorespiratory response [17] ). Anxiety symptoms, such as fear and panic can lead to aversion and avoidance (e.g., phobias), and although aversion/avoidance is not specific to anxiety-associated symptoms/emotions (e.g. aversion/avoidance can be related to food that can elicit disgust) [18] . In the presence of a life threatening event, panic can occur, but following the event fear and avoidance can occur.

In our second theme, trust, doubt, and fear of health workers were represented. Although all intentions were good, concerns remained about the suitability and safety of the isolation ward, the PPE, and other tools, as well as adequate engagement of colleagues who might potentially work alongside them, in case an Ebola patient came to Iceland. The foreignness of putting on, removing, and working from within a PPE and the trustworthiness of available PPE were mentioned. In preparedness efforts in other countries, scarcity of resources in relation to manpower demand and problems with training and protocols involving PPE were common challenges [35] .

Further, the ETT was established based on voluntary recruitment rather than on the staff's assigned roles within the healthcare system, a procedure that was deemed less than optimal. The members of the ETT pointed out that they had never worked together as a team under circumstances that demanded strict adherence to infectious control procedures. This eroded trust, compounded by the laissez-faire attitude of some of its members during the preparation exercises, possibly due to other competing tasks in a busy hospital and insufficient resources that hampered full participation [44] .

Figure 3 shows the classification of standard disease surveillance systems. Event-based surveillance systems are based on the organized, rapid capture, and reporting of information about outbreaks or events that can be a risk to public health [25] [26] [27] . However, rather than relying on official reports, this information is retrieved directly from witnesses of real-time events or indirectly from reports transmitted through various communication channels, such as social media, and information channels including news media and public health networks [28] . A great deal of attention from the public, and media interest, are associated with an epidemic [29, 30] . Health information monitored via the Internet and social media is a pivotal part of event-based surveillance and is most often the source emphasized by many existing surveillance systems [18] . Event-based disease surveillance systems can be classified into three main categories of news aggregators, automatic systems, and moderated systems. Moderated systems function so that information is processed by human analysts or is processed automatically before being analyzed by human analysts [31, 32] . These systems screen for epidemiological relevance of the data extracted within the information prior to being presented to the user [26] . Examples of this system include ProMED-Mail, GPHIN, GOARN, and Bio-Caster. The process by which automatic systems collect data is complex; it adds a series of steps for analysis, but differs in the levels of analysis performed as well as in the scope of information sources, language coverage, speed of delivery, and visualization methods. EpiSPIDER, Health-Map, EpiSimS, MedISys, and GETWELL are examples of automatic systems [33] [34] [35] .

There was much less agreement on the importance of different drivers of changes in infectious disease risks, presumably in part reflecting much more variability in these across different disease systems but also reflecting genuine uncertainty as to what the main drivers will be. Climate change, for example, was much more of a concern for infectious diseases in Africa than in the UK, and for 2030 rather than 2015. Similarly, economic and social factors were seen as much more important drivers for human infectious disease risk in Africa than in the UK.

These changes were sufficient to spark integration between the ICT and public health issues, leading to the rise of web-based disease surveillance systems. The first systems were regarded as pilot trials at the exploratory level, and were often based at, or in cooperation with, universities or institutions (BioCaster, HealthMap, and GETWELL), non-governmental organizations (GOARN, MedISys, and ProMED-Mail) and a few governmental agencies (EpiSPIDER and GPHIN).

Most of the web-based surveillance systems were first developed in North America, particularly the United States, with abundant infrastructure and technological resources, when integration of ICT and syndromic surveillance for early detection and response to diseases was at a preliminary phase.

English was the only language in service in the earlier systems but, subsequently, the collection and analysis of data began to be published in different languages based on the service area.

This serious epidemic created the biggest social fear in Korea. The first MERS case was identified on 20 May 2015; a 68-year-old man returning from the Middle East was diagnosed with MERS. It passed nine days after he had sought medical care. Figure 1 shows repaid spread of MERS. In Figure 1 , the X axis represents the timeline. MERS influenced not only the society but also the economic state of Korea. Amid the rapid spread of MERS, according to CNN International, (17 June 2015 in South Korea) as of 17 June 2015, the reservation of 100,000 tourist visits to the nation had been cancelled. Furthermore, according to the Minister of Strategy and Finance, South Korea's department store sales had decreased by 16 .5% as compared to the same period before 2015, and sales in retail stores also decreased by 3.4%. Risk perception toward a specific object or event may be based not only on objective or physical factors, e.g., large number of deaths, but also on subjective or constructive ones, e.g., the perceived risk from the death of one beloved person. Therefore, risk judgment is considered to be a social phenomenon. In terms of subjective views, the psychometric paradigm in risk studies suggests that lack of control, high catastrophic potential, and severe consequences account for increased risk perception and anxiety associated with dread risks [2] . With reference to MERS, Yang and Cho [3] argued that the MERS outbreak in Korea was exacerbated by inappropriate responses by major institutions. They explained that the Korean government did not deliver timely information about the status of the epidemic, hospitals' names, and response procedures related to MERS. In particular, not disclosing the information of hospitals that accommodated patients with MERS brought about unnecessary anxiety and fear among the public. Instead of the government, the Pressian, a press media organization, was the first to announce the list of hospitals accommodating MERS patients. Under such circumstances of limited information, individuals tend to depend on rumors or informal information. In particular, the public obtained inaccurate information from social media and the internet. Such unfiltered information increased the level of perceived risk of MERS, all of which amplified the dread related to this disease. Unfiltered information is closely related to rumors. Rumors amplify the perceived risk. For example, according to Jacob et al. [4] , rumors related to the Fukushima nuclear accident rapidly spread across the country border, and, once spread, they exacerbated the disaster situation. In the case of MERS, rumors such as ""Several cases were confirmed at hospitals in Suwon and Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, and the disease has been already transmitted to a number of individuals there"", ""Foreign media reports that Korea is under disaster, saying MERS will become a more serious epidemic than Ebola or SARS"", were spread [5] .

As the above examples indicate, non-state actors (including private companies, foundations and charities, NGOs, and civil society groups) can play an important role in GHD, a development which distinguishes this kind of diplomacy from the more traditional, formal negotiations between governmental representatives that characterized diplomacy historically. An additional dimension is the shift from a traditional binary or multipolar set of interactions among discrete government actors in formal settings towards a more dynamic ''networked'' approach to engagement, aided by instant communication capabilities and newly developed social media platforms and tools. Those engaging in GHD may be served well by taking these characteristics into consideration. 22 ",18.71246978136343,7.520837956392316

Describing outcomes at a given time is a mere snapshot of a dynamic process and analogous to prognostication of diabetes and its risks by using a single random blood glucose level. Extending this further, the predictions become more robust if a series of observations are made and this dynamism is incorporated into the model by using rates of change of parameters (e.g. rate of decline of IMR). Parallels are seen in systems medicine where serial analyses of the pulsatile secretion of insulin (rather than fasting insulin) was found to be an early feature of diabetes rather than a single value [28] .

Among these, studies are currently being performed on detecting infectious disease using big data such as Internet search queries [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . The Internet search data can be gathered and processed at a speed that is close to real time. According to Towers et al., Internet search data can create surveillance data faster than conventional surveillance systems [16] . For example, when Huang et al. predicted hand, foot, and mouth disease using the generalized additive model (GAM), the model that included search query data obtained the best results. As such, it has been reported that new big data surveillance tools have the advantage of being easy to access and can identify infectious disease trends before official organizations [17] . In addition to Internet search data, social media big data is also being considered. Tenkanen et al. report that social media big data is relatively easy to collect and can be used freely, which means accessibility is satisfactory and the data is created continuously in real time with rich content [18] . As such, studies have used Twitter data to predict the occurrences of mental illness [19] and infectious disease [20] [21] [22] [23] in addition to predictions in a variety of other scientific fields [24] [25] [26] [27] . In particular, a study by Shin et al. reported that infectious diseases and Twitter data are highly correlated.

The concept of Information Diet was introduced by Clay Johnson for the first time. He believes consumers should take responsibility for the type of information they consume, likewise the rational consumption of food. He also argues that there must be a sustainable news movement, like a sustainable food movement that has already started in the US. In other words, people and even governments are not capable of dealing with the media to a great extent, but people can create their own information diets, like food diet. Therefore, information consumers are advised to consume information in a limited way. However, they must demand complete and credible news, not news that is based on emotional content and full of advertisements"" (4). In the present Coronavirus crisis, some people spend most of their time studying related information regarding Covid-19 in written and virtual media; Meanwhile, they are unwilling to spend time exercising at home, talking to their families, playing with their children or doing other useful tasks such as studying, watching movies and so on. To seriously address these problems in the Coronavirus crisis, not only people must have optimum consumption of appropriate information, but also consuming information should comply with specific terms and conditions. For example, children should not be exposed to the news related to the Coronavirus, because this information increases anxiety and causes other psychological problems among them. The elderly is also vulnerable to the spread of information, and should be provided with reliable and limited information, and they should not be given the ongoing news. On the other hand, individuals should be able to distinguish between high quality and poor quality information, since much of the information regarding Covid-19 is invalid and is produced and published for economic, political, social, and in general profitable purposes (disinformation). Nowadays, in-formation is being provided every day, and by contemplating on and reviewing the publication of statistics related to the Coronavirus crisis on websites, blogs, social media, television and satellite channels etc., it can be understood that the overload of information has already occurred. Hence, providing people with all kinds of health literature is the only option. Although people may not have the ability to control the production and supply of the information nowadays, each of them must control the extent and type of the information which they consume. Therefore, in order to achieve a comprehensive information diet in societies, people need to be equipped with the knowledge and skills of health information literacy, media health literacy, media literacy and health literacy. Currently these trainings can only be delivered through the mass media. Delivering these skills requires specific knowledge and skills which health information professionals (medical librarians) poses, and they can train other people in the society through mass media relying on their abilities.",20.04153955314978,6.824932561487439

The correlation analysis clearly shows a high correlation between the number of publication in the field of social media and the publication productivity related to social media in psychology (r = 0.995; p value < 0.001). This increase in publications related to social media in psychology seems to be related to (1) social networking sites, which became very popular in previous decade [25, 26] ; (2) increasing interest in this field in multiple health disciplines [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] ; (3) or general cause such as the increasingly prevalent use of the internet, which has allowed more rapid distribution of medical knowledge through scientific research [32] .

The publications with the most international collaboration were those from the USA (n = 100). The UK and China ranked second and third, with 35 and 17 documents for each, respectively. The collaboration between countries based on co-authorship is shown in Fig. 2 . The USA is the most networked country, collaborating with 26 countries, followed by the UK (n = 22) and Germany (n = 15). The USA was the most prolific country in producing publications related to psychology in social media, contributing to more than of half of the publications related to this topic. This research output from the USA is possibly due to the large size of the population or economic forces [33, 34] . Furthermore, most of the social networking sites were established and founded in the USA. These findings are similar to those found in previous bibliometric studies in different fields, principally that the USA had the highest activity in scientific research output worldwide and in international collaboration networks, as well as the highest h-index [32, [35] [36] [37] .

Several ways to ensure such communication include: participating in scientific conferences, hosting regular workshops, and creating social media and other communication platforms that allow for direct dialogue and information sharing. Scientific conferences, whether domestic or international, act as centers of learning and networking. Individuals can discover new and exciting research paths, present on shared research, and identify new network members. Workshops bring together individuals from disparate fields and provide a space for networking, data sharing, and collaboration to effectively address research gaps within a network's scope.

Disease control measures may be delayed while waiting for confirmation. 7 As an early warning system, ProMED frequently issues preliminary reports of potential public health events as a request for information in an attempt to elicit further verification of these events.

It can be broad, providing information encompassing all aspects of the field from science to policy, or more focused. On one end of the target audience spectrum is the student at an academic institution who desires to enter into the discipline of microbial forensics and would like to be well prepared for a career choice. Students following a broad academic education and training pathway have many options. They may, for example, (1) become forensic scientists analyzing crime scene evidence for law enforcement or intelligence agencies; (2) work as a research scientist in a government laboratory such as the CDC, FBI, USDA, or EPA; (3) work as a scientist in an industrial or commercial setting; or (4) enter graduate school toward a career in academia. Alternatively, the student may become an investigator who employs traditional law enforcement approaches with the most effective evidentiary documentation, collection, and preservation techniques merged with those of epidemiology for attribution purposes or crime investigation (Budowle et al., 2007 ). An individual may become a law enforcement official whose responsibility is to understand the scope of an investigation and what tools are available to generate investigative leads. Policy makers must have a general understanding of microbial forensic results, keep abreast of technological and analytical advances, and develop better appreciation of their implications to effect sound and defensible policy decisions. Finally, an important group that informs the public and government is the news media. They are frequently the primary interface between the scientist and the public, publishing and reporting their observations, insights, or inaccuracies of great importance and impact.

They are more vocal and can influence a wider range of people. These are also regulation nodes that are important for the propagation of public opinion during an emergency and that are more able to intervene and control communication between and transmission to other nodes. Fig. 4 and Tables 1 through 4 illustrate that the centrality of natural disasters and public health events do not change drastically with an increase of public opinion heat. Rather, the media has a significant role in guiding nodes during these two types of emergencies: Netizens obtain news on an event directly from official media, such as the People's Daily, in the early stages of an incident. Since they trust this media source, they then quickly spread public opinion by forwarding, commenting upon, and paying attention to official media sources. There are not many intermediate links in the network. As a result, public opinion does not fluctuate very much. After accidents and social security incidents, however, media is not always at the center of a network. Instead, netizens are active in the communication process, and individuals are likely to be the center of networks.

In considering this, it is important to locate the analysis with respect to the two broad models of risk used in the social sciences. The first is the 'realist' approach, where risk is seen as an objective threat or danger that can be measured independently of the social context within which it occurs (Kahneman, Slovic, & Tversky, 1982) . The second is the 'social constructionist' approach, which sees risk as a threat or danger that is constructed through social and cultural processes, and cannot be demonstrated to be independent of such processes (Joffe, 2003; Lupton, 1999; Washer, 2006) . The latter is increasingly seen as a key conceptualisation; indeed, the term 'risk society' has been coined to describe the apparent perception of the postindustrial post-modern society as being at constant 'risk' of something, from credit-card fraud to terrorist attack (Beck, 1992) . Although this has been challenged in some cases (e.g. Kitzinger & Reilly, 1997) , what is important in this conceptualisation is not necessarily that populations are in permanently heightened states of anxiety, but how populations develop defence mechanisms to control their anxiety (Joffe, 1999) . In this paper a more 'material-discursive' position is adopted that views both conceptualisations as having some validity; that a 'risk' contains both a materially measurable element of the probability of an event, and a socially constructed element of how that probability/event is perceived by the individual and society (Yardley, 1997) . In this way a contrast can be seen through the examination of the impact of SARS between what is understood from a realist perspective (the materially measurable probability of, for instance, infection with SARS, various outcomes of infection and the effectiveness of different strategies to prevent infection) versus the social constructed perception of those probabilities as 'risk'.",17.381780709757095,6.964689093904485

Recently, this debate has included work related to SARS. Muzzatti (2005) , for instance, demonstrates how such threats to public health are manufactured by the media and how these threats draw upon past and present cultural myths of dangerous 'others', and in so doing contribute to unwarranted public fear, intolerance, and distrust.

Serological studies thus offer another valuable source of information in monitoring diseases [ 32 ] and already play an important role in many national surveillance programs (see Chap. 4 ). While in some cases there remain challenges in the clinical interpretation of quantitative serological data (e.g., Ref. [ 118 ] ), its future use in estimating, for example, the prevalence of subclinical, but infectious, cases could be of signifi cant value to public health efforts [ 119 -121 ] .",18.407502699107475,7.379212284831892

The fear about the pandemic was high, with 73.2% of respondents Slightly fearful/Fearful of the pandemic. Although the level of knowledge was slightly higher in those who were Slightly/Not at all fearful, knowledge was not a significant predictor of level of fear among our study respondents. Our results clearly show that risk avoidance among our study respondents were high, with 78.0% reporting at least one avoidance behavior, and 50.6% reported at least three risk avoidance behavior changes. Females, those with higher education, the employed, and those living in urban areas reported higher number of risk avoidances. This suggests that risk perception and adherence to protective measures could be lower among males, those with less education, the non-employed and those living in rural areas. Those who perceive a low risk of contact with infected persons may believe that they are personally unaffected by the pandemic. Likewise, health protective behavior changes was also high among the study respondents, with 99.0% reporting at least one protective behavior, and 64.9% reporting at least three health protective behavior changes. Only 28.7% reported ever using face masks to protect against A(H1NI) infection. Multivariate analyses indicated that knowledge predicts the practice of health-protective behavior across the three ethnic groups. The results are in accord with Leventhal's CSM, where beliefs and knowing about the causes of illness, and personal control over the illness progression play a role in individual's strategies to control the illness (Leventhal et al. 2003) . This suggests that provision of education and clear information is essential to enhance health-protective behaviors (Wray et al. 2008; Goodwin et al. 2009; Lau et al. 2009 ). There were some notable differences across ethnic and other sociodemographic groups with respect to perception of fear, risk avoidance, health-protective behaviors and impact of A(H1N1). Moreover, there were also notable ethnic differences in association between behavioral responses. Therefore, in the provision of behavioral and prevention information to the public, ethnic differences in perceptions and behavioral responses should be considered. Previous studies have also shown marked sociodemographic disparities in risk perception of disease outbreaks and its associations with health outcomes, disease incidence and mortality (Lau et al. 2006; Lauet al. 2007b; Raude and Setbon 2009) . The findings suggest further indepth qualitative exploration on cultural values and beliefs related to each ethnic group and national studies with a larger number of respondents. According to Leventhal's CSM, anxiety or fear induced by the illness can motivate individual to engage in health care activities (Diefenbach and Leventhal 1996) . Our study also supports this hypothesis, where a high level of fear was associated with higher number of health-protective and avoidance behaviors. This suggests that information communication should attempt to evoke a sense of fear or perceived susceptibility so that a person will adopt recommended health-protective behaviors. Moderate fear has been shown as very effective in motivating changes in behavior. Janis' fear-as acquired drive model proposed that the behavioral response to fear would depend on its intensity-that low levels of fear would lead to inaction, moderate levels would produce self-protective behavior, and high levels would result in counterproductive defensive responses (Janis 1967) . Additionally, it should be noted that excessive avoidance behavior may negatively impact on physical and social functioning, and may have considerable economic consequences. Appropriate healthprotective behaviors, therefore, may be more likely when fear is at a moderate level. As such a moderate amount of fear along with the provision of accurate information and a realistic view of associated risks is warranted to encourage people to take precautions.",18.098276920331635,6.315625716273577

In addition, they should examine the seriousness of the crisis, which could drive negative publicity threatening firms during a time of crises. If a firm has a pre-developed crisis management plan, crisis managers should conduct appropriate crisis management strategies, such as communicating with the media and the public.

Based on [8] , social media has 7 blocks of functionalities based on the grouping of social media functions including identity, conversation, sharing, presence, relationships, reputation, and groups. Users need to know about the functionality of each feature and domain that best fit the needs of the users in order to achieve the purpose of social media usage.

Mediated environments at once facilitate the transfer of credible information and foster epidemic fear, which raises concerns over responsible reporting and oversight as well as the need to study how the public understands and responds to news stories and advertisements that inform the public about risk. Analysis of media environments does not assume comprehensive availability of information, but focuses on the myriad forces that affect what information is made available or chosen for dissemination, the global network of media conduits that convey this information, the multiple social contexts that receive this information via official (e.g., politics, news media) and unofficial (e.g., rumor) networks, and the impact these flows of information have on risk perception, epidemic fear, and behavior change.",25.131207811863593,9.523976725648819

Learning of the existence of disease through firsthand observations, for example, besides signaling health events can also influence people's perception of what they are observing. If the perceived risk of an outbreak is increased, more firsthand reporting could overinflate the health event.

Ley et al. (2007) found that dogs that were given anxiolytic drugs (which reduce fear) were quicker to approach a novel object (a remote-controlled car) and spent more time in its vicinity, indicating that latency to approach a novel object is influenced by fear. King et al. (2003) also used a remotecontrolled car as a novel object and found that dogs' responses were related with a variety of other measures of fear. For example, there was a significant positive correlation between cortisol and the amount of time it took dogs to approach within 100 cm of the object. Interestingly, King et al. (2003) also noted that, compared to other breeds, greyhounds exhibited significantly fewer fear-related behaviours in the novel object test (i.e. quicker to approach and spent more time near) as well as on the other behavioural and physiological tests of fear, suggesting that breed differences or rearing environment could have a large influence on fear and anxiety. Plutchik (1971) also found significant breed differences in the patterns of approach/withdrawal between four different breeds of dogs (beagles, wire-haired fox terriers, basenjis, and Shetland sheepdogs) when presented with novel objects. Thus, it is important to note that responses to novel objects in dogs are not solely determined by their levels of fear and anxiety, but also by their baseline temperaments, which may be influenced by breed type or rearing.",33.05990722360445,14.541621527113334

Perhaps the Z. Polgár, et al. Applied Animal Behaviour Science 213 (2019) 1-13 most universal of these, which are common among most mammals, including dogs, are a low, cowering body posture, attempts to retreat and avoid the fear-inducing stimulus, freezing, and in severe cases, trembling (Stephen and Ledger, 2005; Rooney et al., 2009 Rooney et al., , 2016 Blackwell et al., 2013) . There are some other behaviours which have been suggested to be more specific to dogs, such as paw lifting, lip licking, gaze aversion, panting, whining, auto-grooming, and body shaking (Beerda et al., 1997 (Beerda et al., , 1999a Hiby et al., 2006; Rooney et al., 2009) . Increases in these behaviours have been shown when dogs enter kennel environments (Beerda et al., 1999a) . Aggression is another behaviour that is closely linked to anxiety and fear in dogs and may indicate compromised welfare, however few studies have examined aggression in this context (Taylor and Mills, 2007; Rooney et al., 2016) . Kiddie and Collins (2014) included all of these behaviours and additional ones as ""behavioural measures assessing negative emotions"" in their assessment tool. Barnard et al. (2014) did not list any of these behaviours specifically in their assessment, although the Emotional State Profile section of the protocol does include visual analogue scales for the terms ""nervous,"" ""unsure,"" and ""anxious."" Panting and shivering are recorded as part of the assessment and are used as indicators of inadequate shelter (i.e. is the dog overheating or too cold) rather than as behavioural indicators of anxiety or fear. While some dogs may frequently exhibit fear and anxiety related behaviours during their time in kennels regardless of any external stimuli, the absence of these behaviours does not necessarily indicate good welfare, particularly in cases of chronic stress, where apathy or learned helplessness may influence behaviour (Mason and Latham, 2004; Gaines et al., 2008) . In some instances, increases in fear and anxiety behaviour may become evident only in response to novel stimuli and thus measures looking at these reactive behaviours may be more useful.",31.0015447779304,12.507787998053645

It is possible that the frames on Twitter are influenced by the frames set by the mainstream media. For instance, Lee and Basnyat 21 studied media framing of the 2009 H1N1 outbreak in Singapore and suggested that although traditional media predominantly used the update frame and prevention frame throughout the break, their use of frames diversified to some extent in the later stages of the crisis to include more personal frames and social frames. Our semantic network shows that traditional news media (eg, CNN, CBS, Reuters, and AP) featured prominently in the discussion about the measles outbreak. Future research could examine the intermedia agenda setting process between traditional news media and social media in covering and framing public health crises associated with EIDs to see if Twitter frames are influenced by the frames used in the traditional news media or if the public may influence the frames used by traditional news media through voicing their concerns and opinions in Twitter. The other possible explanation for the changes in the use of frames is psychological. According to the psychometric paradigm, people's response to a risk is decided by the dread, catastrophic potential, controllability, and familiarity of said risk. 22 It is possible that during the early stages of a measles outbreak, the public is unsure about the seriousness of the risk and the controllability of the outbreak and therefore prefers the update frame and the public health frame. These 2 frames provide information that can help the public assess the scale and severity of the crisis. However, as the outbreak develops, people perceive the risks associated with measles as more familiar and more controllable. As a result, they start to try to make sense of the crisis by deciding whom they should blame for the outbreak, thereby leading to the increased use of the vaccine frame, which blames parents who refuse to vaccinate their children, as well as the political frame, which blames illegal immigrants or the government for the outbreak. Through surveys, future research could establish the relationship between social media users' risk perception and the frames they apply in discussing EIDs. The high frequencies of the political frame during the maintenance stage, some of which state that illegal immigrants were responsible for the measles outbreak, also indicates the spread of fake news on Twitter. Recently, Vosoughi, Roy, and Aral 23 found that false news stories spread further, faster, deeper and more broadly on Twitter than truthful stories. Compared with truth, false news stories only took one-sixth of the time to reach 1,500 people and were 70% more likely to be retweeted. These findings have particularly important implications for health care professionals during infectious disease emergencies.

The present study of the 2016 media messages concerning Zika considered the view that emerging risk perceptions and protective behaviors in a population are best instilled by quickly updated information in social media. Fear appeals and risk perceptions have typically been studied in legacy media contexts (Becker, 1974; Rogers, 1983; Witte et al., 2001) but may exert effects in new media as well. A fear appeal refers to a persuasive message intended to arouse danger or threat perceptions to facilitate preventive motivation and protective behaviors (Earl et al., 2009; Rogers and Deckner, 1975; Tannenbaum et al., 2015) . The public health research suggests that fear appeals can act as cues to action and elicit risk perceptions and health behaviors (Becker, 1974; Champion and Skinner, 2008) . Whether risk perceptions and health behaviors are both affected by a message, however, depends on whether the health behavior is perceived as wellsuited to reduce the risk (Fishbein et al., 1995; Rogers, 1983) . When a behavior is perceived as efficacious at reducing the risk, messages that influence risk perceptions may also influence protective behaviors. In contrast, when protective behaviors cannot fully reduce the risk of infection, such as when an infection (e.g., Zika) is asymptomatic and reducing contact is difficult, protective behaviors and perceived risk may remain functionally independent (Rogers, 1983) . All in all, however, the presence of a large volume of social and legacy media messages about the Zika virus may both increase risk perceptions and protective behaviors. Furthermore, perceived risk should depend on the level of actual vulnerability to infection (CDC, 2017b; McCarthy, 2016; PAHO/WHO, 2016) , which, in the case of Zika virus, should be higher in households with current and/or intended pregnancy and in geographic areas of high activity of the Aedes mosquito.",22.169971381991598,10.812424081940772

Whereas the volume of social media data showed robust positive associations with risk perceptions, the volume of legacy media correlated positively with protective behaviors in several subpopulations.

Future work should track a longer period (or a shorter period for each wave), such as a wave per week for a year, and investigate other potential explanatory characteristics, such as the persuasiveness of the information delivered in the media (Albarracín et al., 2017a (Albarracín et al., , 2017b Fishbein and Cappella, 2006; Petty and Cacioppo, 1986 ). In the present study, the legacy media coverage only included English news reports, prints, and broadcasts, whereas legacy media coverage in Spanish was not available. Even though the sampled legacy media are likely representative of the entire legacy media coverage in the United States, and Hispanics often consume news in English (Lopez and Gonzalez-Barrera, 2013) , future research should investigate the effect of the Spanish legacy media. Furthermore, the variables measured in the surveys were limited to the perception of the risk of infection over the next six months, and to protective behaviors such as taking mosquito-prevention measures and discussing Zika with healthcare professionals and providers. Other studies should expand the list of psychological variables to include efficacy beliefs (Brown, 2014; Rimal and Juon, 2010) . Finally, our study focused on the community level instead of considering any change at the individual level.

As people use social media as a useful tool to obtain relevant information during the outbreak period (Yoo, Choi, & Park, 2016) , this study suggests that social media can affect the formation of risk perception of the infectious disease. At the beginning of the outbreak, traditional media, such as television and newspapers, did not provide sufficient information about the infectious disease (Yoo et al., 2016) , so people might rely on social media as an alternative information source to satisfy their information needs. Moreover, when individuals are not able to access to information from traditional media, they tend to produce information and to disseminate it themselves on the Internet (Tai & Sun, 2007) . For example, people in China largely relied on the Internet as an alternative source of information because the Chinese government and mainstream media controlled the relevant information during the 2003 SARS epidemic (Tai & Sun, 2007) . Social media provide such a public space where users can readily create and share unfiltered or uncensored information that does not appear in traditional media (Austin et al., 2012) . During the MERS outbreak period, social media users were also found to largely express negative words, such as anxiety, fear, uncertainty, risk, and suspicion, with respect to the infectious disease (SBS, 2015). Because people tend to focus more on negative information (i.e., negativity bias; Meffert, Chung, Joiner, Waks, & Garst, 2006) , an increase social media exposure could promote shaping people's risk perceptions of the infectious disease. Second, our findings showed that systematic processing was positively correlated with risk perceptions of MERS. Individuals who engaged more in systematic processing were more likely to have greater levels of risk perception for the infectious disease. This is consistent with previous findings (Ryu & Kim, 2015; Tortosa-Edo, L opez-Navarro, Llorens-Monzonís, & Rodríguez-Artola, 2014 ) that systematic processing could increase risk perceptions, especially under an uncertain situation (Trumbo, 1999) , such as MERS, for which South Koreans were unfamiliar and uninformed regarding the infectious disease. This result also suggests that the relationship between heuristic-systematic processing and risk perception should be interpreted in a specific context or situation. As Trumbo (1999) argued, the notion that only people's rational and systematic judgement can decrease unnecessary overreactions to risks needs to be reexamined. Moreover, since systematic processing requires greater attention for acquiring information (Eagly & Chaiken, 1993) , the increased attention could lead to people's risk acceptability by evaluating the information. As a result, people who systematically process information relevant to MERS might arrive at the conclusion that the infectious disease is a serious concern.",29.94105242237157,14.22602828235077

Although self-reported measures are very convenient and common in some fields of media research (de Vreese & Neijens, 2016), the measurement accuracy heavily depends on respondents' ability or willingness to recall their behaviors. This is particularly problematic when answering survey questions about the frequency of media exposure. To solve this problem, researchers should consider many ""gold standard"" measures, such as media diaries, behavioral measures, and video observation for social media exposure (Fikkers, Piotrowski, & Valkenburg, 2017) .",31.390116216939326,12.110091910531692

For example, it is hard to deliver specific messages to a large targeted audience through social media, and measuring exposure can be more demanding than with traditional media sources (Hornik, 2016) . For greater validity, future studies should consider more sophisticated measures for the variable. Moreover, since some studies have indicated that exposure could not be sufficient to measure media influence on people's attitude or belief (Shim & You, 2015) , future research needs to use social media attention as a complementary approach to measure social media influence.",32.9135937002076,12.065891509241922

In recent years, some studies have suggested that the impact of media use, including social media, on people's cognitions, attitudes or behavior can depend on their individual differences, such as information processing ability or personality traits (e.g., Kim, Hsu, & Gil de Zúñiga, 2013; Lee & Oh, 2013; Yoo & Gil de Zúñiga, 2014) . Especially, because social media are designed to customize individual's interests or needs based on users' active behaviors, such as constructing his/her profile, building online networks, or selecting news information (Boyd & Ellison, 2008; Glynn, Huge, & Hoffman, 2012; Lin & Lu, 2011) , individual's differences could play an important role in considering the impact of social media. Specifically, people tend to seek and acquire varying gratifications when they use media, such as social media (Hyun & Kim, 2015; Kim et al., 2013) . Moreover, individuals often perceive risks depending on their psychological or cognitive characteristics (Sj€ oberg, 2000; Slovic, 1987) , such as information processing mode (e.g., Trumbo, 2002) or self-efficacy (e.g., Coleman, 1993) . Thus, people may utilize social media satisfying their personal needs from their psychological or cognitive differences to formulate risk perceptions (Smock, Ellison, Lampe, & Wohn, 2011) , that which would lead to various levels of risk perceptions toward a given health issue. For example, one's information processing mode has been found to moderate the effects of media on his or her risk perceptions (Ho et al., 2013) . Since heuristic-systematic processing motivates individuals to process information to reach their risk judgements (Eagly & Chaiken, 1993) , it is likely that this information processing moderates the relationship between social media and risk perception. That is, heuristic-systematic processing of MERS may help people process MERS-relevant information from social media, which could differently perceive the risk of the infectious disease. Moreover, because self-efficacy indicates the differences in individual abilities to respond or manage situations (Bandura, 1990 ), it has found that self-efficacy moderates the impact of media on one's cognition or behavior (e.g., Lee, Kwak, Campbell, & Ling, 2014) , suggesting that the potential to moderate the association between social media and risk perceptions. That is, in an uncertain situation, such as the MERS outbreak, as individuals hold different levels of self-efficacy, and when they rely on social media for information regarding MERS to form a risk judgement, the interaction between self-efficacy and social media would lead to different levels of risk perception of the infectious disease. From this perspective, we examine how heuristicsystematic processing and self-efficacy interact with social media regarding people's risk perceptions.",29.28825676691478,10.488634879645515

This study is the first to explore MERS-CoV epidemic impact on medical students' perception and determinants of their psychological distress during this outbreak. Methods: We randomly selected and surveyed 200 students from the College of Medicine at King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A predesigned questionnaire was answered by participants, and the collected data were statistically analyzed. Results: One hundred and seventy-four (87%) responded. Female students had a significantly higher mean stress level than males (P < 0.001). Participants had a mean GAD score of 2.7 ± 3.1 and a median of 2. Perceived sufficiency of information score was the highest mean and median (17.4 ± 4.2 and 18 respectively). College and hospital announcements were the most common source of information (25.4%). One hundred and thirty-four (77%) reported minimal anxiety, thirty-two (18.4%) reported mild anxiety, 8 (4.6%) reported moderate anxiety, and none of them reported severe anxiety (score >14). The stress level (as reported on 1-10 scale) shows significant correlation with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) score. We found in this study that significant predictors in our model, in terms of more significant to the least, were: an increased self-report on hygienic habits, self-reported social avoidance, the generalized anxiety score and finally being female gander while other variables including numbers of resources access, agreeing with public fear and knowledge score on MERS-CoV all were found to be non-significant. However, the number of accessed resources, as per students, has borderline significant correlation with higher self-reported anxiety from MERS-CoV.

Ninety-eight out of 174 (56.3%) were senior students, and junior students 76 (43.7%) reported more stress than seniors ; however, the difference was non-significant (U = 3283, P = 0.176). Table 2 shows the descriptive statistics of the questioned variables. Participant students had mean GAD score of 2.7 ± 3.1 and a median of 2. Perceived sufficiency of information score was the highest mean and median (17.4 ± 4.2 and 18 respectively), while the number of resources accessed had the lowest mean and median (2.5 ± 1.1 and 3 respectively). Fig. 1 shows the percentages of different information resources among participants. College and hospital announcements were the most common source of information (25.4%), followed by official statements or press releases from MOH (22.8%), and the third most common were social networks, mainly Facebook and WhatsApp (19.1%). Other resources for information were: other web resources (13.4%), WHO website (11%), and MOH website (8.3%). Fig. 2 shows the percentages of the GAD-7 anxiety levels category among surveyed students. Out of the 174 respondents, 134 (77%) reported minimal anxiety, 32 (18.4%) reported mild anxiety, 8 (4.6%) reported moderate anxiety, and none of them reported severe anxiety (score >14). Table 3 shows the correlation between stress level and continuous predictors included in the model. The stress level (as reported on 1-10 scale) shows a significant correlation with GAD-7 score and moderate correlation with both social avoidance and hygienic habit change (r = 0.41 and r = 0.471, respectively), and both were statistically significant. Independently, both social avoidance scores and personal hygienic habits show a significant correlation to each other. Table 4 shows the linear regression model predicting stress level of students as measured on 1-10 points. The model showed that 61.7 % of the variations in the students reported anxiety levels from contacting MERS-CoV (Multiple R = − 0.617), which is equivalent to an adjusted R squared of 38.1%. The model suggested that at least one or more of the predictors had a significant relationship with the student's levels of anxiety [F(8165) = 12.71, <0.001]. The student's improvised hygienic habits score correlated significantly with the student's reported level. Also, the students reported social avoidance score converged significantly with the students reported anxiety score when considering all other variables jointly. Those were followed by the GAD score, which shows significant correlation with the student's reported anxiety from the MERS-CoV when all the other variables were controlled.",17.54557921594725,7.520678633324514

These models have played an important role in understanding behaviors and its relationship with diseases and maintaining a healthy life. These include the Health Belief Model (HBM) (Becker, 1974) , models based on the Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) (Bandura, 1986) , and the Social Ecological Model (SET). Verbal social and behavioral theories have proven useful in improving public health-but are often informal. These informal models need to be represented as formal computer procedures when using computer models to study epidemics. This turns out to be challenging. The role of information is critical in how such models are developed. We have investigated behavioral models based on (i) role of information (kind of information: space, time, and networked; type of information: local or global; and completeness of information), (ii) computational considerations (efficiency of encoding, computational resources required expressiveness of the language), and (iii) scale of behavior: individual, collective, and institutional, and it is quite demanding to identify the data necessary to instantiate in silico behavioral models. Recent advances in social media, computational turks, online games, online surveys, and digital traces are potentially exciting new ways to make progress in this direction.

The key focus a researcher must have under consideration is how an internet system can be managed and function as a replacement system, a supplementary system, a support system, or an extension to traditional monitoring systems. Peek, Holmes, and Sun (2014) research is about the effective management of big data, collected through both traditional and internet surveillance systems. The scientists of this research believe that data for health and biomedicine have become so big and complex that the traditional methods and tools for managing them are not efficient any more. They call this development a big data revolution. They examine and discover the technical aspects of big data and the infrastructure needed for the management of them, to provide useful information. They also review analytical information about health and biomedicine regarding selection of cases and control, bias and confounding in observational data and techniques for mining health dimensional data. These data come from medical records, administrative data, web search logs, and social media. It is widely recognized that internet and electronic health data are quickly growing as technology advances. Capturing health data from various sources needs a change in the technical and management techniques regarding, such as the infrastructure, the file systems as well as the multidimensional data processing. To catch data from the internet, this can be done either with real-time techniques and nonreal-time techniques. Nevertheless, if we need early prediction of epidemics, we must support real-time data gathering and new technologies must be introduced to do so, such as Apache Spark and Storm. examined various studies about the usability of data from the social media. Many authors claim that social media programs should primarily be used to support existing surveillance programs. The researchers of this study concluded that the use of search queries and social media for disease surveillance are relatively recent phenomena and there is also an evolution of the tools and the methodology to exploit them. Although these surveillance systems, based on internet data, have a support function to the traditional ones, they require a high level of familiarity about capturing social behavior through social media. The data from social media, such as Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook, are abundant, but the quality of health information among users in these media is highly variable and this may raise some concerns (Schein, Wilson, & Kealan, 2011 ) that social media users are exposed to unopposed viewpoints that counter core public health recommendations. We believe that this is logical but partly true as people interact with each other through social media about health issues, but it is hard to imagine that an individual could ignore the official treatment and medication or precaution measures for severe health issues just based on what people say in the social media.

This is already done in other areas.

This often has to do with the brain vis-à-vis thought, feelings, sensation, and intuition. About 14 % of the global burden of disease has been attributed to neuropsychiatric disorders (Prince et al. 2007 ). Mental problems frequently manifest with behavioural changes that represent an infraction on the social norms of the society. A mental disorder is socially disastrous to the individual and could lead to total incapacitation or exemption from normal roles in the society. There are two major divisions of mental illness, which include neurosis (minor) and psychosis (major). While the former does not usually involve organic (brain) breakdown, the latter usually does. Examples of neurosis include: obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, phobia, dissociative disorder, minor depression, hypochondria, hysteria, and puerperal neurosis. Psychosis involves loss of contact with reality. It is generally the worst form of mental disorder. Examples of psychosis include bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, depression, substance-induced mental disorder, dementia (Alzheimer), delusional disorder, and epilepsy. A mental disorder may not necessarily lead to death, but it is disabling-it could be acute or chronic. Sartorius (2007) observed that stigma attached to mental illness is the main obstacle to the provision of care for people living with mental disorders. The stigma is a mark or label on those who are ill and their generations (see Sect. 8.4 .2 for the theory of stigma).",21.75905748075865,8.742877357237713

Initial studies published in 2008 and 2009, respectively, evaluated the use of web searches from Yahoo and Google for estimating influ-enza activity (Milinovich et al., 2014) . Studies have also evaluated queries from clinician support tools and medical websites for monitoring trends in influenza-like illness. These studies have shown significant correlations between data from the U.S. Outpatient Influenzalike Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) and clinician searches on medications, respiratory viruses (such as adenovirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, etc.), and influenza-related terms. Additionally, search query data have also been used in the estimation of different measures of the influenza epidemic curve (e.g., intensity, peak time, and incidence) and as input into disease transmission models to predict influenza spread. Google Flu Trends (http://www.google.org/flutrends/us/), introduced in 2009, and HealthMap FluCast (http://healthmap.org/flucast/), initiated in 2014, are two digital surveillance systems that rely on search query data for influenza-like illness surveillance. Time series data representing searches of particular keywords are used to model and predict influenza-like illness reports from official sources such as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Google Flu Trends uses a single data source, namely, searches submitted through the Google search engine, while HealthMap FluCast uses data from Google Trends and other sources (such as electronic health records Commentary from AthenaHealth). Sometimes information produced using these sources varies from that presented by traditional surveillance systems (Salathé et al., 2012) . There are several potential reasons for this, including changes in the underlying data-generating tools and population health-seeking behavior, as well as discrepancies between sick individuals and individuals searching for influenzarelated terms. Errors in estimates and predictions from digital disease surveillance tools can be misleading to the public and can undermine the potential of and confidence in these systems. As a consequence, these systems need to be regularly updated and validated to minimize real-time over-or under-estimation of influenza-like illness. Once developed, however, the cost of running and maintaining these systems is relatively low and the data sources used in most instances are openly available. Social Media Systems Data from social networking sites have also been shown to have potential for influenza monitoring and prediction. Initial studies assessed the use of reports of influenza-like illness on Twitter (a micro-blogging site) to assess spread of influenza-like illness during the 2009 A (H1N1) influenza pandemic in the United States. There have been several studies focused on using illness reports on Twitter for seasonal influenza surveillance and forecasting. Content from Twitter mentioning influenza or influenza symptoms are extracted and analyzed to estimate disease spread both temporally and spatially. Two examples of systems that use social media data for monitoring influenza-like illness are Sickweather (http://www.sickweather. com) and FluCaster (http://ndssl.vbi.vt. edu/apps/flucaster/). Sickweather combines self-reported information with geolocated data from social networking sites such as Twitter to provide information on the spatial spread of influenza-like illness. FluCaster also uses crowd-sourcing and social media for influenza-like illness surveillance. However, FluCaster further utilizes a complex computational epidemiology model, which enables estimation of the probability of infection and assessment of the effectiveness of different intervention strategies. Sickweather and FluCaster were introduced in 2011 and 2013, respectively. Other systems such as HealthTweets.org aim to translate health research using social media into practice. Systems that use social media data for disease surveillance process large amounts of data to extract useful signals indicating disease activity. For some of these systems, there are disproportionate distributions of users across locations, age, and race/ethnicity that can lead to significant bias in the data sources. There are also concerns of data access, privacy, and data sharing when dealing with data from sources such as Twitter, Facebook, and Google.

That is, we investigate the impact of a set of airlines' specifics to identify the main drivers of productivity change. We study whether productivity changes are related to shifts in (i) network characteristics, (ii) airlines' performance, and (iii) airlines' fuel efficiency. As network characteristics, we consider the average flight distance (''avg_length''-computed as total kilometres flown divided by the number of flights), the total distance flown (''tot_length''), the average size of the aircraft (''avg_size''-computed as total work load units' capacity divided by the number of flights), and the total flights (''tot_flight''). Distance flown, aircraft size, and number of flights are three connected decision variables. First, an increase (decrease) in the average flight distance may be due to either a greater (lower) frequency in longer flights or to the introduction of new longer (shorter) routes. Second, operating on longer (shorter) distances may be connected to the utilisation of bigger (smaller) aircraft. Third, operating smaller aircraft requires a higher number of flights to carry the same amount of passengers and freight. As far as airlines' performances, we include both passengers and cargo load factors (''passenger_LF'' and ''cargo_LF'') in the regression. These variables are expected to positively affect the productivity change. Finally, to investigate the influence of fuel efficiency on productivity, we consider the average fuel per kilometre burn as a level of the fleet's ecological impact (''fuel_km''-computed as the total amount of fuel consumed divided by the total distance flown). While it is not clear a priori the effect of fuel efficiency on the BM index, we expect it to affect positively the BML due to the relationship between fuel burnt and CO 2 .",18.58129291107662,7.915740055140282

In cities where there was no SARS outbreak, trust and sense of reciprocity are positively related to perceived community action taken, as suggested by Hypotheses 1. However, as suggested in Hypothesis 3, the relationships are not significant in cities that experienced the outbreak. A possible explanation of the high level of community action in cities that experienced outbreaks and those that did not is that, while trust and reciprocity do not relate to perceived collective action in cities with SARS, different elements of social relations, such as avoidance or self-protection, rather than trust and reciprocity, contributed to the community action in cities that experienced SARS. Since trust can be seen as ''rational expectation,'' then avoidance or selfprotection is another form of social relations based on rationality [14] . As Coleman [7] succinctly argued, social relations are no longer based on trust and reciprocity when individuals feel fear and anxiety. Given their sense of uncertainty, they consider it too risky to cultivate relationships based on trust and reciprocity that would lead to long-term stable relations. Therefore, our findings show that perceived community action taken is possible in an uncertain and stressful environment, but not through trust and reciprocity. It is possible that individuals develop defensive strategies in such circumstances and are still take community action. One possible defensive strategy is to reduce the interaction between the community at large and the family, a smaller social unit, while family members take care of one another. The aggregate effect is community action still possible. In short, the study has several directions for our future study of the impact of the outbreak of an epidemic on social functioning. First, modern media can vividly portray events associated with the outbreak, and broadcast widely beyond any geographical limitations. Subsequently, though statistically significant differences in responses, analysis of the data shows that a considerable proportion of residents perceived that the community maintained a high level of community action, both in cities that experienced the outbreak of SARS and in cities that did not. Future studies of the outbreak of epidemics should explore these effects of spatial diffusion on collective efficacy and community action in nearby communities. Second, the study has demonstrated that how community action operates can be strongly related to the outbreak of an epidemic. The impact is far-reaching and fundamental to the core of social relations: trust and reciprocity. However, at the same time, the findings suggest that the maintenance of community action in communities where SARS occurred could be retained by other elements of social relations. In other words, community action is not necessarily related to trust and reciprocity. Further studies should identify the alternative elements that are related to community action and how these elements relate to trust and reciprocity in contributing to community collective efficacy. Finally, though our study can show the relationship of how collective efficacy level is related to community action, future study should determine whether collective efficacy affects community action or vice versa.",17.992899639384117,7.516751912277598

Tracking online customer activities (often secretly to users) became industry-wide practice. Personally, identifiable data is routinely collected, centralized, and permanently stored by search engines and social networking sites (SNS) and undergoes mass disclosure (i.e., sold to their parties) without users' permission and even awareness [66] . Such data is in turn used to predict personally sensitive attributes including sexual orientation, political view, parental separation [21, 67] and to generate personalized advertisement aimed at driving consumer preference and decision [68] . In addition, widespread sharing of personal information on the Internet poses a unique challenge in defining online privacy [69, 70] . Users self-disclosing personal information in SNS or blogs typically expect their messages to be exposed to the online world. However, it does not imply that the data is subject to amassing and indiscriminate use, as such activities can lead to reidentification and potential harm to the users [70] , which certainly conflict with the users' expectation [69] . Individuals who are affected by stigmatizing illness particularly express concerns with the unintended use of their data by third parties [71] . Despite the public nature of social media, privacy does exist as a right to prevent data usage that leads to stigmatization, restriction of liberty, and violation of privacy. Some users publish their health and non-health information openly due to the sheer lack of privacy concerns and awareness. Such users are unlikely to be familiar with the contents of the privacy policies and statements in social media, which may state the usage of personal information by third parties.

Although affecting all areas of life, it poses particular problems in the health arena, where it can delay or prevent effective care, in some cases threatening the lives of individuals. While examples of the rapid spread of misinformation date back to the earliest days of scientific medicine, the internet, by allowing instantaneous communication and powerful amplification has brought about a quantum change. In democracies where ideas compete in the marketplace for attention, accurate scientific information, which may be difficult to comprehend and even dull, is easily crowded out by sensationalized news. In order to uncover the current evidence and better understand the mechanism of misinformation spread, we report a systematic review of the nature and potential drivers of health-related misinformation. We searched PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, Scopus and Google databases to identify relevant methodological and empirical articles published between 2012 and 2018. A total of 57 articles were included for full-text analysis. Overall, we observe an increasing trend in published articles on health-related misinformation and the role of social media in its propagation. The most extensively studied topics involving misinformation relate to vaccination, Ebola and Zika Virus, although others, such as nutrition, cancer, fluoridation of water and smoking also featured. Studies adopted theoretical frameworks from psychology and network science, while co-citation analysis revealed potential for greater collaboration across fields. Most studies employed content analysis, social network analysis or experiments, drawing on disparate disciplinary paradigms. Future research should examine susceptibility of different sociodemographic groups to misinformation and understand the role of belief systems on the intention to spread misinformation. Further interdisciplinary research is also warranted to identify effective and tailored interventions to counter the spread of health-related misinformation online.",31.63085267334263,9.137138303977034

The stability of family income was also was a significant factor in students' experienced anxiety during the COVID-19 crisis, which could be explained by increased psychological and economic pressure (Liu, 2013) . Living with parents was another favorable factor against feeling anxious. Previous studies have indicated that the risk factors associated with emotional and anxiety disorders in adults include the death of parents in childhood, not living with parents, and parents' psychological problems and mental illnesses (Woodgate et al.,2020; Gentili et al., 2020) , which are consistent with the results of this study. Relatives or acquaintances being infected with COVID-19 was an independent risk factor in college students' anxiety about the epidemic, which might be related to the high contagiousness of the new coronavirus pneumonia (World Health Organization, 2020; Song et al., 2019) . Consistent with our hypothesis, the COVID-19-related stressors, which include economic stressors, effects on daily-life, and academic delays, were positively associated with anxiety symptoms of Chinese college students during the epidemic. Similar studies (Kernan, 2019) have indicated that in addition to the national health situation, the epidemic will also have a significant impact on the economy of the country and individuals. Because of the outbreak, some families will lose their source of income, and students might feel anxious about paying their tuition fees (Peng et al., 2012) . In China, the government took measures, including travel warnings and bans, and extending the national holidays to control the outbreak, which inevitably disrupted routine life and resulted in anxiety. In the mainland China and Hong Kong, all primary and secondary schools were closed, and universities were either postponing classes until March 2020 or were using distant/remote learning methods (Kwok et al., 2020) . These measures undoubtedly have a specific impact on the education and the growth of students. Finally, social support was negatively correlated with the anxiety of college students, which is consistent with previous findings (Thompson et al., 2016; . Social support not only reduces the psychological pressure during the epidemics but also changes the attitude regarding social support and help-seeking methods. This result suggests that effective and robust social support is necessary during public health emergencies (Bai et al., 2005) .",16.329082799455126,7.7982398642850015

Social media has the unique advantage of being rapid and can be updated in a timely manner. If properly and scientifically utilized, social media can provide a sensitive and user friendly tool to monitor the distribution and determinants of epidemics both locally and at a global level. For example, systems like GT, present a novel and free tool that allows users to search for information with ease on the internet. This tool can also provide useful clues for understanding characteristics of the disease and the healthrelated behavior that influences its occurrence (Nuti et al. 2014 ). The use of social media in infectious disease epidemiology is, however, a new method of surveillance that is emerging. However, with advances in its use, it has the potential of providing an accurate and rapid estimation of the progression of diseases within communities. In addition, social media can be a valuable tool in providing values in distinct climatic and socio-economic context (Gluskin et al. 2014) . Most developing countries do not have a periodically maintained and updated surveillance system for infectious diseases. Countries that own a functioning surveillance system suffer from delay in reporting and many sentinel sites miss out reporting of cases annually or periodically. Lack of resources in most developing countries also hinders communication, training of staff and provision of proper equipment (Madoff et al. 2011) . Thus systems like GT, social media and other internet sources can provide a rapid method of surveillance that predicts the real time burden of disease and hence can guide preventive and curative strategies. Systems like GT could also work as a complementary system along with the traditional surveillance system in countries which have already established such systems.",28.742835757020654,10.080460335720817

A number of online communities have been developed by patient organizations, providers, and nonprofit organizations. Such online communities are virtual forums where patients can discuss their health concerns and exchange information. Participation in online communities heightens levels of emotional wellbeing, perceived control over disease, overall personal empowerment, and level of public awareness and medical knowledge (Wicks et al. 2010 ). The large online population creates a vast network composed of individuals reporting on their activities, their social interactions, and the events around them. These colossal data chunks stream in real time, and are often annotated with context including GPS location, relationships, and images. Extensive data analytics and data mining of social media have been suggested for many applications, such as marketing and financial prediction (Kautz 2013) . Recently, researchers have begun to leverage sensor network for public health: preventing, detecting and fighting infectious diseases. Researchers have shown, for example, that Twitter postings can be used to track and predict influenza (Krieck et al. 2011; Sadilek et al. 2012) . Such work provides evidence that social media can provide data that helps identify early warning for public health threats. Some researchers have explored augmenting the traditional notification channels about a disease outbreak with data extracted from Twitter. By manually examining a large number of tweets, they showed that self-reported symptoms are the most reliable signal in detecting if a tweet is relevant to an outbreak or not. Researchers have also tried capturing the overall trend of a particular disease outbreak, typically influenza, by monitoring social media (Culotta 2010).

The main role of infectious disease surveillance is to predict, observe, and minimize the harm caused by outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemic situations, as well as increase knowledge of both practitioners and the public about which factors contribute to such circumstances (Choffnes et al. 2007 ). Reporting incidences of disease outbreaks has been transformed from manual record keeping to instant worldwide internet communication ). Timely identification of infectious disease outbreaks is critical, both for effective initiation of public health interventions and control measures, as well as the timely alerting of government agencies and the general public at large. Surveillance capacity for such detection can be expensive, and many countries lack the public health infrastructure to identify outbreaks at their earliest stages. The Internet is revolutionizing how epidemic intelligence is activated, and it offers solutions to some of these challenges. Social media and freely available web-based sources of information may allow us to detect disease outbreaks earlier with reduced cost and increased reporting transparency (Wilson and Brownstein 2009 ). Furthermore, the search and exchange of health information on the Internet and social media has been viewed as an opportunity to improve public health surveillance (Velasco et al. 2014; Kass-Hout and Alhinnawi 2013) , and to monitor and predict emerging infectious diseases (Milinovich et al. 2014a, c) .

Various international mass media and foreign bodies outside Indonesia even became very stringent and went as far as questioning the abilities of Indonesian scientists and medical practitioners, as well as the presence of enough technical facilities and skills to detect and diagnose the disease. Further investigations reported that many of the suspected COVID-19 persons were only diagnosed clinically and not tested using the PCR method, including Indonesians evacuated from Wuhan. This could be one of the reasons for the (most likely incorrect) report of zero infections, during the initial period of this global pandemic. At present, through extensive coordination among different institutions, Indonesia has started to do PCR analyses on suspected citizens.",15.17925291110983,11.75318770902821

This may be due in part to that fact that it is often a non-quantitative topic. Keating (1982) considered panic as a unique collective phenomenon when fear is the dominant psychological entity of a group. Neria et al. (2008) argued that when first learning of an impending natural disaster, people will have negative psychological reactions, such as insecurity, anxiety, and/or fear. Armfield (2006) argued that the danger levels associated with a disaster have a major impact on the severity and distribution of panic. Some researchers have found indirect evidence of panic, even in the evacuation processes. First, once danger is recognized and people start responding, their information-processing and decision-making capabilities may be confounded by the mentally demanding circumstances, and those pressures are related to the perception of time pressure (Adam et al., 2012) . Second, egocentric behavior, a panic-related behavior, has been shown to be quite uncommon during an emergency (Bohannon, 2005) . Third, supported by a substantial number of empirical studies (e.g., Dash and Gladwin, 2007) , disaster victims do not automatically follow advice and orders from public officials, and tend to seek information, assess personal risk, and make their own evacuation decisions. According to Adam et al. (2012) shadow evacuation is primarily motivated by people's perception of being at risk, and shadow evacuation may most commonly occur during mass evacuations, increasing pressure on infrastructure and hindering those who need to evacuate. On the other hand, the response rate for evacuation has a marked non-linear impact on evacuation traffic conditions and arrival patterns, and a higher response rate leads to more traffic on roads, results in traffic congestion. The socio-psychological and circumstantial factors markedly affect individuals' evacuation decisions. (4) Panic spread Panic affects victims' evacuation decisions. Panic-related emotions can be minimized or spread to others in a social network. One factor influencing evacuation decisions is the strength of a person's social network. Based on the assumption that social cues are a causal factor, Hasan and Ukkusuri (2011) created a social contagion model to investigate the conditions for a cascade through a network of the decision to evacuate. They also considered the effects of social community mixing patterns, the first person to decide to evacuate, and the decisions neighbors made in previous time steps. Their model used a mathematical approach and simulation to investigate these factors that bring about the desired behavior of evacuating people in an area based on social relationships. Wang et al. (2012) created a qualitative simulation model of a large evacuation system while considering panic spread, and analyzed uncertainty factors that can affect panic spread during the evacuation process. A threshold model of social contagion was developed by Hasan and Ukkusuri (2011) . This model characterized social influence in decision about evacuation. Based on these studies, this study considers the effects of panic spread among disaster victims on temporary resettlement. Bi and Ma (2012) and Zhang et al. (2013) investigated panic psychology during resettlement of disaster victims. Bi and Ma assessed the effects of two resettlement modes, centralized and non-centralized resettlements, on psychological health, and noted that centralized resettlement mode improved mental health better than decentralized resettlement. Zhang et al., who applied statistical methods to analyze factors affecting post-flood anxiety and psychological wellness, determined that timely and effective psychological intervention can minimize anxiety following a disaster. These two studies primarily analyzed the effects of resettlement modes, especially centralized resettlement, on the psychological health of victims; the effect of their psychology on the resettlement process did not get sufficient attention. This study differs from those by Bi and Ma, and Zhang et al. in the following ways. First, they analyzed the effects of resettlement modes on panic and panic spread among victims, whereas this study considered the effects of panic and panic spread on evacuation and temporary resettlement decisions; multi-period evacuation and resettlement decisions are the main focus. Second, they quantified the effects by questionnaire-based methods, which contributed to psychological research, whereas this study minimized psychological penalty or cost perceived by victims and three monetary costs by considering the effects of panic and panic spread.",14.476552083400907,7.585890289155451

Crawford and Finn [39] provide a useful overview of the limitations of what they call ""crisis data""-the use of social and mobile data to understand disasters and other crisis events-of which a bioterrorism/ biological weapons attack would be relevant. Crawford and Finne discussed how social media data can provide important tactical information about a crisis and suggest potential response measures for that moment. They caution, however, that social media datasets represent a specific time point in an event, usually represented by a spike in Twitter messages or the use of particular hashtags. This focus can lead to a narrow conceptualization of the disaster, which leaves out an important understanding of the origin of the crisis or an understanding of the aftermath in which more of the impact and longer-term implications of the disaster is realized. Also Crawford and Finne pointed out that ""big data"" researchers often work in a very different context and location than those involved in the response and recovery in the midst of the disaster; therefore, the researchers can only mine a small fraction of the entire experience and effect of the disaster, leading to a partial and incomplete record of the event. Also Crawford and Finne noted that social media data is not always representative of a local population. For example, Twitter tends to be used by younger, wealthy, and more urban adult populations, meaning that infants, older, rural, and more marginalized populations may not be represented by Twitter posts ( [28] , p. S377). Also, most social media data lacks demographic information, such as age and sex, which is usually important in epidemiological studies.

Instead of utilizing the existing traditional approach of using state-owned television, the government should rather utilize text messaging services, social media, and the Internet (ranked as the first, second and third most preferred approaches of getting disaster-related information, respectively) for timely communicating of disaster risks. In another study, Alshehri et al. [16] found that 55% of study participants access official information about biological disasters through the Internet. After the 2011 flood in Jeddah, online social media was used for publicizing the gravity of the disaster, advising people what to do and what to avoid, and mobilization for help and rescue [32] . Social media has been useful in communicating the impacts of disasters, their possible causes and who was responsible, and suggesting actions for remedying the situation. The Internet and social media have been considered as promising in providing opportunities for greater social and political participation. Given the Internet penetration rate of 40.2% in the Middle East, compared to 34.3% global average [30] , the social media should be extensively used for sharing information about disaster situations and identifying the needed support, which is indeed the approach most preferred by the citizens. There is also the need to improve public access to vital information about disaster preparedness for increasing community awareness, knowledge and skills in disaster risk mitigation [52] . In 2013, the Saudi Ministry of Interior has developed emergency call and operation centers for event reporting and dispatch operations towards enhancing disaster response efficiency to be established in each of the country's 13 provinces [53] . While these centers could support the operational capacities of safety and security agencies [53] , utilizing social media can facilitate citizen participation and engagement in public affairs. Social media can be effective for disaster warning and evacuation procedures and it can influence decision-makers to be more responsive in disaster mitigation. They are also effective in motivating and guiding inhabitants of disaster-prone areas to actively partake in risk preparedness and prevention [24] .

While a lot of simple tasks can be automated in generic and user-friendly tools, the analysis of more complex datasets with relatively atypical structures is likely to benefit from the investment of expert modellers, which can best be achieved through collaboration. These collaborations are particularly important during epidemic crises where it is essential to develop an efficient flow to quickly collect, process, and analyse data and report results back to the public health community [11] . Finally, while we focused this paper on the analyses of epidemiological data gathered during infectious disease epidemics, major developments are ongoing to better integrate other types of data (e.g., social media [60] , viral genetic sequences [61, 62] , contact and behavioural data [63, 64] ) into these analyses as well.",23.709933206205783,9.690550724335338

One of the first mental effects is intense social and psychological distress, especially fear of biological agents, even when they are not used. There are several reasons for this reaction: the invisibility of biological agents, the possibility that the agent can be spread by personal contact, the uncertainty of the extent of dangerousness of biological weapons, etc. On the other hand, the exposure to any severe strictly mathematically, the pyramid is on an incline.

It helps us observe the differences between these two types of epidemics in order to prepare intervention measures. The epidemic of fear and panic can be divided into three phases (Fig. 3 ). The first is the anticipation phase that encounters fear, anxiety, and a possible lower level of panic and somatization at the individual and community level. The presence of these phenomena depends on the seriousness of the threat, any recent terrorist attack in the same or a close territory, awareness of community vulnerability, etc. Medical workers summoned in response teams and exposed to affected (or presumed affected) patients may become anxious, ambivalent and try to avoid contact with patients. Such patterns of behaviour may have a demoralizing effect, and should be treated by providing relevant information (contagiousness of agent) and by implementing appropriate means of protection (protective clothing, vaccinations).

Five articles examined how different organizations used social media in EID communication through the perspective of crisis communication, and 2 articles focused on the public's responses to organizations' EID communication. Most of these studies were based on theories of risk and crisis communication. (For a summary, see Table 4 .) All 5 articles on organizations' social media messages about EIDs used manual content analysis. Among them, only 3 reported the types of social media used and the types of messages posted by organizations. For instance, Biswas 3 studied how the CDC and WHO used Twitter and Facebook in communicating about H1N1 and identified the following 4 types of messages: investigation or diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and update. He also concluded that Facebook facilitated more interactivity because of its technical features, but both the CDC and WHO focused on 1-way communication instead of interacting with the public. Ding and Zhang 16 studied how the CDC and the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services used social media during an H1N1 outbreak and found that Facebook was the most frequently used, followed by Twitter, e-cards, buttons and badges, podcasts, Flickr, YouTube, and widgets. The following types of messages were identified in descending frequencies: updates, policies and guidelines, prevention topics, official actions and efforts, general information, and scientific research, in descending frequencies. Wong et al 35 However, 2 studies offered more theoretical interest by comparing strategies used by different types of organizations in communicating about EIDs using traditional and social media. Adopting the situational crisis communication theory, Kim and Liu 18 studied how 13 governmental organizations and corporations communicated H1N1 on social media (Twitter and Facebook) and concluded that governmental organizations emphasized risk communication (eg, providing guidelines about how to respond to the outbreak), whereas corporations paid more attention to reputation management. Using the same data set, Liu and Kim 19 examined how governmental organizations and corporations framed the H1N1 outbreak on social media (Twitter and Facebook) and traditional media (eg, websites).

Access to social media in low-and middle-income countries has increased exponentially in recent years due to technological advances. Despite this growth, the use of social media in low-and middle-income countries is less well-researched than in high-income countries. Objective: To identify, explore and summarize the current state of the literature on the use of social media for health in low-and middle-income countries. Methods: A scoping review was conducted on literature available to December 2017. Six databases were searched, and grey literature was identified through the Google and Google Scholar search engines. Literature was considered for inclusion if it (1) was published in English, (2) was conducted in or in relation to a low or middleincome country, (3) reported on as least one type of social media or social media use generally for health purposes, and (4) reported on at least one aspect of human health. Content analysis was performed to identify themes. Results: Forty articles met the inclusion criteria. Thirty-one were research articles, and nine were review/discussion/descriptive and evaluative reports. Since 2010, when the first article was published, most of the literature has focused on Asian (n = 15) and African (n = 12) countries. Twitter (n = 11) and Facebook (n = 10) were the most frequently discussed individual social media platforms. Four themes were identified: (1) use for health education and influence (sub-themes were health behaviour and health education); (2) use within infectious disease and outbreak situations; (3) use within natural disaster, terrorism, crisis and emergency response situations; and (4) producers and consumers of social media for health (sub-themes were misinformation, organizational challenges, users' expectations, and challenges of unique sub-populations). Most studies addressed more than one theme. Conclusion: Social media has the ability to facilitate disease surveillance, mass communication, health education, knowledge translation, and collaboration amongst health providers in low-and middle-income countries.

There are also population groups that have been neglected, such maternal-child populations. Although there has been considerable research focused on mHealth and maternal-child health [60] , our scoping review did not identify maternal-child health as a focal topic or potential user group for social media use in LMICs. Social media may be a useful adjunct to the use of mHealth applications concerning maternal-child health, and its use for these populations should be studied. Utilizing social media for maternal-child health education and behaviour change campaigns could be a viable way for research in this specific context to begin. Future research should include prevalence studies to identify who is and who is not using social media, what social media platforms are being used, and well-designed survey studies to identify preferences and barriers to use of social media for health in the context of LMICs.

The importance of the media in shaping consumers' perceptions and behaviors has been studied since the argument of McLuhan (1964, p. 8 ) ""the medium is the message"". McLuhan (1964) asserted that a variety of forms of media such as print media (e.g., newspaper, tabloid magazine), audio media (e.g., radio), and visual media (e.g., television, on-line video clips) are critical factors influencing social discourse. Due to the recent technological developments, the forms of media have become more diverse including social media which is becoming one of the major communication tools (Syed-Ahmad and Murphy, 2010) . The user-created nature of social media may increase the danger of disseminating negative information, which limits the controllability of firms under crisis situations (Palen, 2008) .

Such uncertainty and unpredictability of pandemic outbreak of infectious disease from its clinical presentation, infectious causes, epidemiological features, fast transmission pattern, seriousness of public health impact, novelty, scale, implication for international public health, and underprepared health facilities to address the pandemic outbreak of COVID-19 have considerably high potential for psychological fear contagion as well and often result in prevalent multitude of psychological problems such as fear, anxiety, stigma, prejudice, marginalization towards the disease and its relation of all people ranging from healthy to at-risk individuals to care-workers (Mak et al., 2010) . Mass quarantine could cause a sense of collective hysteria, fear, and anxiety in health workers working in hospitals, inpatient and outpatient care, large tertiary care centers, community based hospitals, primary care settings, nursing homes, assisted living facilities and all isolation units. The medical health-care workers who are exposed and in direct contact with the confirmed and suspected coronavirus cases are vulnerable to both high risk infection and mental health problemsworried, scared, experiencing bereavement and trauma. With the advent of COVID-19 in Pakistan, medical workers have been under physical and psychological pressure including high risk of infection, inadequate equipment for safety from contagion, isolation, exhaustion, and lack of contact with family. The severity is causing further mental health problems which not only effect medical workers' decision making ability but could also have long term detrimental effect on their overall well-being. The unremitting stress medical health-care workers is experiencing could trigger psychological issues of anxiety, fear, panic attacks, posttraumatic stress symptoms, psychological distress, stigma and avoidance of contact, depressive tendencies, sleep disturbances, helplessness, interpersonal social isolation from family social support and concern regarding contagion exposure to their friends and family. The sudden role reversal from a J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f healthcare provider to the COVID-19 confirmed or suspected patient potentially lead to sense of frustration, helplessness, and adjustment challenges in healthcare professionals. Fear of labeling, stigmatization and discrimination potentially impede healthcare workers intent to seek counselling and psychotherapeutic interventions (Zheng, 2020) .

Importantly, stigma may consist of beliefs that are part of a social process that differentiates against those with a Drinking, Smoking, and Morality 219 disease in negative social as well as biological terms. Stigma as it is portrayed in Goffman's (1963) classical description attributes blame, shame and abhorrence, particularly to marginalised groups.

Indeed, in an article about the psychosocial effects of diseases, the disproportionate degree of fear was described as connected to the fact that ""it is transmitted rapidly and invisibly; historically, it has accounted for major morbidity and mortality; old forms re-emerge and new forms emerge; and both the media and society are often in awe"" (12) . However, after analyzing this selection of epidemics-related films, we suggest that although social reactions such as panic (an emotive response caused by fear) are typically found in films concerning epidemics, films also remind us that the fear seen during epidemics is often little associated with the disease itself. In fact, films show that epidemics can push societies in 2 directions: fear leading to a breakdown in sociability, but also fear stimulating the preservation of tightly held social norms. The first social response to epidemics is often informed by concern over broader moral failings within society at large, leading, for example, to violence or scapegoating. In accordance with the ""outbreak narrative,"" a concept developed by Priscilla Wald, a fear of the spread of disease is developed in only 1 direction, from marginalized, deviant, or underdeveloped groups to native, mainstream, or developed society (6) . In recent films, this kind of orientalization (perpetuating stereotypes about Middle Eastern, Asian, and North African societies) and othering (viewing or treating others as intrinsically different from and alien to oneself) has been taken a step further as traditional or underdeveloped societies are heroically saved by outsiders. The second social response to epidemics is often informed by the perceived application of arbitrary or excessive controls from above or outside the community in question. Films have shown that epidemics produce active responses such as resistance or unrest-sometimes violent-to paradoxically retain aspects of normal life under threat (often from elites and authorities), such as perceived freedoms and liberties and customary traditions and practices.",23.281365008088226,10.289598460819617

Stigma is known to delay treatment and to lead to non-adherence to treatment of various diseases, particularly self-inflicted ones. This is also the case with TB-related stigma (Godfrey-Faussett et al. 2002; Kanyerere and Aase 2005; Cambanis et al. 2007; Somma et al. 2008) .",23.018423456382813,10.227474886627219

It has been suggested, or is even clear in some cases, that some of the immunological properties attributed to other cells (see above) are in fact a result of mis-identification or confusion with microglia (Akiyama et al. 1988 ); this appears particularly germane for astrocytes in culture (Hetier et al. 1988 ). Based on the present findings, not only microglia but also these potential nonmicroglial macrophages must be taken into account in efforts to identify accessory cells. Potential non-microglial macrophages may warrant consideration in studies of astrocytes as immunocompetent cells in tissue cultures; this is especially true in instances where a smallpercentage of the protoplasmic astrocytes (type 1) appear to display immune function (DuBois et al. 1985; Sasaki et al. 1989) .",20.61218643558838,9.596892972096665

The dynamics of information spread are inherently different from the dynamics of disease spread. In the days immediately following the first reports of a few cases of a new disease, the volume of news reports and social media posts typically spikes dramatically (see figure, Panel A), because during that period most information is new and potentially relevant and therefore of high interest to the public. After some time, information saturation sets in, and public interest wanes, even as the number of new cases continues to rise. For newly emerging diseases with initially few cases, the social media data are typically dominated by news reports rather than first-person accounts of symptoms by sick individuals -a situation that differs markedly from that during recurring epidemics such as seasonal inf luenza. In the early phase of an outbreak, this effect makes it challenging for digital epidemiology to provide intelligence for early detection of cases of disease.

First, they can be used for early detection of disease outbreaks. This capacity was illustrated most recently in China, when a hospital employee uploaded an image of the medical record of a patient with H7N9 infection to Sina Weibo, a popular Chinese social network similar to Twitter. The post was promptly deleted, but it appears to have accelerated the government's acknowledgment of four new cases (see figure, Panel B). More generally, because digital surveillance is not limited by the hierarchies of traditional public health infrastructure, geographic communication barriers, and geopolitical obstacles, it has improved the timeliness of outbreak detection substantially in recent years. 4 Second, these data can be used to continuously monitor disease levels. With proper filtering by automated systems (see the Journal's H7N9 HealthMap tracking system [http:// healthmap.org/h7n9]), analyst-driven systems (e.g., the Global Public Health Intelligence Network of Canada), vigilant journalists on Twitter (e.g., Crawford Kilian [@Crof ] and Helen Branswell [@HelenBranswell]), and crowd-sourced systems (e.g., FluTrackers and ProMED-mail), informal data sources such as news media, e-mail lists, blogs, and social media can complement formal public health surveillance by offering real-time clues to disease dynamics. Internet-based surveillance systems provided important early epidemic intelligence during the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the 2009 H1N1 inf luenza pandemic, enhancing transparency by rapidly publicizing outbreak information. 3 Third, Internet-based data from social media can be used to assess disease-relevant healthrelated behaviors and sentiments relevant to disease control. During the H1N1 pandemic, sentiments about vaccination extracted from Twitter were shown to correlate well geographically with subsequent vaccination coverage throughout the United States. 5 Such analyses could provide important information to aid in planning and in the distribution of limited resources, as well as improving public health communications efforts.",22.513336924710142,7.495960471828176

Second, initial analyses of viral genome sequences suggest signs of adaptation to mammals -such as the ability to attach to respiratory tissue and to replicate at mammalian body temperatures 1 -which could facilitate human-to-human transmission. Third, because the virus has low pathogenicity in birds, its presence is difficult to detect in bird f locks by symptomatic surveillance alone. Testing of more than 20,000 people with inf luenza-like illness in China revealed only six cases of H7N9 infection, suggesting that there are not widespread mild cases of H7N9. 2 Public health officials on the ground continue to focus substantial resources on assessing and mitigating the pandemic potential of this virus strain. Although these efforts are critical for understanding the evolving public health situation, since there are limited resources available, intelligence for assessing the threat must come from a wide range of data sources. Though relatively new, digital disease surveillance is an increasingly powerful tool that complements traditional approaches. 3 In this and other outbreaks, digital disease surveillance has supplemented the critical laboratory studies and work in the trenches by public health officials and epidemiologists, by leveraging widespread use of the Internet, mobile phones, and social media. 3 Many of these added insights come from the general population, whose access to technology enables rapid information f low.

The year 2016 marks the 20th year since the formation of the UN Kyoto Protocol aimed at a global commitment to emissions reductions, but in that time overall greenhouse gas emissions have steadily increased. 7 Thus, new and innovative approaches are urgently needed to prevent global environmental pressures including climate change. In addition to guiding adaptation to reduce health effects of climate change, the health community can play a meaningful role by catalyzing major systems changes toward infrastructure and practices that are focused on addressing the drivers of climate and other environmental change. Multidisciplinary and cross-sectoral collaboration and the full involvement of civil society and local communities will be central to finding effective solutions. Prevention at the Source. Considering the underlying driver of outcomes provides useful information for prevention opportunities, including those that can be prioritized across multiple sectors or to solve multiple challenges. For example, although climate change is a causal contributor to both infectious disease emergence and biodiversity loss, all 3 share many of the same underlying drivers (such as land-use change/habitat loss). Reversing the trajectory of outcomes requires addressing these underlying drivers, and determining the full scope of major mitigating or exacerbating factors is important for improving understanding of disease ecology dynamics; to look only at climate change could miss intricacies and causality from other factors. For example, climate change is commonly proposed as the reason for the expansion of vector range leading to VBD. However, despite sensitivity to climate, VBD spread may be more dependent on habitat loss and social factors 56 dissues likely to increase through large-scale land conversion to meet growing food demands and expansion of human settlements in the coming decades. Similarly, although pathogen evolution is the focus of intense research, anthropogenic environmental changes are likely to have more profound implications for infectious disease risk under climate change. 57 New or more frequent human contact with other species, resulting in some novel interactions, is facilitating pathogen spillover, leading to outbreaks.",26.016553715255704,10.49651061831454

Using satellite imaging to collect information on sea temperature and surface height and chlorophyll A levels, researchers were able to construct an environmental model that could accurately predict the actual incidence rate of a cholera outbreak in Bangladesh. 65 Apart from water-borne diseases, satellite imaging has also been used to trace vector activity, like the distribution of the Anopheles species that drive malaria transmission in Africa 66 and to model hantavirus pulmonary syndrome outbreaks. 67, 68 However, vector-borne disease outbreaks are more challenging to predict due to the dynamics of vector ecology and human behavior and the variability in host immunity between different populations. 65 Closely monitoring climatologic parameters (i.e. rise in sea surface temperature and protracted rainfall) and vegetation and soil indices is critical in order to evaluate changes that could contribute to infectious disease outbreaks. Using such data in predictive mathematical modeling could generate early warnings to inform public health interventions that would aim in epidemic mitigation. 65 Communications Social media Analysis of data collected through social media applications presents new opportunities as well as challenges in emerging infectious diseases surveillance.

So-called digital epidemiology has enabled practitioners and researchers to use electronic databases and information to enhance traditional surveillance methods. 5 In 2012, HHS launched its Now Trending developer challenge to create programmes for health departments to monitor social media during an outbreak. The challenge resulted in MappyHealth, a Twitter monitoring programme now being piloted for digital health surveillance around the country, helping offi cials examine real-time events. Digital surveillance was used by public health workers during the infl uenza A H7N9 outbreak to monitor Chinese social media for events, myths, and concerns. 6 Improvements in digital surveillance have also improved public communication. Local health departments that can monitor Twitter can give immediate feedback to correct dangerous mistruths that are contagious on social media. 7 CDC's @CDCEmergency Twitter feed, fi rst established during the infl uenza A H1N1 response, now reaches more than 1·5 million people with emergency health information. During the Japan nuclear disaster response, Twitter was used to correct the dangerous myth that healthy people in the USA should take potassium iodide to prevent harm from radiation. 8 These technological advances have been developed in parallel with diplomatic information sharing advances. WHO's International Health Regulations and multilateral collaborations, such as the Global Health Security Initiative, have provided a framework for international cooperation during public health disasters. Improved capacity and the high priority placed on rapid information sharing led to China's timely reporting in 2013 of clinical and genetic information about infl uenza A H7N9 and early sharing of isolates, by contrast with the response to sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) a decade earlier, when information was slower to emerge. 9,10 Cloud computing allowed for distribution of validated epidemiological and analytical programmes to the global community, while allowing China to share genomic sequences, providing the opportunity for immediate actions to analyse the viral genome and develop vaccine candidates. 6 The Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasure Enterprise was established by HHS to coordinate federal eff orts and build new ways to respond to 21st century health threats-from discovery to deployment.

The implications of land-use change for biodiversity loss and the associated loss of ecosystem goods and services present deeper implications for social welfare. For example, decreases in pollination services and reduced access to wild foods may affect food and nutritional security and livelihoods; a potential decline in access to medicinal plants used by a large proportion of the developing world as a source of primary health care may lead to negative health outcomes across indigenous and local communities; inadequate nutrient cycling harms clean water sources and leads to soil erosion and may contribute to the prevalence of waterborne diseases, thereby decreasing ecosystem and community resilience to extreme weather events; and biodiversity loss threatens access to natural resources with biomedical and pharmaceutical importance and weakens ecosystem integrity and resilience to climatic changes. All of these ecosystem services are also correlated to quality of life, mental and physical health, and social welfare. 10 The scope of climate change, its underlying drivers and health outcomes extends widely beyond measurable disease burden and immediate mortality. For example, the IPCC projects climate change will increase the displacement of people and potentially their exposure and vulnerability to extreme weather events, particularly in developing countries. 51 This will modify risks for violent conflicts by amplifying well-documented drivers of conflicts such as poverty and economic shocks. Flow-on effects may include significantly increased risk for civil and political conflict over dwindling resources, and mental health issues arising from trauma, displacement, conflict, and more limited access to natural resources used for food, medicines, and cultural and spiritual fulfillment. 52, 53 Such challenges relate to defense and peacemaking initiatives, with the US Department of Defense 2014 Climate Change Adaptation Roadmap anticipating growing need for disaster relief and humanitarian assistance abroad as well as potential international instability coupled with threats to operations and supply chains. 54 The drivers of climate change may themselves result in displacement of populations.

Some of these motivations in fact conflict with the aims of public health, particularly in developing countries. BAt first glance,^she argues, Bthe cause of handwashing appears as apolitical and uncontroversial as can be^(428). So unproblematic is hand hygiene, and so important are efforts to promote it, that the very few criticisms of Global Handwashing Day have largely been ignored. 12 For her part, Plyushteva takes issue with the celebration's stigmatizing of people in developing countries Bas traditional or backward, or, in a teleological view of development, pre-modern^(424). Hand hygiene's Buncontroversial façade^(420) also obscures the reality that individual behavior change is only ever a Bpartial solution^(429) to the spread of disease. Efforts to quell the spread of disease through behavior change also depend on the implementation of structural interventions-changes that create an environment supportive of personal responsibility. (I return to these limitations of personal responsibility in my conclusion.) I quote Plyushteva at length because hers is the most recent scholarly critique of contemporary, globalized efforts to promote hand hygiene promotion. 13 Her writing establishes a precedent for my critique of North American handwashing campaigns, which may also do more, politically and economically, than simply diminish the risk of infection. Circulated within workplaces, schools, transit hubs, airports, community centers, groceries stores, and shopping malls, handwashing campaigns portray individual bodies, and body parts, as dangerous vectors of infectious disease. What makes these bodies, and parts, dangerous is both that they spread infection and because the disease-causing pathogens they transmit remain invisible to the individuals who transmit them. As a caption for a handwashing poster created by Yale University's Emergency Management Department in 2009, in response to H1N1, puts it, BYou've got a mystery on your hands.T aking the form of pamphlets, posters, transit ads, web infographics, social media campaigns, and public service announcements, these texts caution that the power to prevent (and spread) infection is in our hands. Sales figures for hand sanitizer alone illustrate the impressive new revenue streams generated by this individualization of infection risk. Even in developed countries, where the assumption of personal responsibility is less likely to be impeded by structural issues, hand hygiene promotion may nevertheless skew perceptions of contextual or social determinants of infection risk.

In the first attempt to classify the underlying drivers of disease emergence, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) identified six factors including: human demographics and behavior; technology and industry; economic development and land use; international travel and commerce; microbial adaptation and change; and breakdown of public health measures (Lederberg et al. 1992) . In 2003, seven additional drivers were added to the IOM report including: human susceptibility to infection; climate and weather; changing ecosystems; poverty and social inequity; war and famine; lack of political will; and intent to harm (Smolinski et al. 2003 ). IOM's classification of the ''factors in emergence'' largely paved the way for current research investigating the underlying drivers of infectious disease emergence. It is important to note that these drivers are not mutually exclusive, and that factors may act in concert and will vary at different stages of the emergence process. For example, anthropogenic land use change has resulted in cross-species transmission of disease or initial emergence, from animal hosts to humans both directly by increasing human contact with animal populations, and in other cases indirectly by changing vector populations (Daszak et al. 2000; Patz et al. 2004) . Climate and weather can augment these affects and modulate outbreak size; particularly with vector or waterborne diseases, and global trade and travel has facilitated the spread of those diseases (Hufnagel et al. 2004 ). These EID drivers function on a different scales, vary geographically (Keesing et al. 2010) , and can be attributed to a combination of environmental, ecological, political, and social forces. Despite ongoing research investigating the role of EID drivers, additional studies and modeling approaches are needed to more fully understand the complex mechanisms of emergence (Bogich et al. 2012 ).",31.53828679555219,9.060876872755552

These feelings of anxiety were directly rooted in the unidentified nature of the disease and lack of knowledge concerning how it was spread. This fear was made worse by the potential that a nurse could unknowingly contract the disease and then unwittingly spread it to family and friends (RNAO, 2003) . One nurse who worked in the acute care section of a Toronto hospital noted that not only was she terrified to attend work, but that this sense of trepidation even entered into her dreams: ''I dream of disembodied mouths gasping for air and wake struggling to catch my own breath . . .'' (RNAO, 2003: p. 17 ). This fear made the working environment extremely tense and the lunchrooms and halls were filled with rumors concerning how SARS was spread and its potential to do much more damage (RNAO, 2003) . There certainly was a consensus amongst nurses that the worse aspect of the SARS experience was the fear of the unknown. Nurses reported being in constant fear that anyone who was in the hospital, be it patients or colleagues, could already have contracted the disease and be transmitting it (RNAO, 2003) . Fears were heightened by the contradictory and often confusing information that nurses received. According to Barb Wahl, the President of the Ontario Nurses' Association, nurses reported hearing: a steady stream of contradictory, confusing, inconsistent and incorrect information about the means of transmission, infection controls, effective protective gear and the protective protocols health care workers needed to follow. (ONA, 2003: p. 3) This misinformation served to heighten nurses' fears about their own safety and that of their families. According to one nurse, the best source for reliable information on the SARS crisis was not her employer, but the media (CNA, 2003) . Statements such as this demonstrate that at least some nurses felt strongly that management was doing a poor job at communicating developments in the struggle against SARS. Nowhere in the submissions was there a sense of common cause; on the contrary, after years of neglect, employers and government were perceived as being less than helpful--possibly less than honest. At the time of writing, it still remains to be seen if information was purposefully kept hidden from health care professionals or whether the slow dissemination of knowledge to front-line workers was due to structural and bureaucratic problems that slowed the diffusion of pertinent information.",21.983162611442932,8.265008778772101

(2001) found that family environment may have an impact on risk. Nevertheless, moderate heritability of social anxiety traits was demonstrated in the same study . A conceptually driven landmark genomic study has documented an association between social anxiety traits and an (balanced) allele-variant polymorphism in the Beta-1 adrenergic receptor (Stein et al., 2004) . Evolutionary factors contributing to social anxiety traits are cogently articulated elsewhere (Stein, 1998; Stein and Bouwer, 1997; Stein et al., 1996) . Several authorities have argued that, during parts of the human EEA, being stared at by a large group of strangers was frequently associated with potential threat to life. Stated differently, for upper Paleolithic H. sapiens, situations in which an individual was simultaneously scrutinized by a large group of nonsmiling, non-kin conspecifics were more likely than not to be followed by negative consequences. This neuroevolutionary hypothesis can be tested empirically in patients with socialphobia-related traits (e.g., by comparing autonomic nervous system response and neuroendocrine response during visual scrutiny by a large group of non-kin versus a comparably sized group of blood relatives). Previous studies and the DSM-IV-TR cluster together two innate fears of arguably different time-depths as ""social-anxiety-related traits"": 1) a generalized fear of ""new people""an innate upper Paleolithic ∼ 70,000 y/o fear of non-blood-related conspecifics and 2) fear of public bathroomsan innate Neolithic ∼ 12,000 y/o fear of fecal contamination. Arguably, this clustering is unhelpful in charting the genetic architecture of social-anxiety-related traits. Finally, it may be of note that, with regard to the sex ratio of anxiety disorders, men are generally believed to under-report symptoms of most phobic and anxiety disorders in both epidemiological and clinical studies. Male under-reporting may partly account for the typical sex ratio of anxiety disorders. In contrast, objectively severe social anxiety (severe enough to require hospitalization) presents primarily in males (DSM-IV-TR, 2000, p. 453). In this regard, the sex ratio of severe social phobia (as well as of severe OCD) stands out among anxiety disorders. The high prevalence of clinically significant social anxiety among males is consistent with neuroevolutionary predictions since, in the mid-upper Paleolithic EEA, visual scrutiny by a large group of strangers was more likely to result in loss of life for a male than for a female. Goodall's (1986) research on the patterns of behavior of the chimpanzees of Gombe leads us to predict that, especially in males, symptom severity during meeting ""new people"" will often manifest only when the ""new people"" encountered include three or more men. This prediction can be easily confirmed or disconfirmed in clinical samples.",26.236349614427375,10.478134339241246

In the U.S., the disorders are probably most often seen in Hawaii, Guam and American Samoa. All consist of an intense acute fear that the external genitalia (in males) or nipples (in females) will retract into the body and potentially cause death. The author posits that these six syndromes are essentially identical to either panic attacks or other well-understood acute anxiety states in which the evolutionarily hardwired sympathetic (Fives F's) evolved acute fear response includes a fitness-enhancing and protective retraction of the external genitalia as part of the freeze-flightfight-fright response. In women, the manifestations include a retraction of the nipples and blanching of the areola, which may be understood as fear-induced cutaneous vasoconstriction. Arguably, the reason why these signs of acute anxiety are usually reported from peri-equatorial countries may simply be that minimal clothing makes them more easily observable. Maintaining the description of these syndromes as ""culture-bound"" may prevent science-based treatment and may be stigmatizing. 17 .

Introduction: the three goals of this articles Pitman and Delahanty (2005) have recently emphasized the importance of conceptually driven approaches to stress and fear circuitry disorders research. This conceptually driven article has three main purposes. The first and most important purpose is to present testable predictions which can be falsified in existing databases or in future studies. The second purpose of this article is to attempt to tackle some remaining language barriers between anxiety disorder researchers and evolutionary neurobiologists. The third purpose of this article is to look at the field's conventional wisdom from a new angle, and to propose useful concepts based on research from seemingly distant scientific disciplines. The article's title was inspired by Nesse and Williams' ""Smoke-Detector Principle"" of anxiety, which introduced into psychiatry a highly useful concept based on principles of financial cost-benefit analysis in economics and principles of signal detection analysis in psychophysics.",16.839875040551718,6.920980099673313
the doctrine of preemption,0.14542618649087927,0.363299161195755,0.6174830794334412,6d26ffa4-847f-43fd-9826-645e113ebb3e,"custom_license/One-health approach as counter-measure against ""autoimmune"" responses in biosecurity","It seems that, carried by fear and anxiety, the doctrine of preemption is of growing importance and popularity for managing not only a proliferating range of political problems, but also for coping with viral threats. There is an increased demand for public health preparedness to focus not only on interventions against known recorded viral strains but on generic measures that would be effective against yet unknown, not recorded but theoretically possible viral strains (Collier and Lakoff, 2008, p.12e16) . The idea behind pre-emption is to intervene in the conditions of emergence of the future, before one may be besieged by nature's own act of emergence (Cooper, 2008a, p.91) . In the case of the mutant Avian flu, virologists make use of exactly that argument. Professor John Oxford from Barts and the London School of Medicine says, ""The biggest risk with bird flu is from the virus itself. We should forget about bio terrorism and concentrate on Mother Nature"" (Walsh, 2011, p.1) . In similar vein, Osterhaus argues that the bigger danger is that ""nature will do the first job"" (quoted from Check, 2005, p.406) . Similarly, Fouchier and De Jong (virologists) claim that ""nature is the biggest terrorist"" (Carvajal, 2011, p.A28; Visser, 2012, p.1) . Their argument clearly states that virologists should be allowed to pre-emptively 'attack' nature, before nature itself will 'attack' us.",17.141854836273534,6.637157649104714
Research has documented that individuals who reported having experienced painful dental treatments,0.18480145870596745,0.36171919107437134,0.28056085109710693,8e049e4b-1aad-456a-a3b0-5c32aa23332d,"custom_license/Human brain evolution and the ""Neuroevolutionary Time-depth Principle:"" Implications for the Reclassification of fear-circuitry-related traits in DSM-V and for studying resilience to warzone-related posttraumatic stress disorder","More research is also needed on ""dental phobia"" since the available data are inconclusive (Poulton et al., 1997) . Dental phobia most probably a heterogeneous category consisting of 1) an innate fear of sharp objects in close proximity to one's head and neck, 2) innate fear of drowning (choking on saliva) and 3) probably most commonly, a non-innate overconsolidational fear following a very painful dental procedure (Bracha, Vega and Vega, submitted for publication). Important recent research by Jehel et al. (2003) on survivors of a bomb attack in a Paris subway in December 1996 is relevant in this regard. As Jehel et al. (2003) have demonstrated, physical pain/injury during the Criterion-A adversity is a previously neglected risk factor for subsequent overconsolidational disorders such as PTSD. Bracha, Vega and Vega (submitted for publication) have argued that problem with using the term ""phobia"" in a dental-care context is as follows: by definition, phobias involve a fear that is ""excessive or unreasonable,"" which the individual recognizes as such, and in which the anxiety, panic attacks and phobic avoidance are not better accounted for by another disorder, including PTSD. More research is needed, however most individuals with dental ""phobia"" do not recognize their symptoms as ""excessive or unreasonable"" and, in that sense, resemble individuals with PTSD. Our review of the dental-care literature suggests that true (innate) dental phobias (akin to unreasonable fear at the sight of blood or a syringe) probably account for a smaller percentage of cases, and that the vast majority of dental-care anxiety (DA) cases stem from aversive dental experiences. Research has documented that individuals who reported having experienced painful dental treatments and perceived a lack of control in the dental situation were approximately 14 times more likely to also report higher dental fear, and approximately 16 times more likely to report being less willing to return to the dental treatment. Therefore, this psychological condition may be better conceptualized as Posttraumatic Dental-care Anxiety (PTDA), and should be classified as part of the overconsolidational disorders spectrum in the forthcoming DSM-V. 13 .

Constant monitoring and real-time analysis of a large influx of data with a high level of background noise, including rumours and unrelated information, is labour-intensive. Identifying the most appropriate social media platform to use is also critical to ensure effectiveness. In this case, the use of Weibo for the A(H7N9) outbreak in China would be more appropriate than global social media platforms such as Twitter. Language barriers can pose additional challenges; our ability to access and accurately interpret information from Weibo was partly due to our being based in Singapore where Mandarin is an official language. Our experience showed that it may be beneficial for public health agencies to recruit and maintain a workforce of epidemiologists who are multilingual for international disease surveillance in a foreign language.",27.549967514643235,11.971742106983271

One limitation of the social media surveillance system is the initial difficulty in identifying reliable, consistent and timely information sources at the outset of surveillance since countless numbers of users would be posting on the topic of interest. Time is usually required to monitor the information put out by various users and to compare them against verified reports to insure their relevance for inclusion into the surveillance system. The other limitation is the veracity of the information. While the analyses of posts could be limited to those from verified users only, we observed that the study of posts from layman users provided an understanding of the actual situation and sentiments in the affected country.

The findings of our analysis demonstrate the potential for public health agencies to acquire time-sensitive information on rapidly evolving outbreaks occurring outside of their countries through social networking sites. In our analysis, Weibo served as a platform leveraged by central/provincial governments, local news agencies and the public for the timely release and retrieval of information. The Chinese social networking sites' timeliness of reporting are significantly better compared to international mainstream media in English, official websites of the central Chinese government and WHO. Information was released by the local news agencies on the social networking site in the local language before any reports in the conventional news websites or government websites. The information was subsequently amplified by the social networking sites through re-posting of the original report. This allowed the international community greater access to more detailed and timely information compared to that released at the central government level to the international media. The central Chinese government may have allowed the provincial/municipal health authorities to release information on new cases when available to ensure transparency and timeliness of public communications. The access to such timely, crowd-sourced information on infected cases greatly facilitated the understanding of the epidemiology of an unknown disease, which is key in developing effective prevention and control measures. public health practitioners, social media surveillance could provide early warning for unusual public health events in a foreign country and serve as an additional source of epidemiological intelligence to complement conventional surveillance tools. For local public health authorities, social media surveillance could function as an effective platform for public education and social mobilization. The underlying value coupled with the challenges of using social media warrants future research and collaboration between public health agencies and computational scientists to enhance its use in disease outbreak surveillance and response.",23.680750102334642,9.176736201531387

There is an understanding of the volatility of this non-peer reviewed medium but also a perception that social media is a place only for ""selfies"" and not science. Tweets can disappear to search after a short period, blog pages can come and go and be untraceably altered while online mainstream news stories, in some countries more than others, may suffer similar fates as they rapidly become old news. Despite that, internet-driven information has played a vital role in rapidly tracking and unearthing cases, clusters and outbreaks of disease in recent years. This has been the case for MERS globally. At this stage, many who follow infectious disease clusters, outbreaks and pandemics through social media are well informed by exposure to a distillation of the most recent events, reports, commentary and news stories from all over the world. Professionals who use this communication medium are clearly appreciated by their funding stakeholders, the public. Social media and blogs communicate with a much broader audience than is usually reached by the traditional scientific literature and they are more accessible to the local and global communities who contribute to the funds that researchers so dearly seek. Sometimes these forms of mass communication are useful to those seeking information about a disease outbreak in their own country. Sometimes they are entirely misleading. The public audience may not spend the time and mostly do not have the background expertise to interpret the densely presented, often slow to appear, scientific and public health literature. The space between the scientific literature and mainstream media is occupied by those science communicators who may, sometimes with and sometimes without relevant scientific training, be as up-to-date on their topics as the best academic epidemiologist. The President John F. Kennedy quote, ""One person can make a difference, and everyone should try"" seems an apt one to describe these dedicated people who, often without any paid incentives, devote their personal time, effort and money to better understand and communicate about infectious disease. Frequently updated data repositories such as the small FluTrackers group constantly compile, actively curate and condense worldwide news sources into threads of information that often assemble into patterns that can predict emerging infectious disease events well before they reach the mainstream media, and their line list of MERS-CoV detections (Ministry of Health, Saudi Arabia. 2014) has been a cornerstone of case numbering, detail and clarity; Crawford Kilian's H5N1 blog (Kilian, 2014) outstrips its name by providing links to other reliable sources as well as excerpts and highly eloquent and thought-provoking commentary on a range of microbial infectious disease stories, of which MERS-CoV is just one; Michael Coston's Avian Flu Diary (Coston, 2014 ) also focusses and comments on emerging infectious diseases augmented by astute and experienced public health commentary, resources and a large inventory of past posts that are used to good effect when creating new and informative ones; the Programme for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED) is an internet-based reporting system maintained by a panel of authoritative professionals and rapporteurs who prepare daily digests of the latest infectious disease happenings which they freely circulate using widely read emails (Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases, 2014); for a more workforce-oriented view of MERS and infectious disease, Shane Granger's Random Analytics provides an excellent perspective of the less frequently discussed impact of infectious diseases on humans (Granger, 2012) ; my own blog, Virology Down Under seeks to distill some of the more complex virology-related happenings and present data on emerging viral disease in a more graphical, accessible and open access way (Mackay, 1997 (Mackay, , 2013 ; Maia Majumder who applies an engineering systems expertise to the epidemiology of the disease (Majumder, 2014) . These are just a few resources and each is part of an interconnected web of other sources, contacts and personal experience that exist on the internet; they have all chased and tracked the emergence of MERS-CoV as doggedly as a professional science writer. Each resource is as distinct yet complimentary source of information that together are sometimes referred to as flublogia.

Many different social institutions contribute to the construction of specific public images of the target populations. The people and places at risk of contracting a disease are identified by the epidemiological studies but they do not necessarily become comprehensible to the masses. The public, the media, and the policy-makers begin to develop certain images about the disease and the at-risk people. According to Schneider and Ingram [13] , 'officials develop maps of target populations based on both the stereotypes they themselves hold and those they believe to prevail among the segments of the public likely to become important to them.' Formulation and shifts in policy for a particular group, subpopulation, or community depend on how they are viewed by policy-makers. Gauri and Liberman contend that where social institutions divide the population groups deeply, elites and common people perceive AIDS to be a disease of other people outside their community and who are unlikely to mingle with them [14] . When responsible authorities take 'us' and 'they' approach by prejudicially linking the disease with specific sections of the populations, AIDS policies remain misguided and fragmented. To illustrate, despite very similar socio-demographic setups, response to AIDS were very different in Brazil and South Africa; unlike Brazil where AIDS was considered a general threat for the entire population, AIDS was linked in South Africa with the racial issues and AIDS policy was marred with racial divisions [14] .",17.668852622691247,10.370854408923993

Review,"Is Transport through the Golgi Selective or Nonselective? Having considered the evidence for the compartmental organization of the Golgi and for the role of carrier vesicles in transport, we come to the last of the three general elements underlying our view of Golgi function, namely, that transport of passenger proteins through the Golgi is inherently nonselective (Pfeffer and Rothman, 1987) . The evidence for this view is largely indirect or negative, in that efforts to identify discrete signals on proteins that are required for forward transport have thus far been unsuccessful. On the other hand, as discussed above, there is now considerable evidence in favor of several distinct ""retenlion signals"" that effectively prevent forward transport of membrane or lumenal proteins after reaching their prescribed destinations in the ER or various Golgi compartments (Pelham, 1991) . If this view is correct, selectivity in I.ransport through the secretory pathway may occur by ""default,"" i.e., transport of passenger proteins proceeds owing to the absence of a retention signal. This concept, however, is not necessarily incompatible with the existence of selective signals for forward transport. It is clear that such signals exist and play an important role in directing the traffic of proteins as they leave the TGN. Examples include the mannose g-phosphate residues that specify transport of hydrolytic enzymes to lysosomes and Mellman, 1989) and the cytoplasmic domain determiinants that target newly synthesized membrane proteins to ithe basolateral surface of polarized cells (Hunziker et al., 1991a; Brewer and Roth, 1991) . Since the transport of ,fluorescent lipids from the Golgi to the plasma membrane Iin nonpolarized cells occurs very rapidly, it is thought that ""constitutive"" transport from the Golgi to the cell surface may not require specific signals . ,Analogous results were obtained in experiments in which a tripeptide containing a cognate site for N-linked glycosylation presumably also involved transport from the ER (Wieland et al., 1987; Helms et al., 1990) . While these experiments suggest that signals are not necessary for transport, the fact that they are released with rapid kinetics does not alone establish the absence of such signals.",12.711779741066312,7.62000284559147

Almost 800,000 children in the UK were taking ADHD medication; in Australia the number of children taking ADHD medication has doubled in the last decade reaching almost 70,000 by the end of 2013 (Corderoy 2014 ) . According to Thomas et al. ( 2013 ) , ""medication prescription rates have also increased twofold for children and fourfold for adolescents"" while ""the prevalence of parent reported diagnosis of ADHD in the US rose from 6.9 % in 1997 to 9.5 % in 2007. In the Netherlands it doubled over a similar period and other countries have also seen similar rises"". There has been a 41 % rise in diagnoses of ADHD among children aged 4-17 years in the US in the last decade; two-thirds of these young people are prescribed drugs such as Ritalin or Adderall leading to headlines such as ""Ritalin turned my son into a zombie"" ( The Star , 2014 ) teacher descriptions of students who have lost their ""life spark"" (Corderoy 2014 ) , and arguments that normal childhood behaviour is being pathologized and drugged as schools struggle to enforce curricula and norms that are no longer useful or appropriate. Children and adolescents are, in these views, losing social skills, energy and identity. The use of the zombie metaphor to give voice to the moral panic around children, technology and medication is telling. Young people, it turns out, are one of the broader social anxieties that zombies allow us to articulate.",16.081003333681824,8.198330518547596

The emergence of social media platforms both challenge preparedness and response while representing immediate communication channels for transmission of updates and messages (Rossmann et al. 2018) . Social media platforms can also amplify risk messages; however, the communication dynamics is multidirectional. Risk communication using Twitter, for example, will include postings and responses from experts, stakeholders, journalists, general public, and possibly automated bots (Mønsted et al. 2017 ). Journalists will use Twitter to gather new information and to disseminate news stories (Fellenor et al. 2017) .

Second, the appearance of social media such as Weibo and WeChat makes timing an essential factor in crisis communication.

Chinese social media helps balance the organizational power as the ""dominator"" and the public power as the ""challenger"" in crises. On the other hand, social media serves as an open-platform to all types of users, so it is hard to control information due to the highly engaged dialogic interactions. Messages online have the power of directing public opinion and can cause damage to an organization's reputation.

Contrasting with the social media system in Western countries such as the United States, the Chinese new media landscape contained a large number of highly engaged users. For instance, one of China's most popular social network, Sina Weibo has over 411 million monthly active users in the first quarter of 2018 (China Internet Watch, 2018), while Twitter only has 336 million users globally (Statista, 2018) .

On the one hand, scholars found that social media could facilitate organizations to monitor crisis issues, open up-to-date conversations with publics, cultivate critical relationships, and create transparency of organizational actions (Jin & Liu, 2010; Macias, Hilyard, & Freimuth, 2009 ). On the other hand, misinformation, rumors, negative opinions, and emotions were amplified on social media and crisis managers might lose control of official messages when user-generated contents emerged or even dominated the public opinion (Liu, Jin, Austin, & Janoske, 2012; Wigley & Fontenot, 2010) .",29.530014392230477,11.172731916877376

Scholars discussed antecedents that motivated publics to engage in dialogue on social media in crises, including a low-level of trust toward governments and traditional media, gratifications-sought from social media, and the increased-level of civic awareness and media literacy (Mou, 2014; Xie et al., 2016) . Results also showed that Chinese online publics are highly dependent on social media and a growing number of users have used social media to express and share opinions during public emergency events (Xie et al., 2016) . During the Sichuan earthquake, for example, grass-roots activists began to build up mutual trust, pave the way for more regular and extensive dialogue between online and offline activism (Lu, 2018) . In the ""occupy central"" social movement, large quantities of online publics also expressed their extreme voices through proactive dialogue with authorities (Luo & Zhai, 2017) . Finally yet importantly, the Chinese socialmediated dialogue consists of many nonverbal languages such as emoticons and figurative language. Scholars such as Kim et al. (2016) found that when Alibaba, China's largest e-commerce companyadopted an informal personable communication style in dialogue with their online publics in China, the communication outcomes were positive in terms of consumer sentiments. RQ3 explored how contextual characteristics in China affected the social-mediated dialogue in crises.

(2012) created a social-mediated crisis communication model, serving as the first theoretical framework to describe relationships between organizations, online and offline publics, social media, traditional media, and word-of-mouth communication before, during and after crises (Austin, Fraustino, Jin, & Liu, 2017) . This model has been widely tested using different methods such as experiments or interviews in the context of the United States. Scholars mainly discussed 1) how crisis information form, sources, crisis type and history might influence publics' (e.g., influential social media content creators, followers, and inactives) crisis responses; 2) how types of organizations (i.e., corporates, NPOs, and governments) may respond to publics effectively by adopting different crisis communication strategies (Liu, Jin, & Austin, 2013; Liu, Fraustino, & Jin, 2015) . Besides this SMCC model, scholars also applied four main blocks of theories to study the interplay between social media and crisis communication (Austin et al., 2017) . These theories included audience and stakeholder theories (e.g., uses and gratifications theory, media dependency theory, and spiral of silence theory), form or medium influence-based theories (e.g., media richness theory), source influencebased theories (e.g., dialogic public relations theory), and content influence-based theories (e.g., framing theory, image repair theory, and situational crisis communication theory). For instance, Lev-On (2012) adopted uses and gratifications (U & G) theory to examine publics' motivations of using social media in a natural disaster context. continued to use the U & G approach and examined publics' gratifications-sought on social media of mobile devices during an earthquake in mainland China.

Psychologic stress may be experienced differently by different people, and may be modulated by personal factors like age, sex, health status, baseline anxiety level and risk perception. More severe psychologic distress may be followed by increased levels of posttraumatic stress symptomatology 59 . Psychological distress may be related to increased work load due to coworker absenteeism, lack of socialization with friends and colleagues, lack of recreational activities due to the closure of gyms, restaurants, movie theaters and other recreational avenues, and increased family stress and parenting issues due to children being at home as a result of school closings. It may also relate to having a friend or family member affected by the disease. All healthcare workers may also feel anxious and stressed due to the fear of contracting the disease, fear of transmitting the disease to members of the family, or financial fears related to the changes implemented during this period.

Providing emotional support and an opportunity to discuss any personal and family concerns is crucial during these times.

The apprehension often moves from the political to the social level (especially at the level of the individual), following perceived possibility of transmissions. Smith et al.

Using such data in predictive mathematical modeling could generate early warnings to inform public health interventions that would aim in epidemic mitigation. 65 Communications Social media Analysis of data collected through social media applications presents new opportunities as well as challenges in emerging infectious diseases surveillance.

During the study period, no severe cases and no deaths were reported. The hypotheses that the adoption of the 3 types of preventive behaviors was associated with cognitive factors such as perceived efficacy of the preventive measure, perceived chance of having a large scale outbreak, and perceived nonavailability of vaccine were largely supported by the results of this study. Similar factors were identified in the recently published UK study. 10 Moreover, similar factors were associated with adoption of different types of preventive behaviors protecting people from contracting SARS 12 or human avian flu. 13 The similarities are not unexpected because the aforementioned perception factors were derived from general health behavioral theories (such as the health belief model), which can be applied to understanding different types of preventive behaviors. It is hence important to keep track of changes in perceptions toward new emerging respiratory infectious diseases because modification of these perceptions may result in promotion of preventive behaviors. Consistent with the finding of the UK study, 10 our study showed that people with a higher level of mental distress because of A/H1N1 were more likely to adopt some of the 3 preventive measures. A Web-based study conducted in Norway reported the impact of fear and anxiety on people's decision making in the context of imminent influenza pandemic. 16 The result revealed that a certain level of fear and concern might lead to desirable preventive behaviors. One challenge for health policy makers and workers is to allay public anxiety without adversely impacting on positively protective behaviors particularly among single, male, and younger people who were less likely than others to use preventive measures to prevent influenza A/H1N1.

Nevertheless, the Chinese government assigned responsibility for censorship of the media, including the Internet, to local agencies. 5 In the new media age, in which social media (including the Internet, short message services, and mobile applications) are centralized, the government restricts freedom of expression in the same way as it has restricted such freedom among traditional media sources, such as newspapers, radio, and television. 6 The control of the acquisition of information is more difficult in this new age because social media are tools not only for the dissemination, sharing, and seeking of health information but also for the expression of feelings and the sharing of personal experiences and opinions. 7, 8 Therefore, organizations need to build effective communication tools to respond to emerging infectious disease (EID) outbreaks because the public may express scientific skepticism about scientific topics and participation in decision-making. 9 During epidemics, people usually require guidance on how to behave from a trusted source. The government and public institutions are the ideal sources because people tend to rely on the national administration. For this reason, trust in these institutions plays a main role in the public's acceptance of policies and actions. 10 The World Health Organization suggested that outbreak communication should incorporate the following 5 key factors: (1) building, maintaining, or restoring trust; (2) announcing early; (3) maintaining transparency; (4) understanding the public; and (5) planning of all aspects of the response to an outbreak. 11 Therefore, risk communication enhances the decision-making ability of laypeople, and can be examined by assessing risk perception. 12 Trust in not only the government and public agencies but also in the media and other institutions may be associated with risk perception.

In addition, while responsiveness to an emergency was associated directly with overreaction and compliance with self-quarantine, willingness to sacrifice was associated only with compliance with self-quarantine. Personal characteristics were associated with responsive behaviors; however, the reasons for these associations could not be determined. One possibility is nationalism. Individuals who regard nations as abstract communities with shared emotional bonds governed by rules and/or norms tend to be altruistic. 32 Therefore, people in Table 5 Associations of risk perception, knowledge, and personal characteristics with overreaction in one's own behavior societies governed by established, systematic rules are less likely to exhibit unusual behaviors that may lead to social panic. Moreover, inaccurate information is disseminated through social media platforms, such as Twitter, Facebook, and Google. The enormous influence of social media during the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa has led to exaggerated concerns even among the population in the United States with negligible risks. 33 Indeed, the mass media can also incite panic, which is related to fear and antisocial behavior 34 ; however, when they do their job properly, they can inform the public accurately about current conditions. Two studies in which a mobile health communication tool was used demonstrated the effectiveness of a social media-based approach in terms of changing vaccination behavior. 35, 36 Furthermore, the provision of appropriate and timely public health information by social media and the mobile health tool could accelerate the detection of disease outbreaks and enhance the public's response, 37 thereby minimizing adverse health and economic effects. 38 The findings of our study are depicted in schematic form in Figure 2 . In this model, risk perception was related to various factors such as sex, trust, and other personal characteristics. There was a notable aspect of risk perception: it was directly associated with overreaction, but not with compliance to self-quarantine. This suggests that risk perception motivates self-protective behavior, possibly resulting in overreaction. However, it does not automatically result in compliance to quarantine, which is generally perceived as protecting others, rather than oneself. In this sense, risk perception is a double-edged sword: at an optimal level, it helps the public protect themselves from infection and thereby deter the spread of epidemic; however, when excessive and characterized by fear, it can lead to other social problems, such as overreaction and discrimination. Sandman reported that risk perception is comprised of hazard and outrage. 39 The MERS outbreak caused fear and anxiety among the population, which might have resulted in an overreaction to both the response of the government and the behaviors of themselves and others. 40 Our model also points to the importance of trust in medical experts and proper knowledge. These 2 factors demonstrate the potential to maximize the benefit by promoting compliance and reducing overreaction. Therefore, risk communication should not just scare people, but should create a context in which there is trust and a flow of knowledge and clear information between the authorities and the public. These conditions should prevent adverse effects, particularly in democratic states. The existing literature emphasizes these essential components of risk management and risk communication. 41, 42 To date, there are a limited number of studies on risk perception of infectious diseases (including MERS); therefore, this work makes an important contribution to the field. Several factors affecting perceived risk were evaluated (eg, trust in the media or health policy, personal characteristics), which were not assessed in previous studies. Although knowledge and trust have been previously reported to be associated with perceived risk, 17, 18 this study further explored possible effects of risk perception and their implications in responding to an epidemic. EIDs are unfamiliar to the general public and are likely to be overestimated in the risk, 31 possibly leading to social panic. To prevent this, it is important to boost the risk communication with fostering trust and relevant knowledge, which requires transparency.",28.57665086371063,10.944219817755874

The IoT-derived data, if obtained with the highest standards of ethics and secured with the highest standards of security, will enable us to better track and control infectious diseases globally. In most studies, the parameters that show high dependence for dissemination of infections are the role played by the individuals and their close environment. As such, social interactions are very important drivers of infectious diseases transmission. Social interactions are probably even more important for primates and other group-living animals (Rushmore et al., 2017) . Network analysis becomes a must not only to better control zoonosis but also to understand how in a group of individuals, be it animals, the social interactions shape the infectious disease dynamics. Human studies have shown how social media data (Lim et al., 2017) could be used to map infectious diseases that have not yet been identified by public health institutions. Using unsupervised machine learning model (i) no name of disease and (ii) no symptoms as a bottom-up approach. Our interpretation and review of the method is that by avoiding the integration of the name of the infection and the symptoms, there is more change to cover diseases and unknown diseases and to also enrich the databased related to known infectious diseases. Because most of the terms used in social media (symptoms, body parts, and pain locations) are not the scientific/medical level often reported by health-care institution it is more likely to cover a wide range of individuals and as such outputs with a denser geographical area. Although the study was limited in time (8 months), the validation was performed with accurate (electronic medical records) from a small group of individuals (n ¼ 104), and the model was able to predict with a high precision, recall and F values on average above 0.7 (Lim et al., 2017) . This suggests that sentiments expressed in social media is still valuable information, despite their heterogeneity and better classification of sentiments should be a priority for the next generation of social media-related studies. This approach of mass data to identify specific signals may enable us to enter into the era of personalized medicine. In line with this, patient similarity using electronic medical record has been successfully used to recommend treatments (Wang et al., 2015) . The diagnoses, demographic data, vital signs, and structures laboratory results were used for similarity testing. The addition of an intelligence to the electronic medical record may enables us to reach a precision >0.8.

The concept of stigma is broad and encompasses several dimensions including internalized, anticipated, and enacted stigma (Earnshaw, Smith, Chaudoir, Amico, & Copenhaver, 2013). While anticipated and enacted stigma involve experiences with others, internalized stigma is a result of self-evaluation based on long-held values and beliefs, and associated with affective health (Earnshaw et al., 2013). Shame is one of the components measured in internalized stigma and it is posited that people with HIV who feel ashamed of their HIV status may have difficulty developing or maintaining positive perceptions of their HIV status (Earnshaw et al., 2013).

In Australia, for example, bush fires impose a regular risk for many households. The preparedness of individual households can make a difference between life and death. The National Partnership Agreement on Natural Disaster Resilience in Australia therefore emphasises the significance of involving multiple parties including individuals.41 Emergency response systems are often complex and adaptive. A highly participatory strategy would encourage individuals to take more responsibility, become less dependent on the government and leave more resources for others.42 Trust in the government is important given that it is most likely to play a coordinating role in emergency events.43 However, over-reliance on the government and professional workers could dampen household efforts for future disasters.44 A study of postearthquake survivors in China showed that high expectations of the public on the government are associated with high trust in the government, leading to increased complacency in individual efforts in preparedness.16 In China, governmental response to disasters from the military force has often been extraordinarily rapid and efficient. For example, an earthquake-relief headquarter was established by the army 18 min after the earthquake strike in Ya’an and 5000–6000 rescue workers were deployed on the same day but people need to realise that there is always a gap before the full functioning of external rescue assistance, a gap which needs to be filled by the survivors of disasters.7 Poor cooperation from those being rescued can also jeopardise professional efforts.",7.4940753318129865,5.439618861480614

It is deemed a cost-effective investment in preventing losses and is considered one of the four priority areas in the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030 which has been endorsed by the third United Nations World Conference in Japan.4 Over the past few decades, emergency response efforts have evolved from a focus on top-down relief assistance to a more comprehensive strategy with a greater emphasis on community participation and pre-event preparedness for better risk management. This is because emergency victims often face geographical isolation as a result of damage to local infrastructure such as energy, road and communication facilities.5 Consequently, the arrival of external rescue support may experience two or more days of delay.6 But rescue efforts in the first couple of days in disastrous events are critical.7 Community and household preparedness in self-rescue efforts prior to the arrival of external assistance may result in the difference between the chance of survival and death.8 Empirical evidence shows that sufficient household preparedness can significantly mitigate the negative consequences of emergency events.9

For our participants, who are all highly socially connected, a day of social isolation was a very large deviation from typical rates of social interaction. Although being alone is not inherently aversive for people (i.e., when chosen intentionally, solitude can be restful and rejuvenating (80, 81) ), our isolation paradigm was subjectively aversive: participants felt more uncomfortable and less happy at the end of the day. In the current paradigm, isolation was likely made more salient by the externally mandated (not personally chosen) restrictions on participants' behaviour, including bans on email, social media, fiction, films, music, and other forms of virtual and fictional connectedness(82) (though participants did have access to games, puzzles, and reading material). The cessation of virtual social interaction was a substantial change: typical young adults currently use social media for social interactions more than two hours per day (83) .

Indeed, several peculiarities of media narratives around public health hazards 17 and infectious diseases 18 have been elucidated, but a general and quantitative comprehension of how the public opinion responds to media exposure during an emerging epidemic threat is still lacking. The majority of modeling studies assume that media exposure is driving behavioural changes, hence media exposure effects are incorporated into some kind of media function that modulates individual behaviors and may affect disease dynamics [19] [20] [21] . The general assumption is that as the number of cases increases and is reported by mass media, the susceptibility of individuals will decrease due to increasing awareness and the associated behavioral changes 20 . However, for most disease outbreaks, such an assumption has never been supported by direct empirical evidence.

It also found that handwashing behaviour before eating food was lower, and unfortunately, only 8% of their study participants stated that they use soap for washing their hands at the baseline. It also noticed that handwashing knowledge and practices were relatively lower before cooking, serving and eating food [26] . Furthermore, socioeconomic status, including education, have shown a positive association with handwashing, which are similar to our current study findings. During outbreaks such as COVID-19, information regarding safety measures should be selflessly promoted by the news channels, print media, radio stations, and social media, as almost every individual relates to either of these platforms at some point in a day. Around three fourth of respondents in a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted in Nigeria have stated that they have acquired good handwashing measures by watching health education messages from social media, newspapers and radio channels [27] .",18.38893885591104,5.228307889029045

Instead, the participants could choose themselves when to run the app which might have biased some to choose a particularly 'interesting' day when they are going to meet a lot of people, or travel somewhere unusual. In addition, the participants themselves were not sampled at random from the population but instead chose to take part. How they heard about the study might might have varied from whether they were reached through social media in the drive to recruit participants before broadcast, or consequent to watching the BBC4 programme, or through hearing about it from friends -all of which could lead to selection bias. Given the big social media exposure around the citizen science project, our participants were recruited largely in two time periods: in October 2017 after the launch of the app, and in March 2018 after the airing of the documentary 'Contagion! The BBC4 Pandemic', but the uneven recruitment of participants over time should not have much impact. There is evidence, at least among school-aged children, that social contact structure during term-time is relatively consistent over a period of several months [19] . Contacts can also change between term-time and school-holidays [8] and with the health status of participants; individuals typically make fewer social contacts when they have ILI compared to a normal day [28] ].

The implications of misunderstanding the real dynamic of the COVID-19 pandemic are extremely dangerous. Ethnic or social discrimination resulting from unsupported assumptions on viral contagion -often amplified by irresponsible, uncontrollable communications -can be highly damaging for people and countries. In particular, the US-based NextStrain (4) team has been posting real-time updates on the epidemic tracing by molecular analyses. Despite (social) media are often vehicle for fake news and boast news hype, it is also worth noting the tremendous effort of the scientific community to provide free, up-to-date information on ongoing studies, as well as critical evaluations. Several discussions and evidence-based debates on controversial hypotheses on the epidemic have ensued -such as the number of untraced infections in the US, the putative virus introduction in Italy through Germany, and the alleged lineage diversification in China (5) later criticized (6) . Recently, an editorial published on Science (7) has also highlighted how unsupported or misleading claims circulating in forums, social media, and even peer-reviewed articles, have been led by a substantial over interpretation of the available data. Hence, the urgency to reframe the current debate in more rigorous scientific terms, and quantitatively evaluate whether sufficient information for reliable phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies currently exists, or which gaps need to be addressed.

Our study found that social media (e.g., Sina Microblog) can be used to measure public attention to public health emergencies. During the epidemic of the novel coronavirus, a large amount of information about the COVID-19 epidemic was disseminated on Sina Microblog and received widespread public attention.

We used the Sina Microblog hot search list to analyze the public's attention to the COVID-19 epidemic from December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020, which was 52 days after the first disclosure of COVID-19 by the Chinese health department. There are four main findings from this study. First, we analyzed the changing trend of public attention given to the COVID-19 epidemic, which can be divided into three stages. Second, the hot topic keywords of the public's attention at each stage are slightly different. In addition, the public's emotional tendency toward the hot search topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic changed from negative to neutral across the study period. As a whole, negative emotions weakened, and positive emotions increased. Finally, we divided the topics of public concern about the COVID-19 epidemic into five categories through social semantic network analysis. This study analyzes the public's response to and attention given to the COVID-19 epidemic, which will help public health professionals monitor public response, identify public needs as early as possible, make timely public health prevention and control measures, and disseminate knowledge to citizens in a targeted manner to better respond to the current COVID-19 epidemic.",18.709770051972118,6.5715368190582755
