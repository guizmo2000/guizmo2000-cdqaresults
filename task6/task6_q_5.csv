As opposed to the DPO strategy, the myopic policy is reactive, rather than predictive, as it allocates resources regardless of the remaining availability and the overall cross-regional pandemic status. In contrast, the DPO model distributes resources trying to balance the impact of actual outbreaks and the expected impact of potential outbreaks. It does so by exploiting regionspecific effectiveness of mitigation resources and dynamic reassessment of pandemic spread probabilities, using a set of regression submodels. Hence, we believe that in scenarios involving regions with a more heterogeneous demographics, the DPO policy will likely to perform even better and with less variability than the myopic strategy. We also note that the difference in the model performance was particularly noticeable at lower levels of resource availability, which is in accordance with a higher marginal utility of additional availability at that levels. We thus believe that the DPO model can be particularly useful in scenarios with very limited resources.",26.46527819644499,12.793523185291697

It is key to ensure that proper data can be obtained for model construction during the early stage of an outbreak. To address this concern, public health authority should work closely with other government departments to work out accurate epidemiology data. Modelling researchers should also liaise with public health authority to ensure the required data can be obtained. Second, to reflect the real situation, future modelling studies should evaluate intervention tools under resource-constrained situations and how to allocate resources at different epidemic stages. Third, although SARS and MERS are both classified as coronavirus, the transmission heterogeneity, differences in relative exposure patterns [3] and practicability of control measures determine the optimal solutions for their containment. Geographic disparity of Ro estimate for SARS in 2003 due to different disease and community dependent transmission rate [45] highlighted the need for different levels of contact tracing approach during the epidemics. Forth, both hospital and community setting with the superspreading events should be included in the transmission dynamics of Co-V outbreak to characterize the role of contact tracing in curbing the escalation of number of infections contributed by super-spreaders. Fifth, modelling approach can provide the condition that contact tracing effectively control the outbreak. Sometimes, politicians or health policy makers may hesitate to implement contact tracing. For example, SARS transmission in high-rise buildings among residents of Amoy Gardens suggested possible airborne transmission [46, 47] and government officials were prone to political pressures regarding quarantine. With the help of mathematical models, they can decide when to adopt contact tracing if certain conditions are satisfied. Last but not least, model developers should incorporate factors regarding pre-symptomatic transmission and limited resources allocation against the epidemics at the beginning of the outbreak. Resources optimization and quarantine prioritization by target population will be the next step epidemiologists or modelers should focus on for the challenges of new emerging Co-V epidemics in the future. Two typical examples of the refinement of the current quarantine approach are household quarantine and quarantine based on residential geographic location. In addition to restricting movement in a particular geographic region and recommendation of infectious household members to stay home, other tracing approaches including identifying contacts at workplace or school can also be considered.",14.725430096965109,10.768499344610547

Moreover, this policy provided an incentive for households to participate: presumed-infectious individuals could expect to be prioritized for health care by entering isolation and would protect household members by leaving the home.

In the case of infectious diseases, we may be able to identify those at increased risk of contracting or transmitting infection, or those more or less likely to respond to interventions, before we have safe and effective interventions to offer, or before policy can be modified. Another major ethical challenge results from the variability in the predictive value of genotypic information and how such information can be used to inform risk management policy when our understanding of risk is inexact. The significance of genomic information, and the uses to which it is put, may give rise to the following specific ELSI-related concerns: (1) an imbalance in health-related benefits and harms to individuals and populations; (2) privacy and confidentiality of personal information, autonomy, choice and limitations on liberty; (3) the social and behavioral impact of genomic information on individuals, family members and others; and (4) the equitable distribution of scarce resources. Although these issues are not unique to infectious diseases, they need to be considered as our scientific understanding of the role of genomics in infectious disease management advances. What may be unique at the intersection of genomics and infectious disease control are ethical challenges that stem from the inherent tension between the goals of personalized medicine, which are to benefit particular individuals, and those of public health -to benefit and protect entire populations.",15.153549120148302,8.527856353781718

Essentially, we visually picked out a 6-10-nucleotide candidate region close to the beginning of each of the eight strands of the flu genome that appeared mostly conserved. The algorithm scanned each set of sequences for this segment and added an appropriate number of spaces to the beginning of each for a rough alignment. Using BioEdit [49] , we simply looked for sequences that were misaligned and inserted gaps where necessary to complete the alignment, paying close attention to codon usage.

One of the aims was to assess the impact of the database compared to the algorithms on performance. Interestingly, we observed that the database that we provided enabled participants to get as good results as they would get using their own in-house database ( Figure 6 ). One reason for this finding may be that participating laboratories have hired bioinformaticians and dedicate resources in (semi-automatically/automatically) refining their internal databases and do not simply download all NCBI viruses, likely achieving already good quality databases similar to the one we provided. Thus, in our settings (i.e., rather common viruses and Swiss clinical context), it appears that the impact of the database was rather low on the overall performance. It is however unclear how generalizable this finding may be, given the limited number of tested viruses in our samples and the small number of participating laboratories. Since we did not test several databases of varying qualities, we would still recommend taking advantage of the expert curated databases that are being published (cf. Material and Methods and references therein) to optimize the speed of bioinformatics workflow, decrease the false positive calls in general (cf. Figure S20) , and also increase sensitivity for less sequenced viruses.

Values of p c ¼ 50% and h ¼ 30% were assumed for baseline intervention scenarios (Table 1 ; Figures  2 and 3 ).

In deciding whether to implement any or all of the policies described here, local public health officials may wish to consider available epidemiological data (to assess R 0 and h) and also estimate the levels of compliance that could be achieved for the different options in their populations. As compliance may be higher for policies that provide immediate benefits to the individual, we suggest that compliance will be low for Q, higher for QI and QA, and higher still for QIA. It is likely that the provision of anti-viral prophylaxis and treatment would increase compliance substantially. Our baseline assumption of 50% compliance is intended to be conservative. Intuitively, it seems likely that household-based interventions would work with high levels of compliance. Here, we have shown that even moderate levels of compliance would allow household-based public health interventions to be effective.

Because quarantine increases the average time spent at home substantially for most people, the value of this parameter may be greater than unity (e Q ¼ 2 at baseline; see Table 1) . Also, the level of transmission in isolation may be higher than elsewhere. We assumed that the degree of transmission in isolation was a factor of e I greater (e I ¼ 1 at baseline; see Table 1 ), i.e., the basic reproductive number inside transmission was equal to e I R 0 (see Protocol S1). Note that we assumed that for all policies, those individuals with symptoms severe enough to be hospitalized (see Figure 1 ) would be isolated. Hence, policies without explicit isolation elements used isolation resources. Also, we assumed that all those in isolation received anti-viral treatment. Hence, policies without explicit anti-viral elements used anti-viral doses. We modeled compliance at the individual level: a symptomatic individual in a household that was not quarantined decided for herself if she reported, but the other members of her household made independent decisions for themselves.

These 'high-risk' EIDs were also shown to be biased toward a few 'high-value' wildlife species (bats, rodents and non-human primates (NHPs)). This realization that global resources need to be allocated toward countries that have the highest likelihood of high-risk EIDs [4] has led to the recent implementation of surveillance programs (e.g., USAID Emerging Pandemic Threats (EPT) program (superseded by EPT-2 in 2014)) targeting 'high-value' target wildlife species in 'hotspot' areas prone to EIDs.

The development and identification of standardized definitions of LTFU can inform cohort analyses [2, 3] , program evaluations [4] and tracing mechanisms. While LTFU can be considered a general 'catch-all' category for patients who miss scheduled clinic visits or medication pick-ups [5] , different definitions of LTFU within ART programs can have a significant impact on LTFU estimates over time [2, 4] . For example, in their 2013 study Shepherd et al., reported that cumulative estimates of LTFU varied widely, ranging from 22 % to 84 %; this variation was primarily dependent on the definition of LTFU that was applied [4] . This, in turn, has significant implications for program planning purposes such as the development of targeted strategies to improve retention. Current methods to assess LTFU rates have relied largely on fixed time period cohort approaches, primarily through the use of retrospective cohort analyses. Attrition rates are often reported as proportions of patients who meet a specific outcome at various time points since ART initiation (e.g., 6 months, 12 months) [5] [6] [7] , although definitions of outcome measures over a specified period of follow-up are generally unclear [8] . Importantly, there is no gold standard to measure retention in care, and different measures (e.g., missed visits, frequency of visits) have different advantages and limitations [9] [10] [11] . Generally, when such information is reported and available, patients who are known to have died, stopped ART or transferred out are generally excluded in reported LTFU rates. In addition to a general call for enhanced data on losses to follow-up [8] , there has also been a push toward developing more evidencebased definitions [3, 12, 13] that minimize the misclassification of patients as LTFU. Related to this is the need for LTFU definitions that can be used for clinical management purposes. A clinical management definition of LTFU may be particularly useful in settings, such as Malawi, where limited resources are available for tracing. Indeed, high costs and a shortage of human resources necessary for finding missing patients have contributed to a backlog of patients needing to be traced in our setting. Identifying patients earlier who are risk of becoming lost and at risk of experiencing poor clinical outcomes has implications for patient retention overall. At the same time, if patients are prematurely classified as lost, limited resources may be used to trace individuals who ultimately will return on their own. Therefore, a LTFU definition specific to clinical management can inform clinicians of the optimum time to initiate the tracing process (in real time) in such a way that both patient and health system outcomes are maximized.",19.107916222372282,11.656401242043097

For example, a high incidence prediction could lead to a public health department using its limited resources to deploy costly measures (e.g., mosquito spraying). One consideration is whether it is more important to use a model with a high PPV or a high Sensitivity. A high PPV indicates that, when the model predicts high incidence rate, high incidence is very likely to actually occur. When disease prevention and mitigation resources are limited, it is very important to have high PPV. Based on feedback from the local public health departments in Peru, there was a desire for a dengue prediction model with high PPV [20] . To reduce morbidity and mortality, public health departments also want to be able to mitigate any real outbreaks without being caught unprepared. A high Sensitivity indicates that the model predicts a high percentage of the outbreaks that actually occur. If PPV is high and Sensitivity is low, it means that when an outbreak is predicted, the probability is high that it will occur, but only a small percentage of actual outbreaks are predicted. In an attempt to illustrate these differences, the F-score [45] was introduced.",17.209763608986158,9.537018566245742

Limiting results about the exactness of different ODE models assume that both the number of individuals infectious and the network size are large, and so the early behaviour of simulations, when there are few infectious individuals, is often dominated by stochastic effects. There are different ways to address this issue, but even after this has been done, there are two sources of deviation of simulations from their deterministic limit. The first of these is the number of simulations realised. If there is a summary statistic such as the mean number of infectious individuals over time, then the confidence interval in such a statistic can be made arbitrarily small by running additional simulations, but agreement between the deterministic limit and a given realisation may still be poor. The second source of deviation is the network size. By increasing the number of nodes, the prediction interval within which the infection curve will fall can be made arbitrarily small; however, the computational resources needed to simulate extremely large networks can quickly become overwhelming.",14.763906373648748,8.956983100299155

It is key to ensure that proper data can be obtained for model construction during the early stage of an outbreak. To address this concern, public health authority should work closely with other government departments to work out accurate epidemiology data. Modelling researchers should also liaise with public health authority to ensure the required data can be obtained. Second, to reflect the real situation, future modelling studies should evaluate intervention tools under resource-constrained situations and how to allocate resources at different epidemic stages. Third, although SARS and MERS are both classified as coronavirus, the transmission heterogeneity, differences in relative exposure patterns [3] and practicability of control measures determine the optimal solutions for their containment. Geographic disparity of Ro estimate for SARS in 2003 due to different disease and community dependent transmission rate [45] highlighted the need for different levels of contact tracing approach during the epidemics. Forth, both hospital and community setting with the superspreading events should be included in the transmission dynamics of Co-V outbreak to characterize the role of contact tracing in curbing the escalation of number of infections contributed by super-spreaders. Fifth, modelling approach can provide the condition that contact tracing effectively control the outbreak. Sometimes, politicians or health policy makers may hesitate to implement contact tracing. For example, SARS transmission in high-rise buildings among residents of Amoy Gardens suggested possible airborne transmission [46, 47] and government officials were prone to political pressures regarding quarantine. With the help of mathematical models, they can decide when to adopt contact tracing if certain conditions are satisfied. Last but not least, model developers should incorporate factors regarding pre-symptomatic transmission and limited resources allocation against the epidemics at the beginning of the outbreak. Resources optimization and quarantine prioritization by target population will be the next step epidemiologists or modelers should focus on for the challenges of new emerging Co-V epidemics in the future. Two typical examples of the refinement of the current quarantine approach are household quarantine and quarantine based on residential geographic location. In addition to restricting movement in a particular geographic region and recommendation of infectious household members to stay home, other tracing approaches including identifying contacts at workplace or school can also be considered.",14.337703408328245,10.632795003587646

These challenges were shared in all regions where the meetings occurred. Participants agreed that because of the cultural and regional variations, a ""one size fits all"" approach to any planning and response activity is unlikely to be optimal and should be questioned and challenged. However, although differences were acknowledged, there were also shared understanding and general agreement on the importance of the ethical values discussed at the meetings. Participants felt that planning and response should take into account contextual variations and cultural differences. Additionally, participants discussed the issue of resource allocation within the framework of transparency, especially when preferential treatment is given to the most powerful community members as opposed to the most vulnerable. The African meeting participants affirmed the importance of providing resources to the young, but noted important differences in perspectives among countries. Many African societies give higher status to the elderly than to other age groups. With a life expectancy for some African countries in the 40s and even 30s, the proportion of the population composed of young children is much higher than in other countries. Thus, in African countries, a preference of allocating scarce resources to children would leave little resources for other segments of the population. Generally, African countries are much more rural than are countries of other continents, making access to villages difficult, whether by road, telephone, or internet. Although meeting attendees did not feel that rural or urban habitation should be a criterion for allocation of resources, they anticipated that logistical challenges would make it so. These concerns are dwarfed, however, by the likelihood that resources such as antivirals and vaccine will be far scarcer in African countries than elsewhere because of the continent's dual challenge of weak economies coupled with the number of other endemic health challenges, such as malaria and HIV/ AIDS. With few resources at hand, the ethical imperative to respond to pandemic influenza may fall below that of addressing hyperendemic fatal diseases. Each of the countries represented in the Asian meeting had a pandemic flu preparedness plan that addressed allocation issues and maintained a national stockpile of antiviral drugs. In most cases, biological vulnerability determined priority; thus, the very young or very old, pregnant women, and immunecompromised individuals tended to be prioritized to receive antiviral drugs. However, as Asian cultures exhibit more hierarchy than those in the West, more honor is accorded to the elderly, senior staff, royalty, and public service personnel in Asian cultures. In addition, it is expected that relatives and friends of the powerful will be unofficially prioritized to receive limited resources, without that being considered unethical. Indeed, in many Asian contexts, such prioritization is viewed as a social obligation (eg, a health worker would consider offering antivirals from the limited supply to a senior official before offering the resources to a person in one of the official priority groups). Nevertheless, participants expressed disapproval of officials who abuse their power and demand or extort limited resources for themselves. One participant described a shortage of N95 face masks (masks that can filter at least 95% of particles from the air) during the SARS epidemic. Although some people were willing to pay twice the regular price for a N95 mask, yielding to this demand would in effect favor protection for the rich over the poor. The participants felt the government had a duty to enforce price controls in order to ensure an adequate supply. As an example of enforcing price controls, one government instituted licensing for antiretroviral distribution to put a ceiling on the costs of the medications. Some of the Asian perspectives on ethical distribution differed by religion. An appeal to Buddhist beliefs stated a priority for those who are most severely ill, and the young making sacrifices for their elders. A priority for women and children was expressed with reference to Catholic values. When a choice must be made between a mother and her child, participants at the Asian meeting felt that Catholic values would typically give preference to the mother. Some Asian nations include island archipelagoes. It will be difficult for populations living on minor remote islands to access medical services and resources during a pandemic. The participants questioned whether their country plans address the challenges that certain geographical conditions may place on the equitable distribution of resources. Many participants of the Latin American meeting thought that individual rights were paramount and that during a pandemic a clear communication plan that includes community input into the process for drug allocation would help avoid panic. They emphasized the importance of including all sectors of society, including the private sectors, migrants, and minorities in public health decision-making process. Issues such as discrimination and stigmatization of certain sectors of the population must be addressed before an emergency situation arises. Meeting participants stressed that emergency plans should take into account the diversity of population, must be transparent, and favor equal distribution of resources. At the Eastern Mediterranean meeting, participants discussed the need to evaluate ""what is good for you versus what is good for others.

Because NPIs disrupt daily societal functions, it is important that they be implemented judiciously. This requires identifying effective initiating triggers, which is a challenging research task. Implementing NPIs will impede influenza spread; on the other hand, normal societal functions will be interrupted. The optimal control method takes both aspects into account and tries to find the best balance between them, given the decision makers relative weighting of the two. Based on Figures 2 and 3 , early implementation for moderate and severe pandemic is very important for NPIs to have impact on the outbreak and the impact is effective only if NPIs are implemented early. Late NPI implementation might still be optimal, but the impact is much less. For a severe pandemic, it is optimal to trigger NPIs at the beginning stage when susceptible population is large and infectious population is small. If we miss the beginning stage, it is not optimal to implement NPIs until the outbreak is significantly progressed. This is because once the pathogen achieves a certain level of infection, NPIs are not effective against it, and thus are not worth the cost. That is, the benefit of NPIs at a stage when the disease has progressed significantly is less than the cost of NPI implementation. This finding supports the CDC pandemic mitigation guidelines, which state that when the pandemic is Category 4 or 5, all NPIs are recommended for early implementation [7] . Furthermore, earlier NPI implementation reduces and delays the peak of the outbreak as illustrated Figures 3(a) and 3(b), which allows additional time for vaccine development. If a severe pandemic occurs, hospitals will experience an overwhelming influx of patients and need to operate at their surge capacities. Earlier NPI implementation can reduce the magnitude of infectious at the peak, which relieves some of the burden on hospitals and other health care infrastructures. In contrast, NPIs are not nearly as effective if disease has already spread into the community as the cases shown in Figures 3(c) and 3 (d). In both cases, NPIs are triggered after the peak of the outbreak, where hospitals might have already been operating at their surge capacities for a few weeks. Both cases start at states falling on the control thresholds recommended in Figures 2(c) and 2(d) [37] . This finding indicates that the additional complexity of our model is warranted when compared with the SI model used in [37] . Timely and sensitive surveillance systems are key to successful application of the optimal control method as knowledge of both the pathogen characteristics and the community state are assumed. The surveillance systems should be able to identify the virus quickly and provide accurate estimates for parameters which characterize the severity of an influenza. The effectiveness of the control policy depends on the accuracy of these estimates, which include infection rate b, death rate τ and recovery rate g. Once the control policy is computed, we also need to track the community state to determine if NPIs should be triggered. As early NPI implementation is found to be much more effective, we do not want to miss the beginning stage of the outbreak. Thus, the surveillance system should also estimate the community state, including the size of the infectious and susceptible populations.",19.087244136849023,10.955444050134858

In addition, we investigated the effect of these parameters on the outcome of applying the control policy, defined as the mean cumulative death, d T . We simulated the SIRD system under the optimal policy starting from all state (s 0 , i 0 , r 0 , d 0 ), where s 0 > 80%, i 0 <20%, and d 0 = 0. The simulation was terminated at a randomly selected exponential terminal time, and we recorded and analyzed the cumulative number of deaths. The mean cumulative death was calculated by taking the average of cumulative deaths over all tested initial states. Table 3 summarizes the estimated probability distribution functions (PDFs) of five input parameters, assuming the input parameters are statistically independent. The PDFs of influenza transmission characteristics (R 0 , 1/g, and 1/τ) are estimated based on the 1918 pandemic [25] . Note that the infection rate b can be written as R 0 (g + τ). The effect of NPIs, b, was found to reduce the infection rate, b, by up to 30-50% in 1918 and in many cases the effect of NPIs was very limited [11] ; thus we assume the impact of NPI implementation, b, follows Uniform(0,50%). We are not able to find any empirical data on the cost of NPI, c. This value is a relative cost, which depends on decision makers' perceptions of saving lives versus maintenance of daily societal functions.

The SHSO oversees the operation of the six directorates (see Fig. 2 ) covering the Cypriot population: nationally, the capital district, the remaining four districts, as well as primary care, mental health and ambulatory services. In the effort to support the operating hospitals and clinics within each directorate, academic departments providing training to the healthcare workforce have a very important role in this. Key skills required to achieve this goal include clinical decision making, project management, data collection design and analysis, report writing, training, knowledge and experience in QI. The outcome of the clinical audit services should be a series of national audits on conditions identified as priority areas. Each audit will provide 'state of the nation' and individual provider organisation reports. Individuals and teams should be recruited in provider organisations with the skills and knowledge to develop local audits and implement changes in practice that lead to sustained improvements.

Through speaking to various human and animal health practitioners and policy makers in Uganda, Nigeria and Tanzania, the authors have created three case studies highlighting the various successes of the approach to date, but also clarifying areas where the approach will take longer to implement, often as a result of the wide institutional and policy changes required in many countries. The authors conclude that whilst the ''goodwill'' is certainly there, the reality of planning, executing and budgeting for joint interventions -particularly at the national or regional level -proves in many cases more difficult than first thought.

Our analysis suggests that arrival screening has the potential to make a non-negligible contribution to overall case detection, not only by detecting travellers who develop symptoms in flight, but also by detecting travellers who were missed by imperfect screening at departure. Hence, the additional benefit of arrival screening is greatest when efficacy of departure screening is relatively low, for example if potentially infected travellers primarily depart regions with limited public health re-sources and arrive in regions where public health resources are more abundant. Yet even costly policies that combine exit and arrival screening lack the potential to prevent all case importations. Our analysis suggests that in any context screening would miss a substantial proportion of infected travellers; this result is consistent with other analyses that highlight the limited effectiveness of screening (Pitman et al., 2005; Bitar et al., 2009; Mabey et al., 2014) and with previous or ongoing screening outcomes ( Table 1) .

Healthy individuals may utilize protective measures to avoid contracting a disease. Sick individuals may utilize preemptive measures to avoid spreading a disease. Yet, in practice both protective and preemptive changes in behavior come with costs. This paper proposes a stochastic network disease game model that captures the self-interests of individuals during the spread of a susceptible-infected-susceptible disease. In this model, individuals strategically modify their behavior based on current disease conditions. These reactions influence disease spread. We show that there is a critical level of concern, i.e., empathy, by the sick individuals above which disease is eradicated rapidly. Furthermore, we find that risk averse behavior by the healthy individuals cannot eradicate the disease without the preemptive measures of the sick individuals. Empathy is more effective than risk-aversion because when infectious individuals change behavior, they reduce all of their potential infections, whereas when healthy individuals change behavior, they reduce only a small portion of potential infections. This imbalance in the role played by the response of the infected versus the susceptible individuals on disease eradication affords critical policy insights.",14.991832457612611,7.806471263290177

First, the data were collected among inpatients at a referral pediatric hospital in Phnom Penh, whose patient population may be biased towards patients with more severe diseases than those of hospitals at peripheral health center level. Thus, these findings might not describe the full spectrum of dengue in Cambodia and, hence, might not be fully representative of areas with different dengue transmission patterns or serotypes, or where patients seek medical care later in the course of illness. Because of limited resources, it was not possible to run additional biological tests to investigate the etiologies of the other febrile illnesses. Further efforts should be made to validate the findings in other epidemiological contexts. Second, there were incomplete data for certain variables (i.e. results of the tourniquet tests and AST/ALT), although we have no reason to suspect that this introduced a bias. Third, because of limited resources, we were unable to test the 482 patients who did not fulfill the WHO criteria for dengue on admission and who represented a significant number of the patients with fever (40 %). It is likely we missed some dengue cases by relying solely on the WHO criteria. The median duration of hospitalization was short (3 days), and a significant number of patients did not have a convalescent sera collected. This could have caused misclassification of non-lab confirmed cases. DENV-1 was the predominant serotype identified during the study period, and it was not possible to explore the effects of other dengue serotypes; this might affect the generalizability of our results, which remain context-specific.

For a reduced level of treatment and a higher transmissibility of the sensitive virus, corresponding to the epidemic profile in Figure 2c , we observed two infection waves, both of which are caused by the spread of the sensitive virus, with generation of very few cases of resistant infection. In this scenario, run-out occurs before epidemic is contained, and a second infection wave takes place. Similar dynamics can occur with two subsequent waves of resistant infections for a significantly higher treatment level (Figure 2d) . However, the second wave that occurs after the treatment capacity is fully dispensed (run-out scenario) leads to a major reduction in susceptibility of the population; thereby ending the epidemic. These simulations indicate that multiple infection waves could occur due to limited resources for treatment/isolation of infected cases, the ways that such resources are deployed during the outbreak, the evolutionary responses of the pathogen to control measures (e.g., emergence of drug resistance), or a combination thereof. We performed further experiments with small changes in these parameters, and observed significant influences on the epidemic dynamics that can be associated with the elimination or creation of an infection wave. It is worth noting that the above scenarios can take place even for sufficient drug stockpiles for which run-out does not occur, if a policy for adaptation (e.g., reduction) of treatment at the population level is implemented due to wide-spread drugresistance [15] .",19.805637456427874,8.899764601496658

In late 2015, the Center for Open Science Badges Committee considered provisions for situations in which the data or materials for which a badge was issued somehow disappear from public view and how adherence to badge specifications can be improved by providing easy procedures for editors/journal staff to validate data and material availability before issuing a badge, and by providing community guidelines for validation and enforcement [15] .",16.23469667082663,8.729840806682631

Olson et al.

In modern liberal democracies at least some consensus over what is in the public interest and an understanding of the values which support it, is therefore required for the successful implementation of EID responses. Yet this is precisely what has been lacking in outbreaks where fracture lines, differences and value conflicts have become apparent. When the stakes are high, evidence and the implications of actions are uncertain, the situation is complex and resources may be limited but where decisions need to be made, differences are exposed. Such differences could be around beliefs about how to deal with ecological and environmental issues, which may conflict with the importance people attach to public goods, protection of individual autonomy and animal welfare [47]. These conditions of crisis and division are conducive to undesirable consequences including public fear, mistrust, misinformation and non-compliance with public health directives. For example in Canada during the SARS crisis, leaders were unprepared for the range of ethical conflicts that arose, including those over: individual freedom versus the common good; healthcare workers' safety versus their duty to care for the sick; and economic costs versus the need for containment [48] .

Even social distancing measures, such as self-isolation, may be limited by economic necessity-the need to go to work, school or daycare-or care-giving obligations for extended family. While such limitations should be formally analyzed, our simple analysis suggests that the best paradigm for averting infections also requires the fewest resources. For example, for a flu-like R 0 of two, compare the local count strategy, where individuals protect themselves as their number of infected friends and family climb, to the global strategy, where decisions are based on population prevalence. For every individual that takes action, almost two infections are averted under the local strategy whereas less than one infection is averted under the global strategy. Local counting results in far fewer total infections (3% versus 13%) while requiring far less intervention resources (23% versus 60% of individuals taking protective action).",17.717937702500407,9.641456673639272

End users of the innovation need to perceive relative advantage of the innovation for successful implementation [23, 30] . Many staff members identified that the policy was useful to justify programs, especially politically sensitive ones such as harm reduction. The fact that the OPHS are legislatively mandated is an attribute that could be used to leverage local implementation and could be helpful in securing resources that might otherwise be diverted to other municipal programs. Opportunity for reinvention of the innovation is another aspect of an innovation's attributes that can support uptake [23] . Participants had mixed opinions in relation to the prescriptiveness of the new policy. Most participants felt that the policy was less prescriptive compared to the OPHS predecessor (the MHPSG), particularly in relation to the CDP program. The ability to tailor programs to meet local community needs was seen as a great advantage in the new policy -an opportunity for reinvention. On the other hand, staff involved in STIP programs did not see much change of the new policy with respect to prescriptiveness, since they have always had strict guidelines to follow for STI management including contact tracing. Similarly, the Bax, de Jong and Kooppenjan study of implementation of road policy in the Netherlands [31] noted that a policy implementation gap was the absence of precise policy objectives which allowed for discretionary power to deviate from the intended policy directions. They also argued that an implementation strategy needs to match the policy and implementation context. Another important lesson was that ""local knowledge is indispensable to adapt a uniform package of measures to specific conditions"" (p.880). In other words, implementation requires a certain amount of discretionary freedom to permit local tailoring. On the other hand, Bax and colleagues also reported that a lack of precision in their policy had risks characterised as: ""'not knowing how to' (lack of proper information and communication), 'not being able to' (lack of competence and capacity), and 'not wanting to' (resistance)"" ( [31] p.873).

Partly in response to this, but also in recognition of the need to address ongoing global health disparities and realize the Millennium Development Goals, donors have dedicated more resources to overseas health programs and created new channels of assistance, leading to greater policy attention and scrutiny. [13] [14] Further, global health has grown more interdisciplinary, with links increasingly being made between health and other areas such as international trade and intellectual property rights, agriculture, education, and the environment. In the process, health has moved onto diplomatic and foreign policy agendas. 15 Another factor has been an unprecedented level of personal engagement and commitment shown by many political leaders and high-profile personalities, such as U.S. President George W.

Light and electron microscopy were applied in conjunction with immunohistological characterisation of leukocyte populations. Contrary to our predictions, our results indicated that shrews are capable of mounting immune/inflammatory responses throughout their entire life span. While some degree of lymphatic exhaustion was obvious in adult animals (perhaps as a result of age-related changes, or reduced investment in immunity as a consequence of breeding effort), there was also evidence of some degree of compensation, in the form of storage of plasma cells particularly in the pancreas of Aselli, possibly as a defence against previously encountered parasites.",17.520862007647445,9.104973437963318

In accordance with previous studies [4, 5] RM with 25 cmH 2 O peak pressure were not sufficient to avoid a loss of lung volume (data not shown). The double sigmoidal nature of the murine pressure volume curve [38] may explain the positive response to RM with 30 cmH 2 O pressure. According to Zosky et al. [38] , pressures above 20 cmH 2 O induce fundamental changes in the murine lung, resulting in increased compliance. These changes are proposed to be either due to reopening of collapsed alveoli or to a secondary population of alveoli that are present but not aerated below a critical transrespiratory pressure [39] . In the present study, measurement of lung input impedance revealed that the alterations in pulmonary resistance and compliance in RM60 and noRM mice were predominantly due to changes in the periphery of the lung. Although we observed significant differences in R aw between RM5, RM60 and noRM mice ventilated at the same V T , this effect was rather small, indicating that bronchoconstriction of large airways is of minor importance to explain our findings. The strong increase in G and H in mice ventilated without RM demonstrates a progressive loss in lung volume [24] . Increases in tissue damping reflect energy dissipation and are associated with an increase in tissue resistance and/or regional heterogeneity as result of peripheral airway constriction, whereas tissue elastance reflects energy storage in lung tissues and represents lung stiffness [5] . The small decrease in hysteresivity shows that H increased slightly stronger than G. Further, it underlines that impaired lung functions were not primarily due to heterogeneity caused by narrowing of small airways [40] . Thus narrowing of conductive airways played only a minor role in this model and we conclude that the loss of lung volume was mainly due to formation of atelectasis.",13.851008371559544,8.924145444846864

The model also gives a very good approximation of the spatial spread of the disease, the size of the epidemic peak and the epidemic duration. When markets contribute towards disease amplification, the TNS method requires that around 30% of all nodes would need to be surveyed in order to accurately predict epidemic sizes. The SBS method is found to perform less effectively than the TNS method, as this strategy rapidly identifies the most highly connected nodes that are likely to contribute most significantly to disease transmission. However, the SBS method may be more practical to implement as it does not require prior knowledge of the relative connectivity of the farms in the network.",14.274238458276958,8.53062501236837

The calculation of the optimal policy therefore explicitly accounts for uncertainty associated with the disease transmission and recovery processes (see Methods) under a given valuation of the model parameters. Assuming a value of 2 cost units per dose of vaccine (c v~2 ), we use Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the expected cost surface associated with variable stop time policies based on the true parameter values (Figure 3 ). The minimum expected cost is achieved under a policy of maximum (30%) vaccination and a stopping threshold of 150 individuals. Repeated simulation of the epidemic under this policy shows that in the average case (dashed line), the policy amounts to 4 time units of maximum vaccination as soon as the initial lag is over ( Figure 4 ). In situations where the number of susceptibles remaining after the lag is already below 150 individuals, no policy is implemented. The 95% central interval for the final distribution of total vaccine units dispensed is (339,581), representing variation in the total size of the epidemic at the time of the vaccination sweep, and the numbers of new infections after vaccination begins. Figure 5 shows the distribution of total costs accrued under this policy. After the end of the vaccination campaign, the uncertainty bands widen, representing variations in the costs associated with maintaining the remaining population of infected individuals until their natural recoveries. The mean total cost at time 40 is 1652 cost units, approximately a 21% reduction in total cost compared to no-intervention. ",15.678060250599493,6.232135567153998

Incubation periods for AIVs in poultry can be up to 2 days when birds are inoculated with doses less than or equal to 10 3 , and around 1 day when doses are higher [6] . Making the worst-case assumption that susceptible and infectious hosts are in constant contact, this means that the minimum time infectious individuals can create other infectious individuals is 1 day, and higher on average. Thus, if the average staytime of birds in rLBMs is ≤ 2 days, there is not time for exponential growth of prevalence due to direct transmission within rLBMs (e.g., ""outbreaks""). In addition, direct transmission alone may not cause significant amplification of prevalence within rLBMs because birds that entered the market uninfected have a high probability of being slaughtered before they begin shedding AIV. A similar principle has been identified in other animal-disease systems. For example, epizootics of plague in prairie dog populations have been shown not to occur by blocked-flea or pneumonic transmission alone, because both blocked vectors and hosts capable of direct transmission are removed from the population by death before they reliably create large chains of transmission required for outbreaks [7] .

Immunity can be acquired through infection at a young age (natural immunity) or vaccination (artificial immunity). Natural immunity is currently difficult to acquire in Korea and the recent implementation of mandatory infant vaccination under the NIP leaves the challenge of increasing immunity in adults [24] . However, it is practically difficult to administer the hepatitis A vaccine to all individuals. Therefore, all three policies should be deployed to prevent hepatitis A outbreaks. Which policy will be conducted as a priority will depend on the circumstances in each country. Immunization policies, in particular, depend on the hepatitis A incidence rate in each country. The World Health Organization recommends vaccination of individuals in countries with very low incidence of hepatitis A and rare outbreaks who are at high risk of hepatitis A infection (i.e., those travelling in high-prevalence regions, hemophiliacs, male homosexuals, those with illegal drug abuse, and jobs in contact with primates) [25] . In countries with a high incidence of hepatitis A, large-scale vaccination is not recommended as it will have little effect since many people tend to be infected when they are young and acquire natural immunity. However, large-scale vaccination is a cost-effective measure in countries, such as Korea, with large differences in immunity levels by age and region due to reduction in hepatitis A incidence [25] . The immunity levels are relatively low among Koreans born in the 1970s to 1990s and even lower in urban areas. In addition, the incidence, and complication and mortality rates of hepatitis A increase with age; thus, the hepatitis A fatality rate may increase in future outbreaks. Therefore, a large-scale catch-up vaccination policy is required for adults in their 20s to 40s. The hurdles to the introduction of such a policy, including securing budgets, vaccine supply, and low vaccination rates, can be overcome if with the establishment and implementation of a long-term plan of five years or more. As a short-term measure, organizations such as public health centers should provide adult vaccines at a lower cost than that of private hospitals to provide an alternative for those who are not vaccinated due to cost.",10.134483795508773,9.158221405149263

While most studies on infectious disease ecology focus on the dynamics of a single host species and single pathogen, we acknowledge that more research is needed to address the complexities of multi host-pathogen dynamics [148] . Community ecology, with its emphasis on the composition of and interconnections between ecological communities, allows one to understand infectious disease dynamics in multi-pathogen, multi-host disease systems that occur across diverse scales (e.g., from within a single host, to between species, to between regions) [148] . Other topics of importance deserving further study in bat species of Western Asia include: effects of extreme weather (e.g., heat waves) on bat survival, including changes in the distribution of bat species (and associated pathogens) and changes in prey abundance or food resources that could alter reproductive patterns and disease transmission [149, 150] . For example, increased prevalence of Marburg virus (MARV) in Rousettus aegyptiacus colonies corresponded with defined periods of synchronized parturition (which resulted in an influx of immunologically-naive, juvenile bats), as well as an increased incidence of spillover into human populations [77] . If such virus-host associations exist in regional bat species, climatic changes may affect reproductive phenology in bats, and therefore the timing of peak viral spillover into human populations. A systems-wide, hypothesis-driven approach will allow for better identification of emerging disease risk factors, and more effective policy recommendations for reducing the disease transmission and spread [146, 148] .",10.220854445363207,7.528204593482408

Training and certification of vast number of health care providers to use POC diagnostics, and ensuring an effective supply chain for tests and drugs across the country present an enormous challenge to health systems that are already suffering from a critical shortage of human resources. Quality assurance systems, that include providing proficiency testing, sites visits, and corrective action, are essential to ensure that accurate results are being used to guide treatment decisions, and to ensure that control strategies are based on accurate surveillance data. Studies have shown that deployment of POC diagnostics can be an opportunity to improve health outcomes and strengthen health systems [29] [30] [31] . Overcoming challenges will in turn motivate health care workers and increase capacity and efficiency to test and treat appropriately. RDT introduction and implementation must be culturally sensitive and accompanied by an inter-connected system to monitor the necessary processes. Another key barrier to the appropriate use of POC diagnostics is the need to train clinicians to create a demand for them and then use the test results to effectively manage the patients.

The costs of healthrelated goods and services directly affect health by reducing the demand for necessary health care or by increasing consumption of unnecessary care,0.18533979028614345,1.1055808067321777,1.8075329065322876,79adf19c-25fd-4249-ae0f-070b221d5fe9,custom_license/Health and social justice,"Fifth, the equity implications of access to those goods and services cannot be separated from the equity implications of financing them, because the capability principle requires that resources be allocated on the basis of medical need, not ability to pay. The costs of healthrelated goods and services directly affect health by reducing the demand for necessary health care or by increasing consumption of unnecessary care. Leaving people vulnerable to economic barriers therefore would fail to reduce deprivations in health. Additionally, the uncertainty of health need, the catastrophic costs of medical care, and the risk-averse nature of individuals places risk pooling (eg, through insurance) at the centre of health-care financing. 20 An expensive medical event can prevent access to health care or be a primary cause of financial ruin. From a capability point of view, ""protective security"", 14 through health insurance, is a necessary safety net. And the economic burden of health care should be justly shared by all through the redistribution of funds from the well to the ill and the rich to the poor, using progressive financing and community rating. 21 Sixth, one of the most difficult tasks in applying an ethical framework that values health intrinsically is the conceptualisation and measurement of health and inequalities in its many domains. There are many approaches to measuring health equity. As Sudhir Anand and colleagues have shown, 22 the choice depends on numerous considerations, ranging from health domains to the weights attached to those domains. 22 Another consideration is the choice of groups for stratification. 22 Even within the capability perspective, one would need to determine what set of inequality measures would be most appropriate for a given exercise, although certain types of inequality assessment-for example, a goal of complete ""health equality"" (levelling down to lowest common denominator)-have less appeal than others. And certain health equity evaluations-for example, deciding how much priority to give the ""worst-off""-will undoubtedly require public reasoning about values imbedded in the health equity concept. Although the capability view of health does not come down on an exact formula for judging inequalities in health, Sen has noted the potential use of ""partial ordering"" (eg, ordering some alternatives as opposed to ordering them all) of health states for assessing relative inequalities. In a collective exercise, incomplete theorisation may facilitate evaluation in health policy. 15, 16, 23 Incompletely theorised agreements Incomplete theorisation is useful to a theory of health and social justice because it provides a framework for understanding collective decision-making on human goods that are plural and indistinct (such as health and inequality), and allows individuals to take divergent paths to a common, though often partial, agreement. It describes how people with divergent, even opposing, views on health, equity, and health-policy issues might reach agreement in specific situations and thus generate health-policy decisions that are legitimate and stable and reflect mutual respect. 15, 16, 23 The method of reaching agreement described here is called incompletely theorised agreements, developed by Cass Sunstein, 24 and it holds promise for health-policy decision-making at several levels. 15, 16, 23 An incompletely theorised agreement is one that is not uniformly theorised at all levels, from high-level justifications to low-level particulars. It complements and extends the capability approach by providing a framework for operationalising the capability approach at three or more levels. The first level is the conceptual level, which specifies the valuable functionings that constitute human flourishing and health. The second level is the policy level, which specifies policies and laws. The third level is the intervention level, which specifies actions in particular cases and decisions about medical treatments, public-health interventions or social services. This framework constitutes three different types of incompletely theorised agreements: incompletely specified agreements, incompletely specified and generalised agreements, and incompletely theorised agreements on particular outcomes.",13.637997178974839,6.666822926263096

In ancient and medieval times, disaster was considered the divine realm of God. Ancient human societies considered praying to God the only way to ward off disaster, and when a force majeure did occur, it was seen as God's punishment for sinful or disrespectful behavior. During such historical catastrophic epics like Noah's Great Flood, the Great Fire of Rome in AD 64, and the Black Death in medieval Europe, tens of thousands of people perished; however, neither the government nor the people contemplated the root causes of the disaster.

The government should carefully consider how to distribute their resources and money between messages supporting vaccination, hospitalization, self-protection, and so on, since the outcome of policy largely depends on the complex interplay among the type of incentive, individual behavioral responses, and the intrinsic epidemic dynamics. In their further work [91] , the authors investigated the effects of two types of incentives strategies, partial-subsidy policy in which certain fraction of the cost of vaccination is offset, and free-subsidy policy in which donees are randomly selected and vaccinated at no cost on the epidemic control. Through mean-field analysis and computations, they found that, under the partial-subsidy policy, the vaccination coverage depends monotonically on the sensitivity of individuals to payoff difference, but the dependence is non-monotonous for the free-subsidy policy. Due to the role models of the donees for relatively irrational individuals and the unchanged strategies of the donees for rational individuals, the free-subsidy policy can in general lead to higher vaccination coverage. These findings substantiate, once again, that any disease-control policy should be exercised with extreme care: its success depends on the complex interplay among the intrinsic mathematical rules of epidemic spreading, governmental policies, and behavioral responses of individuals.",21.645903404644184,10.22277438802706

The idea of global commons has been used to describe various shared resources that are both managed through community oversight and are undermined by greed, poor regulation, and poor enforcement of existing regulations. The management of resources like clean air, water, a stable local food supply, and so on, and practices such as sustainable agriculture and water conservation demonstrate ways that groups come together to preserve/conserve resources. Examples of mismanagement, overuse of limited resources, and the cumulative effects of seemingly small negative impacts illustrate the tragedy of these commons, as resources are squandered, degraded, or polluted. At a local scale, people develop a relationship with land and the surrounding environment, and the knowledge, ideas, and informational resources embedded within the local cultural and physical landscapes are lost when these landscapes are destroyed or altered by habitat loss, environmental degradation, or pollution. Globally, issues such as loss of biodiversity; cumulative impacts of pollution; the overuse of pesticides, antibiotics, and fertilizers; and widespread environmental modification and degradation all point to potential global impacts. Global versus local governance of the commons is a contentious political issue especially as it pertains to issues of national sovereignty and the locus of responsibility, for example, in governing the availability and use of valuable antibiotics like the drug rifampicin (an important TB drug) or antiretroviral drugs for HIV. If they are misused or sold in diluted doses, resistant pathogens will emerge that affect all nations.

The first idea is that people know what they can do to maintain health and prevent or cure illnesses, and they are capable of ranking the actions that can be taken. In other words, people are endowed with the abilities or preferences for ranking health services. The second idea is that the material means that people possess, such as income and assets, limit the type and intensity of the actions they can take to maintain or promote health. This limitation arises from the fact that health services, like other goods, have prices that consumers must pay directly or indirectly given limited incomes or assets. The third idea is that, faced with this limitation, people try to do the best for themselves. Expressed strongly, the idea says that people make choices and behave in ways that enable them to maximize the benefits from health-care consumption given their income or wealth. This maximization hypothesis is the cornerstone of much economic analysis, including demand analysis. Not surprisingly, the hypothesis is the subject of intense debate in the health-care demand literature. Since individuals and households possess limited information about health care, the assumption that this care is optimally used to confront illnesses is too strong. For example, the assumption is contradicted by consumption behaviors that harm health, such as smoking, drug abuse, and unhealthy eating habits. Economists have to date not been able to respond convincingly to the persistent criticism that people do not possess the ability and the information required to engage in optimizing behavior. However, in order to derive the strong prediction of demand theory, that people respond to price incentives, a view on optimization assumption is required. Economists generally assume that people behave as if their purpose in life is to do the best for themselves using their scarce resources. This assumption permits a straightforward derivation of policy relevant prediction of demand models that is generally in agreement with everyday experience. For example, the models predict that people will reduce consumption of health-care services if health-care prices are increased, provided that other factors such as income and the disease environment remain the same. Policy makers can use estimation results from these models to set appropriate prices for health-care services. Indeed, information on demand parameters is essential for evidence-based financing of health services.",15.929773127087655,7.633766880896733

It is not known whether quarantine was necessary, 25, 33, 56 or whether strict isolation and early case finding would have been a better use of resources. In Singapore and elsewhere, isolation has been shown to be highly effective in reducing the number of secondary cases associated with individuals with SARS. Lipsitch and colleagues 57 showed that as the Singapore epidemic progressed, the time to isolation decreased and the corresponding number of secondary cases decreased, with the notable exception of the SGH cluster. 54 In any future epidemic we should be able to isolate and detect cases early and may not have to resort to draconian quarantine rules. Alternatively, a careful system of outpatient follow-up and clinical or serosurveillance, as we did with our first case, might be more practical. 80 813 individuals arriving in Taiwan from SARS affected countries were quarantined for 10 days and only one person (0.001% of the total) developed laboratory confirmed SARS. 32",16.800064489660958,10.335780177410845

In these countries, however, the burden imposed by infectious diseases is highest (Jones et al., 2008; Mabey et al., 2004) . Also, some populations in developing areas have complex demographic histories. This is the case of African populations, that are genetically highly diverse and display a limited extension of linkage disequilibrium (LD) compared to non-Africans (International HapMap Consortium et al., 2007) . For instance, one of the first GWASs for infectious diseases genotyped individuals in West Africa to identify susceptibility variants for severe malaria (Jallow et al., 2009 ). The authors found considerable population stratification, which was corrected for using principal components analysis (PCA); signals of association at known malaria resistance loci (e.g. HBB) were difficult to retrieve due to weak LD between causal variants (e.g., HbS locus) and tag SNPs (Jallow et al., 2009) . Populations from South and Central America also display relevant population structure due to recent admixture (Bryc et al., 2010) . In a GWAS for visceral Leishmaniasis that included families from Brazil, ancestry differences and close relationships were efficiently corrected for using a linear mixed model (LeishGEN Consortium et al., 2013) .

Although evaluation of analytical performance may continue to involve this subset-based approach, the proposed new standards, as outlined by the FDA 120 , could include defined technical metrics for data quality, additional standards for computational approaches and standard best practices for quality assurance. The debate over FDA oversight is largely focused on the presence or absence detection of DNA variants, such as germline cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) or BRCA2 testing. While the FDA guidance and debate is limited in use of examples, the broad scope of additional regulation on all NGS-developed tests, including RNA-seq, may provide regulatory uncertainty for RNA-seq and impede its adoption in the clinic.

Advanced knowledge of this information before installation allows RAD-AID to plan the most appropriate site-specific architecture and maximize the success of installation. For example, some institutions are better suited for a mini-PACS platform given limited resources and experience with radiology informatics. However, at sites with more experience with radiology informatics, such as Ghana, where RAD-AID implemented a PACS platform at Korle Bu Hospital in 2013, implementing a comprehensive PACS solution is more appropriate. Assessing the learning curve and readily available IT resources maximizes the institutional adoption of PACS platforms.",18.256682362865273,9.021629953730903

In a more realistic case, the total amount of medical resources is limited and the average curing rate is thus fixed. Chen et al. [295] analyzed how to best allocate limited resources to each node so as to minimize the epidemic prevalence. They formulated the SIS model by the mean-field theory and solved the corresponding optimal control problem by the Lagrange multiplier method, and found counterintuitively that in the strong infection region, the low-degree nodes should be allocated more medical resources than the high-degree nodes to minimize prevalence. The above models assume that resources can be distributed to reduce the infectiousness or increase the recovery of a node. A similar idea can also be conducted on the edges. Nowzari et al. [296] assumed that the epidemic spreading can be suppressed by decreasing the strength or weight of edges when allocating resources. For example, the government Source: Reproduced from Ref. [298] . might be able to decrease the edge weight by reducing interactions between two nodes, such as by limiting the amount of transportation between two cities.

By incorporating evolutionary games into epidemic dynamics, Zhang et al. found that under the partial-subsidy policy, the vaccination coverage depends monotonically on the sensitivity of individuals to payoff difference, σ , but the dependence is nonmonotonic for the free-subsidy policy, referring to In [307] , Zhang et al. further explored the effect of a preferential imitation rule, where individuals choose their imitating neighbors with a tendency rather than randomly selecting them. It is found that the targeted subsidy policy is only advantageous when individuals prefer to imitate the subsidized individuals' strategy. Otherwise, the effectiveness of the targeted policy is worse. More importantly, under the targeted subsidy policy, preferential imitation causes a nontrivial phenomenon whereby the final epidemic size increases with the increase in the proportion of subsidized individuals. In summary, epidemic-control policy through resource input depends on the complex interplay among the intrinsic mathematical rules of epidemic spreading, governmental policies, and the behavioral responses of individuals. Moreover, this complexity may introduce the so-called Braess's Paradox [240] , such that increasing the effectiveness of the strategy may in contrary lead to worse strategy outcomes (more resource to be consumed).",17.761481253658957,7.871700955355495

Accounting for behavioural mechanisms that determine uptake of infectious disease interventions such as vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) can significantly alter predicted health outcomes in a population. However, most previous approaches that model interactions between human behaviour and disease dynamics have modelled behaviour of these two interventions separately. Here, we develop and analyze an agent based network model to gain insights into how behaviour toward both interventions interact adaptively with disease dynamics (and therefore, indirectly, with one another) during the course of a single epidemic where an SIRV infection spreads through a contact network. In the model, individuals decide to become vaccinated and/or practice NPIs based on perceived infection prevalence (locally or globally) and on what other individuals in the network are doing. We find that introducing adaptive NPI behaviour lowers vaccine uptake on account of behavioural feedbacks, and also decreases epidemic final size. When transmission rates are low, NPIs alone are as effective in reducing epidemic final size as NPIs and vaccination combined. Also, NPIs can compensate for delays in vaccine availability by hindering early disease spread, decreasing epidemic size significantly compared to the case where NPI behaviour does not adapt to mitigate early surges in infection prevalence. We also find that including adaptive NPI behaviour strongly mitigates the vaccine behavioural feedbacks that would otherwise result in higher vaccine uptake at lower vaccine efficacy as predicted by most previous models, and the same feedbacks cause epidemic final size to remain approximately constant across a broad range of values for vaccine efficacy. Finally, when individuals use local information about others' behaviour and infection prevalence, instead of population-level information, infection is controlled more efficiently through ring vaccination, and this is reflected in the time evolution of pair correlations on the network. This model shows that accounting for both adaptive NPI behaviour and adaptive vaccinating behaviour regarding social effects and infection prevalence can result in qualitatively different predictions than if only one type of adaptive behaviour is modelled.",15.410537348041206,9.685195733157043

When the transmission rate is low, NPIs alone are relatively effective at hindering the growth of the epidemic, lowering the peak infection prevalence compared to the vaccineonly case (Fig. 2a) . For a transmission rate of β ¼ 0:00493 per infectious contact per day, simulations that utilize NPIs only or vaccination only result in the same epidemic final size (Fig. 2b) . Although the peak infection prevalence in this scenario is larger for vaccine-only simulations, the epidemic dies out more quickly compared to the NPI-only scenario, resulting in the same cumulative infection incidence over the epidemic duration. For higher transmission rates, the vaccine only scenario outperforms the NPI only scenario (Fig. 2c) . Although NPIs delay the peak of the epidemic, infection prevalence dies out more slowly than when the population uses solely vaccination instead. However, this highlights the importance of NPIs in epidemics where vaccination may not be immediately available. Considering the combined scenario data in Fig. 2(c) , which indicates infection prevalence in simulations utilizing both NPIs and vaccination, the initial disease spread is very similar to that of the NPI-only scenario. Only when individuals begin to vaccinate does the infection prevalence in the combined scenario show quantitative difference to the infection prevalence in the NPI-only scenario. Thus, as long as a vaccine is made available within a given time frame, the final size can be expected to be the same due to the early activation of NPIs.",15.828362675844273,7.858068993010645

We call this the baseline scenario as it was calibrated to achieve plausible epidemic outcomes under the realistic assumption that both vaccination and NPIs are available simultaneously. Henceforth, we will refer to this scenario as the ""combined scenario"", as both interventions may be used. If both intervention options are available, the final size of the epidemic is lowest compared to when only one of the two interventions are used, as expected (Fig. 1a) . We also compare the epidemic time series of the combined scenario to hypothetical scenarios where there is no vaccine available over the course of the outbreak (""NPI-only scenario""), or self-protective behaviour is completely ineffective (""vaccine-only scenario""). We note that the NPI-only scenario gives similar infection rates as the combined scenario for the first 3 weeks of the epidemic. This occurs because vaccine uptake in the combined scenario is close to zero in the first few weeks, due to low perceived risks of becoming infected while infection prevalence is still minimal, and therefore the differences between scenarios with and without vaccination are small during this period of time. The implication of this is that delays in vaccine availability in the first few weeks of an epidemic may not hinder vaccine uptake under a voluntary vaccination policy. After this initial period, we observe consistently higher cumulative infected for the NPI-only scenario over the combined scenario for the remainder of the epidemic. The NPI-only simulations yield the greatest average cumulative infection incidence, as the response from solely NPIs amongst susceptible individuals cannot match the disease mitigation of a perfectly efficacious vaccine, in the long term (however, we note that the difference in cumulative incidence is relatively small). In the vaccine-only scenario, infection incidence spikes rapidly but the epidemic lasts a shorter amount of time than in the NPI-only scenario. The relatively rapid early spike in total infected individuals is due to the lack of vaccine uptake in the first weeks of the epidemic, as vaccination decisions are not activated until the perceived threat of becoming infected is sufficiently high. In all these cases, self-protective behaviour serves to slow the spread of an epidemic, but does not successfully reduce the final attack rate as significantly compared to when it is aided by vaccination.",15.804978104969393,7.021997022021995

A sectoral policy refers to one in which the tourism sector is subsidized two periods (quarters) after the outbreak, whereas a comprehensive policy includes simultaneous subsidies to the health sector as well. As indicated, the sectoral policy overcomes the tourism sector decline; however, such mitigation comes at the cost of a deeper recession in the generic sector.

However, empirical studies in the field of strategic management reveal that freestanding ES units face serious difficulties and do not survive (Engledow and Lenz, 1985) . A number of reasons can be given why ES units cannot survive in hospitality organizations. First, as stated above, the majority of businesses in the hospitality industry are small establishments, which have limited resources and knowledge for establishing ES units or for recruiting someone especially for the task of ES. Second, the majority of hospitality organizations do not have an organizational culture that allows for the employment of professional management approaches, including formal ES activities. Third, due to organizational politics and differing perceptions at various management levels, other departments and lower management levels may not always believe in the importance of ES units and their activities (Engledow and Lenz, 1985) . A further reason is that ES units do not always provide any visible output such as profits and, therefore, are seen as cost centers in the long term. For example, Stubbart (1982) found that when there are performance problems or changes in top management and ownership, companies often introduce radical structural changes and cut costs initiatives and under these circumstances ES units are seen as vulnerable targets. Such examples can also be seen in the hospitality industry. For example, it is well known that for the last ten years a large majority of hotel groups have acquired other hotel chains or have been acquired by other companies. As in the case of Forte it has been the general practice of takeover companies to replace top management teams and make structural changes to cut costs and run hotels more efficiently than before. A final reason for why ES units cannot survive is that many hospitality organizations can use external consultants or buy essential information from organizations offering a variety of external reports, forecasts, and other services, rather than produce this information within their own organizations.",14.184048534139087,7.578389811760616

The simulation model features a flexible design which can be particularized to an even broader range of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions and more granular mixing groups.

However, tracing all contacts is often problematic especially when an infected individual has traveled to numerous locations and when exposure occurred in public spaces and mass transit. Compared to isolation, quarantine sometimes faces more resistance from expected participants especially from those who have been exposed but appear to be in a healthy condition. During the SARS epidemic, mass quarantines were implemented in many countries. Over 130,000 potentially exposed individuals were quarantined in Taiwan, but in retrospect, the action may have spread panic among uninfected individuals and may not have been an effective strategy (University of Louisville School of Medicine 2003). In reality, quarantines are never perfect. Compliance to the procedures is often problematic: quarantined individuals do not reduce their geographical movement or they only abide by the procedure for a short period. Formal quarantines have good compliance rates but are costly and difficult to manage for a large number of cases. Therefore a majority of quarantines are made voluntarily or with less monitoring than formal quarantines, but these suffer from reduced compliance and are less effective overall. Knowledge about potential superspreaders to identify candidates for isolation can greatly enhance the efficacy of quarantines with much lower numbers of required isolations (Diamond 2003) .

SARS created opportunities for Hu and Wen to wield decisively the power they formally held and move beyond Jiang's shadow in a Politburo that was packed with Jiang's protégés. It helped that Jiang was rumored to be hiding out in the safety of Shanghai and that his Politburo acolytes remained silent while Hu and Wen manned the frontlines and saturated the airwaves.

Many nurses believe the patients are not motivated to change their condition, and they do not believe they are effective in helping the patients achieve any behavioral change. Similarly, physicians have adverse opinions especially about the morbidly obese patients. The patients often view the health care community as biased against them, often disrespectful in the care they receive. 18 Thus, faced with a disaster setting of limited resources and perhaps with some patient care bias in managing obese patients, a transparent process of triaging resources must be developed. Several models have recently been proposed in triaging hospital or ICU resources for nontrauma patients, so-called tertiary triage. Most models focus on use of the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score. Through the use of an intensivist-led multidisciplinary triage team, patients in need of advanced clinical resources are evaluated for inclusion and then exclusion criteria and followed up using the SOFA score to determine illness severity and course. Patients with predicted high mortality or failure to improve, in this model, would be supported with palliative care and have their resources reallocated to other patients with greater chance of survival. Important to note is that none of the models specifically target patient weight as a criterion in determining need or exclusion; what counts is the severity of the illness. 38, 39 SUMMARY Management of the morbidly obese patient under normal circumstances requires increased resources such as personnel, supplies, and special equipment. In the often Critical Care of the Morbidly Obese in Disasters resource-constrained setting of disasters, normal support to these patients may be jeopardized. In addition, their underlying condition with limited mobility and comorbidities may increase their likelihood of suffering harm depending on the type and tempo of the disaster. Morbidly obese patients are a special-needs population for whom necessary planning must be done to mitigate the effects of the disaster on them. Prior planning not only addresses appropriate care needs for these patients but also avoids crisis intervention during an event that might detract care and support from others during stressful times. In the end, such planning helps optimize the care for all.",17.61237489140812,9.678117396780593

For example, in the city of New York, if a fire occurs in a high-rise building, the fire floor and the floors immediately above are the most critical areas for rapid evacuation. ♦ However, in Los Angeles, if a fire occurs in a high-rise building and it is serious enough to evacuate one floor, five ♦♦ floors are evacuated (commonly referred to as the ""Rule of 5"" or ""5 Move 5""): the fire floor, two above it for safety, and two below it (so that the second floor below the fire floor can be used as a staging area for fire department operations). Occupants on these five floors are relocated down five floors, thus being relocated to at least three floors from the fire floor; if the fire is on or below a floor that is six floors from street level, the occupants usually are evacuated from the building. Figure A9 -7 shows the floors from which occupants are usually evacuated or relocated during a fire using the ""Rule of 5"" or ""5 Move 5"" zoned evacuation. During a fire situation, it is usually advisable to evacuate downward in a building. However, if the lower floors or the stairwells are destroyed or untenable because of heat or smoke, only then is it necessary or more desirable to go to an upper floor or to the building's roof. The problems with occupants relocating to a building's roof, particularly in substantial numbers, are its limited space to accommodate people and the difficulty if becomes necessary to evacuate these people from the roof itself. If the building has a helipad or heliport, as some modern high-rise buildings do, there is not only the problem of obtaining a helicopter but also of it landing safely to pick up occupants. During serious building fires, smoke and heated air cause air turbulence and updrafts. ♦ ♦♦ Individuals with temporary or permanent disabilities ♦♦♦ or other conditions that would require them to obtain assistance during an evacuation require special consideration during evacuation.

Although in our previous study (Abu-El-Noor et al., 2016) we called for immediate interventions from health care policy makers and hospital administrations and to offer adequate treatment and counselling for those affected by the war stress and to take further interventions to improve their mental health, to reduce the incidence of chronic PTSD and other possible psychiatric disorders, improve their job satisfaction and reduce burn out to retain them in their professions, but on the ground, there were no actions taken. The only actions that were taken were sporadic interventions that were taken by international organizations, such as Doctors of Spain. We believe that this was not enough. There are several possible reasons that health policy makers did not intervene to offer help and counselling to health care providers affected by the war. First, it is possible that health policy makers are not aware of the impact of PTSD. A second possible reason is lack of financial resources. Gaza Strip passes through crises and under siege for the last decade. Financial resources are very limited; therefore, priorities are in a continuous dramatic change. Meeting physical needs such are water, food, and electricity supplies come first in the priority list of the government. A third possible reason is that international health organizations are not engaged in offering such help as they are also considering meeting physical needs as a priority. Only a few number of organizations had offered counselling to health care professionals after the war. A final possible reason could be related to the gap between research and policy makers as some policy makers don't take seriously the results of research studies into their considerations. The literature described the gap between research and practice in health care and public health as large and troubling (Glasgow & Emmons, 2007; Lenfant, 2003) .

Conflicting data from studies with poor design and/or low compliance does not constitute evidence against contact precautions; rather, these data are inconclusive. Whereas the study that performed best on our quality score found no significance between contact precautions and not isolating patients, this study did not consistently assess intervention compliance in the various study phases. 31 The included study that showed a difference in MDRO transmission with use of contact precautions did not report compliance rates and could not be assessed for quality on any of the other bias and confounding items of the quality assessment tool. 32 Inconsistencies and absences in compliance monitoring and reporting make it impossible to tell whether protocols were completed as intended, threatening the internal validity of these studies. 35 The CDC recently faced similar difficulty interpreting health outcomes after two healthcare workers were infected with Ebola virus in Texas, as it was unclear whether transmission had been due to inadequate isolation precaution protocols or to a protocol breach. 38 In practice, healthcare facilities should be regularly monitoring compliance, and investigating potential lapses when cross-transmission is documented, to potentially resolve systems-based inefficiencies. It is also important for researchers to monitor and report compliance to understand what effectiveness level can be reasonably expected in practice where compliance may be lower than in clinical studies.

The idea of global commons has been used to describe various shared resources that are both managed through community oversight and are undermined by greed, poor regulation, and poor enforcement of existing regulations. The management of resources like clean air, water, a stable local food supply, and so on, and practices such as sustainable agriculture and water conservation demonstrate ways that groups come together to preserve/conserve resources. Examples of mismanagement, overuse of limited resources, and the cumulative effects of seemingly small negative impacts illustrate the tragedy of these commons, as resources are squandered, degraded, or polluted. At a local scale, people develop a relationship with land and the surrounding environment, and the knowledge, ideas, and informational resources embedded within the local cultural and physical landscapes are lost when these landscapes are destroyed or altered by habitat loss, environmental degradation, or pollution. Globally, issues such as loss of biodiversity; cumulative impacts of pollution; the overuse of pesticides, antibiotics, and fertilizers; and widespread environmental modification and degradation all point to potential global impacts. Global versus local governance of the commons is a contentious political issue especially as it pertains to issues of national sovereignty and the locus of responsibility, for example, in governing the availability and use of valuable antibiotics like the drug rifampicin (an important TB drug) or antiretroviral drugs for HIV. If they are misused or sold in diluted doses, resistant pathogens will emerge that affect all nations.

As Weihai has the regional advantage of being near Korea, the local culture and Korean culture are both the main cultural resources, and the communication of the two kinds of cultures will enable them to develop sustainably.

First, the transmission patterns of HAIs in LMICs require further studies because they are likely to be dramatically different from those in HICs owing to many factors such as poor infrastructure, insufficient environmental hygiene conditions, different staff cohorting, shortage of HCWs, the knowledge and compliance of HCWs to IPC measures, overcrowded health care facilities, absence of comprehensive IPC guidelines and policies, lack of procedure, and different antibiotic prescribing and referral patterns. Second, pediatric hospitals and other types of health care setting-like LTCFs, as well as interactions between settings were not extensively investigated. Furthermore, understanding of patient sharing and referring networks among health care facilities driven by operational and financial alliances needs to be improved. Third, the number of studies adopting hybrid simulation models are still limited, possibly because of the unavailability of clear guidelines and frameworks for hybrid model development. Because it is argued that most, if not all, real-world problems tackled with simulation modeling cannot be solved by SD, DES or ABM alone but require a combination of 2 or all of them, a hybrid model resulting from this combination expectedly offers different perspectives of a problem and generate more insights, which will provide better understanding and greater support for decision-making. 100 The use of simulation modeling for economic analysis of different IPC measures and strategies has increased but is still relatively scarce. The application of this methodology to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of various IPC strategies is promising in a sense that it can appropriately guide and prioritize the allocation of limited resources and funds. Additionally, an understanding of other kinds of interactions in the health care setting apart from interactions between doctors and/or nurses and patients is insufficient. Last, the evaluation of clinical and cost effectiveness was only conducted for a number of commonly used interventions like hand hygiene, isolation, and screening, further investigation on other IPC measures and a combination of different strategies is imperative to determine best practice in various health care settings.

This policy describes the requirements for local review, approval, and oversight of dual use research of concern (DURC). DURC is described in detail elsewhere in this book but, in short, DURC refers to research that produces valuable scientific information but may also be used in warfare or terror attacks. This federal policy requires that each institution designate an Institutional Review Entity (IRE) to review DURC projects and assist in creation of risk mitigation plans for these projects. The companion guide [14] that accompanies the federal policy suggests that IBCs are the most logical choice for the IRE since similar expertise is needed to assess the risks associated with recombinant DNA research and modifications of pathogens that may increase their transmissibility or pathogenicity. IBCs may not have the security expertise needed for these reviews, however, and consultants or ad hoc members may need to be added to fulfill the responsibilities assigned to the IRE. The DURC policy only applies to institutions that receive federal funding for life sciences research and is restricted to research involving 15 specific pathogens. Institutions or individuals that receive no federal funding are under no obligation to follow the DURC policy, nor are individuals who are working with pathogens other than the 15 specifically listed in the DURC policy. Many common human pathogens (e.g., Salmonella, E. coli, or influenza) are not on the list of pathogens covered by the DURC policy.

In the 1960's, McDonnell Douglas began producing the DC10-10 but the conditions for sale were that the New York airports could accommodate the aircraft, which required strengthening the taxiways and widening the runways. The New York Airport Authority argued that the costs involved were prohibitive and the McDonnell Douglas Company, after reducing the costs through a radical redesign, paid for the changes necessary. Multiple airports are currently under expansion in order to accommodate the A380, but these costs are being borne by the airports, which represents a distortion in the airframe market. Clearly, subsidies are unlikely to disappear despite WTO rulings and it would appear that the more appropriate policy would be to encourage discussions and reach agreements across countries in order to limit the imbalance such distortions create. An example of the results of such discussions includes the 1992 E.U.-U.S. agreement that calls for a Critical Project Appraisal before permitting any subsidization of the research and development of airframes.

For example, nurses must know that it is customary for a large proportion of Korean men to eat dinner out with friends and colleagues after work nearly every weekday. At the dinner table, men smoke and share drinks. In fact, smoking and drinking are highly encouraged and pressure to conform to this behavior is common among members of the social groups. For instance, it is not polite for a man to refuse a drink or a cigarette when others, particularly someone in higher power or a higher position, offer such. Furthermore, it is expected that those who receive the offer return the favor, thus continuing a vicious cycle of more smoking and more drinking. When such behavior largely constitutes male socialization and bonding, those who do not smoke and drink tend to fall outside the social circle, often feeling left out and isolated. A positive note in such a seemingly destructive social culture is that this is an effective means for Korean men to disperse their daily stress from a highly competitive society. Thus, understanding cultural aspects is a critical step for any international collaboration.

Results of studies comparing compliance as measured by human observers and by automated systems have varied. For example, Sharma et al. [26] evaluated nearly 1400 hand hygiene-related events recorded by an automated system and by human observers. They found that the details of the observations differed for 38% of the events. They postulated that the discrepancies may have been due to the ""distance between the observer and the event"" and the clinic's level of busyness [26] . Swoboda et al. [27] found that hand hygiene compliance assessed by observers was 20% (±2%) higher than that assessed by the electronic monitoring system.

According to one view, we should not interfere with natural systems at all; apes have lived with Ebola for years without need for human intervention. Yet the state of wild populations today is such that no environment is free from human effects, and therefore such groups must adapt to the 'Anthropocene' (Hockings et al. 2015) . In fact, the landscape has changed so significantly that human intervention is perhaps necessary for them to survive at all. 12 Although dissent has been voiced against interfering in 'natural systems' and the effectiveness of medical interventions relative to other conservation strategies (Ryan and Walsh 2011) , the magnitude and significance of the current Ebola outbreak should at least question the premise of non-intervention. Intervention, therefore, can be justified because the alternative is decimation across the biosphere, affecting human beings who rely on it, and the animals that live within it. If this can be considered as a universal good, then, we can start to envision medical strategies to protect both human and animal populations. The plausibility of vaccinating other species during significant endemics has been voiced before, often from the conservation angle (Marzi and Feldmann 2014; Ryan and Walsh 2011) , but never received any serious consideration, as far as we are aware. Two reasons for this might be postulated: limited resources are to be used to address human needs, especially at times when endemics or potential pandemics are occurring; and vaccine safety in administering to potentially critically endangered species. Recently, a vaccine trial for Ebola was carried out on captive chimpanzees to inform future conservation (Warfield et al. 2014) .",15.1791460047638,10.399832768804476

Secondly, the investment of schistosomiasis control was under a budgeting system responsible by the state.

If NPI support can be influenced through introduction to certain measures, then it may be possible to expose populations to NPIs in advance of an emergency. The exposure of populations to face masks prior to an outbreak is a particularly intriguing option, since they are inexpensive and easy to distribute. While the effectiveness of face-mask usage is currently under debate (MacIntyre et al., 2009; Cowling et al., 2010; Tracht, Del Valle, and Hyman, 2010) , their usefulness may go beyond their direct role in disease prevention and instead be a way to increase population compliance with other NPIs, such as quarantine. The effectiveness discussion is largely scientific; however, an individual may perceive an experience of face-mask usage as 'positive' with a much more simple perspective. This could happen when he/she does not become ill or does not make the family ill when wearing the mask, or simply when he/she finds the wearing of the mask to be non-burdensome. If face masks were shown to be completely ineffective or harmful in the future, though, this could lead to a negative gateway experience, potentially reducing future compliance. In much the same way as hand sanitizers came to be widely accepted before H1N1, the correct usage of pre-pandemic exposures to public health interventions may create a more public health aware and savvy population.",15.371088966705429,7.376357264064063

Recent data from our department suggest that such changes can last for up to two years (119) . We hypothesize that the ecosystem is altered directly by reduction in pathogen numbers and indirectly by altering the status of the local host tissues. In particular, reduction in local inflammation would lead to lower levels of gingival crevicular fluid, diminishing a prominent source of nutrients for the growth of subgingival taxa (339, 360, 373) . These alterations may lead to the additional slow but continued decline in a wide range of additional subgingival taxa. Further, periodontal therapy results in reduction of the deep periodontal pockets that foster colonization of red and orange complex species (337, 339) . The treatment of periodontal diseases, for the most part, does not involve the reduction of a single bacterial species, but rather the alteration of an ecosystem to one in which pathogenic species remain below the threshold required for disease initiation or progression, while commensal species are favored (364) . Changes in the composition of the subgingival microbiota are accompanied by changes in the habitat, particularly the adjacent host tissues. The alteration of the local environment, in turn, leads to an altered ecosystem and additional changes in the composition of the subgingival microbiota with reduction in the numbers of many other taxa. The new climax community approximates the one typical of periodontal health. Thus, the effect of therapy is to ""set the clock back"" for the development of the mature biofilm, requiring the subgingival microbiota to go through the time-consuming changes necessary to trigger disease recurrence.",15.025227218642037,6.904995573978592

The new discourses, while still stressing the importance of economic construction, further require that people's well-being be placed at the core, and stress the comprehensive, balanced, and sustainable development of 'a harmonious socialist society' as reflected by allround improvements in Chinese people's quality of life (Hu, 2007) . As Table 2 shows, such people-oriented approaches are conspicuous in the social demand sub-categories for the 2007 policy, such as promoting traditional Chinese culture, realizing human rights to leisure time, and learning from international practice. Furthermore, even the economic considerations taken into account for the 2007 policy make reference to sustainability values such as balanced development and equal opportunity. What is particularly worth noting here is the specific timing of the promulgation of the 2007 policydDecember 2007, which was only one month after the convention of the 17th National Congress of the CPC, where the 'scientific outlook on development' ideology was formally proposed. This short interval may have been emblematic of the considerable and immediate impact of ideological shifts on the legitimacy of the policy changes made in the 2007 regulation. Finally, the 'scientific outlook on development' approach is still seen as an integral advance based on Deng Xiaoping Theory; such ideological harmony may have accounted for the partial policy changes made in 2007 whereby the May Day golden week was abolished and the other two golden week retained.",23.806272822941168,10.627264216953206

Our findings both echo existing theoretical elaborations and explain Chinese peculiarities. First, the findings corresponding to the first research objective, for which the results demonstrate a significant change in the dominant policy demands taken into account in the respective policy making processes undertaken in 1999 and 2007, consolidate theoretical discussions on policy change that analogize the policy process as a dynamic equilibrium with policy punctuations being the norm rather than the exception (Baumgartner & Jones, 1993; Sabatier & Jenkins-Smith, 1993) . Meanwhile, classical theoretical discourses designate policy changes as responses to the occurrence of abrupt major incidents known as potential focusing events (PFEs) (Birkland, 1997) . However, the policy change observed in this study seems to have been influenced by a cohort of complex and sometimes competing demands which were triggered not only by a number of PFEs, but also by factors of a more incremental nature. Such a complex group of forces influencing policy change may be accounted for by the Chinese leadership's traditional emphasis on 'gradual and prudent decision making' (Wu, 2005, p. 67) .

The pooling of samples was unavoidable due to resource limitations precluding the use of the commercial kit on samples from a large number of individuals. Although rt-PCR assay is considered more sensitive than conventional PCR, a use of standard PCR for brucellosis and PPR, and rt-PCR for BTV was associated to the availability of assay for each of these pathogens under limited resources in the laboratory. A random selection of animals was a consequence of the fact that selection of animals for resampling based on preliminary disease prevalence data was not practicable because most of the animal owners were nomadic and there exist an absolute lack of animal identification/tagging system. All camels included in this study were apparently healthy at the time of sampling and, according to the owners, none of them had previously shown clinical signs of brucellosis, BT and PPR, or at least they were not aware of it. Hence, these results indicate the disease carrying potential of camels posing a serious concern to veterinary and public health, and subsequent food insecurity. A continuous disease surveillance and appropriate interventions, particularly the vaccination of camel population, is suggested for an effective control of brucellosis, BT and PPR in the region.

However, little research has examined the driving force behind this systemdthe Chinese government. China has endeavored to establish a socialist market economy over the past three decades, and the Chinese government, with a uniquely centralized party-state dualism, a largely internally driven policy making model, and a highly centralized bureaucracy, is still believed to exercise firm control over the trajectory of the majority of social and economic phenomena in the country (Chao & Dickson, 2001; Zhang et al., 2005) . The golden week holiday are no exception. The Chinese government's move to commute days from adjacent weekends and form week-long holidays is an example of the considerable executive leverage it has. This type of executive power has only been seen sporadically in countries such as France, Brazil, and Japan several decades ago (Samuel, 1993) . In addition, policy making in the golden week holiday has been unique because of the relative instability of the policy subsystem of the golden week holiday, with dynamic shifts in the structure and interactions of the components both outside and within the Chinese bureaucracy. Actually, as the paper is being written, hot debates are being conducted over further policy changes to the golden week holiday system.

First, on the specific research methodologies employed in this study, despite the efforts of the authors during the analysis stage, content analysis has long been criticized for its neglect of semantic structure, inflation of the theme count, and lack of sensitivity (Neuendorf, 2002) . Also, due to time, financial and social network constraints, the limited access possessed by the authors to data sources for this study may have undermined the validity of the research results. While the amounts of text units out of the 45 collected documents have been deemed sufficient pursuant to the research purposes of this study, the validity of the research results of this study would be greatly enhanced if more primary research resources could be secured. In addition, the lack of established criteria for evaluating research objective 3 may have weakened the subjective conclusions reached by the authors. Thus, the research design required the use of more rigorous research methodologies that could better accommodate the research objectives and more credible data sources. Third, with regard to the conceptual framework for the study, taking into account the growing influence of external factors on the Chinese policy subsystem, which has been undergoing a fundamental transformation with the deepening of the reform and opening-up of the economy and the establishment of a socialist market economy, the introduction and due investigation of foreign components may further complement the existing framework by giving a more comprehensive picture of contemporary Chinese policy making, especially the 2007 mechanism.

The deputy-ministerial rank of the China National Tourism Administration (CNTA) under the Chinese central government was also a factor in the low degree of influence the CNTA has in policy making on golden week. For instance, in addition to the CNTA, there are 13 ministerial departments that have jurisdiction over the administration of tourist attractions in China (Zhang et al., 2005) , and it has been admitted that across the whole Chinese tourism industry, only the hotel and travel agency sectors are within the exclusive realm of the CNTA (Gao, 2006) . Nevertheless, it is particularly ironic that the findings of this study show that a strange mix of tourism policy has been observed: tourism concerns were not meant to occupy the central stage in the 1999 policy making process, yet the 1999 policy was retrospectively bestowed with the splendid title of 'the golden week', mostly because of their effect in stimulating Chinese domestic and outbound tourism. The changes made to the policy in 2007, as embodied in the abolition of the May Day golden week, were partly stimulated by the public angst about the negative tourism impact the policy had had, notwithstanding the supportive stance of the CNTA in lobbying for the retention of the 1999 policy. This shows the pronounced contrast between the considerable weight attached to and debate over tourismrelated policies among the general public on one hand, and the limited leverage of the tourism authorities within the Chinese bureaucracy on the other. With soaring demand for travel among the Chinese people as a result of sustained economic growth, it remains to be seen whether such a gap will induce a fundamental transformation of the Chinese tourism policy arena, and more research on this point would be worthwhile and insightful, especially if the role played by the CNTA in other Chinese tourism policy issues is investigated on comparative and longitudinal bases.",15.839897952655438,6.11072121661188

The suspicions are based upon the fact that when sampling amniotic fluid of women who have preterm contractions, but not cervical change, it is noted that the women who had culture-confirmed infection had elevated rates of PTD and overall morbidity [24] .

For example, in an outbreak with R 0 = 2.5 and h = 0.5 (figure 2d, red lines), making improvements in isolation practices (decreasing k value) has little effect on R if current control measures place the system at point A, but shows dramatic benefits if the system is at point B. Conversely, increasing h c significantly boosts control from point A but has negligible effects from point B. This threshold arises because even if all cases are isolated immediately (h c = 1) the epidemic will not be contained unless k is sufficiently low. Conversely, even if isolation stops transmission entirely (k = 0), the outbreak will not be contained unless a sufficient proportion of cases are isolated soon enough. The sharpness of this threshold arises in part because the proportion of individuals not isolated by the nth day is (1 2 h c ) n , where values of n~10 2 20 are pertinent because individuals with SARS often remain symptomatic for an extended period. The threshold softens as R 0 increases, since when transmission rates are higher the critical values of n are smaller (i.e. individuals must be isolated sooner, on average, to keep R , 1). These findings highlight that pushing blindly to upgrade any given control measure may not advance the fight against SARS; with limited resources, the best approach is to identify where the current policy is failing (e.g. inadequate case identification versus ineffective isolation practices) and make targeted improvements.",21.53586376262458,11.342444868817559

When Is a Policy Issue Most Suited for Public Deliberation?,"More obviously, in health care and public health, where resources are limited and rationing may be necessary, policy-makers must weigh difficult trade-offs among funding for preventive care, emergency care, specialty care, mental health services, and myriad other options. While there are reasons to prioritize some of these options over others, there is no absolute hierarchy of their importance. The answer depends on what the public values or finds relevant to its collective health and well-being. While medical and economic data can illuminate the implications of different choices, the choices themselves require normative evaluation of priorities and acceptable compromises. 3 The kinds of value judgments required for policy decisions must also be considered. The aggregation of individual preferences toward specific public policies provides a limited perspective. Rather, we are interested in an aggregate of the values that individuals hold about a public good. One strength of public deliberation is its ability to shift participants from the ""what would/should I do?"" response often elicited by surveys to the ""what would/ should we do?"" reasoning more appropriate to many policy decisions. When citizens with various perspectives gather to ask these questions, the diverse impacts of public policy decisions are explicitly addressed in public decision-making.",24.3566422481058,11.768146265203882

The recent evolution in next-generation sequencing techniques and the introduction of high-throughput methods has resulted in an explosive cascade of research applications, spanning from target identification to diagnostics and therapeutics. These technical advances have provided the impetus for some radical changes in the way research itself is conceived and performed. As a result, enhanced interactions and broader collaborations among researchers with different expertise will be required just to keep up with the rapidly changing state of science. In order for a multidisciplinary approach to be effective, better ways to collect and share data (e.g. biorepositories) must be identified. In addition, a more rapid translation of information from basic science into useful clinical applications will require the removal of communication barriers and financial roadblocks that currently prevent basic science teams from working with each other and with clinical researchers.

This can be achieved via sharing available experiences and resources and can be maximized by building collaborative regional MICs. 4. Institutions from developing countries with no or limited access to high-quality medicines information resources should seek assistance from supportive organizations such as the WHO, which can offer free access to the Hinari database. Other freely available resources should be also sought. 5. Medicines information education should be promoted among colleges of pharmacy at various levels including didactic courses during undergraduate studies, during APPE training of PharmD students and as postgraduate studies and training (i.e., residencies, fellowships, and masters programs). 6. Training for developing and strengthening the medicines information skills should be provided regularly to all practicing pharmacists as part of the continuing professional development (CPD) programs 7. Advanced training can be scheduled for pharmacists working on the provision of medicines information services as part of CPD activities to build their capacities and to raise their competencies. 8. Countries with limited experiences in the area of medicines information should work on to learn from countries having well-established systems of medicines information and try to copy successful innovations. 9. There is a need to monitor and evaluate various resources of medicines information available in the developing countries as well as evaluating the services provided by the medicines information centers.

Many EDs in Beijing were designed between 20 and 30 years ago (or longer), mindful of the number of patients at that time. Currently, the volume of ED patients has more than doubled, but the available clinical space has remained the same. The data showed that only 138 acute care beds in 18 EDs have to hold 88,190 acute care patients each year, and the average boarding time of ED-boarded patients was 37 h. This ''exit block'' reduces the ED's capacity to accept newly arrived patients for care. Times exist when emergency medical services (EMS) crews are forced to wait in the ED with their newly arrived patient for several hours, because the conditions in the ED do not permit the EMS crew to off-load their patient into an ED care bed. This traps EMS crews in Beijing EDs. As a direct consequence, EMS responses to scenes of other ill or injured patients will be needlessly delayed. Further, to enable sufficient EMS responses, the city government must enable the training of more EMS crews than would be necessary if not for the inability of EMS crews to promptly off-load their newly arrived patients. Thus, ED exit block, which constrains ED capacity, also causes wasteful deployment and use of EMS resources.

In other words, the priority of meeting budgetary targets outweighed the priority of the provision of necessary patient care. The individual departments have no obligation to admit patients to their wards, even if such an admission is medically indicated, and these departments often do not have available beds or sufficient care capability. Thus, complex patients with chronic multisystem illnesses who cannot be sent elsewhere are admitted to ED observation units. The most common categories of patients in ED observation status are older persons with dementia or prior cerebrovascular accidents, or other late-stage disease or organ dysfunction. Included here are patients with advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic or acute-on-chronic respiratory failure due to other causes, latter stages of cancer, and other end-stage diseases. Many of these patients would be eligible for home care and postacute care resources such as long-term care or rehabilitation services, but cannot receive such care due to limited resources and a lack of beds.

They involve policy implementation that may be easier to enact and sustain. Cohorting, which attempts to limit transmission by decreasing the number of susceptible individuals with whom an infected individual might come in contact, is routinely used in hospital infection control. 61 For patients with diseases where airborne and droplet precautions are necessary, and private rooms are not available, it is recommended that an individual patient be grouped with other patients who have the same active infection with the same microorganism, but no other infections. 61 Outside a healthcare setting, identification of infected individuals is not possible. A different method of cohorting, which is practiced in military basic training centers, involves minimizing contact between training companies of approximately 100 to 200 people. Population-based evidence for the effectiveness of cohorting was observed during Marine initial entry training, but not later in advanced training, when companies had more contact with other companies. 29 Evidence of the effect of cohorting is suggested by the way clusters of cases occur during initial entry training. In two outbreaks in 1997 30 and 1998 31 at Fort Jackson SC, company-specific attack rates and temporal progression of ADV-associated ARD cases supported the spread of infection by cohorts. Thus, interruption of outbreaks may be possible if contact between members of separate training companies could be avoided early. In an ADV type-4 outbreak in 2000 at Fort Benning, 32 the involvement of only one training company, atypical of previous ADV type-4 outbreaks, may have been explained by the limited degree of interaction by members of that company with other trainees at the time.

Similarly, the WHO and higher-income States Parties agreed to provide technical and financial assistance to countries in need (Article 44), but with some exceptions, 44,45 very few have funded projects explicitly for building IHR core capacities. The bulwark of international financing has been in the form of vertical funding streams, such as for AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. All in all, sustainable funding commensurate with the need for IHR core capacities has come neither from national governments nor from donors.",14.654287287279299,9.155869525710262

The network emerged after repeated discussions between individuals centrally placed at international organizations. There was a perceived need to coordinate marine activities and connect them to the global climate agenda Galaz et al. (2011) . 3d. The network started with a few individuals and their respective organizations, and has grown over time. PaCFA has evolved from a loose communication network, to a formal partnership and recently (2010) became a UN Oceans-Taskforce. 3 It is currently unclear how it will develop over time, but it will likely remain (as a minimum) a communication-based learning and coordinating network. Evolution toward tangible joint field projects depends heavily on funding, see Galaz et al. (2011) . 3e. In a context where climate change is high on the political agenda, but where there is a limited understanding of the associated challenges and limited political connection between those challenges. 3f. The evolution of the network has gained modest support from governments through the FAO and its member states. The network successfully coordinated their activities with the Indonesian government during the climate negotiations leading up to the meeting in Copenhagen 2010 (COP 15). We have not identified any explicit opposition to the network. 3g. Coordination is assumed by a small number of key organizations, centered around the FAO. This institutional affiliation provides the network with legitimacy, connections, and necessary competence. However, it is also vulnerable as much of the coordination is centered around a small number of individuals, see Galaz et al. (2011) . 3h. Key coordinator of network has clear mandate by the FAO, and its work is embedded in UN Law of the Seas, and the Convention on Biological Diversity Galaz et al. (2011) . It should be noted however that ocean acidification and protection of marine ecosystems such as coral reef ecosystems have been denoted as ''non-regimes' ' Dimitrov et al. (2007) . The lack of formal regimes or institutions devoted to ocean acidification has however not been identified as a problem by key actors in network. Key barriers perceived by the network to further develop their work is rather a lack of funding and political support for the implementation of ecosystem-based approaches in marine systems, see Galaz et al. (2011) . 3i. Transparency is limited due to the informal structure of this network, see Galaz et al. (2011) . 3j. A number of issues related to internal legitimacy have been raised by network members especially related to the use of scientific organizations as leverage to influence international policy processes . Coordinating actors try to resolve external legitimacy challenges through actively recruiting members that secure a representation of diverse interests in the network, e.g., ranging from international organizations, to scientific organizations and NGO's in the global south. 3k.

Network members monitor different aspects of problems associated with climate changeocean acidification-marine biodiversity, however, only in a fragmented way. Marine ecological parameters are the main focus of monitoring activities ). 4b. There is an explicit focus on the need for action before critical ''tipping points'' have been transgressed. The network describes this situation as ''self-regulating and buffering processes [could] break down, leading to irreversible consequences.'' 4 This message is part of the information material and technical reports produced by the network. 4c. The network primarily coordinates its activities around political opportunities. The network deals primarily with knowledge diffusion among its members, attempts to coordinate local coastal marine management or climate adaptation projects, and highlevel lobbying. Scientific syntheses coordinated by the network play a key role for this last activity. For example, actors in the network were trying to gain international momentum for their cause and focused all their activities on trying to influence the international climate negotiations in Copenhagen 2009, with an ambition to integrate marine issues in those discussions. This required the capacity of all core actors in the network to tap into resources and knowledge, including international scientific institutions (e.g., ICES), international organizations (FAO, World Bank), and placebased research NGOs (WorldFish, with over a hundred partners, including universities and non-government organizations in the South). These syntheses not only provide an opportunity to bring together insights, but also feed into lobbying at high-level policy arenas ). 4d.

Methods: We included patients with a diagnosis of influenza for two consecutive influenza seasons, and retrospectively collected limited patient encounter data on patient location, transport, and compliance with assignment and transport precautions for both years. For the second influenza season we sent monthly reminders to all ED providers via the electronic medical record (EMR), explaining the importance and proper use of infection control precautions in patients with suspected influenza.

Compliance with infection control guidelines for influenza in the ED is generally unknown, and effective yet low-resource training is needed to educate staff on the importance of decreasing the potential for ED transmission of the virus. Objectives: This study evaluates compliance with patient assignment and transport precautions for influenza in an urban ED before and after implementation of electronic reminders. Methods: We included patients with a diagnosis of influenza for two consecutive influenza seasons, and retrospectively collected limited patient encounter data on patient location, transport, and compliance with assignment and transport precautions for both years. For the second influenza season we sent monthly reminders to all ED providers via the electronic medical record (EMR), explaining the importance and proper use of infection control precautions in patients with suspected influenza. Compliance between the two sea-sons was compared using descriptive statistics and chisquared analysis. Results: Overall compliance with infection control precautions was poor, but increased with the use of electronic reminders from 29% to 45% (p ‫؍‬ 0.015). Compliance with precautions for patients moved to the hallway or Radiology increased from 7% to 24% (p ‫؍‬ 0.001). Conclusions: The EMR may be a useful tool for improving compliance with transmission-based precautions by implementing reminders on order sets and informational mailings, and by tracking compliance. Future study should be undertaken to determine the most effective interventions to prevent ED transmission of influenza. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",11.476593740834371,6.76631409805889

For this reason decisions surrounding what should be done about new or pressing zoonotic risks are often contested, and finding the right balance between over-caution, laissez-faire approaches, and determining the weight given to different socioeconomic factors can be difficult. For example a lack of due diligence can expose the population to the risk of infection for far longer than necessary, as was the case with BSE. Conversely, the overzealous application of the precautionary principle can destroy the livelihood of a population, impact its food supply, limit development, and entrench or exacerbate socioeconomic disadvantage (World Health Organization, 2004) . Furthermore, when the zoonotic risk is new, attempts to explain the choice of policy are likely to be further complicated by uncertainty regarding the precise risk of infection, the drivers of disease emergence, and the measures needed to control the risk of infection. Therefore public support for policies that disrupt people's lives and communities or place precautionary limits on the development of natural resources might depend on their understanding of the causes and risks of zoonotic outbreaks, their trust in government agencies, and the likely consequences for them of different public health responses.",11.716055919888666,6.565926056660281

policy makers will have to consider whether such resource gaps can be closed in reality.

These gaps are, however, likely to occur over a limited duration if the cases occur over several weeks and the numbers of cases are limited. As the number of cases increases, however, provincial and national capacity is likely to be tested in certain ways if clinical care and surveillance are expected to remain at a similar standard as when cases are limited. The results of such a scenario are similar for some countries of western Europe (21) . Although policy makers will, in all likelihood, need to consider issues of rationing and priority setting explicitly in national strategic planning, resources in Thailand are substantial overall, although geographic distribution likely poses logistical challenges. In the event of a modest outbreak of pandemic infl uenza (WHO phase 6) similar to these locally developed scenarios, Thailand, a relatively affl uent country in Southeast Asia, might encounter relatively modest gaps in available resources. However, if a pandemic is substantial in terms of the severity of illness and proportion of deaths, resources are likely to be insuffi cient, and policy makers will have to consider whether such resource gaps can be closed in reality. This conclusion has important policy implications and raises several questions. Should most resources and planning be focused explicitly on early containment potentially at the expense of mitigation, particularly in developing countries? How, to whom, and where should the deployment of scarce resources be planned (22) ? A further issue raised is how realistic simulation exercises are and whether they effectively inform preparedness planning. Investment to address gaps in resources can be focused where the most important gaps exist. Some gaps, however, for example, in clinical and nursing staff, will take time and considerable investment to fi ll. We show at the province level where resource gaps are most profound and thus where future investment might be focused.",18.078524801586,11.527018609353775

Conflicting data from studies with poor design and/or low compliance does not constitute evidence against contact precautions; rather, these data are inconclusive. Whereas the study that performed best on our quality score found no significance between contact precautions and not isolating patients, this study did not consistently assess intervention compliance in the various study phases. 31 The included study that showed a difference in MDRO transmission with use of contact precautions did not report compliance rates and could not be assessed for quality on any of the other bias and confounding items of the quality assessment tool. 32 Inconsistencies and absences in compliance monitoring and reporting make it impossible to tell whether protocols were completed as intended, threatening the internal validity of these studies. 34 The CDC recently faced similar difficulty interpreting health outcomes after two healthcare workers were infected with Ebola virus in Texas, as it was unclear whether transmission had been due to inadequate isolation precaution protocols or to a protocol breach. 37 In practice, healthcare facilities should be regularly monitoring compliance, and investigating potential lapses when crosstransmission is documented, to potentially resolve systemsbased inefficiencies. It is also important for researchers to monitor and report compliance to understand what effectiveness level can be reasonably expected in practice where compliance may be lower than in clinical studies. Given the quality of evidence presented here, it may be advisable that healthcare workers and administrators continue to devote focus and resources to improve components of contact precautions and other infection prevention techniques with strong effectiveness evidence, such as hand hygiene technique and compliance. 3 ",17.291776204809786,9.667963477618331

As regarding the biological meaning of homologous crossovers with subgenomic components, these mechanisms can serve as an efficient strategy that RNA viruses may use to diversify their RNA genomes and/or to guard the integrity of viral genome. It allows them to not only shuffle their genes so to adjust to ever-changing environment, but also to exploit subgenomic components as potential backup in case of extensive damage of their replication-competent genomic RNAs. The fact that BMV utilizes its multifunctional CP to orchestrate recombination proves once more the economical nature of virus life cycle under the limited resources. It is possible that CP-mediated recombination might be a common process among (+) stranded RNA viruses. The accumulating evidence demonstrates close proximity of viral RNA replication and CP translation inside the host cell (Annamalai et al., 2008; Seo et al., 2012) . Thus, it is tempting to assume that RNA recombination processes are linked not only spatially but also they share protein factors.

The world emergent in the ad hoc alliances between States and NSAs has rendered a reordering of citizenship-the contract between individuals and their government for the recognition of the latter's sovereignty and the provision of the former's welfare, notably and increasingly the human rights to security and economic welfare (Hösle 2003) including the right to health-and its claims, necessary, if not yet viable. Practitioners and academics have both contributed to this change: reality affirming theory. Now the challenge is to bridge the gap. How this looks with regard to health is explored more deeply in the following chapter. April 2017. 4. Not her full name. 5. Conversational interviews, Pretoria, South Africa, 4 April 2017. 6.

The seven males and seven females were unrelated and neutered and ranged in age from 6 months to 13 years at the start of the 3-month study (approximately 336 hours of observation). The first finding was that these cats could live relatively peaceably at a density of 0.1 cat/m 2 or 113,000/km 2 , about 50 times greater than the highest densities described for feral groups outdoors (e.g., 2000 cats/km 2 ). 20 This suggests that cats are capable of dealing with social ""closeness"" in the home and do not have to be solitary, although, clearly, single cats can thrive. The 14 cats in the study group seemed to do this through space management, home ranges and favored spots, and tail signaling at a distance. These tactics provided information that could enable recipients to tailor their responses before contact was imminent, and so, for example, avoid aggression. Based on findings for feral cats, availability of resources likely also would be an important factor in behavior determination. This owner provided a food dish for each individual, spread water bowls and litterboxes throughout the house, and provided isolated food, water, and litter for individuals that did not venture far from a specific room because of illness or apparent avoidance behavior.

Although most viral pathogens cause limited morbidity in healthy adults, they can pose significant risks to both mother and fetus during pregnancy. 17, 18 Cardiorespiratory compromise can adversely affect maternal haemodynamic stability, thereby affecting fetal nourishment. 19 In addition, viruses which are transmitted transplacentally can cause fetal viraemia, leading to multiorgan infections. 20 This is particularly worrying as the detection of such infections is limited in mass gathering settings. 21 Furthermore, the clinical presentation of certain respiratory infections may be non-specific, especially in cases of seasonal influenza and H1N1, thus increasing the burden of laboratory testing. During Hajj, the Saudi Arabian healthcare system has limited resources at its disposal, particularly when it comes to the sophisticated molecular tests required for the diagnosis and identification of novel respiratory pathogens. [21] [22] [23] While there are operational stringencies in place for the isolation of suspected cases of infection, there are no approved antiviral drugs for treating novel respiratory pathogens-the teratogenic effects of which would need to be assessed in any case-nor available guidelines for their specific monitoring, prognosis or follow-up. 21 Moreover, hospitalisation can further increase the transmission of respiratory pathogens. 24 Unfortunately, sociolinguistic and ethnocultural differences are barriers to proposed measures aiming to help prevent the transmission of respiratory infections among Hajj pilgrims.",15.503774698610787,8.392355580739666

Descriptive policy analyses are well suited to analyzing policy making concerning risks by identifying the critical factors influencing decisionmaking as well as providing insights on where decision-making breaks down and, equally important, where it works effectively (Hogwood & Gunn, 1984) . Descriptive policy analyses in health, however, have often been based on the assumption that rational decisions are made on the basis of complete information (Pal, 1992) . Given the uncertainty of scientific information on potential health risks, these information-based models may not be adequate. Alternative models to evaluate decision-making have focused on the role of value systems or institutions. However, to be truly comprehensive, approaches to policy analysis integrating the impact of information, values and institutions are needed to ensure that both the policy makers and the public understand how decisions are made concerning health risks. Paul Sabatier has compiled some of the available frameworks for conducting descriptive policy analyses (Sabatier, 1993a) . One of the criteria used for selecting frameworks is that they address the roles of conflicting values and interests, information flows, institutional arrangements and variations in socioeconomic environment on the policy process. The following frameworks were identified as useful for describing decision-making within a given political system or set of institutional arrangements: the stages heuristic, institutional rational choice, multiple-streams framework, punctuated equilibrium framework and the advocacy coalition framework. The last framework, the advocacy coalition framework (ACF), was proposed by Sabatier and suggests that decision making occurs in a policy subsystem involving individuals from a variety of public and private organizations who are actively concerned with a policy problem. Within this subsystem, individuals aggregate into advocacy coalitions based on shared ideologies and beliefs. The success of the coalitions in translating their beliefs into policy is dependent upon their resources (money, expertise, legal authority and size). Policy brokers attempt to mediate the conflict between the various advocacy coalitions. This process of conflict and mediation eventually results in policy outputs by the governing structures in the subsystem (Sabatier, 1987; Sabatier, 1993b ). The ACF model has been identified as being effective in describing decision-making in a variety of policy sectors (Jenkins-Smith & Sabatier, 1994) .",16.446683134416276,8.037535771750248

Studies among adults with febrile illness who required hospital admission documented case fatality ratios that ranged from 5% to 24% [2, 3] . In 2010, global estimates of causes of child death determined that almost two-thirds of deaths in children younger than 5 years were attributable to infectious causes, of which malaria was considered 1 of the top 3 causes [1] . In low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), where limited resources hinder diagnostic capacity, clinical management is infrequently supported by knowledge of the predominant local and regional etiologic pathogens. As a result, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, acute febrile illness is commonly diagnosed as malaria. However, since the introduction of rapid diagnostics for malaria and implementation of malaria-control strategies in several countries, the number of diagnosed malaria cases has declined substantially [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . As a consequence, the overdiagnosis of malaria and overtreatment in febrile illness has been increasingly recognized [10] [11] [12] [13] and necessitates an improved understanding of nonmalarial causes of acute febrile illness [14] .",13.349225987790968,9.014143284588686

In this regard, mapping risk variations in child morbidity is an invaluable tool. Further, the mapping of variation in risk of childhood morbidity can help improve the targeting of scarce resources for public health interventions. Therefore, Geographic Information System (GIS) is a powerful tool for public health practitioners that can easily allow them to assess patterns, trends and relationships between health events and environmental, socio-economic and other geographic factors (see for instance the case of disease surveillance, preparedness and response coordination to combat health threats such as West Nile virus, anthrax, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and bioterrorism (Gardner & Harrington, 2003) ). GIS further helps us to understand childhood disease prevalence at the community level (see for instance Garg, Omwomo, Witte, Lee, & Deming, 2001; Mbonye, 2003 Mbonye, , 2004 ) and helps to identify underserved populations, and can help public health agencies to efficiently allocate scarce program resources to appropriate locations. For example, the Communicable Disease Control Division of the Boston Public Health Commission (BPHC) uses GIS to help identify at-risk populations and determine where to focus efforts to vaccinate residents against influenza. This paper is based on a study of the spatial distribution of childhood diarrhoea and fever in Malawi. The study applied Bayesian statistical and geo-statistical techniques to the 2000 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data of Malawi with location (district) attributes and other information to answer specific questions about geographic inequalities in childhood disease prevalence. The DHS in Malawi conducted in 2000 is a valuable resource for population-based morbidity data, although we recognize its limitation, like other DHSs elsewhere, in that it relates only to reported child morbidity during the last 2 weeks before the survey. Thus, our results might be influenced by the effects of seasonality in diseases prevalence.",12.78850852814437,8.271943060343387

For substantial emissions reductions, new and radical technologies will need to be introduced such as blended wing body aircraft and unducted-propfan engines. There are few prospects at the moment for alternative fuels such as liquid hydrogen to make substantial emissions savings and the utility of using biofuels in the aviation sector remains uncertain, principally because of the stringent requirements over fuel composition for reasons of safety. A limited range of scenarios was examined to estimate what degree of CO 2 saving could be made by 2030. The potential savings are limited because of the long-lifetime of new aircraft; for example, the fleet in 2030 will substantially comprise the best of today's technology, which has been delivering diminishing returns in terms of fuel efficiency. All 2030 scenarios resulted in increased emissions in line with the underlying growth of passenger demand ranging from 2.0 to 3.3 times 2002 CO 2 emissions. Policies and measures have been difficult to formulate for the aviation sector in relation to CO 2 ; fuel taxation is unpopular with many countries and emissions trading has had only limited proposed implementation. Currently, the only proposal for a legal policy framework that directly addresses targeted reduction of aviation CO 2 emissions is that of the EU which intends to incorporate aviation into its wider emissions trading scheme in a phased manner in 2012.

Limitations of the model. Lack of reliable data prevented us from considering geo-spatial aspects of mixing group formation in the testbed implementation. We also did not consider the impact of public education and use of personal protective measures (eg, face masks) on transmission, again due to a lack of effectiveness data. 83 We did not study the marginal effectiveness of individual resources due to a considerable uncertainty about the transmissibility of a future pandemic virus and efficacy of vaccine and antiviral. For the same reason, the vaccine and antiviral risk groups considered in the testbed can be adjusted, as different prioritization schemes have been suggested in the literature, based on predicted characteristics of a future virus. The form of social distancing implemented in the testbed can also be modified as a variety of schemes can be found in the literature, including geographical and social targeting. Effectiveness of these approaches is substantially influenced by the policy compliance, for which limited accurate data support exists.

First, our data cover two distinct periods: before and after a major policy change in 2006, which is the introduction of an entirely different type of license plates. It provides us a unique opportunity to study the change in the value of superstitions in response to the policy change. We also link the data to the stock market index and examine whether the value of superstitions varies with the macroeconomic environment. Second, we estimate plates of different types separately, rather than jointly as in Woo and Kwok (1994) , and Woo et al. (2008) . In addition to being a strategy to disentangle the effect of superstitions from the effect of conspicuous consumption, a point discussed in Section 3.1, our estimation strategy allows us to ask how the value of superstitions changes across different types of plates, a question addressed in Section 4.2.1. It is important to note that although we use a different estimation strategy, our estimated coefficients are consistent with those in Woo and Kwok (1994) , and Woo et al. (2008) , suggesting that their qualitative results are robust. 3 Along the same line, Foster and Kokko (2008) presented a simple model in which the false causalities people develop survive over natural selection, therefore becoming superstitions. 4 For instance, Mr. Dilip Rangnekar and Miss Elizabeth Young from the Communications Department of Otis Elevator Company, the world's largest elevator manufacturer, confirmed to us on November 20, 2008 that roughly 80% of their elevators around the world do not have the 13th-floor button.

In POCF, Hofferbert noted that five elements-historicgeographic conditions, socioeconomic composition, mass political behavior, governmental institutions, and elite behavior-affect the policy output directly and indirectly (Hofferbert 1974) . His view is that these five factors undergo the process of ""passing through the tunnel"" in consecutive order, thereby directly and indirectly affecting policy output. He considered historic-geographic conditions and socioeconomic composition as different elements because two states having similar environment and natural resources often have a different socioeconomic composition, and put historic-geographic conditions before socioeconomic composition because the former tends to change less than the latter.

Low scores for compliance and ease of implementation of using NPV rooms and N95 respirators were particularly evident at LGH. The former reflected the state of renovations at the time of the survey. Reported differences between VGH and LGH regarding N95 respirator use likely reflect a difference in organizational culture rather than resource availability; the algorithms had been in place for approximately 1 year at LGH compared with 5 years at VGH, and a previous audit documented that respirators were accessible at all sites. 5 The challenge of adhering to guidelines regarding commode use as it pertains to the GI algorithm was illustrated in the following statement and reflected inadequate resources. ''Sometimes it is difficult to have a designated commode at the bedside due to not having enough commodes at the bedside. Often times we have to wipe down commodes aggressively so the next patient can have a disinfected commode.'' Compared with other HCWs, physicians reported lower compliance with the respiratory algorithm and scored lower on their perception that the algorithms protected either staff or patients. This contrasts with results from a survey conducted by Virginia Commonwealth University, in which physicians reported significantly better compliance with hand hygiene, contact precautions, and airborne precautions compared with other occupations. 6 Results were explained by different motives for compliance: RNs were motivated by patient safety more than personal safety, whereas physicians reported personal safety as more of a motivating factor. 6 Our findings showed that personal and patient safety were both strong motivating factors for all occupations.",17.766475125941696,9.402945873814396

Second, national planning for disease control requires a good understanding of disease dynamics on farms in order to inform models of the transmission dynamics between farms. Some key parameters for such models are time to detection and farm latent and infectious periods, all of which can be inferred from well-parametrized mathematical models.",15.885667461443516,8.865862977903088

The country has mostly sought to be a socially progressive force, punching above its weight and exerting influence disproportionate to its financial and military resources. Leaders in Canada have been prominent and respected con tributors to global health research, practice, and diplomacy for decades (panel 1). At times, however, the tendency to give primacy to consensus building, inclusion, and equity has led to a lack of decisiveness and timely strategic action. Conversely, when Canada has strayed from progressive social values, and economic selfinterest has been prioritised in foreign policy, the country's perceived leadership in the global health community has dim inished. On the basis of this analysis, we identify lessons for the Canadian federal government, acting strategically with limited political and economic resources, to translate values of equity and inclusion into strong, bold, and much-needed leadership in global health.",16.15610430713537,8.769858842359135

Different approaches to intervention time series analysis have been adopted in the evaluation of programs and policies in a number of criminal justice settings (McCleary and Hay,1980; McDowall et al.,1980; Orwin,1997) . The standard approach to time series analysis in this framework aims at discriminating between the behaviour of the time series prior to the intervention and after the intervention. In other words, ""given a known intervention, is there evidence that change in the series of the kind expected actually occurred, and, if so, what can be said of the nature and magnitude of the change,"" (Box and Tiao, 1975) . From the effective crime policy perspective it is important to assess whether a known intervention (policy change) has had the intended effect. For example, it is important to know whether an increased reliance on prisons, an increased number of police, tougher gun control laws, and innovative criminal justice programs and policies reduce crime rates and deter potential criminals from committing crimes.",17.182850805623044,8.486018083190867

Although three-quarters of the school nurses in this study reported receiving the seasonal influenza vaccine during the 2010-11 season, the uptake rate remains well below the target of 90% compliance outlined in Healthy People 2020. 31 It is essential that school districts work to increase influenza vaccine uptake among school nurses, because this will likely result in decreased influenzarelated morbidity and mortality. One factor that may be influencing school nurse influenza vaccine uptake is the low prevalence of mandatory vaccine policies reported by the school nurses in this study. Previous research indicates that approximately 12% of nonhospital agencies have a mandatory vaccination policy, 30, 32, 33 yet only approximately 2% of the school nurses in this study reported having such a policy. Mandatory vaccination policies have been found to be very strong predictors of vaccine uptake, 30 and multiple organizations, including the CDC 34 and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America, 35 recommend that all health care workers be vaccinated against influenza every year. School administrators should consider implementing a seasonal influenza vaccination policy for nurses that is a condition of employment. 35 School districts also should create a system to track nurses' seasonal influenza vaccine compliance, a recommendation made by the CDC for US health care agencies. 36, 37 This will facilitate vaccine compliance during a disaster or pandemic, which should decrease event-related morbidity and mortality. It also may be prudent for schools to mandate seasonal influenza vaccination for teachers and other staff who have close contact with students.

Prevention of these events will involve two changes in policy. The first is to recognize that isolation wards cannot be staffed with the same nurse-to-patient ratio as a regular ward. Care of patients in isolation is more time intensive due to both the physical barriers (e.g., anterooms, doors kept closed at all times) and the required use of protection equipment. The nurse-to-patient ratio on the SARS ward at the time of the arrest was between 1:4 and 1:5; a more ideal ratio might be 1:2 or 1:3. It is also necessary to have a lower threshold for transferring patients to a higher acuity setting (i.e., ICU or stepdown unit) when they first begin to show signs of a clinical deterioration. To enable this, all patients on a SARS unit should have measurement of vital signs along with pulse oximetry at a minimum of every 4 hours. Should their oxygen saturation drop below 92% on room air one should administer oxygen through nasal prongs 1-4 L per minute to maintain saturation >92%, and increase vital signs/pulse oximetry to every 2 hours. If the patient subsequently requires oxygen through nasal prongs at >4 L per minute the responsible physician should be notified and increase vital signs or pulse oximetry to every 1 hour. Finally, if the patient requires supplemental oxygen of >40% to maintain saturation >92%, the patient should be transferred to the intensive care unit and undergo elective intubation in a controlled manner. This later policy has worked well in other SARS units, as well as in hospital A after it was implemented by one of the authors (M.L.) after this cluster.",15.304206663258467,8.187412960192221

During an emerging epidemic, individuals with particular risk factors or health conditions (e.g. the elderly or the immunocompromised) are particularly at higher risk of morbidity and mortality [27] [28] [29] . Providing vaccine to these high-risk individuals has a significant direct benefit in preventing mortality. However, individuals with high contact rates with the rest of the population (e.g. school-aged children) may also be attractive vaccine candidates due to their key role in transmission. The second policy-related question we study in this paper is how to rationalize the limited supply of vaccines between population subgroups who are at different level of mortality risk (e.g. healthy individuals versus those with certain conditions), and who play a different role in disease transmission (e.g. children versus the elderly) [30] .",15.262991607659664,9.962586012647312

The loss function r(A k , χ k ) can be characterized in a variety of ways depending on the policy maker's priorities. For example, if the policy maker wants to minimize the total number of influenza cases over the course of epidemic, then loss function r(A k , χ k ) can be simply defined as the number of new influenza cases during the period [k, k + 1]. However, efforts to control epidemics may be bounded by the availability of resources, in particular budget. In these situations, where both healthrelated and financial outcomes are essential for determining the optimality of a health policy, a common approach is to assume that the policy maker's objective is to minimize the loss in population's net health benefit (NHB) [38] .

This determination seems to depend not only on the magnitude of the exceedance but on the nature of the illness and other information that is available about the set of affected individuals. Thus, the current published definitions of outbreak and epidemic are necessary (i.e., there must be an exceedance) but not sufficient (some exceedances do not qualify) conditions for labeling an exceedance an outbreak.

Consequently, we wish to assess the potential for model discrimination when sampling is only performed on a subset of days, rather than every day. If we choose to only sample on D < 14 days, within the first 14 days following the first symptomatic case in each household, we must necessarily also choose the optimal days on which to sample. We call the number of days D being sampled the design size. We choose those days that produce the highest classification accuracy on a left-out test set. This design problem is small, with only ( 14 D ) designs of size D (or 2 14 = 16 , 384 total designs) to evaluate, so we apply exhaustive search in this case; however a combinatorial optimisation algorithm could be applied and would likely be necessary in a more complex design problem to search for the optimal design. Potentially symptom onset data could be made complete for this style of study by, for example, asking each household on which day all individuals with symptoms first presented with them (rather than just the individuals who presented symptoms on the sampling days); although some loss in quality of data might be expected. In other cases it might be necessary to perform a test (e.g., virological testing) as part of the sampling program, in which case choosing optimal designs that are as small as possible can save substantial resources.

The early reports in heart transplantation suggest that symptom expression during the phase of establishment of infection are similar to non-immunosuppressed individuals; however, in limited series the second wave determined by the host-inflammatory response appears to be milder, possibly due to the concomitant use of immuno-modulatory drugs. 5, 6 Similarly, an epidemiological study from Wuhan in a cohort of 87 patients suggests that precautionary measures of social distancing, sanitization and general hygiene allow heart transplant recipients to experience a low rate of COVID-19 illness. 7 We do not of course, know if they are asymptomatic carriers, since in this survey-based study universal testing during the early 3 months was not employed.

These missions work to improve health but are also driven by training needs and the intent to “win hearts and minds through the use of health interventions” (101, p. 3).

While mask use can help to mitigate transmission, the supply & demand model suggests that panic buying at the very early phase of an epidemic can be detrimental, and that managing demand in the early stages of the outbreak could be beneficial. In Taiwan, the government implemented such a resource management strategy in early February 2020, limiting the number of masks each person can buy per week with their National Health Insurance cards [25] .

However, the timing of this e↵ect (early to mid February) is important to consider. The decrease in the observed US ILI peak occurred before widespread closures of public spaces and implementation of social distancing to mitigate COVID-19 transmission. Our results could indicate that the use of personal NPIs such as handwashing and voluntary social distancing may have been occurring before policy changes took place in March 2020. In a survey conducted in early February 2020, US respondents rated their risk perception of COVID-19 as a median score of 5 out of 10, and more than 90% of participants were aware of infection prevention measures [22] . Our mechanistic model suggests that an average of 5% reduction in transmission likelihood could result in the ILI dynamics observed of the 2019-2020 season. Past studies have shown that frequent, e↵ective handwashing can result in a comparable moderate reduction in infections [23, 24, 25] .

Therefore, it is imperative that the UK Government, and governments around the world, quickly develop and implement policies to support the most vulnerable, in a bid to minimise the long-term social and economic harm caused by COVID-19. Government policy should recognise the disparity in impact across socio-economic groups, particularly across the labour market, and should aim to support workers equitably across the income spectrum. This would likely help increase compliance across the population to the levels required to suppress transmission and thereby reduce the strain on national health services, both in the UK and abroad.

The reduced-form statistical techniques we use are designed to measure the total magnitude of the effect of changes in policy, without attempting to explain the origin of baseline growth rates or the specific epidemiological mechanisms linking policy changes to infection growth rates (see Methods). Thus, this approach does not provide the important mechanistic insights generated by process-based models; however, it does effectively quantify the key policyrelevant relationships of interest using recent real-world data when fundamental epidemiological parameters are still uncertain.",14.232067238865735,7.714427767249401

Important for the current debate about the natural history of the disease, this policy would also work if there is a fraction of asymptomatic but infectious individuals in the population. Our results also show that from a practical point of view, a combination of all the analyzed contexts can have second order benefits. As already stressed, containment measures should not only be directed towards a full cutdown of the number of infected cases. Their efficacy is also given by other factors, such as delaying, even if only by a few days, the spreading of the disease. Such delays are always good for preparedness and to have more time for clinical research that can lead to new pharmacological treatments or vaccines. For instance, even if traffic restrictions are not effective on their own, they facilitate the control of the population and thus it would be easier to detect infected individuals and treat them. Similarly, self-protection measures and other social-distancing practices delay the spreading of the disease, freeing resources that would allow for a better management of the epidemic, in turn leading to an increase of the efficacy of individual isolation. Closing public places would, in practice, reduce the transmission, which again will lower the total number of infections and thus make them more manageable for the public health system. This also highlights the importance of having a coordinated response system, since simply adopting central measures like imposing mobility restrictions and closing public places is not effective in the middle-to-long term.",8.466126962263594,6.986230388597372

This makes the task of policy makers notoriously difficult, as they need to design realistic, implementable, confinement measures that reduce the impact of the epidemic sufficiently within the shortest time frame possible. If the interventions planned are too weak, the epidemic will not cease and the surge capacity of healthcare systems will be surpassed, leaving many individuals requiring hospitalization out of the attention they need. Furthermore, once policy makers realize the insufficiency of the interventions put in place, the epidemic may have spread up to a point such that only the most severe interventions will be of real use. On the other side, implementing very strict confinement measures from an early stage would give governments a much needed time to prepare against the attack of the disease, but would most likely take a huge toll in the economy, and consequently, in the population.",9.043752809764902,6.791192830742087

It was based on confirmed cases, and by excluding suspected cases or mild cases may have under-estimated the rate of spread of the disease. We did not estimate the values of the parameters defining the transition rate from exposed to infectious, or infected to recovered, but fixed them at previously published values. This was a necessary decision because the clinical features of the disease are not yet fully understood, and may affect estimates. However, our intuition after fitting these models is that the maximum likelihood estimate of the force of infection naturally adjusts to fit the value of the recovery rate, and produces a broadly similar value of the basic reproduction number as a result. Furthermore, to adjust for the still-arbitrary nature of these estimates of key parameters, we used some methods that do not depend on any assumptions about these aspects of the disease process. Another limitation of this study is the uncertainty introduced by the use of multiple modeling methods, which we combined with a weighted average. However, we believe that by presenting varying methods with different assumptions along with a weighted average, we enable researchers and policy-makers to make judgements about the dangers of the epidemic without relying on any particular set of assumptions about a disease that is not yet well understood.",10.261436140589884,6.524956840891182

In the initial phase, NU was randomly and uniformly distributed in NC; that is, the number of individuals in each city was NU/NC. One individual in a major city was randomly selected as the first infected person. The simulation program ran 200 timeframes, during which individuals might undergo spatial movement and a state change at any time frame (for example, daily). First, without considering the status of city and residential unit lockdowns, individuals moved to neighboring cities at a probability of the across-community mobility rate of the population (MU). Secondly, individuals in all cities either changed or maintained their original states based on the rules of the SAIRD model. Figure 2 shows differences in the ratios of individuals in the five states in the core locked down cities and the ratios of infected users in each city. With respect to timing, if a city was locked down after an infected user was confirmed and given no residential unit lockdown and no increase in medical resources, the ratio of individuals in S state would be 0% at steady state; that is, all individuals would be infected. This was without regard to whether the city was under early ( Figure 2C ), late ( Figure 2B ), or no lockdown (Figure 2A ). Regarding variance in the ratios of D individuals among all cities, the earlier a city was locked down ( Figure 2F , TLC = 5), the greater the variance in the proportions of D individuals state across all 81 cities (VARD ~ 0.05). This indicated that the number of deaths in the core cities that were under lockdown was significantly higher than in other cities. By comparison, variance in the proportions of D individuals across the 81 cities was lower when no cities were locked down (VARD of ~ 0.02; Figure 2D ). Overall, the implementation of measures to place cities under lockdown could not reduce the ratios of infected individuals in the SAIRD model. The implementation of measures to lock down cities would result in larger variances in the number of deaths between cities with and without lockdown. These findings were consistent with the perspective of Li et al. (2020) , who reported that the stringent lockdown policy applied to Hubei Province had suspended a nationwide outbreak of COVID-19 [8] . However, mortality rates in lockdown cities were higher because infected individuals in core cities were unable to move to other cities. .
