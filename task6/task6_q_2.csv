For CFR values Influenza Research and Treatment 5 between 0.1% and 1.0% (Categories 2 and 3), in addition to at-home isolation, the following measures are recommended: (i) voluntary quarantine of household members of infected cases and (ii) child and adult social distancing.

The objective of the model is to allocate some of the available mitigation resources to the new outbreak region (actual distribution) while reserving the rest of the quantities for potential outbreak regions (virtual distribution). By doing so, the model seeks to progressively minimize the impact of ongoing outbreaks and the expected impact of potential outbreaks, spreading from the ongoing locations. Mitigation resources can include stockpiles of vaccines and antivirals, administration capacity, hospital beds, medical supplies, and social distancing enforcement resources, among others.

This may be partially explained by the fact that Hong Kong has relatively short school holidays except for the summer holidays. In many cases, R t has already been decreasing well before the summer holiday (Fig. 2) . Besides, previous findings showed that household plays an important role in HFMD transmission, where the transmission risk among siblings could reach 84% 33 .

We did not attempt to examine the potential effect of reactive school closure due to HFMD outbreaks, during which the social activities of the children may have a very different pattern from those in holidays. There were large HFMD outbreaks in 2010 in Hong Kong which led to some school closures and had significantly raised the awareness and preparedness in the schooling setting in the subsequent years. Considering the high social cost and enhanced preventive measures already in place at schools, the additional effect of school closure to reduce HFMD transmission may be limited. Furthermore, even if the EV71 vaccine would be available in Hong Kong in the future, it may have limited effect on HFMD transmission at the population, as the EV71 serotype was responsible for less than 20% of the HFMD outbreaks in Hong Kong 5 .

Recent studies of the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic have quantified the role of demographic factors, school cycles and social distancing measures (e.g., school closure) on disease transmission [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] , but their effect combined with climatic factors is less clear [6, 7] .

The early introduction of social distancing measures, such as school and church closures and banning of mass gatherings, significantly reduced excess mortality during the 1918-19 influenza pandemic [33] . With similar contagious diseases, such as SARS, plague and cholera, quarantines and evacuations have been used to counter severe outbreaks.

The effect is due to both school holidays and weekend closures, the latter periodically dampening transmission. Variations in travel behavior do not lead instead to visible effects. The observed impact strongly depends on the timing of the school closure, and to a lesser extent on its duration. Christmas holiday is the school break generally playing the most important role in mitigating the epidemic course, though variations are observed depending on the influenza season (e.g. early vs. late epidemic).

While longer delays in local transmission to the summer in countries in the Northern hemisphere could have substantially aided pandemic mitigation, due to seasonal factors [3] and school vacations [10, 11] leading to lower peak attack rates [12] , the observed delays in the present pandemic suggest entry screening provided around 1-2 weeks of additional time for preparation and planning. While our study focused on the impact of entry screening, some nations also implemented other containment and mitigation measures, such as isolation of suspected or confirmed cases, quarantine of their contacts with or without antiviral chemoprophylaxis, school closures or other social distancing measures, and public health campaigns to improve hygiene. Most nations enhanced their influenza surveillance. If countries that expended greater effort into entry screening also had more effective containment and mitigation measures in the general population, these might have led us to overestimate the effect of entry screening. Conversely, if countries that expanded greater effort into entry screening also tended to have better influenza surveillance and were able to identify local transmission earlier, we may have underestimated the effect of entry screening.

Nonetheless, it also illustrates that general patterns of epidemiological behaviour can be associated with different evolutionary pathways. The scenarios presented here have widely different implications for public health, and each presents its unique problem in terms of containment. A pathogen following a punctuated route to adaptation is liable to emergence without any warning. Moreover, under this scenario, large outbreaks tend to be caused only by adapted pathogens, and so such outbreaks will be comparatively difficult to contain. By contrast, the gradual route offers some warning of adaptation in the form of large but self-limiting outbreaks. Both these clusters and the early stages of emergence are composed mainly of cases of a partially adapted pathogen, rendering containment comparatively easier. However, a danger is that repeated false alarms would elicit repeated containment efforts, potentially draining valuable resources. There are many possible refinements to the simple model of transmission presented here. One shortfall in the model is where large numbers of infection are predicted: in reality, large outbreaks will tend to be limited by local depletion of susceptibles, as well as being likely to trigger spontaneous social distancing and public health interventions. Host heterogeneity may also play a role. For example, Lloyd-Smith et al. (2005) point out in the context of a non-adapting pathogen that individual variation in transmissibility, hidden by a population-level value for R 0 , can have a strong effect on the outcomes of introductions, making extinction more likely than in a homogeneous population. Yates et al. (2006) explore different types of heterogeneity, including susceptibility to infection, and make the elegant distinction that, for nonadapted stages, the rate of adaptation has a stronger effect on probability of extinction than heterogeneity, and conversely for adapted stages. Extending this discussion to cluster sizes before emergence, these and other aspects of host population structure would be areas for refinement in models more detailed than those we have presented here. Nonetheless, the general insights offered by our approach are likely to remain valid. While mathematical models can be no replacement for detailed epidemiological investigations in the field, such as contact tracing and laboratory analysis, we hope we have shown here that they can offer valuable, objective insights into potential pre-emergence scenarios. Together with established frameworks for rapid case identification and management, mathematical models can play an important role in our toolkit for preparedness in public health.

Benefits and limitations appear to depend on the specific epidemic context. For example, influenza epidemics characterized by a larger attack rate in children compared to adults are expected to be more sensitive to the closure of schools [9] . This experience was reported in many countries during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, where closed schools coincided with a marked reduction of influenza activity [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . School closure interventions are often considered along with other mitigation strategies, as it happened with social distancing in Mexico following the pandemic outbreak [15, 23] , making their effect more difficult to isolate. Studies generally report a slowing down effect in the incidence during closure, however in some cases the effect may be mixed with the natural decline of the epidemic, because of late implementation [8] .

Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that the ICER remained to be above the acceptable threshold for all the assumed parameter space for H1N1-2009 (even when ICER took the minimum value). As for the length of closure, the ICER appeared to be a monotonically increasing function of the length of closure. For both the timing and length, the variations in the efficacy of closure and proportion of contacts compensated had only marginal impact on ICER. Figure 4 examines the ICER by varying two additional epidemiological variables, i.e., the basic reproduction number ( Figure 4A ) and the relative risk of death given infection ( Figure 4B ). The timing of epidemic peak varied with R 0 , and thus, the time for ICER to take the minimum value also greatly varied with R 0 . Greater R 0 yielded the minimum ICER value at earlier epidemic time. Nevertheless, again all the ICER values were above the acceptable threshold in Figure 4A . When the infection fatality risk was proportionally magnified, we found that the ICER fall below acceptable threshold. That is, when the risk of death was three times or greater than that of H1N1-2009, all scenarios that we examined appeared to be cost effective.

Some countries even instituted a ''containment phase'' using case-finding and various measures such as isolation and antiviral treatment of ill suspected and confirmed cases, and quarantine of exposed persons with or without antiviral chemoprophylaxis, while others never attempted or quickly moved from resource-intensive containment to mitigation [22] . A preliminary evaluation of intensive containment undertaken in parts of the UK during its spring/summer wave of 2009 demonstrates how resource-and labour-intensive community containment could have been and also how even with a lot of resources the measures had to be abandoned [23] .

These include socio-economic factors (eg, densely populated settings), and cultural factors (eg, family duty, funeral rituals). Participants in the African meeting agreed with the social distancing principles described in the 2007 WHO document, 20 including making the measures voluntary to the greatest extent possible; ensuring ""safe, habitable, and humane conditions of confinement including the provision of basic necessities (food, water, clothing, medical care, etc)""; and employment protection for workers who comply with social distancing measures against the wishes of their employers. Participants stressed that isolation and quarantine measures will be more difficult to enforce in rural compared to urban areas in Africa due to the isolated geography of some rural areas and the lack of healthcare workers and security officials. However, participants noted that these public health measures have been successfully employed in rural areas in prior epidemics in Africa. Densely populated urban slums were also noted to present a challenge to social distancing. In a typical slum dwelling, people occupy all available sleeping space at night in small and poorly ventilated homes. There is no separate space available for isolation or quarantine. The same applies in some refugee camps. In such densely populated settings, the lack of freedom of movement may lead to near-certainty of transmission. Neighboring communities will be tempted to protect themselves by fencing off the slums or forcibly preventing the exit of slum residents. There was also concern among the participants that some African countries would rely heavily on military personnel to impose order, potentially with unnecessary force. Participants in the Asian meeting also noted challenges associated with the use of social distancing measures. Duty to family is a major theme of Confucian philosophy. In some Asian countries, it is a tradition for friends and relatives to visit and even stay with a hospitalized person. In many instances, exhortations to family and friends about the serious nature of isolation are no match for the force of tradition: some find a way in and out of the isolation wards. Due to the lack of resources, isolation wards do not have security guards, and nursing staff are not able to add policing to their already heavy workload. A common concern reported by participants at the Asian meeting was the risk of stigmatization of patients and family members who were placed in isolation and quarantine. One of the participants reported that during the SARS outbreak, an entire village was stigmatized because it was home to one of the cases. Anybody known to have come from the village was avoided by others. Workers from the village were not admitted to their place of employment outside the village. Similarly, students were kept out of their schools. When the village was eventually quarantined, people feared delivering food and supplies. The stigma remained long after the epidemic subsided and the quarantine was lifted. High rates of poverty also pose a challenge for use of social distancing measures. It is difficult for patients to remain in isolation wards or for potentially exposed individuals to remain quarantined for long period of time unless compensation can be offered for lost wages. Participants at the Latin American and Eastern Mediterranean meetings reflected on the long history of human rights abuses in their countries. This made them more likely to view use of social distancing measures as something that should be considered with great caution. Some even viewed these measures as human rights violations.",32.834519607072316,13.879743850018416

The WHO Western Pacific Region Office provides updates on HFMD cases notified through local public health systems in Japan, Singapore, China, Vietnam, The Philippines and Thailand. 2 Outbreak control measures are targeted at interrupting virus transmission from person to person, as well as through contact with contaminated surfaces (such as toys) or fomites. Therefore health education messages focus on personal hygiene and good sanitation, including recommendations for frequent hand washing, proper disposal of soiled diapers and regular disinfection of soiled surfaces. The transmission of EVs is most efficient in crowded settings, and therefore during outbreaks most countries in the region have adopted social distancing measures, such as closures of childcare facilities and schools and cancellation of public functions involving children. Little systematic research has been done to assess the effectiveness of such measures, but one study from Singapore seemed to show some benefit. 19 However, the optimal timing for implementation of these measures is unclear-early, as soon as a HFMD is reported, or later following confirmation of EV71 as the causative agent. In addition, the effectiveness of distancing measures, which have substantial socioeconomic implications, is uncertain. If EV71 is like other directly transmissible viruses, such controls may decrease the peak incidence of disease during an outbreak/epidemic, and blunt the burden on the healthcare system, which can be of great value. However, it could thereby also prolong the outbreak and the total numbers would be similar. In addition, school closure could cause relocation to other geographical areas. 6 ",30.35224399790733,11.836033911893258

Indeed, early assessment of the relative contributions of local transmission versus case importation is essential for designing appropriate intervention strategies. For instance, a nosocomial outbreak may be driven by within-hospital transmissions or repeated introductions from the community, calling for different control measures [6, 7] . Similarly at a country level, local transmissions and importations of cases from other countries will require different control measures, e.g. social distancing and prevention versus border closing [8, 9] . In the case of zoonotic infections, it is also crucial to identify the extent to which within-species transmission and spill-over from the reservoir (i.e. cross-species transmission) contribute to the observed incidence, as illustrated in the case of avian influenza [10, 11] , bovine tuberculosis [12] , or MERS [3, 8, 9] .",24.225105787419867,10.451377808835364

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak to be a pandemic because of growing worldwide cases [3] . Currently, the severity of the outbreak is moderate as most people recover from infection without the need for medical care [4] . However, if the virus mutates and achieves the ability to cause severe illness, it will kill more people and overwhelm the health system. Vaccination is the most effective means of pandemic mitigation. Vaccine production is a complex multi-step process which involves development, manufacturing, and delivery processes and current levels of vaccine production capacity are inadequate. Thus many uncertainties exist in every step and effective vaccines are typically available well after the viral strain has emerged [5] [6] [7] [8] . For instance, vaccines against the H1N1 strain are still under development and will remain in short supply by November 2009 [9] . Current stockpiling of antiviral drugs will also be in short supply and their efficiency will be limited once a pandemic occurs [7, 8] .

First, influenza transmission is known to be concentrated within the household, and thus parameter estimates which ignore this heterogeneity are likely to be frail. Second, many public health policies for future pandemics are likely to be organised around the household. The net effect of social distance measures such as school and workplace closures and cancellation of social gatherings is effectively to reduce transmission out of households (and perhaps inadvertently to increase transmission within them). Furthermore, antiviral treatment and prophylaxis and quarantine measures are likely to be targeted at whole households rather than individuals (though restricting families with one suspect case to stay together without any other support is possibly undesirable) [16, 17, 20] . A number of studies have identified the parameters needed to estimate the household reproduction number for influenza [8, 10, 11, 17] . It is important to bear in mind that these parameters could be quite different in future pandemics, and thus that robust methodology may be more useful in responding to new outbreaks than numerical estimates obtained for past outbreaks. While it would be straightforward to use demographic data and exponential growth rates from earlier pandemics combined with interpandemic data on the transmissibility of influenza within households to obtain estimates of R * for historical pandemics, it has not been shown that the within household transmission parameters for inter-pandemic influenza adequately describe the pandemic situation, so I focus instead on providing illustrative examples using current demographic data (on the household size distribution from the UK) [34], and recent data on the transmissibility of influenza in modern households [10] .",25.274303943191473,10.849549697434977

Decisions regarding isolation, quarantine, vaccination and prophylaxis may often be made for entire households. Similarly school and workplace closures as well as restrictions on leisure activity can be thought of as trying to reduce between household transmission. Analytical approaches are also invaluable in calibrating and providing independent checks on more detailed individual based micro-simulations, such as [13, 17, 20] . Some control interventions require more subtle analyses; for example it has been shown that vaccinating whole households is not the most effective strategy for a given vaccine coverage rate, and that alternative strategies such as preferentially vaccinating larger households could be considered [39] .",21.633218023265385,10.590357914149507

Overall, these results suggest that success in containing an accidentally released potentially pandemic influenza virus by employing social distancing measures only is uncertain: containment probability for a virus with transmissibility comparable to many of the estimates for the 2009 H1N1 virus (namely R 0 or effective transmissibility in the range 1.2 to 1.6 [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] ) is reassuring, even though containment is not guaranteed. Should the transmissibility of the pathogen be comparable to that of the 1918 Spanish influenza (R 0 = 1.8 or higher [25] ), containment success would be seriously compromised. A further relevant finding is the strong impact of the BSL laboratory location. Rural areas have a fivefold increase in containment probability with respect to densely populated urban areas.

Zhong et al. [48] used survey (Public Risk Communication Survey, 2009) data to parametrize their BCM. Robinson et al. [14] surveyed sexual attitudes and lifestyle to build a sexual contact network. The IBM in Gray et al. [85] for syphilis transmission was also informed with survey data on sexual behaviour. Additionally, disease transmission parameters were calibrated from syphilis diagnosis among gay men in Victoria, Australia. A survey on altruism rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org J. R. Soc. Interface 13: 20160820 and self-interest was conducted by Shim et al. [23] to calibrate the behavioural change parameters regarding influenza vaccination. In Schumm et al. [127] , the BCM is represented by a dynamic social contact network with social distancing, constructed from a survey and census data. Cohen et al. [24] surveyed a convenience sample of students about their risk perceptions for influenza A/H1N1 to estimate the utility values of different behaviours. The study by Fierro & Liccardo [70] , used data on awareness and concern about the risk of contagion to populate their model on A/H1N1 influenza transmission with behavioural parameters. Moreover, they also validated their output through comparisons with Italian influenza surveillance data from 2009. The health belief model (HBM) [191] is frequently used to retrieve prevention behaviour and parametrize BCMs. The parameters in the HBM in Durham & Casman [3] were calibrated, using survey data on perceived severity and susceptibility during the 2003 SARS outbreak in Hong Kong. Karimi et al. also use the HBM for their ABM on influenza in 2015 [45] . For validation, the authors compare their model output with similar influenza ABMs in the literature. Another model tackling the influenza A/H1N1 pandemic in 2009 is the model by Bayham et al. [60] , who used data from the American timeuse survey and the National Health and Activity Patterns Survey (NHAPS). Moreover, Google Trends data are represented as a proxy for subjective risk perception and weather data are used to control for the effects of extreme weather phenomena. Xia et al. [25] constructed a social network using data of an online Facebook-like community to construct a BCM for disease and vaccine awareness on the 2009 influenza A/H1N1 pandemic in Hong Kong. The same pandemic has inspired Springborn et al. to use home television viewing as a proxy for social distancing [56] . Pawelek et al. [66] used Twitter data of self-reporting for awareness spread and ILI surveillance data (UK Health Protection Agency) of the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic for disease transmission. In addition, Collinson et al. [68] constructed a model on influenza A/H1N1, incorporating mass media report data from the Global Public Health Intelligence Network.",23.365140864142433,11.38294976364675

Again, we take influenza as an example where we discovered a multitude of prevention measures in our selection (also see table 1): vaccination, social distancing, pre-exposure prophylaxis by antivirals, hygiene measures and others. Interdependencies between these prevention strategies may occur. For instance, a person vaccinated for seasonal influenza may put less effort into hygienic measures such as hand-washing. However, individuals taking hygiene measures may also be more inclined to engage in social distancing if these individuals are more risk-averse. Researchers need to take into account that focusing health policy on one prevention measure may induce 'crowding out' of other prevention measures because of such interdependencies. Hence, it is useful to assess the total effect of combined prevention efforts when evaluating policies to reduce the incidence of a disease. Models introducing behavioural change with interdependencies between different prevention measures are influenced by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors.",25.802278501837044,11.14407861239414

Demographical data must improve its interfaces for access, retrieval, and translation into model parameters. Regarding the concern about credibility and validity of modeling assumptions, we found that the models often simplify reality to reduce computational burden. Such simplifications may be permissible if they do not interfere with the performance assessment of the mitigation strategies. We also agreed with the concern that social behavior is inadequately represented in pandemic influenza models. Our review showed that the models consider only a few social-behavioral aspects including contact rates, withdrawal from work or school due to symptoms appearance or to care for sick relatives, and compliance to social distancing, vaccination, and antiviral prophylaxis. The concern about the degree of accessibility of the models is palpable, since we found three models that are currently accessible by the public while other models are seeking public accessibility. Policymakers would prefer models scalable to any population size that can be downloadable and operable in personal computers. But scaling models to larger populations would often require computational needs that cannot be handled with personal computers and laptops. As a limitation, we state that some existing models could not be included in our review due to their limited available documentation discussing the choice of relevant parameter values. Conclusions: To adequately address the concerns of the policymakers, we need continuing model enhancements in critical areas including: updating of epidemiological data during a pandemic, smooth handling of large demographical databases, incorporation of a broader spectrum of social-behavioral aspects, updating information for contact patterns, adaptation of recent methodologies for collecting human mobility data, and improvement of computational efficiency and accessibility.",22.50267173642327,10.207814431469076

Assessing the costs and disruptions to the non-agricultural activities in the epidemiologically impacted region can be very important [4, 21] . Thompson et al. [13] estimates that the direct losses of tourism following the 2001 UK FMD outbreak were equal to the losses to the agricultural sector, excluding the producer compensation from the government. Furthermore, the indirect effects to tourism were more than 20 times larger when compared to the indirect effects to agriculture. The regional impacts in this study are estimated using an input-output model which is a system of equations that describe the flow of income and product throughout an economy. Specifically, the Bureau of Economic Analysis's Regional Input-Output Modeling System (RIMSII) is used because they provide a well-accepted and validated methodology to evaluate these impacts. Moreover, the input-output industrial multipliers provide the flexibility to define the states defined by the disease spread model. RIMSII integrates the input and output relationships of approximately 500 U.S. industries and regional economic accounts. The final-demand multipliers for output are used to estimate the indirect economic activity generated by a specific economic activity in a region. Thus, the intent of using the RIMSII data is to measure the effects of an FMD outbreak on the non-agricultural regional economy. Calculations are structured to remove duplication or double counting of losses. The indirect effects evaluated include: (1) the effect of culling and destroying animals on the non-agricultural regional economy (e.g., retail trade); (2) the economic implication of a travel ban that would limit recreational and non-essential travel in and out of a region; and (3) the indirect effects from the stimulus to the region created by the expenditures during government eradication and clean-up efforts. Travel bans, resulting in reduced tourism, are another important source of potential economic losses for the impacted region [35] .

The objective would then shift from containment to mitigation, requiring substantial risk communication effort to ensure that the public knows how to respond in case of a suspected infection. Countries may consider the implementation of social distancing measures such as cancellation of conferences, cultural or sport events or the recommendation of teleworking or school closures in order to slow transmission of the virus. Such measures may reduce the acute burden on healthcare systems and possibly delay and/or reduce the peak of an outbreak. In this phase, it may be essential to simplify case reporting and test for SARS-CoV-2 in specimens from syndromic primary healthcare and hospital-based influenza surveillance systems. Detections of SARS-CoV-2 via influenza surveillance would initially be an indicator of transmission in the community and over time would allow the spread, intensity and severity of the virus to be described.

The EU imposed a one year ban on the UK following its 2001 FMD outbreak. Rich and Winter-Nelson [7] analyzed the 2000-2001 FMD outbreaks in the southern cone of South America and concluded short lived impacts on exports to Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay. Randolph, Morrison, and Poulton [48] assumed a 12 month ban on exports during FMD outbreaks in Zimbabwe. Nogueira et al. [49] and Tozer et al. [50] apply 1 to 2 year trade bans for hypothetical FMD outbreaks in Mexico and Australia, respectively. Although the actual length of export restrictions will depend upon the actual product, disease, trade agreements, and countries involved, these observations provide valuable information on trade bans. Given the information above, trade shocks are created in the following manner. First, 95% of all U.S. exports of beef, pork, lamb meat, cattle, swine, and sheep are halted during the full quarter of the outbreak and for one quarter after the last case appears. This assumes some processed/cooked beef is still exported after the outbreak. The interruption of exports for one quarter beyond the end of the outbreak (and for two quarters beyond the end of the outbreak when emergency vaccination without slaughter is practiced) is consistent with World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) guidelines and practices (Chapter 8.5) during FMD outbreaks [51] . Second, after the additional quarter ended with no FMD reported, it is assumed that gradual recovery of U.S. exports will occur until it reaches the baseline levels. Full recovery is assumed to occur in approximately two years following one full quarter after the outbreak is eradicated.

At the outset, mass-gathering events provide challenging settings to plan a suitable emergency public health response. Published studies basically talk about retrospective reviews, case studies of the public health preparedness, or health care provided at individual events. Developing an understanding of the variables associated with MGs is the first step for public health managers. Risk assessment (RA) is a crucial part of pre-event planning as it helps foresee potential risks. Based on RA, one can develop preventive measures and ensure that the infrastructure to control the potential problems is in place. This study is an attempt to systemize RA process during MG events in a country that is culturally rich but with poor resources to handle such events. A RA tool will be developed for planning and management of religious MG events of India. Methods/design: Various strategies will be used to develop the risk assessment tool (RA tool). Extensive review of literature clubbed with key informant interviews will be done in order to identify the risk variables and decide the domains and items of the tool. Further, this tool will be developed as a mobile-based application. The feasibility of the mobile-based RA tool will be tested in real-time MG event in one part of the country. Concurrently in the same event, a community survey of residents and visitors will be done in order to assess public perceptions of public health and environmental risks associated with MG events.

There is increased risk of disease transmission because of huge influx of those attending the event. Overcrowding and overwhelmed medical services in such gatherings often aggravate the risk of infectious disease outbreaks [3] . Considerable challenges are posed by a mass gathering event (MG) in terms of communicable and noncommunicable disease surveillance, emergency preparedness, environmental health, vaccination, crowd management, and various other issues [4] . In spite of the fact that MGs are an undeniably regular activity of our society that are attended by huge crowds, such gatherings are not very well understood. Even though such gatherings are accumulations of ""well people,"" vast number of people associated with MGs can put a serious strain on the entire health care system [3] . Along these lines, such MG events are more perilous and hazardous in terms of higher incidence of injury and illness compared to population in general [5] . Preplanning for MG events is crucial, and identification of potential health risks can be a vital element in pre-event planning for a MG [6] . Broadly, it includes health management and major incident planning [7] . Public health managers need to plan for, and respond to, a wide range of incidents and emergencies that could affect health or patient care. These could be anything from extreme weather conditions to an outbreak of an infectious disease or a major transport accident related to the MG event [1] . It is important to note that planning for MG events offer a chance to enhance health service delivery, strengthen public health systems, and escalate health promotion activities [8] but failure to plan sufficiently can also disturb the routine health services as the existing system is not attuned to deal with such gatherings of people [9] . The aim of public health at MGs is to prevent or limit the risk of injury or ill health and boost safety for participants, spectators, and residents of host community. Scope of planning for MG is largely dependent on the type of event, risk assessments (RAs), and available resources. Unfortunately, effective preparedness to mitigate and control health risks are inadequate when it comes to planning and management of MG events, especially in countries with poor resources [1] . It is important to note that public health priorities are determined based on the assumptions laid down during initial stages of public health planning of MGs [10] . For instance, in the development of any surveillance system, utilizing syndromic surveillance during MGs requires making suitable inquiries of the data before the event. Those inquiries are a result of RA, a process which has to be performed before and during the event in order to determine what public health-related outcomes will potentially occur and whether these outcomes can be addressed through syndromic surveillance [11] . RA serves as an initial step in the process of planning [12] . RA for a MG is a process that determines the intent and implementation of risk reduction measures, response planning, and capacity building for health functions. RA for MGs is undertaken to empower the public health authorities to identify and evaluate the generic characteristics of a MG which introduce or escalate specific threats. It incorporates assessment of the potential public health effects of the MG [1] . Systematic assessment of risks also helps to identify the potential health security risks that require cooperation of other departments and government agencies [8] . Existing research in the field of MG health is dedicated to the development of rapid diagnostic methods, monitoring and response, and treatment and vaccines. Public health surveillance systems are less likely to include information on non-infectious health threats such as air quality, which can be extremely important for event organizers. This area poses particular challenges for traditional public health surveillance which is generally designed to detect when things happen. This is where RA comes into picture [13] . For example, the leading causes of morbidity and mortality during the Hajj are heat-related illnesses and trauma-related injuries. Identification of such risks had allowed event planners to instigate preventive measures and rapid response strategies. For instance, provision of shaded areas reduced the incidence of heat-related illnesses and effective crowd control reduced the risk of a stampede. Drug and alcohol use were identified as health risks for other types of MGs [14] ; therefore, restriction of their use mitigated the associated illnesses. In the context of limited resources, it has been suggested that one can choose to alleviate more likely events even if their potential impacts are smaller. Events that are catastrophic, but extremely unlikely, can then be given less priority [15] . During religious gatherings in India, some special events and unforeseen events occur at the places of religious MGs besides fixed places of worshipping. Special events like idol procession, chariot pulling, fire walking, and animal sacrificing happen pulling larger crowds within the MGs and causing more damage to human beings and property. History is in replete with incidences when MGs at fairs and festivals of India have turned into the hotspots of various types of risks [16] . Fire incidents have been reported to have occurred as a result of plastic sheets used as construction material for building cottages as temporary shelters for the pilgrims and also due to the use of liquid petroleum gas cylinders in the Kumbh mela premises and presence of unplanned and faulty electrical lines near lodging areas [17] . Previous studies [18, 19] have reported impaired water quality of Ganges River and consequential health risks by virtue of mass ritualistic bathing and insisted time and again that water of river Ganges was not fit for drinking or bathing purposes. A 10-year analysis of public health safety in 27 traditional MG events of India indicated around 936 dead and 540 injured casualties [20] .",19.25120255814017,8.929442939292464

The collection of high-quality clustered data for research may thus be a useful side effect of geographical containment. In this way, major nonpharmaceutical strategies (those of physical and hence social distancing or isolation) could enhance our capacity for pharmacological advances. Once the problem is recognized, and in the absence of epidemiological knowledge, the first defense is quarantine. This might seem pragmatically easy since patients who are very ill will be confined in intensive care.",23.79140485945672,8.764098258745326

Network and spatial spread in the early outbreak period (the first 14 days of this outbreak) is described in detail elsewhere [32] . To focus this analysis on the meteorological factors associated with local spread, we excluded any premises that may have been infected in the first 10 days of the outbreak, before the complete implementation of horse movement bans (i.e. any premises with an onset date in the first 14 days of the outbreak), setting the origin of the survival analysis at 30 August 2007.

The infrastructure includes staff instructions, processes and the development of systematic approaches related to personnel resources and medical support plans 43 . Various studies indicate that readiness for structured mass gatherings depends on investing in health infrastructures and the size of gatherings, and strengthening infrastructures and post-event coordination of mass gatherings must be continued. The inappropriate location of gatherings, the weakness of facilities and the lack of infrastructure increase the vulnerability of communities 44, 45 . The remoteness of health facilities and a lack of needed road infrastructure can make medical services and emergency assistance ineffective. Limitation of infrastructure and medical care system, increase the incidence of injuries 44, 45 . Arbaeen is held in a country that has long been involved with interior and exterior wars; therefore, it seems that due to economic difficulties, it does not have the capacity to support the necessary health infrastructure required by pilgrims. Although according to the participants, the health system in Iraq seems somewhat weak, given that Arbaeen ceremony is of particular popularity among Shia Muslims and is held annually, therefore, some of the activities serving pilgrims and its management during the Arbaeen ceremony is voluntarily conducted. In recent years, numerous health facilities have been constructed on religious places, as well as along the path of pilgrimage using pilgrims' donations.

Formal messages may not reduce social distancing behaviours until such time that preventive behaviours are widely adopted in the community. Social distancing seems more likely to occur when there is high influenza-related worry and uncertainty, such as in the initial stages when epidemic circumstances are unknown, or if an epidemic is severe and appears poorly controlled, as during early SARS. This would seem to be largely worry/affect-driven. If so, then social distancing is likely to occur irrespective of government messages as population anxiety about an epidemic increases.

If a disease is very highly infectious, social distancing may have no effect, or may require an unfeasibly high degree of caution in order to be effective. In these cases, doing nothing will be a more cost-effective strategy than using social distancing, because the worst-case outcome arises if the control is applied, but the level of caution used is too weak. The steep threshold separating the bestcase outcome from the worst-case in Figure 6b indicates that it is very important that the level of infectiousness of the disease is not underestimated. The similar, steep threshold in Figure 9 highlights the danger of having an overly relaxed attitude to risk when using the control. Hence the slogan in the title of this paper: if social distancing is being considered, do it well, or not at all. http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/12/679 We have also seen the importance of having a good match between the spatial area from which an individual draws information which will affect his/her behaviour, and the spatial area containing those other individuals who actually pose an infection risk. The control works best when these two areas are the same. If the individual has too little knowledge and can be infected by others who are outside of the awareness radius, the control does not work. If, on the other hand, the individual responds to infection cases which do not pose a realistic risk of infection (as might happen if, say, individuals in the UK change their behaviour in response to mass media reports of faraway epidemics in distant countries) the control is also inefficient.",30.95252430042906,12.526405514880508

Voerten and colleagues describe such a pattern of response in the early stages of SARS [25] . These models support the hypothesis that social distancing is more likely to occur when perceived health threat is high [25] . Logically, when others seem to be behaving in a way that is informed and probably consistent then their actions provide clear information. If mixed social messages occur signalling uncertainty then the utility of social information will fall. This is likely to be associated with increase perceived susceptibility, and possibly greater worry and distancing behaviour. This pattern of responses would be most likely early in a novel RID epidemic where disease characteristics and behaviour are often uncertain. High threat uncertainty then drives social avoidance of potentially high-risk others. High levels of worry are associated with greater social distancing. Around 50% of 997/14,297 (response rate 7%) British respondents agreed that social avoidance would minimize risk of A/H1N1 infection, and respondents reporting more anxiety were more likely to engage in preventive actions; severity and likelihood of infection were the most important determinants of preventive action [12] . Further research on social influences on HPB during epidemic and pandemic RIDs is warranted. Providing more knowledge about disease causes can improve hand hygiene but is unlikely to influence social avoidance, which appears less amenable to formal health messages. However, as formal messages achieve acceptance across the population, and uptake of HPBs increases, then under circumstances where a critical mass of the population are practicing precautions trust in informal information should increase, reducing susceptibility and worry and leading to declines in social avoidance. Because others are likely adopting HPBs this makes them less of a contagion risk. Conversely maintaining a high level of hand washing practices may require sustained public education activities. Finally, different segments of the population probably communicate different types of information with their peers.",34.63602608803155,11.634398564469164

Even at large mass gatherings involving out-of-town visitors such as the May 2009 convocation speech in Arizona (during which no respiratory disease outbreaks were detected) [37] , most participants likely stayed at hotels or at other low-density accommodations rather than in cabins or at campgrounds [5, 49] .

Results from a Systematic Literature Review and Analysis of the National Outbreak Reporting System,"To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to describe the frequency and characteristics of mass gathering-related respiratory disease outbreaks occurring in the United States. Mass gathering-related respiratory disease outbreaks appeared to be relatively rare during our 10-year project period, but were reported from agricultural fairs (zoonotic transmission) and summer camps where participants had close social contact in communal housing. Though legionellosis outbreaks were more common, none of these water-borne outbreaks was linked to a mass gathering in our analysis. The type and duration (multi-day events with communal housing) of mass gatherings could be important factors in mass gathering-related respiratory disease outbreaks. International participation may be a contributing factor for certain diseases. As anticipated, we identified several mass gathering-related pdm09H1N1 outbreaks involving school-aged children [41] . These persons are a high-risk age group for the novel 2009 influenza virus. Compared to other settings, influenza transmission among children and teenagers is more likely to occur within households, school classes, peer groups, and sports teams [42] [43] [44] -all of these social mixing opportunities are prominent at summer camps. Children and adolescents can easily have more than 20 close contacts with other children lasting 5 minutes of more during a typical school day [45] . Both the number and duration of close contacts could be higher in residential camps. This is supported by the outbreaks reported from Maine where the camp size and the number of campers per cabin were associated with influenza outbreaks [25] . Though respiratory disease transmission can occur at summer camps, influenza transmission during the summer (in the United States) outside a pandemic is uncommon; pdm09HIN1 was circulating since early spring and was involved a number of school-based outbreaks in states reporting camp-related influenza outbreaks in summer 2009. No respiratory illnesses were detected from a syndromic surveillance system implemented at a large school-aged summer camp in Virginia in 2005 [40] .",30.662996915982518,12.058050610176943

Travel restrictions reduced the illness rate only in the event of mild local disease transmission intensity. In some rural areas or island countries, the disease transmission intensities as well as the reproduction numbers remain at low levels due to limited human mobility and contacts. In addition, these areas may be infrequently visited by foreign travelers. Such areas may benefit significantly from travel suspension. In some studies [54, 55] , beneficial delays in epidemic establishment have been reported, as a result of blocking imported cases. Apart from travel restrictions, there are other public health measures such as regular hand washing, voluntary quarantine, and school closures to reduce the impact of influenza pandemic. Compared with travel restrictions, school closure is easier to implement in a community. Past influenza pandemics have shown a particular focus on disease transmission in children. School closures resulted in a positive effect proven to be effective in reducing the disease transmission during the H1N1pdm [28] . Nevertheless, while school closures and antivirals are good for transmission reduction, they may not be for buying more time in epidemic preparation. Closing schools for a long time would induce social and economical impacts, whereas closing schools for a short period of time may not be sufficient to show effects on community transmission [56] .

Moreover, proponents of dual-process health behavior models have suggested that analytic central and emotional-heuristic processes work in concert to select decisions [14] , and under certain circumstances emotions may even be the dominant force [41] . While the PMT used in this study does include an emotional component, it still represents a cognitive appraisal model in assuming that cognitive risk assessment determines experience of fear. Such a model is naturally applicable for the study of behaviors aimed at fending off long-term disease, where fear is likely to be less imminent and therefore secondary to more rational reflections about gains and losses related to protective behavior. However, in an acute threat situation, like a severe influenza outbreak, emotional aspects might gain more immediate importance. This would even be more likely during periods of scientific uncertainty, when fewer facts are available. It is in this context interesting to note that coping appraisal in this study was found to be the motivation factor that contributed most to the discriminatory performance despite the fact that threataffect was included in the general model, although indirectly through cognitive assessment. However, what role affect-or emotion-based judgments play in interaction with threat and coping appraisals is still an issue in need of clarification. Finally, it should be noted that there were relatively small differences between the reported intended behaviors associated to the mild and severe scenarios, respectively. One explanation of this observation can be the fact that the A(H1N1)pdm09 outbreak was relatively mild in Sweden, and that the respondents, wrongfully, related the severe scenario to their recent personal experience rather than the scenario description. However, the lack Table 6 . Simple and multiple logistic regression models of explanatory factors for the intention to wash hands after touching common objects displayed by influenza outbreak scenario. of difference can also be seen as a sign of its own, i.e. that the Swedish population may not be fully aware of the seriousness of a full influenza pandemic. Failure to monitor the beliefs and attitudes of the public has recently been identified as a weakness in preparedness strategies against infectious disease outbreaks [42] . We examined how items in a general explanatory model of intended health behavior were associated with personal hygiene and social distancing practices following a questioned mass vaccination campaign against influenza in the Swedish population. We observed a relatively high trust in official recommendations and a higher proportion of intentions to improve personal hygiene than those used to increase social distancing. Among the explanatory factors considered, coping appraisal was the factor most frequently included in models explaining self-reported intentions. Variations in threat appraisal played a smaller role in these models despite the uncertainties surrounding the mass vaccination during the A(H1N1)pdm09 outbreak. The results also show that not just from a third world perspective [43] it is necessary to consider that not all population sub groups have the same predispositions to enact specific behaviors to protect their health. For instance, they suggest that further studies are needed of gender differences in protective behaviors during influenza outbreaks. We conclude that developing interventions that support the general population's efforts to perform self-protective behaviors during influenza outbreaks and longitudinal studies of such interventions across several influenza seasons are warranted also in European countries.",22.440133715229223,8.436537012055462

By estimating the risk of MERS importations, one can comparatively understand the country-specific risk, and such understanding may help raise situation awareness among the general public, facilitating preventive action planning. In this context, a metapopulation epidemic model that uses the airline transportation network has been employed for predicting the global spread of various emerging infectious diseases, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the influenza pandemic H1N1-2009 and Ebola virus disease [12] [13] [14] . These transmission models have not only helped study epidemic scenarios but also estimated the effectiveness of specific countermeasures targeting travelers, e.g., entry and exit screenings and travel restrictions [15, 16] . While the metapopulation epidemic model is simple in its structure, epidemic forecasting by fitting the model to empirical data entails optimization procedures that are often computationally intensive. Moreover, while a few published studies have already investigated the risk of MERS associated with mass gatherings in Saudi Arabia [17, 18] , the distribution of secondary cases per single primary case is highly over-dispersed [4, 11] with the overall R 0 falling below 1. Hence, the metapopulation type models that have been used to evaluate epidemics of communicable diseases (e.g., R 0 > 1) may not be directly and immediately applied to model the global spread of MERS.",24.85620965753475,11.455918242216784

The Zika virus outbreak, spread by daytime-active Aedes mosquitoes, is estimated to have cost equator-belt local economies in affected areas between USD $7 and USD $18 billion [28] .

In regard to the current epidemic of Coronavirus, though it is too early to quantify or project its impacts on the global economy, there are fears that it may take the precedent of other outbreaks where billions of dollars will be lost. The foundations for this escalating loss can be witnessed in the rapid growth of travel bans being enacted by some countries and their international airports, especially specifically restricting people from visiting the affected regions in China and their growth into general non-Chinese travel movements. On this, noting that the outbreak came almost on the eve of the Lunar New Year celebrations, and that it had been estimated that over 400 million people were expected to travel in different parts of the world and China to observe this festivity, the majority have had to reconsider their options as to flights, hotels and entertainment events due to service provider cancellations [30] .

Figure 4 examines the effect of isolation of cases and social distancing measures (see figure caption for details) in the absence of antiviral treatment. The peak of the epidemic is protracted by about 1 day for every percent of contact reduction if this intervention starts immediately after the introduction of the infection. Thus, a peak shift is not only possible by early action, but also by the degree of contact reduction. If contact reduction is initiated later, the peak shift diminishes, but the proportionality remains. For example, if the intervention starts three weeks after the introduction of infection, the peak of the epidemic is only mitigated by about half a day per 1% contact reduction ( Figure 4B ). Premature cessation of contact reduction measures restores the infection rates to the pre-intervention values which fuels the epidemic.

Enplanement is mostly made up of domestic flights. International air travel is represented by passports for the controls in the cohort and in the cases; the travel history is indicative. Given our rationale for using enplanement as an indicator for domestic travel in the controls and a negative history of travel through case interviews, high enplanement captures international air travelers as well as domestic travel. Low enplanement areas represent mostly regional and domestic flights. A likely scenario is that the students, families, and friends the traveler visits in the countries shown in Figure 1 suggest a traveler who has come to an area with high enplanement such as a major metropolitan area for business or education. One could hypothesize a younger adult, a risk taker traveling around the world and perhaps being in areas where mosquitoes could prevail. The longer potential incubation time for malaria of well over a month would suggest that a percentage of persons traveling from endemic areas are going to come down with malaria. Why would international travel be protective for HA and influenza? The vaccine preventable disease of influenza would be a requirement for entry into the United States.

No intervention is without some economic or social cost. If individuals are isolated or quarantined, and there is no support system in place to provide essentials such as groceries and prescriptions, or services such as child care for ill parents of small children, there can be social disruption in addition to extended health effects. Economic protection measures may need to be considered to allow those who are ill to work from home or at least to have some assurance taking sick days will not result in job loss. A variety of consequences must also be considered when closing schools and day care centers or when discouraging public gatherings. Children are at increased risk of influenza transmission in both preschool contacts and school-age contacts. Viboud et al. (2004) found there was also an increased risk in contacts exposed to preschool index patients and school-age index patients compared with those exposed to adult index cases. However, there are substantial economic and social outcomes to school-related measures. If children are not in school or day care, some parents will be unable to work. Parents are also likely to congregate children who have been kept out of school in order to have child care and to provide a diversion for the children, thereby negating the desired social distancing. If mass transit and congregate gatherings are discouraged, a variety of industries will suffer. Social distancing interventions may be important to public health but must be used judiciously. If the impact is seen as too severe, the political and social consequences may be too burdensome and the public may not comply.

Such uncertainty of contracting a highly contagious disease actually deteriorated the fear of security breaches, and the panic of overexposure (Tan 2006) . Responding to the uncertainty of disease transmission, the Singapore government instituted many draconian public policies, such as social distancing, quarantine and isolation, as risk mitigating measures. All of these control measures created an instinctive withdrawal from society for the general population. This brought about a behavior which resulted in the public avoiding crowds and public places with human interaction. On 24 March 2003, the MOH invoked the Infectious Disease Act (IDA) to isolate all those who had been exposed to SARS patients. After IDA was invoked, on 25 March 2003, schools and non-essential public places were closed. Public events were cancelled to prevent close contact in crowds. Singaporeans with contact history were asked to stay home for a period of time to prevent transmission. Harsh penalties, such as hefty fines of more than USD4,000 or imprisonment, were imposed on those who defied quarantine orders. In a drastic move reminiscent of a police state, closedcircuit cameras were installed in the houses of those ordered to stay home to monitor their compliance with the quarantine order (ABC News Online 2003). At the height of SARS, 12,194 suspected cases were ordered to stay home, all of whom were monitored either by cameras or in less severe cases, by telephone calls. Quarantine, regardless of its effectiveness, received strong criticism from the general public during the outbreak of SARS due to the invasive nature of that measure (Duncanson 2003) . Impact of social distancing remains unclear, but WHO has recommended such control measures depending on the severity of the epidemic, risk groups affected and epidemiology of transmission (World Health Organization 2005). Singapore's MOH advocated the practice of social distancing during the outbreak of SARS. The sole intention of social distancing was to limit physical interactions and close contact in public areas to slow the rate of disease transmission. Additionally, social distancing measures in particular have a psychological impact. The practice of social distancing led to a social setback in businesses that suffered economic losses as a result (Duncanson 2003) .",34.24611969123556,15.224430497145612

The economic fall-out from COVID-19 appears to be profound, at least $20 trillion in a few short weeks, and may exceed the 2008-2009 Great Recession. The direct costs of COVID-19 travel bans, social distancing, and other responses are merely one aspect. Far more devastating is the uncertainty that has gripped capital markets. Declining economic activity and large drops in capital markets have a mutually reinforcing impact, undermining the capacity of heavily indebted businesses and households to cover their debts. Uncertainty is the primary driver of such crises, and stems in large measure from lack of close coordination and science-based decision-making. Were there more certainty, households, investors and other economic agents would be less inclined to panic. COVID-19 appears certain to become a very costly lesson that DRR does indeed save many more multiples in avoided costs than its initial investment. An additional point in this regard is that health is a critical infrastructure. The resilience of critical infrastructure is well identified in DRR literature (e.g. [18, 19] ). Resilience is fostered not just by sciencebased decisions and coordination, but also via redundancy to ensure buffer capacity when a particular system collapses [20] . Disaster-illiterate economic policy tends to see redundancy as inefficiency.

Infectious disease outbreaks may trigger various behavioral responses of individuals to take preventive measures, one of which is social distancing. Valdez and coworkers have investigated the efficiency of social distancing in altering the epidemic dynamics and affecting the disease transmission process on ER network, SF networks, as well as realistic social networks [83] . In their model, rather than the normally used link-rewiring process, an intermittent social distancing strategy is adopted to disturb the epidemic spreading process. Particularly, based on local information, a susceptible individual is allowed to interrupt the contact with an infected individual with a probability σ and restore it after a fixed time t b , such that the underlying interaction network of the individuals remains unchanged. Using the framework of percolation theory, the authors found that there exists a cutoff threshold σ c , whose value depends on the network topology (i.e., the extent of heterogeneity of the degree distribution), beyond which the epidemic phase disappears. The efficiency of the intermittent social distancing strategy in stopping the spread of diseases is owing to the emergent ""susceptible herd behavior"" among the population that protects a large fraction of susceptible individuals.",38.05724745916988,14.167276081191329

Also, the basic reproductive number of a disease must exceed a certain threshold for individuals to feel self-protective behavior is worth the effort [58] .

Human behavior such as contact precautions and social distancing clearly influence disease prevalence, but disease prevalence can in turn alter human behavior, forming a coupled, nonlinear system. Moreover, in many cases, the spatial structure of the population cannot be ignored, such that social and behavioral processes and/or transmission of infection must be represented with complex networks. Research on studying coupled disease-behavior dynamics in complex networks in particular is growing rapidly, and frequently makes use of analysis methods and concepts from statistical physics. Here, we review some of the growing literature in this area. We contrast network-based approaches to homogeneous-mixing approaches, point out how their predictions differ, and describe the rich and often surprising behavior of disease-behavior dynamics on complex networks, and compare them to processes in statistical physics. We discuss how these models can capture the dynamics that characterize many real-world scenarios, thereby suggesting ways that policy makers can better design effective prevention strategies. We also describe the growing sources of digital data that are facilitating research in this area.

It is notable that a quarter of the initially reported 27 pneumonia cases presented with severe disease. 45 Within days, the cause of the pneumonia was identified as a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 2 On January 19, 2020 the WHO issued a warning that the virus may have the ability to spread from human to human. 3 Wuhan is a major transportation hub within China with a population of 11 million. On a typical day, approximately 3500 people take flights to other countries from Wuhan, and the number increases with holidays and the Chinese Lunar New Year. Within 1 month, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases rose to more than 9000, surpassing the number of SARS and MERS cases reported to date. Similarly, global fears escalated as cases spread to other countries. Extensive control measures were put into place, starting with massive decontamination efforts and, ultimately, closure of the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, banning the trade of wildlife and poultry in wet markets, contact tracing of cases, exit screening at airports, lockdown and quarantine measures that progressed to include adjacent cities (an estimated 50e60 million people affected), school closures, extension of the Lunar New Year holiday, prohibition of mass gatherings, and building of two new hospitals (1000 and 1600 beds) to care for infected individuals. Other nations instituted airport screening, travel bans, and evacuating citizens from Hubei Province and quarantining them through the incubation period. 6 Despite these measures, the case counts continued to increase in the outbreak epicenter, and countries with imported cases reported clusters of human-to-human transmission.

Influenza spreads through person-to-person contact via airborne particles as well as by direct and indirect (e.g., via fomites) contacts. Several studies have shown that facemasks can be an effective mitigation strategy. A recent study on facemasks and hand hygiene showed a 10 -50% transmission reduction for influenza-like illnesses (Aiello et al., 2010) . Other studies have also shown that facemasks can not only act as a barrier (Del Valle et al., 2010) but they can redirect and decelerate exhaled air flows to prevent them from entering the breathing zones of others (Tang and Settles, 2009) . Several laboratory studies on mask effectiveness have shown that N95 respirators are 21.5% effective in protecting against the inhalation of nanoparticles, while surgical masks were only 2.4% effective (an Lee et al., 2008) . However, a study by Loeb et al. (Loeb et al., 2009) found that surgical masks and N95 respirators offered about the same percentage of protection for nurses in hospitals. Although several studies have shown that both surgical masks and N95 provide similar protection against influenza, a recent editorial by Killingley (Killingley, 2011) discusses two studies and argues that the results are still inconclusive and that more research is needed. For our model we will focus on N95 respirators since we are interested in analyzing optimal interventions, however, our analyses may be applicable to surgical masks based on Loeb et al. (Loeb et al., 2009 ) results. Using a mathematical model, Tracht et al. (Tracht et al., 2010) analyzed the effectiveness of facemasks in reducing the spread of pandemic (H1N1) 2009. They compared the impact that surgical and N95 masks could have on reducing the spread of influenza. Their results showed that facemasks can be an effective intervention strategy for mitigating an airborne disease.

heuristic-systematic processing and self-efficacy will moderate the effect of social media on risk perceptions of MERS,0.24416122029352288,2.336700201034546,1.7449558973312378,e23af3b5-a21d-44da-b0e3-32d0eef870e3,custom_license/The impact of social media on risk perceptions during the MERS outbreak in South Korea,"In addition to the main effects that social media, the heuristicsystematic processing, and self-efficacy have on risk perceptions of MERS, this study also posits that heuristic-systematic processing and self-efficacy will moderate the effect of social media on risk perceptions of MERS. In recent years, some studies have suggested that the impact of media use, including social media, on people's cognitions, attitudes or behavior can depend on their individual differences, such as information processing ability or personality traits (e.g., Kim, Hsu, & Gil de Zúñiga, 2013; Lee & Oh, 2013; Yoo & Gil de Zúñiga, 2014) . Especially, because social media are designed to customize individual's interests or needs based on users' active behaviors, such as constructing his/her profile, building online networks, or selecting news information (Boyd & Ellison, 2008; Glynn, Huge, & Hoffman, 2012; Lin & Lu, 2011) , individual's differences could play an important role in considering the impact of social media. Specifically, people tend to seek and acquire varying gratifications when they use media, such as social media (Hyun & Kim, 2015; Kim et al., 2013) . Moreover, individuals often perceive risks depending on their psychological or cognitive characteristics (Sj€ oberg, 2000; Slovic, 1987) , such as information processing mode (e.g., Trumbo, 2002) or self-efficacy (e.g., Coleman, 1993) . Thus, people may utilize social media satisfying their personal needs from their psychological or cognitive differences to formulate risk perceptions (Smock, Ellison, Lampe, & Wohn, 2011) , that which would lead to various levels of risk perceptions toward a given health issue. For example, one's information processing mode has been found to moderate the effects of media on his or her risk perceptions (Ho et al., 2013) . Since heuristic-systematic processing motivates individuals to process information to reach their risk judgements (Eagly & Chaiken, 1993) , it is likely that this information processing moderates the relationship between social media and risk perception. That is, heuristic-systematic processing of MERS may help people process MERS-relevant information from social media, which could differently perceive the risk of the infectious disease. Moreover, because self-efficacy indicates the differences in individual abilities to respond or manage situations (Bandura, 1990 ), it has found that self-efficacy moderates the impact of media on one's cognition or behavior (e.g., Lee, Kwak, Campbell, & Ling, 2014) , suggesting that the potential to moderate the association between social media and risk perceptions. That is, in an uncertain situation, such as the MERS outbreak, as individuals hold different levels of self-efficacy, and when they rely on social media for information regarding MERS to form a risk judgement, the interaction between self-efficacy and social media would lead to different levels of risk perception of the infectious disease. From this perspective, we examine how heuristicsystematic processing and self-efficacy interact with social media regarding people's risk perceptions.",17.65461266507889,8.832190896715371

In these provinces, the mean serial interval was 5·1 days (95% CI 1·3-11·6). This estimate is considerably shorter than a previous estimate (7·5 days) derived from an analysis of six observations of the serial interval in Wuhan. 5 Given that the basic reproduction number is positively associated with the growth rate of the epidemic and the length of the serial interval, 8 the shorter mean serial interval estimated here implies that transmissibility might not be as high as initial estimates suggest. We cannot rule out, however, that the serial interval might differ between Wuhan and other Chinese provinces. The short estimate of the serial interval that we obtained might be linked to the short estimate for the interval from symptom onset to hospital admission (with a mean of about 2·6 days since Jan 28) for mainland China outside Hubei. A longer admission delay was reported in Wuhan in the early phase of the outbreak, 5 which could drive longer serial intervals. It should be stressed also that serial interval estimates based on household clusters might be up to 20% shorter than the true value, as suggested by a theoretical study. 10 We estimated that the serial interval was about as long as the incubation period, which is in overall agreement with an independent previous estimate. 5 This finding suggests the possibility of an early peak of infectiousness, with possible transmission of SARS-CoV-2 before the onset of symptoms. If confirmed, the presence of relevant presymptomatic transmission might hamper control efforts, including contact tracing and timely isolation of index cases, as well as passenger screening at airports. By contrast, strategies based on social distancing, such as limiting mass gatherings and contact in the workplace and in schools, might still be effective. 15, 24, 25 Evidence is accumulating to indicate the possibility of transmission during the incubation phase. [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] It is worth noting also that our estimates of the incubation period and serial interval were based on analysis of cluster data, for which we assumed that the risk of infection from the community was negligible compared with that from infected individuals in the cluster.

The potential benefits from school closures need to be weighed against costs of health-care worker absenteeism associated with additional child-care obligations. In this study, we aimed to measure child-care obligations for US health-care workers arising from school closures when these are used as a social distancing measure. We then assessed how important the contribution of health-care workers would have to be in reducing mortality for their absenteeism due to child-care obligations to undo the benefits of school closures in reducing the number of cases.",55.91637687724903,21.09088093831863

Nevertheless, during the 2018 Winter Olympic Games in PyeongChang, Korea, an outbreak of respiratory tract infections affecting 45% of athletes and 31% of staff members of the Finish team was reported [8] . It was mostly due to coronaviruses (229E, NL63 and OC43), influenza B and other viruses [8] . The paucity of reports of respiratory tract infection outbreaks among public attendance at the Olympics is likely the result from relatively short duration of sport events which frequently last less than one day, with many attendees moving to other locations at the end of the event and not living on site. Furthermore, social distancing between attendees is likely to be much easy to perform in stadiums than at the Hajj where the density of population in the Great Mosque may be extreme. At the Olympics, it is expected that there will be 20 million visitors of 204 countries and regions at the Olympics and 164 at the Paralympics and this will increase the chance of the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 [9] . Furthermore, asymptomatic persons carrying MERS coronavirus or SARS-CoV-2 have been demonstrated to be a potential source of contamination to the population [10, 11] .

We focused on the midpoint of this estimate, 0·15, but considered cumulative case reductions from school closures to be between 0% and 50%.

This estimate can be combined with projections of the case reductions from school closures to identify the condition where the estimate of is important to inform whether school closures would reduce net mortality.

This is the case when school closures lead to many avoided cases and few health-care workforce effects.

This is the case if school closures reduce the labour force substantially while providing a relatively small reduction in cumulative cases.

These closures prevent contact among children and reduce cases. However, closing schools has down sides, even if the only goal of the measure is to save lives during an epidemic.

On the one hand, our estimates of the proportion of health-care workers with child-care obligations might be optimistic because non-working adults might not be able to provide care or might require care themselves. On the other hand, it is possible that family members outside the household (eg, grandparents), neighbours, or friends could care for children, though no data are available in the CPS on these possibilities.

The marginal impact was measured separately by the change in the total pandemic cost and the number of mortalities (averaged over multiple replicates), resulting from a unit change in the total budget availability or a factor value, one at a time. Factors under consideration included: (a) antiviral efficacy, (b) vaccine efficacy, (c) social distancing conformance, (d) social distancing declaration threshold, and (e) social distancing period. We also investigated the affect of varying the social distancing conformance on the dynamics of the societal and economic costs. Figure 8a and b shows the dynamics of the pandemic impact, measured as the average number of fatalities and total cost, for different levels of the total budget availability relative to the total budget requirement (see Appendix Table 13 ). As expected, the curves for the average number of deaths and total cost exhibit a downward trend, for both transmissibility scenarios, as the total budget availability increases. An increased budget translates into higher availabilities of mitigation resources, which will mediate regional pandemic impact and reduce the probability of spread to unaffected regions. As also expected, a higher virus transmissibility generates more infections which, in turn, result into more fatalities and, subsequently, bigger societal and economic costs. As the budget availability approaches the budget requirement (starting from approximately 60%), both impact curves show a converging behavior, for both scenarios, whereby the marginal impact of additional resource availability decreases. This can be explained by noting that the total budget requirement was calculated assuming the worst case scenario where all regions are affected and provided with adequate resources to cover their respective populations at risk. Figure 9a and b shows the behavior of the two impact measures for the level of the antiviral efficacy (τ in Eq. 3) between 10 and 20, and a fixed level of the total budget availability (50% of the total requirement).",32.067302597667165,13.538352428462986

The infected population is then treated with an antiviral therapy to reduce infectiousness, and the susceptible is vaccinated to increase their immunity. For example, Wu et al.

Vaccination has been one of the main areas of application for pharmacoeconomic models that incorporate models of infectious disease transmission. Such transmission models are needed in order to capture the inherent nonlinear effects of vaccination, as a result of the potential of vaccines to protect not only directly vaccinated individuals but also their contacts. The infectious disease models used to predict the effects of vaccination have been reviewed elsewhere. [20] Screening. Screening for infected individuals allows them to be treated before they progress to more severe disease and/or infect other individuals. Models need to incorporate transmission if early detection affects transmissibility. This has been shown to be important for many infectious diseases such as Chlamydia [8] and HIV. [21] Such models may allow for the possibility that a screened and treated individual may be re-infected, which would decrease the cost effectiveness of screening. Social distancing. Planned responses to large outbreaks of infectious diseases such as an influenza pandemic often involve social distancing measures such as isolation of suspected cases, school closures, travel restrictions and cancellation of mass gatherings such as football matches. [22, 23] While these may affect the progress of the epidemic, they come with a cost in terms of both individual liberty and economic activity within the population. Their benefit depends crucially on the frequency and type of interactions that occur between individuals in different age groups and settings (such as families, work places and schools). Such information can be obtained from populationbased surveys that are available in Europe [24] and the US. [25] On a smaller level, models can estimate the impact of isolating infectious individuals during outbreaks in closed institutional settings such as hospitals, nursing homes and schools. [26, 27] Post-exposure treatment. Chemotreatment options such as antimicrobials can be dealt with using static models, unless they alter the transmissibility of an individual, or a transmittable characteristic of the infection. Models falling into the latter categories include the use of antiretrovirals for HIV (which increases the life expectancy of infected individuals but decreases their infectiousness), [28] antimicrobial use against pathogens that can develop resistance [29] and antiviral prophylaxis to delay the spread of pandemic influenza. [30] Culling. For animal and plant diseases, one option to interrupt transmission is to deplete the host population by culling both infected livestock and even healthy livestock at risk of being infected. Models examine the trade-off between reduced infection transmission and the detrimental death of animals or plants as a result of culling. Such models have been applied to epidemics of diseases such as foot-andmouth disease [31] and avian influenza. [32] 3. Modelling Infection Transmission",36.953049495135886,14.630879773706495

These advances in realtime surveillance have improved public health security for the mass gatherings at the Hajj. 69 See Online for appendix",20.705828319569427,9.505978140933314

Infectious diseases are of particular concern at MGs. The aim of this review was to summarize findings in the field of infectious diseases with a variety of pathogens associated with international MGs in the last 5 years. Recent Findings In the context of Hajj, one of the largest religious MGs at Mecca, Saudi Arabia, respiratory tract infections are the leading cause of infectious diseases in pilgrims with a prevalence of 50-93%. The most commonly acquired respiratory viruses were human rhinovirus, followed by human coronaviruses and influenza A virus, in decreasing order. Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were the predominant bacteria. The prevalence of Hajjrelated diarrhea ranged from 1.1 to 23.3% and etiologies included Salmonella spp., and Escherichia coli, with evidence of acquisition of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. In other MGs such as Muslim, Christian, and Hindu religious events, sports events, and large-scale open-air festivals, outbreaks have been reported less frequently. The most common outbreaks at these events involved diseases preventable by vaccination, notably measles and influenza. Gastrointestinal infections caused by a variety of pathogens were also recorded. Summary Because social distancing and contact avoidance are difficult measures to implement in the context of many MGs, individual preventive measures including vaccination, use of face mask, disposable handkerchief and hand hygiene may be recommended. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of these measures has been poorly investigated in the context of MGs.",22.28804608808967,9.17737423498883

Novel data approaches such as high-resolution satellite imagery of disease-affected populations can provide a representation of how population behavior varies over time and can be used to assess response to specific intervention strategies such as social distancing. For example, high-resolution satellite imagery of hospital parking lots in Chile, Argentina, and Mexico were shown to be predictive of influenza activity at the national level (Butler et al., 2014) . Further studies using targeted surveillance approaches can be useful in assessing changes in health-seeking behavior especially during major influenza outbreaks.",21.9517981471812,9.123663764374289

The risk of infectious disease transmission during a mass gathering is the same or even more as the risk of transmission that prevails in any one of the home or host countries of mass gathering participants. During the world health Assembly 67, a side event took place to launch the lancet series on Mass Gathering Medicine in May 21, 2014 ( Figure 1 ). Mass-gatherings are held for various purposes including religious rituals, sports activities, or festivals and therefore the demographics, risks, and the intensity of activities vary. Further, the risks are exacerbated during mass gatherings such as the Hajj for airborne, droplet, and body fluid-related transmission due to the absence of social distancing among participants; increased susceptibility due to stress, lack of sleep, and changing nutritional factors during peak events; disruption of medications among persons with chronic debilitating diseases; and participation in some of the rituals such as animal sacrifices or the practice of scalp hair shaving practices by self-help groups using unsterile blades rather than in regulated barber shops. Given that two-thirds of the emerging diseases are zoonotic, human-animal interaction during some mass gatherings such as the Hajj further increases the risk, and Saudi Arabia imports sacrifice animals from 6 countries. Thus, except for vaccine preventable diseases, perfection of disease control strategies in one or few countries alone including in the host country may not offer blanket protection from all types of disease transmission dynamics for epidemic prone disease agents present in any one of the countries. The impact of these challenges on public health during mass gatherings can be minimized by two strategies. First, each of the countries that participate in a mass gathering should have alert systems in place to identify diseases of transmission-potential during a mass gathering, control measures in place to avoid the exportation of such risks, and reduce the participation of individuals at risk increased risk for disease acquisition. For GHSA 1 , this relates to adequate syndromic-and agent-based surveillance, laboratory enhancements, and reporting systems and risk communication managed by adequately trained workforce including one epidemiologist for a population of 200,000. Furthermore, countries participating in mass gatherings should have public emergency preparedness in response mode and adequate surge capacity to be able to respond to potential emergencies from participants returning from mass gatherings. Existence of a public health emergency operations center with sufficient pool of response manpower and medical countermeasures available will be critical. This can only be functional if relevant a national public health preparedness policies and authorities are in place to coordinate a response with diverse organizational entities such as the ministries of aviation, defense, interior, and health.",46.96218475083903,18.12431538336613

This work seeks to determine the extent to which the effects of behavior changes and metapopulation coupling on epidemic size can be characterized. While mathematical models have been developed to study local containment by social distancing, intervention and other behavior changes, their connection to larger-scale transmission is relatively underdeveloped. We make use of the assumption that behavior changes limit local transmission before susceptible depletion to develop a time-varying birth-death process capturing the dynamic decrease of the transmission rate associated with behavior changes. We derive an expression for the mean outbreak size of this model and show that the distribution of outbreak sizes is approximately geometric. This allows a probabilistic extension whereby infected individuals may initiate new outbreaks. From this model we characterize the overall epidemic size as a function of the behavior change rate and the probability that an infected individual starts a new outbreak. We find good agreement between the analytical results and stochastic simulations leading to novel findings including critical learning rates that demarcate large and small epidemic sizes.",21.154577166396262,10.842029051676649

For instance, spread among counties in Liberia seems to be consistent with this picture (Fig. 1 ). Here we see that the epidemic was maintained by a series of outbreaks, each of which recapitulates a common pattern of explosive transmission, followed by a decline in the rate of transmission and eventual containment. Because the transmission process in each county occurs almost independently of the other counties (coupling is primarily important for the initial spark and possibly subsequent reinfections), a single compartmental model cannot accurately represent the associated dynamics. Instead, what is required is a model of coupled epidemics. In the following sections we develop a simple, conceptual model of this process. We imagine an epidemic starting with an outbreak originating at a single location. In contrast to most models, we assume that this outbreak is quickly contained by reductions in transmission. The stochastic nature of transmission when only a small number of persons are infected gives rise to a probability distribution in the outbreak size. Although the outbreak is quickly contained, there is a small chance that the infection is spread to an adjacent population before complete containment is achieved. If this occurs, then the process is repeated until finally no further outbreaks occur. It is this outbreak-of-outbreaks that we call an epidemic. To model this two-scale process, we first propose a simple model for the stochastic dynamics of an outbreak subject to behavior change, for which we obtain the mean outbreak size, denoted M. M is Organization declared the Ebola epidemic to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern one week later. Here, the cumulative number of cases in each administrative unit is plotted against epidemiological week. These nearly parallel epidemic curves suggest that the same process of outbreak and control was replicated in one county after the next with local interventions and behavior change realized some finite time after cases began accumulating. For instance, approximately the same take-off rate was exhibited by Montserrado as by Grand Cape Mount, despite the fact that their first cases were separated by twelve weeks. Data from the World Health Organization situation reports important for three reasons. First, it enables calculation of the chance that a secondary outbreak is caused, which may be iterated until no further outbreaks result. Guided by numerical experiments, we propose to approximate the probability distribution of the number of outbreaks by a geometric distribution. The second role played by the mean outbreak size is to parameterize the geometric distribution of outbreak number. Finally, by summing a random number of outbreaks with the mean size M, we obtain an approximation for the epidemic size, i.e., the size of all outbreaks added together. The accuracy of this approximation is studied through comparison with simulations. Models that explicitly take account of within and between household transmission have yielded important understanding of the role of host social structure on epidemic development. Part of their success lies in the relatively simple task of enumerating all possible infection statuses of individuals in small households and of assuming a constant hazard of transmission to uninfected cohabitors [2] . In contrast, when attempting to describe connections between local outbreaks (involving population sizes much bigger than households) and larger-scale epidemics against the backdrop of reduced transmission over time, tracking the local outbreak sizes can be challenging. Previous modeling studies of behavior change to limit transmission have generally assumed that transmission dynamics may additionally be slowed by susceptible depletion, e.g., [3, 5, 15] . By instead assuming that behavior changes act before susceptible depletion, birth-death branching process techniques can be utilized. As well as lending analytical tractability, these models likely capture the rapid social distancing and learned risk-averse behavior associated with deadly diseases such as Ebola. In the recent West African outbreak, outbreak sizes were considerably smaller than population sizes (Fig. 1 ).",17.933201902451252,8.065113494465496

For example, during the 1918-19 influenza pandemic, the New York City Department of Health enforced several social distancing policies at the same time, including staggered business hours, compulsory isolation, and quarantine, which likely led to New York City suffering the lowest death rate from influenza on the eastern seaboard of the USA. 17 During the current outbreak of COVID19, government officials and researchers were concerned that the mass movement of people at the end of the Lunar New Year holiday on Jan 31, 2020, would exacerbate the spread of COVID19 across China. Moreover, individuals typically return from their Lunar New Year holiday after only 1 week, which is shorter than the longest suspected incubation period of the disease. 18 Many of the 5 million people who left Wuhan before the travel ban was put into place 3 could still have been latently infected when their holiday ended.

Second, governments should tailor the design of such outbreakcontrol closure periods to the specific epidemic characteristics of the novel disease, such as the incubation period and transmission routes. Third, a central goal of an outbreakcontrol closure period is to prevent people with asymptomatic infections from spreading the disease. As such, governments should use the closure period for information and education campaigns, community screening, active contact tracing, and isolation and quarantine to maximise impact. Such a combination approach is also supported by studies of responses to previous outbreaks, which showed that reductions in the cumulative attack rate were more pronounced when social distancing policies were combined with other epidemic control measures to block transmission. 23 As for COVID19 in China, this combination of an outbreakcontrol closure period for social distancing and a range of accompanying epidemic control measures seems to have prevented new infections, especially in provinces other than Hubei, where new infections have been declining for more than 2 weeks. 1 As fearsome and consequential as the COVID19 outbreak has been, China's vigorous, multifaceted response is likely to have prevented a far worse situation. Future empirical research will establish the full impact of the social distancing and epidemic control policies during the extended Chinese Lunar New Year holiday. As travel and work slowly resume in China, the country should consider at least partial continuation of these policies to ensure that the COVID19 outbreak is sustainably controlled.",39.14506955059944,14.391856178598129

This situation had rapidly escalated from 29 countries with national school closures a week before. 2 School closures are based on evidence and assumptions from influenza outbreaks that they reduce social contacts between students and therefore interrupt the transmission. 3 School closures can affect deaths during an outbreak either positively, through reducing transmission and the number of cases, or negatively, through reductions in the health-care workforce available to care for those who are sick. Studies of UK children and young people report that the mean number of daily social contacts during school holidays are approximately half that of school term days; 4, 5 however, contacts continue and mixing between children and adults and between children at different schools actually increases during holidays and school closures.

It is unclear whether school measures are effective in coronavirus outbreaks-for example, due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and, most specifically, COVID-19, for which transmission dynamics appear to be different.",47.676319812992745,18.51761225197796

The study used transmission data representative of COVID-19, but it was unclear whether epidemiological data from the outbreak were used further in the modelling. This study concluded that the package of social distancing measures was effective in reducing the final size and peak incidence of the outbreak while also delaying the peak. 43 However, it did not examine the effect of school closures relative to other measures. It modelled different timings of relaxation of social distancing measures and concluded that earlier relaxation (after 2 months of restrictions) risked a second peak, whereas 3 months of restrictions did not result in a second peak. 43 Only one study examined the effect of school closures separately to other social distancing measures. In a nonpeer-reviewed but widely cited report from an established group, Ferguson and colleagues 31 modelled the estimated effects of a range of different social distancing measures and combinations of measures. They used UK population and schools data together with data on transmission dynamics reported from the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan. Using data from previous influenza outbreaks, they assumed that per-capita contacts within schools were double those in households, workplaces, or the community, and that, overall, approximately a third of transmission occurred in schools. They modelled a scenario in which all schools and 25% of universities were closed and where the effect on non-school social contacts was an increase of 50% in household contact rates for families with children and a 25% increase in community contacts during the closure. They concluded that school closure as an isolated measure was predicted to reduce total deaths by around 2-4% during a COVID-19 outbreak in the UK, whereas single measures such as case isolation would be more effective, and a combination of measures would be the most effective. The authors concluded that school closure is predicted to be insufficient to mitigate (never mind suppress) the COVID-19 pandemic in isolation, which is in contrast to seasonal influenza epidemics where children are the key drivers of transmission. 31 An early modelling study of a SARS-like illness in school children concluded that a school closure policy would reduce the effective R by 12-41% depending on the proportion of between-household mixing that occurred during school hours. The study noted that modelling was based on plausible assumptions regarding characteristics of the SARS virus, noting that obtaining good quality estimates of epidemiological parameters for SARS was difficult as the outbreak was contained rapidly. 39 A modelling study of the transmission of SARS in hospitals and in elementary school classrooms in Taiwan using data from the 2003 SARS outbreak concluded that a single case of SARS would infect an average of 2·6 secondary cases in a population from transmission in hospital, whereas less than 1 secondary infection would be generated per case in a school classroom. 38",44.266297015684984,17.804813319045653

Emerging epidemiological data suggest little evidence of transmission of COVID-19 through schools in China, although this might reflect closure of schools during most of the outbreak. Notably, school closures began with not reopening schools after the Chinese New Year Review holidays. 29 As of April 3, 2020, Taiwan has been recognised to have effectively minimised spread of COVID-19, 30 but with national policies that avoided widespread planned school closures and instead mandated initially local class closures, and subsequently local temporary school closures, based on low thresholds for infected cases within individual schools. 30 In view of the scarce information and pressure on countries to consider school closures to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, we did a systematic review of the literature to answer the question: what is known about the use of and effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of school closure and other school social distancing practices on infection rates and transmission during coronavirus outbreaks?",48.289678755682615,17.634475765773324

School closures were implemented at the same time as a number of other stringent social distancing measures, with school closures extended initially to March, 2020, then to April, 2020. 12, 44 Collectively, these measures were considered to have reduced the R below 1, controlling the spread of the outbreak. 12 As in mainland China, no data were available from either paper on the effect of school closures separate from other measures. Cowling and colleagues 12 noted that the social distancing measures implemented during the COVID-19 outbreak reduced community transmission by 44%, which was much greater than the estimated 10-15% reduction in influenza transmission conferred by school closures implemented alone during the 2009 pandemic in Hong Kong. 44 During the SARS epidemic, schools in Beijing were closed on April 24, 2003, approximately 6 weeks after the beginning of the outbreak, and remained closed for over 2 months. One study 36 concluded that school closures made very little difference to the prevention of SARS in Beijing, given the very low attack rate in schools before the closure and the low prevalence of disease in children. A second study 37 estimated the effective R for each day of the Beijing SARS outbreak, noting that school closures occurred after the R had dropped below 1 and that school closures in this case added little to control of the outbreak. Class cancellation strategies, in which upper high-school and college students remained on college campuses but did not attend classes, were also widely used during the SARS outbreak in mainland China. 45 There was no recorded transmission of SARS in schools during the outbreak in mainland China. 46 A review 33 of the 2003 SARS outbreak in Singapore noted that twice daily, mandatory temperature screen ing of all children aged 6-16 years in schools was part of the containment measures instituted. Pupils were excluded from school if their temperature was more than 37·8°C for students aged 12 years or younger, or more than 37·5°C for students older than 12 years. Although there were school children diagnosed with SARS in Singapore, none of them were identified through temperature screening. 35 All educational facilities in Singapore were closed for 3 weeks from March 27, 2003 (the SARS outbreak ran from late February to May 2003), together with suspension of other activities to prevent the congregation of large groups of children. 34 A review 24 of responses in Taiwan to the SARS outbreak and 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic noted that schools were designated as alternative health-care sites in case the health system was overwhelmed during the SARS outbreak, but that there were no school social distancing measures (including closures) introduced during the SARS outbreak. This finding is in contrast to the use of class suspensions during the H1N1 pandemic in Taiwan. 24 Schools were also closed in Hong Kong during the SARS epidemic; however, the extent to which this was at a city-wide or local level is unclear. There was no evidence of spread of the infection in schools, with spread among children almost entirely through family settings and living in the same apartment blocks as infected cases. 27 A preprint study by Jackson and colleagues 32 used routine viral surveillance to examine the effects on transmission of endemic human coronaviruses (229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1) and other viruses of a 5-day closure of nearly all schools in the greater Seattle metropolitan area in February, 2019, due to extreme weather on transmission of these viruses. Their study estimated that the school closure resulted in a 5·6% (95% CI 4·1-6·9) reduction in coronavirus infections, similar to influenza H1N1 (7·6%; 5·2-9·7) but higher than influenza H3N2 (3·1%; 2·5-3·2), all of which were prevalent at the time. 32",43.311342801732295,17.153186768421396

20 There are many other potential social distancing actions available for schools that are less drastic than full closure,0.11781807415750352,0.20417557656764984,1.3576234579086304,c2aa3a36-b10c-4590-b207-003b18cef024,custom_license/Review School closure and management practices during coronavirus outbreaks including COVID-19: a rapid systematic review,"One way that school closures are effective during outbreaks might be through forcing parents to work at home and thus reducing work-related contacts. However, reviews have also noted the adverse effects of school closure, including economic harms to working parents, health-care workers, and other key workers being forced from work to childcare, and to society due to loss of parental productivity, transmission from children to vulnerable grandparents, loss of education, harms to child welfare particularly among the most vulnerable pupils, and nutritional problems especially to children for whom free school meals are an important source of nutrition. 8, 10, 11 Social isolation itself brings a range of psychological harms. 13 A rapid review 13 found evidence that, during unplanned school closures, children's activities and contacts decreased but did not cease, with some evidence that this was particularly so among older children and those whose parents disagreed with closures. 7 The economic harms of school closures are high. A UK study 14 from 2008 suggested that approximately 16% of the workforce are the main caregivers for dependent children and are at very high risk of absenteeism if schools are closed, a proportion that rises to 30% in the health and social care sectors. In the USA, unpublished estimates suggest that 29% of health-care workers have childcare obligations. 15 A 2010 economic modelling analysis 16 of school closures as mitigating interventions during influenza outbreaks suggested that 4-week or 13-week closures reduced the clinical attack rate minimally but markedly increased the economic cost to the nation, in particular through forced absenteeism by working parents, in the UK, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. Costs have been estimated to be as high as 0·2-1% of UK national gross domestic product (GDP) per annum for school closure for 12-13 weeks, 14 or up to 3% of GDP for an 8-week closure in US studies. 17 Reviews have not summarised economic harms from school closure in detail, but economic modelling from an influenza outbreak in Hong Kong, China, suggested that the most cost-effective models were selective local closures rather than city-wide closures. 18 Notably, regardless of official school closure or other distancing policies, unofficial student and staff absenteeism (whether due to illness or precautionary) can be very high during epidemics. Staff absenteeism can lead to forced local school closures. 19 School dismissal-whereby all students, except the most vulnerable and children of health-care and other essential workers, are sent home but the school stays open-has been suggested to be a less strict intervention than school closure, although there is no evidence supporting its use separately to full closure. 20 There are many other potential social distancing actions available for schools that are less drastic than full closure, although these have received little attention. 21 A 2018 systematic review 21 of such strategies noted that potential practices include suspending affected classes or year groups, or changing the school organisation structure to reduce student mixing (eg, by closing playgrounds, cancelling non-essential activities and meetings, keeping students in constant class groups or classrooms, increasing spacing between students in classes, shortening the school week, and staggering school start and lunch or break times across year groups or classes). The review concluded that few studies have been done but that a small number of modelling studies supported the use of alternative strategies during influenza outbreaks. 22, 23 There were no UK studies included in this review. 21 In the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, Taiwan instituted class suspensions rather than school closures, facilitated by keeping students in a homeroom class with a core teacher and having other teachers routinely moving between classes. Studies suggest that this approach was an effective social distancing measure in this outbreak while reducing social disruption. 24 To reduce the transmission of COVID-19, many countries had instituted large-scale or national closure of schools by March, 2020. These actions appear largely based on assumptions that the benefits apparent in influenza outbreaks are also likely to be true for COVID-19. There are several theoretical reasons why school closures might be less effective in COVID-19 than in influenza outbreaks. Children contribute more to influenza transmission than do adults, 25 with low levels of immunity and high levels of transmission due to symptomatic disease. However, in the COVID-19 pandemic thus far, children appear to form a much lower proportion of cases than expected from their population, although evidence for this is mixed and some data suggest that children might be as likely to be infected as adults but largely remain asymptomatic or have a mild form of the disease. 26 It remains unclear whether the low proportion of confirmed COVID-19 cases among children in mainland China relate to a reduced risk of infection, having subclinical or milder infections, or specific population factors (eg, one-child policy). Evidence of COVID-19 transmission through child-child contact or through schools is not yet available, although family transmission has an important role in the outbreak.",44.04557610420621,16.431121008881753

Figure 6 shows four density surfaces created using different bandwidths (1 km and 500m) and cell sizes (1km x 1km, 500m x 500m, and 250m x 250m) . The choices of bandwidth and cell size determine the degree of smoothing applied on a point pattern. A larger bandwidth yields a smoother surface with low intensity levels while a smaller bandwidth a thorny surface with more obvious local variations. Similarly a smaller cell partition produces a pattern that resembles more closely that revealed in a point map but too small a cell defeats the original intent of areal generalization. Bandwidth and cell size need not be the same but the former should be at least as large as the latter. Although the cell sizes used for LISA and kernel density maps in Figures 5 and 6 were the same, the visual impression of hot spots projected by these maps were quite different. The kernel density surfaces appeared smoother and the patterns more contoured. Indeed, they resemble a probability surface of disease occurrence and the patterns are easy to interpret. LISA maps however showed hot spots as a discrete category along with other categories not identifiable on a kernel density surface. Pockets of hot spots buffered by spatial outliers implied that the disease had remained localized. In both cases, the patterns and Moran's I values can inform about areas of concentration or hot spots are but not the severity of the matter. From the observed pattern, we cannot say for certain that the outbreak needs drastic measures of intervention (such as school closures or designated isolation).

We note the diffi culty of making inferences directly from changes in epidemic curves because changes in the epidemic curve may lag behind changes in the underlying transmission dynamics by at least 1 serial interval, as has previously been shown for severe acute respiratory syndrome (9, 11) . Although the estimates of R t (panel E) are crude, the estimated values of 1.2-1.5 during the rising phase of the 2008 winter epidemic in Hong Kong are slightly lower than previous estimates for interpandemic infl uenza (12, 13) , perhaps because of the low time-dependent resolution of the weekly aggregation of surveillance data. We emphasize that our results must be interpreted with caution; in particular, infl uenza might have continued to circulate for a longer period had the school closures not been implemented. Furthermore, notwithstanding our tentative null fi ndings, some previous reports have demonstrated that school closures may be effective at mitigating infl uenza seasons. For example, a study showed signifi cant reduction in respiratory infections during school closures in Israel (14) , and a recent model estimated that school holidays prevent 16%-18% of seasonal infl uenza cases in France (12) .",33.92633133075762,13.69591791559999

For example, from influenza-related mortality data in the USA, Shaman et al. demonstrated that the transmission of influenza was strongly modulated by absolute humidity [41] , while Perkins et al. analysed chikungunya surveillance data from 50 countries to describe how chikungunya transmission was impacted by temperature and precipitation [42] . During the 1918 pandemic influenza, Bootsma and Ferguson observed stark heterogeneity in the presence and size of a second wave (the autumn wave) across cities in the USAmore than seen in European cities, where only one city experienced a second wave [43] . The authors posited the hypothesis that autumn waves resulted from imperfect, short-lived efforts that controlled transmission during the first wave, yet, when lifted, facilitated a second wave due to a susceptible population larger than would be expected in the absence of control. To test this hypothesis and estimate the impact of social distancing (e.g., school closures, banning of mass gatherings, case isolation, and hygiene measures), the authors fitted Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR)-type models (Box 1) to observed time series of pneumonic and influenza mortality. They found that (i) including both a time-limited effect of social distancing (as informed by onset and end dates of control) and changes in contact rates in response to increasing mortality best explained the observed time series, and that (ii) the impact of control efforts was limited (reduction in mortality 10-30%) yet could have been improved if they were implemented earlier and left in place for longer.",50.78095348684073,19.35930558172691

[55] [56] [57] An essential element in modeling the dynamics of an epidemic is the determination of the basic reproductive number, the R 0 , which predicts the number of new infections produced by 1 infected individual when the population is completely susceptible to infection (ie, no preexisting immunity and unvaccinated). Calculation of the R 0 takes into account the average duration of infectiousness, the rate of contact of the primary case with susceptible individuals per unit time and the probability of transmission per contact. 55, 57 An R 0 of 3 indicates that a primary case of disease generates an average of 3 secondary cases in a susceptible population. Sustained transmission of a disease will not occur if R 0 is 1 or less. Also, of importance in predicting the potential for spread of an epidemic is the time it takes for the index case to cause secondary infections (the generation time), which is relatively short for influenza, in the range of 2 to 3 days. 57 The estimated R 0 for previous influenza pandemics ranged from approximately 2.0 for the 1918 pandemic, 56 1.89 for the 1968 ""Hong Kong"" influenza and 1.5 to 1.7 for the 1957 ""Asian"" influenza pandemic. 55 The 2009 H1N1 influenza had a R 0 of approximately 1.5 in the first wave of disease. 57 The goal of mitigation efforts is to reduce the transmission of influenza to a level that falls below that which is necessary to sustain the epidemic (reduce the R 0 to Յ1). The 1918 influenza pandemic produced some of the earliest evidence that social distancing measures could significantly impact disease burden in a community. City officials were not particularly alarmed when on September 17, 1918 , the first civilian cases of H1N1 ""Spanish flu"" were identified in Philadelphia, a city with a population of approximately 1.75 million at the time. A Liberty Loan parade, designed to raise money for the war effort, was allowed to proceed on September 28, 1918 , and attracted several hundred thousand spectators lining the streets over a 2-mile parade route. 58, 59 Within days, influenza cases and deaths dramatically increased and followed an explosive course reaching a peak rate of weekly excess pneumonia and influenza (P&I) deaths of 257 per 100,000 by October 19, 1918. 60 School closures and restrictions on public gatherings were not implemented until 16 days after recognition of the first influenza cases. 58 -60 In contrast, authorities in St. Louis, a city with a population of approximately 775,000 in 1918, moved quickly to institute social distancing 2 days after its first civilian influenza cases were recognized, and this Midwestern city experienced a peak weekly excess P&I death rate that was 88% lower and a cumulative excess P&I death rate that was approximately 50% lower than in Philadelphia. 60 In an epidemic model of weekly mortality in 16 cities during the 1918 pandemic, nonpharmaceutical mitigation efforts reduced the mortality by an average range of 10% to 30%, but this impact was diminished when interventions were introduced too late or released too soon. 61 Pandemic models testing a range of R 0 numbers (1.0 -3.0) that incorporate case-based interventions (eg, household quarantine, antiviral treatment and household prophylaxis and prophylaxis of extended contacts) and general or networkbased interventions (school closures, social distancing of children and teens and social distancing of adults and seniors) have shown that combinations of case-targeted and community-wide social distancing interventions implemented in a timely fashion are the most effective and can theoretically decrease infection rates to below 10% in a pandemic with a basic reproductive number as high as 2.0. 55, 56 Such efforts would allow containment while an effective vaccine is developed. 62, 63 Less is known about the acceptability to the general public of disease-control measures, the appropriate thresholds for implementation and the likelihood for sustained compliance with mitigation efforts. In addition to considering the basic reproductive number of a newly circulating pandemic influenza strain, the decision by public health authorities to implement aggressive mitigation efforts must also take into account the overall severity and lethality of the disease. 55 The 2009 H1N1 pandemic illustrates the challenges of assessing transmissibility and lethality immediately after recognition of a newly circulating influenza strain. Anecdotal early reports of the human 2009 H1N1 virus infections from Mexico suggested a much higher case-fatality rate than was later documented, and many argued that initial school closing recommendations in the first wave of the 2009 pandemic in the United States were overly vigorous for the relatively mild disease produced in most cases by the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza strain.",42.354095240647695,16.704369739766207

For SARS, viral loads peaked at 6-11 days after onset of illness for nasopharyngeal aspirates, enabling early isolation before transmission. 12 The number of secondary cases from an infected patient was clearly reduced if the infected patient was isolated within 4 days after onset of symptoms. 13 For SARS, a highly sensitive case definition was used with a focus on fever or respiratory symptoms, and an epidemiological link (contact or travel history). All suspected patients were isolated until SARS was ruled out. Implementing optimal isolation by itself was modelled to be more costeffective than implementing suboptimal isolation and quarantine together. 14 Secondary household transmission was low in Singapore (6·2%), indicative of rapid detection and isolation of patients. Similarly, in Toronto, secondary attack rate in households was 10%, with a linear association between secondary attack rate and the time that the index patient spent at home after symptom onset. 15 In Singapore, healthcare associated transmission accounted for more than 90% of all cases. 16 Once full measures were in place, almost all patients were promptly isolated before secondary transmission had occurred. The outbreak in Singapore was propagated by five superspreading events, 16 including three super spreading events as a result of atypical clinical manifestations of SARS. 17 Quarantine involves movement restriction, ideally combined with medical observation during the quarantine period, of close contacts of infected patients during the incubation period. 18 The premise for successful quarantine is prompt and comprehensive contact tracing of each and every confirmed patient. Quarantine can take place at home or in designated places such as hotels, and both of these options were used during the SARS epidemic. Quarantined contacts had to record their temperatures, and were visited or telephoned daily by a member of the public healthcare team. If the contact developed symptoms, they were investigated at a designated healthcare facility. The principle is that if the person under quarantine developed illness, that person would not have any close contacts to spread the disease, effectively reducing the R₀ of the outbreak to less than 1. As an example of the magnitude of efforts taken, Toronto Public Health investigated 2132 potential cases of SARS and identified 23 103 contacts as requiring quarantine. 19 Legally enforceable quarantine orders were issued to contacts. Police made spot checks in Hong Kong whereas video cameras were installed at the home of each contact in Singapore. 16, 20 Once it is no longer feasible to identify all infectious individuals and their contacts in the attempt to slow the spread of disease, a possible next step is to apply communitywide containment measures. Community wide containment is an intervention that is applied to an entire community, city, or region, designed to reduce personal interactions. 10 These interventions range from measures to encourage personal responsibility to identify disease, increase social distancing among community members including cancellation of public gatherings, and finally implement community quarantine. 11 Enforcement of communitywide contain ment measures is far more complex than isolation or quarantine because of the larger number of people involved. China best exemplified this largescale quarantine by declaring epidemic zones and placing people under collective quarantine in villages, cities, or institutions. 21 In April 2003, the Chinese authorities gained full control of all activities to combat SARS, with guidelines and control measures that were national, unambiguous, rational, and widely followed, under central guidance. The stringent control measures included school closures and closures of all universities and public places, as well as the cancellation of the public holiday in May. Immediately, the R₀ decreased greatly and consistently. 22 In May, 2003, China locked down Beijing and closed more than 3500 public places in an effort to curb community spread.",25.902737686165736,10.01483600978553

Protection of patients and staff during a pandemic,"Disease transmission Although many of the lessons learned from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak are relevant to the planning process for a pandemic [3, 4] , there is one significant difference between the implications of these infectious events. In the SARS outbreak there was a realistic possibility of restricting and eventually preventing global disease transmission. In an influenza pandemic this is extremely unlikely to be achievable. There is a theoretical possibility that if the potential pandemic were to be detected very early, the combination of preventing all travel from the geographical area and widespread administration of effective antiviral agents to minimise the risks of disease transmission might just prevent its progression-but for logistical reasons this is unlikely to be successful. The production and distribution of a widely applicable generic influenza vaccine could also theoretically prevent a pandemic-but may take considerable time and cannot be guaranteed to be fully effective. It is therefore sensible to plan on the basis that a pandemic may still cause significant numbers of patients to become seriously ill. The most obvious and universal threat to the whole population is the acquisition of influenza viral infection spread by standard virus transmission processes. Although these risks may be slightly reduced by a number of agreed local or national policies such as cancellation of major social events, etc., there is no real prospect that the national transmission of an influenza virus can be prevented by such restrictions. School closures may also be considered an appropriate strategy to reduce the risks to children and their role in virus transmission, but any benefits of this may be offset by the impact on parents being unable to attend work because of the necessity to provide home care, and any alternative structures for providing group child-care for children will almost certainly restore the same risks of virus transmission as school attendance.",22.7296830029603,9.745438341693148

In this regard, we need to focus our planning and response efforts on those interventions that are critical during the early phases of a pandemic where there is no availability of a specific pandemic vaccine (2, 19) .

Consequently, from a policy perspective, trade bans have been proposed as a tool to help achieve these threat reduction goals.

However, in addition to being heterogeneous, network contacts generally evolve during the course of a disease outbreak, due to changes that occur in individuals' mobility patterns according to their clinical/epidemiological status in the population. For example, infected individuals tend to isolate from the rest of the population for the duration of their infection, and reconnect once they have recovered (and acquired immunity). The co-evolution of individual disease states and the contact network has recently been considered for simple SIS and SIRS models (Risau-Gusman and Zanette, 2008; Shaw and Schwartz, 2008; Zanette and Risau-Gusman, 2007) , and new phenomena (such as backward bifurcations) not encountered in traditional models were found. Generalization of the models presented in this paper to incorporate coevolution of contacts and individual disease progression could suggest alternative control strategies for mitigating the spread of infection. Although this study considers treatment as a single intervention strategy, a combination of control measures (e.g., vaccination, isolation/quarantine, and other social distancing mechanisms) is likely to take place during an outbreak, which can profoundly influence the dynamics of network contacts and spread of resistance in the population. This further underscores the importance of optimizing control strategies from a societal point of view, especially in the face of inadequate resources and limited capacity to cope with surging demand in healthcare.",19.58801226352481,9.150099245579936

Based only on local information, a susceptible agent is able to prune a link with an infectious individual with probability δ and restore it afterwards such that the underlying interaction topology remains unchanged. With the help of percolation theory, the authors find a cutoff threshold, δ c , directly controlling the eradication of the disease. As for the adoption of non-pharmaceutical measures, an important aspect seems to be the awareness of the current state of an infection and the associated dangers [135, 187] . The spread of awareness strengthens the behavioral response, which in turn affects the trajectory of the infection and the outbreak likelihood [188] . Finally, because non-pharmaceutical measures and vaccines go hand in hand, some recent studies consider the effectiveness of integrated frameworks that combine both of these types of prevention [157, 189] . As a concluding remark, we emphasize that coupled disease-behavior models exhibit dynamics rich with surprising phenomena, yet this richness comes at a price-models are complex and difficult to relate to the available data.

Therefore, nonpharmaceutical interventions, such as isolation and quarantine, social distancing, attention to personal hygiene, hospital infection control, and border control measures have important supplementary roles during a pandemic. But the effectiveness of these measures during a pandemic has not been properly evaluated during past pandemics, and scientific evidence for the effectiveness of these measures is also limited. 26, 27 Isolation and quarantine Isolation is defined as ""the removal of symptomatic individuals from the general population"" and quarantine as ""the removal of individuals who have had contact with an infected individual but are not displaying symptoms"". 28 This is the conventional approach that has been used for the control and containment of disease outbreaks for hundreds of years. These measures were also used as the main strategy to contain the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). 29, 30 Whether or not isolation and quarantine are effective depends on several factors. The most important factor is the time at which an infected individual becomes infectious. If most of the infected individuals are not infectious until they develop apparent clinical symptoms, isolation and quarantine are more likely to be effective in controlling the disease. Most SARS patients were not infectious until they developed severe lower respiratory infections, such as pneumonia and respiratory distress syndrome (WHO Consensus report). On the other hand, if infected individuals become infectious before the onset of clinical symptom (i.e., during the incubation period) or immediately after the onset, containment by isolation and quarantine is more difficult. 28 The shedding of influenza viruses starts even before patients develop clinical symptoms such as fever. Therefore, quarantine and isolation are considered to be less effective for influenza than for SARS. 31 Implementation of quarantine measures is also associated with many legal, ethical, and psychological issues. 32, 33 Social distancing Various social distancing measures, such as the closure of schools and workplaces, home confinement, and cancellation of social gatherings were used to prevent the transmission of the virus during past pandemics. Some of these measures were implemented as official policy, but in many cases, they were implemented as voluntary behavior changes due to a fear of infection in crowded places. Similar behavioral changes were also seen during the SARS epidemic. 34 There is little scientific evidence for the effectiveness of these interventions in reducing influenza transmission during periods of seasonal and pandemic influenza. 26 Schools often play an important role in spreading the virus to the community. It was suggested that school closures were associated with a reduced incidence of influenza. 35 Recent studies, using epidemiological models, have concluded that social distancing measures alone would have little impact on the overall number of cases, although they might have some effect in delaying the peak of an epidemic. 5,6 Therefore, social distancing may only be effective in gaining time to produce sufficient vaccines or as a supplemental strategy in addition to pharmaceutical interventions.",41.96951617766821,16.588446433239092

Adolescents with eating disorders can be among the most active medically and at times, the most ill. Frequent -sometimes even weekly -outpatient appointments with the medical team are often necessary to allow for medical assessment including weight and vital sign checks (2) . Given that adolescents with eating disorders have associated psychiatric comorbidities and require psychological treatment for their eating disorder, regular meetings with a mental health provider are essential (3). However, the COVID-19 situation presents a particularly challenging set of circumstances for the adolescent with an eating disorder, which can be extremely distressing. Patients may experience limited access to treatment, lack of structure, exposure to triggering circumstances (e.g. discussions around food shortages, increase hygiene practices, seclusion from others), social isolation (e.g. social distancing and quarantining), and as Davis et al. describe (1), ""coronaphobia"" or increased anxiety which results in decreased willingness to come in for health care appointments. Nonetheless, COVID-19 does not take away the need for frequent medical monitoring and ongoing psychological treatment for teens with eating disorders, optimally achieved through an in-person visit.",21.749326250128725,9.449702505678408

Various strategies, including pharmaceutical interventions (such as vaccines and antivirals) and nonpharmaceutical interventions (such as quarantine, isolation, and social distancing) may be implemented to mitigate the impact of a pandemic. It is necessary to understand the potential benefits and limitations of each strategy to determine the most appropriate strategies to be implemented. In this article, each strategy is reviewed to define its potential benefits and limitations during a pandemic. Vaccines are probably the most effective measure to reduce morbidity and mortality. However, vaccines are not likely to be available at an early stage of a pandemic. The supply of vaccines is most likely to be insufficient due to limited worldwide production capacity. Antivirals, particularly neuraminidase inhibitors, are expected to be effective against a pandemic influenza strain and are the only available pharmaceutical intervention until enough vaccines are produced. Shortage of supply and high cost is still a major limiting factor in amassing large stockpiles of neuraminidase inhibitors. The possible emergence of resistant strains should also be considered. Nonpharmaceutical interventions can be effective in preventing the spread of the virus under certain conditions. The effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical interventions depends on how influenza viruses are transmitted. There are still significant gaps in the scientific evidence of the way in which influenza viruses are transmitted. Further studies should be conducted to define the basic transmission patterns of influenza viruses. ",19.10946020355376,8.855533338633112

Therefore, nonpharmaceutical interventions, such as isolation and quarantine, social distancing, attention to personal hygiene, hospital infection control, and border control measures have important supplementary roles during a pandemic. But the effectiveness of these measures during a pandemic has not been properly evaluated during past pandemics, and scientific evidence for the effectiveness of these measures is also limited. 26, 27 Isolation and quarantine Isolation is defined as ""the removal of symptomatic individuals from the general population"" and quarantine as ""the removal of individuals who have had contact with an infected individual but are not displaying symptoms"". 28 This is the conventional approach that has been used for the control and containment of disease outbreaks for hundreds of years. These measures were also used as the main strategy to contain the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). 29, 30 Whether or not isolation and quarantine are effective depends on several factors. The most important factor is the time at which an infected individual becomes infectious. If most of the infected individuals are not infectious until they develop apparent clinical symptoms, isolation and quarantine are more likely to be effective in controlling the disease. Most SARS patients were not infectious until they developed severe lower respiratory infections, such as pneumonia and respiratory distress syndrome (WHO Consensus report). On the other hand, if infected individuals become infectious before the onset of clinical symptom (i.e., during the incubation period) or immediately after the onset, containment by isolation and quarantine is more difficult. 28 The shedding of influenza viruses starts even before patients develop clinical symptoms such as fever. Therefore, quarantine and isolation are considered to be less effective for influenza than for SARS. 31 Implementation of quarantine measures is also associated with many legal, ethical, and psychological issues. 32, 33 Social distancing Various social distancing measures, such as the closure of schools and workplaces, home confinement, and cancellation of social gatherings were used to prevent the transmission of the virus during past pandemics. Some of these measures were implemented as official policy, but in many cases, they were implemented as voluntary behavior changes due to a fear of infection in crowded places. Similar behavioral changes were also seen during the SARS epidemic. 34 There is little scientific evidence for the effectiveness of these interventions in reducing influenza transmission during periods of seasonal and pandemic influenza. 26 Schools often play an important role in spreading the virus to the community. It was suggested that school closures were associated with a reduced incidence of influenza. 35 Recent studies, using epidemiological models, have concluded that social distancing measures alone would have little impact on the overall number of cases, although they might have some effect in delaying the peak of an epidemic. 5,6 Therefore, social distancing may only be effective in gaining time to produce sufficient vaccines or as a supplemental strategy in addition to pharmaceutical interventions.",39.40221896200883,15.689892407758311

MPERT was developed to provide a readily available specialized regional resource that could be mobilized whenever and wherever needed. Resource utilization and reallocation allowed for a rapid, cohesive institutional response. The ability to quickly respond to a dynamic situation was possible because of experiences dealing with mass casualty situations and a physical infrastructure that could be adapted for a new functionality. The hospital experience with pediatric Hurricane Katrina evacuees identified several areas of improvement: cohorting for infectious diseases, improving communication, and streamlining processes. 2 These were addressed before the start of this MPERT. The need to identify venues for obtaining emergency stocks of supplies (eg, rapid influenza testing kits) also was recognized. One possibility would have been contacting the regional hospital preparedness council's Catastrophic Medical Operations Center. The center was used after Hurricane Katrina to coordinate regional resources, avoid duplication of requests, and streamline processes. 12 The unique circumstances of the threat of pandemic influenza necessitated a novel strategy in the ED because of increasing patient volumes and infection control concerns. The epicenter of the 1988 to 1989 Houston measles epidemic was the Texas Children's Hospital ED waiting room. 13 The threat of another airborne pathogen led to the decisions to perform active surveillance for symptoms, using a screening questionnaire, and to screen patients outdoors. The infection control challenge was to keep care areas safe for staff and patients. Although the community could practice social distancing, we could not; in fact, ill children actively sought out our facility.

The vast majority of the 8096 cases and 774 deaths from SARS were in China, but the disease spread to a number of other locations, notably Toronto (251 cases), Singapore (238 cases) and Taiwan (346 cases).

In the context of pandemic influenza, it is considered that social measures authorized by law will be at least as important as medical interventions. 3 Evidence from the 1918 influenza pandemic suggests that compulsory home isolation and quarantine were not particularly effective disease control measures because of the difficulty in diagnosing mild cases. Nor were such measures likely to be feasible beyond the initial cases. 4 However, compulsory interventions such as school closures, closure of public places and restriction of mass gatherings, along with disease surveillance and hygiene improvement, have proved effective both in influenza outbreaks and in the SARS epidemic. 5 International and EU instruments require states to undertake such measures, many of which will require a legal underpinning. The requirement of compliance with the revised IHR and the globalization of disease information and exchange have prompted many states to revise their public health laws. Other states, which had no public health legislation, have now enshrined public health laws in legislative form. These initiatives were long overdue. Across Europe, as elsewhere, national public health laws tended to be old, based on flawed science, and to predate contemporary understandings and protection of human rights. 6, 7 The allocation of responsibility for public health practice and the role of the state in regulating private behaviours have very different histories across Europe. 8 Not surprisingly, states have adopted very different positions on the issue of the extent to which constraints can be placed upon individuals for the public benefit. Earlier research on European national public health laws in relation to tuberculosis 9 enabled the identification of four different 'families' of public health legislative models in Europe. These were: authoritarian (the enforcement of a high number of compulsory control measures); moderate (the enforcement of predominantly compulsory control measures without recourse to prevention powers such as compulsory vaccination or population screening); preventive (where compulsory provisions were oriented towards preventive measures, including screening, medical examination and/or vaccination, rather than compulsory treatment or detention); and the laissez faire model, where few or no compulsory measures existed.",29.062993687271803,12.774887653845454

On the other hand, the threat of an influenza pandemic is a threat to nearly every country, and it seems that the widespread buy-in and scope of pandemic planning reflects an acknowledgement of this fact.

Ideas of police ran throughout the limited repertoire of traditional public health techniques used to halt SARS. Quarantines of the infected and their contacts, and surveillance of travellers were the two most important methods used against SARS, with travel bans imposed by some countries. 4 The relationship to policing was clear: governments promised 'to hold victims', 'detain SARS sufferers', identify 'those suspected of harbouring the virus'.

During the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak in Singapore, numerous non-pharmaceutical interventions were implemented successfully, including effective triage and infection control measures in healthcare settings, isolation and quarantine of patients with SARS and their contacts, and mass screening of schoolaged children for febrile illness. 4 Each of these measures represented an escalation of typical public health action. However, the scale and disruptive impact of these interventions were small compared with the measures that have been implemented in China in response to COVID-19, including closure of schools, workplaces, roads, and transit systems; cancellation of public gatherings; mandatory quarantine of uninfected people without known exposure to SARS-CoV-2; and largescale electronic surveillance. 5, 6 Although these actions have been praised by WHO, 5 the possibility of imposing similar measures in other countries raises important questions. Populations for whom social-distancing interventions have been implemented require and deserve assurance that the decision to enact these measures is informed by the best attainable evidence.",30.26855006131208,11.278864648038512

Mass gatherings at religious events can pose major public health challenges, particularly the transmission of infectious diseases. Every year the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) hosts the Hajj pilgrimage, the largest gathering held on an annual basis where over 2 million people come to KSA from over 180 countries. Living together in crowded conditions exposes the pilgrims and the local population to a range infectious diseases. Respiratory and gastrointestinal tract bacterial and viral infections can spread rapidly and affect attendees of mass gatherings. Lethal infectious disease outbreaks were common during Hajj in the 19th and 20th centuries although they have now been controlled to a great extent by the huge investments made by the KSA into public health prevention and surveillance programs. The KSA provides regular updated Hajj travel advice and health regulations through international public health agencies such as the WHO, Public Health England, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Hajj travel agencies. During the Hajj, an additional 25 000 health workers are deployed; there are eight hospitals in Makkah and Mina complete with state-of-the-art surgical wards and intensive care units made specifically available for pilgrims. All medical facilities offer high quality of care, and services are offered free to Hajj pilgrims to ensure the risks of ill health to all pilgrims and KSA residents are minimal.

Schools must remain closed for at least 8 weeks, that is, throughout most of the epidemic, to have a significant impact on overall ARs. Simply, screening for ill students and keeping them from attending schools had minimal effect on the overall extent of the epidemic. Individual and systemwide school closures appeared to be equally effective so if the latter are more difficult to execute, the former can suffice. In addition, our results did not support any specific ""illness"" threshold level at which to close schools. In other words, short delays in school closure may not have a significant effect on the AR, timing of epidemic peak, or peak incidence. Finally, school closures may delay the epidemic peak for up to a week, which may provide more time to implement a second more effective intervention such as vaccination. The observed effect of reducing the peak incidence during an epidemic could place more importance on school closures when medical care capacity is anticipated to become strained or overloaded because of the number of patients needing care during the epidemic. This might be especially important in the setting where flu vaccine was becoming available just at the beginning of the school year. It is possible that delay of school opening for several weeks, in order to ensure that students get vaccination prior to beginning the school year, could be highly effective.

Challenged by the reality that earlier opportunities had been missed, China launched a costly public health response in Wuhan, which involved many tactics besides isolation of cases and contacts, including lockdown of the city and mass quarantine, social distancing mandates, school closures, and intense case finding and contact tracing by the medical and public health professionals who were mobilised across the country to come to Wuhan. [2] [3] [4] The approach in Wuhan and the nearby cities in Hubei Province took exceptional measures in response to the outbreak, because there was evidence of high-level community transmission and widespread nosocomial infections. 5 As of Feb 11, 2020, 3019 COVID-19 cases among health workers had been reported, with at least five deaths. 5,6 In many regions outside of China, decision makers and the medical community still have the opportunity of early detection and response. 2 The Article by Hellewell and colleagues gives us a clearer sense of how quickly the window for early response is closing: when the number of initial cases increases to 40, the probability of failure to control is high, at 80% even with 80% of contacts traced and isolated. Based on the early experience in Wuhan, the number of COVID-19 cases could increase from 20 to 40 cases within 3 days (from Jan 6-8, 2020), and outbreak sizes doubled in every 7·4 days on average, highlighting the urgency of early detection and rapid response. 7 In Hellewell and colleagues' model, transmission before symptoms, even when the percentage is moderate, at 15-30%, had a marked effect on probability to control. 1 Unlike the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus, where almost all onward transmissions occur after symptom onset, 8 we now know that transmission of COVID-19 virus can occur before symptom onset. In the fifth version of Chinese guidelines governing contact tracing, it defined close contacts as ""those who have been in close contact since 2 days before the onset of symptoms in suspected and confirmed cases, or 2 days prior to an asymptomatic confirmed case,"" which reflects our current understanding that secondary transmission of COVID-19 virus is possible at least 2 days before symptom onset. 9 However, the efficiency of transmission remains uncertain, and seroprevalence studies among different contacts will be important. Transmission by people with no or mild symptoms can dampen the power of the isolation strategy because of reduced likelihood of isolating all cases and tracing all contacts. The identification and testing of potential cases need to be as extensive as is permitted by health care and diagnostic testing capacity-including the identification, testing, and isolation of suspected cases with no or mild disease (eg, influenza-like illness).",26.108179351039055,10.904628593843741

As diseases transmitted by respiratory droplets require a certain proximity of people, social distancing of persons will reduce transmission. Social distancing is particularly useful in settings where community transmission is believed to have occurred, but where the linkages between cases is unclear, and where restrictions placed only on persons known to have been exposed is considered insufficient to prevent further transmission. 8 Examples for social distancing include closure of schools or office buildings and suspension of public markets, and cancellation of gatherings.",47.90178965348469,20.478075607483223

Some authorities may enact recommendations and policies that increase social distancing, by which gatherings of individuals in affected areas are reduced through school or workplace closures. One approach to capturing how social distancing approaches reduce transmission is to model the social network explicitly, as opposed to assuming homogeneous mixing within the population. For instance, school networks could be superimposed on a dynamic model, keeping track of schoolage individuals in the population and calculating their risks of infection as a function of transmission in both schools and the wider community. Even in the absence of enforced policies, individuals often spontaneously reduce their contacts in response to an outbreak by keeping children home from school, washing their hands more frequently, or avoiding public transit [8] . Such behavior change can be represented in a network model by incorporating a contact rate between network neighbors that depends on local rather than overall disease prevalence in the network [6] .",51.872258653716216,20.386956771877

One well-investigated example of this has been the effects of school closure on the subsequent progression of an influenza pandemic. Various mathematical modeling studies have suggested that, although there may be some delay in the spread of the pandemic from closing schools, this measure will only be effective if the subsequent behavior of children outside the school does not result in a similar number of contacts and that such relative isolation is prolonged during the pandemic period. However, the social and economic disruption for the working parents with such a strategy may be difficult to overcome because at least one parent will have to take time off work to look after young children at home. In particular, school closure has to be part of an overall mitigation strategy, including the treatment and home isolation of infected individuals to reduce further contacts. 15 Air travel can rapidly transport infections between different destinations around the world and also act as a source for generating new infections within the crowded confines of modern passenger planes. Various mathematical modeling tools have been used to assess the effect of restricting air travel on the spread of pandemic influenza.

It affects all individuals whatever their comorbidities, age, and adherence to preventive measures against respiratory infections including use of face mask, hand hygiene, social distancing, and vaccination. 22 Vaccination against influenza may be considered, although contradictive results have been obtained. 83 A metaanalysis of observational studies demonstrated a significant effect of vaccination on laboratoryproven influenza although the overall effect of the vaccine on disease is yet to be seen and controlled studies exploring the efficacy of influenza vaccine among attendees of MGs are not available. 84 Studies are necessary to evaluate knowledge, attitudes, and practices of Hajj pilgrims regarding vaccination. Randomized controlled trials are needed to assess the efficacy of vaccines and improve the vaccination coverage in this vulnerable population. 83 Nonpharmaceutical methods, such as face mask use, hand washing or use of hand gel, cough etiquette, social distancing, can be theoretically effective to mitigate the interhuman transmission of respiratory viruses 85 and are consequently recommended to Hajj pilgrims by national public health agencies 86 However, given the limited and inconclusive evidence of their effectiveness at the Hajj, prospective cohort studies are required to confirm whether or not such interventions are effective in interrupting or reducing the spread of respiratory pathogens at the Hajj. 87 A trial is being conducted to provide evidence on the efficacy of face masks in preventing viral respiratory tract infections among pilgrims. However, the adherence to face mask use by Hajj pilgrims remains a challenge. 87 By contrast, and despite their poor knowledge of the usefulness of hand hygiene in preventing respiratory tract infections, hand washing compliance of pilgrims is quite good. 87 Pending further rigorous studies on their effectiveness, we recommend effective hand hygiene practices, notably the use of alcoholbased hand gel, since it requires less time than classical hand washing, and act more rapidly. Social distancing measures are not realistic given the high density to which pilgrims are exposed at holy sites. 87 Transmission of respiratory pathogens at the Hajj Muslim pilgrimage in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is highly frequent, resulting in high acquisition rates of virus and bacteria carriage. The Hajj may, therefore, contribute to the globalization of common respiratory pathogens resulting from the crosscontamination of participants harboring pathogens that easily spread among pilgrims. Numerous viral and bacterial clinical infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract do occur during the pilgrimage leading to a high number of in-and outpatients in Saudi medical structures. Over the past 10 years, the emergence of several viruses including influenza AH1N1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, and MERS-CoV have been a great concern for the international medical community. 5 However, no major outbreaks have occurred at the Hajj, up to now. We must remember that aside from the highly publicized exotic and emerging pathogens, we must be alert to the circulation of common pathogens, which silently cause much more casualties than the exotic newcomers which occupy the forefront of the stage and get all the headlines. 88 Although outbreaks are less frequently reported in or after MGs outside the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages, they do sometimes occur. Most common were vaccine preventable diseases, mainly measles and influenza, while outbreaks of mumps have rarely been recorded. Almost all measles outbreaks at MGs have occurred among unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated individuals. 84 However, the effectiveness of vaccination in this context remains to be evaluated.

It is a continuum to expand from social distancing to community-wide quarantine with major movement restrictions of everyone. Enforcement of community-wide containment measures is far more complex given the larger number of persons involved. Such measures are also ethically more challenging with individual human rights weighing against the public health imperative. The advent of social media is an additional challenge to ensure compliance. During such community-wide quarantine, it is particularly important to wisely use social media as social media provides an opportunity for communicating the reasons for quarantine, reassurance and practical advice and to preempt false rumours and panic. Implementation requires close partnerships and cooperation with law enforcement at the local and state level, and often involves checkpoints, and may need legal penalties if quarantine violations occur.

The planning required to prepare for, or intervene in, pandemics involves an understanding of the spatial patterns of the transmission and spread of the pathogen involved. In the most recent global pandemic, of H1N1 influenza, GIS played a critical role in putting into motion a wide variety of locationbased analyses, from developing strategies for social distancing to implementing tactical vaccine-distribution logistics. GIS were used, by national, sub-state and local health jurisdictions around the world, to identify geographically those populations that were most at risk, to guide the local administration of vaccines, and, ultimately, to measure the effectiveness of the entire 'antipandemic' process. Being prepared for a pandemic means learning to use increasing amounts of geographically relevant information from a wide variety of non-standard sources -such as data supplied by volunteer or 'crowd' contributors. Analysis of the data -and identifying what the information actually meansmust also become more transparent, with many more disciplines being involved in the recommendations for action. When pandemics threaten, GIS software will also become ubiquitous and useful to a wider group of interested people, from epidemiologists and infectious-disease experts to social and medical practitioners, helping to pass the relevant data from specialised 'information works' to the aggressively health-seeking/informationseeking consumers. Spatial analysis, aided by sophisticated but easily accessed satellite imagery and image interpretation, will become a common 'cloud-computing' service (where the relevant software, applications and data will co-exist) that can be efficiently accessed, upon demand, from anywhere at any time.

Since 1950, food production has more than quadrupled, using less than 1% more cultivated land, allowing civilisation to proceed and expand. Food security is no longer an issue in many countries, and the global economy, human health, and societal development have been, for the most part, positively influenced by agricultural advancement. In the period 1900-2010, when the global population increased from around 1.5 billion to around 7 billion, average agricultural commodity prices decreased by an average of 0.9% p.a. because supplies rose faster than demand (unpublished presentation by Prof. Ingo Pies in 2014 to biennial development meeting of Pottinger). Nonetheless, feeding any substantial increases in the global population will only be possible by technological innovations because of the ecological limitations on increased water and fertilizer supplies and increasing the area farmed. Likewise, various climatechange predictions amplify justifiable concerns about global agricultural productivity. Supply and demand market dynamics are complex and ultimately resilient to political interference, although many countries and trading blocs try to manipulate production by tariffs, export bans, subsidies, inhibiting technological developments and market processes. The spikes in prices of traded wheat, rice, maize, and soya in 2008 and 2011 were initially blamed on speculation, especially the index tracking funds and derivatives markets. Yet this type of speculation does not trade physical goods but price risks, and is therefore a form of insurance market. In addition, speculation would be expected to be associated with high stocks as farmers opt for storage rather than sales. In 2008 and 2011, however, stocks were very low and caused the price rises. Even so, government policy failures, including protectionist export bans and inadequate promotion of agricultural efficiency, contributed to panic buying, as exporters reduced their offer and importers increased their demand in response. Calls by civil society groups to ban speculation by index-tracking funds and derivatives markets were always and continue to be profoundly misguided. All countries should have policies to sustain and constantly review food production and supply, especially if there is a significant dependence on food imports. Reasonably substantial reserve food stocks are essential cushions to prevent price bubbles and food shortages, but excessive stocks can distort markets such as when they are released in large quantities as general food aid and undermine the operation of normal agriculture markets in developing countries. Some price volatility is an essential component of healthy competitive markets, driving adaptation, risk taking and innovation.",18.192271223050582,8.603083815806885

''Ecosystem approaches'' to health (Waltner-Toews, 2001; Lebel, 2003; De Plaen and Kilelu, 2004) offer examples of research methods that explicitly engage with the ecological and social systems within which health is created and challenged, although these approaches were not developed specifically for EID investigation. However, these and other systems-based approaches provide some common principles with which to help understand the nested, interdependent systems in which diseases emerge, maintain themselves, and evolve on a multitude of levels-molecular, organismal, communal, national, and global (Wilcox and Colwell, 2005) . Understanding of these ''nested hierarchies'' is complemented by the idea of coupled human-natural systems, in which humans are both part of nature and fundamentally conditioned by social activity. This recognition, in turn, encourages researchers to incorporate into their methods and research design the idea that ''delineation between social systems and ecosystems is artificial and arbitrary'' (Berkes et al., 2003, p 2) . Research that explicitly engages with the complexity of systems' interactions (Kay et al., 1999) , and the associated concepts of adaptation and resilience (Holling, 2001) , offer valuable precedents and fertile ground for understanding the social, ecological, and economic contexts in which EIDs occur.

Besides, 82 districts all over the country have been locked down to get control over the situation (Hindustan Times, 2020). However, another step taken to prevent the spread of the discussed epidemics is the closure of educational institutes in various states. Nevertheless, the setback was that the closure included only the holidays declared to students and not to the faculty members. This decision of withholding the teachers back on the job has created a lot of psychological impacts on the morale of the teachers. The teaching community is trying to question back as how are they safe from the pandemic disease if not the students and on the other hand few educational institutes are mulling to terminate a few teachers for saving the money (Times of India, 2020a). Teachers irrespective of being in private or government institutes all over highly disappointed with the inhumane behavior with them compared to the industries and companies giving a work-from-home facility to their employees (Times of India, 2020b). The magnitude of agitation has gone to such heights that recently, an online petition was circulated namely ""#KeepTeachersSafe."" The petition is being signed to ask the Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) and Health Ministry and the Human Resource Development Ministry (MHRD) to immediately issue a directive asking all educational institutions (schools and colleges) to be closed till March 31, 2020, for teachers and other staff as well. In just four days, 53,325 faculty members have signed the petition (Parekh, 2020) , which shows the disappointment of the Indian teaching community. The disappointment here is not due to the lethargic attitude of teachers but the fear of getting infected and being a carrier for the family and neighbors. This if continued can bring the teacher's morale down and a teacher's moral is very complex as the research has proved very well how it affects the student learning process (Mackenzie, 2007) .

Our assumptions dictate that for such a serious pandemic the transition point would be passed, and the low, medium, and high infection scenarios yield reductions in gross domestic product of 6.0%, 7.4%, and 9.6%, respectively.

In brief, schools closing for about 95% of the 15 weeks of the pandemic's duration and assuming a mitigation equivalent to 2% if the clinical attack rate was 34%, as outlined by Ferguson et al, 10 produces a 2.5% further reduction in gross domestic product compared with our four week closure scenarios; it reduces the infection rates, but the dominance of the case fatality rate in determining the transition point is such that the degree of prophylactic absenteeism remains the same. Similarly, informal care by grandparents and friends, reducing the level of prophylactic absenteeism from 16.1% to 8.7%, 32 reduces the loss to gross domestic product by 0.56-0.58% in the four week school closure scenarios and by 1.8-2.0% in the longer closure scenario. Assuming the higher mitigation rate of 15% suggested by Cauchemez et al, 30 which would apply to longer school closure scenarios, the severity of the economic impact of school closures is reduced in proportion to the severity of the pandemic. This reduction is quite small-up to 0.25% of gross domestic product for non-extreme scenarios and up to 0.9% of gross domestic product in the most extreme and unmitigated scenario-so overall reductions in gross domestic product are still between 1% and 2% larger than with the four week school closure scenarios.

However, this distinction is not as important here as it would be should we have considered problems related to the control of the spread of the infection. In the latter case, the presence of a class of incubating individuals makes controlling the infection hard (since E individuals might travel undetected). In the case of media-induced social distancing, the presence of an E class simply delays the 'birth' of new infectives, so we expect similar results to the ones obtained here. The system should be studied with an arbitrary number of patches. It can be expected, though, that the global results we were able to establish here, in particular about the endemic equilibrium, will be hard to carry through to higher dimensionality. Also, while media coverage can help curtail an epidemic, it can also have negative consequences. The WHO guidance document [23] states, among the Communications actions to be taken in the event of a pandemic, that the WHO should 'Continue to work with partners to promote consistent messages'. We have assumed in our model that communication is always beneficial in mitigating the spread of disease. However it is possible that some forms of messaging could be counterproductive from a public health standpoint (e.g. messages inciting fears over vaccine safety). Therefore, more elaborate forms of the 'media coverage effect function' should be considered. This would be a very interesting problem on many different levels: the interaction of patches with different media coverage effect functions, some decreasing, some increasing, would most likely pose difficult and interesting mathematical problems. There are additional temporal effects in social distancing that are important but not taken into consideration here. For example, [7] found that social distancing was generally well accepted, but only insofar as it did not have major economic consequences for the individuals involved. During the 2009 pandemic influenza outbreak, [14] found that after initially experiencing high anxiety about getting infected by the virus, individuals were becoming less and less concerned. There is, therefore, a waning of the effect at the individual level that could be taken into account. Finally, knowledge of the presence of a disease could also lead to modification of the rate of travel between locations. During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, it was for instance observed [15] that air traffic to Mexico was affected in the early stages of the epidemic, although the effect on the overall global air transportation network was less evident. Work is in progress to incorporate such effects to our model. Table 1 such that R > 1. Table 1 such that R > 1. ",30.0356781200878,11.63395861891004

As the events in relation to the recent MERS-CoV outbreak show, the Hajj will continue to pose substantial public health challenges for health authorities in Saudi Arabia, the countries from where pilgrims travel, and worldwide. The introduction and spread of infectious diseases during and after the Hajj or any mass gathering event will remain important topics on the public health agendas for the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, the Hajj off ers a great opportunity for creating a health legacy that will enable improvements in health systems and services for mass gatherings. It presents major opportunities to do high-quality cross-sectional, case-control, and longitudinal cohort studies to generate an evidence base for the development of optimum recommendations for prevention, management, and control of infectious diseases and for sustaining global health security for Hajj 71 and other mass gatherings. The Saudi Ministry of Health established the Global Center for Mass Gathering Medicine in 2012 with the headquarters in Riyadh. This centre is a virtual research network of UK academic and public health institutions in partnership with the WHO Collaborating Centre on Mass Gatherings Medicine and WHO Global Capacity Alert and Response. This unique network will undertake longitudinal and cross-sectional cohort studies, review and publish reports, and has brought together a coalition of interested partners to gather and translate an appropriate evidence base into public health policy for use by countries that host mass gatherings. So far, the Global Center for Mass Gathering Medicine has established an overarching board chaired by the Saudi Minister of Health with membership of experts from the University College London, Public Health England, WHO, Saudi Council for Health Specialties, and the Saudi national research funding agency King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology.

The SARS-CoV had a relatively long 4-to 6-day incubation period and a peak infectious period that was delayed until the tenth day of severe illness. 16 SARS was transmitted predominantly in the healthcare settings, with a case fatality rate exceeding 10%. These features made SARS relatively easy to detect and readily amenable to individual-based control measures such as case isolation and contact tracing before substan-tial spread could occur beyond initial seeding and local hospital-based outbreaks. Influenza viruses, in contrast, are characterized by shorter incubation (typically 1-4 days), pre-clinical virus shedding and peak infectiousness shortly after illness onset. 17, 18 Influenza illness comprises a spectrum including mild or asymptomatic infection with overall case fatality below 2% even during the worst pandemic on record (1918) and 10-fold lower still during subsequent pandemics. 19 In keeping with this classic influenza profile, pandemic (H1N1) 2009 shows a larger proportion of mild infections, community-based propagation and a lower case fatality than SARS. 20 Thus, while the reproduction numbers of the two infections are not dramatically different, they likely will require a different set of population-based social distancing and mitigation measures. General reinforcement of voluntary self-isolation, cough etiquette, handwashing and self-monitoring by contacts combined with social strategies to disrupt complex contact networks and lessen virus amplification and adaptation at the community level are needed. National health authorities in North America and Europe have implemented varying school closure policies (e.g. broadly in Mexico, targeted in the UK and minimal in the US) in an attempt to contain viral transmission; as of this writing, these measures are being scaled back, but further interventions to change social contact patterns may be important as the outbreak progresses. 21 Pandemics are classically defined as the emergence of novel influenza A subtypes that have not previously been experienced by human populations, or at least not for a 2009 remains a worthwhile goal until a safe and effective vaccine can be developed and administered. Furthermore, global inequalities in social and economic conditions amplify the impacts of infectious diseases, including influenza. 22 As our estimates account for important sociological anomalies and are based on multiple data sources from communities rather than closed settings, they are likely to be broadly applicable. However, our optimistic prognosis relies on several critical assumptions about disease progression, virulence, and reporting rates, and it is clear that worse scenarios could evolve. Vigilant surveillance, self-isolation, adherence to social distancing and hygiene measures, strategic school closures, and other community measures to mitigate spread, as directed by national policy, may be paramount in the months to come.

The risk of infection was evident in the outbreaks of meningococcal W135 strains in 2000 and 2001 with their associated high mortality and potential for international spread. 10 Indeed, the annual Hajj has faced several disasters due to fires at camp sites and in crowded tunnels, falling cranes, and stampedes due to failures in crowd movement control. 13 However, as in a number of other health policy areas, reducing the health risks of mass gatherings and seizing the opportunities for health improvement that mass gatherings may offer requires a broader approach to the underlying determinants of risk. 1 A comprehensive risk approach incorporates a wide range of hazards as well as taking into account the role of population vulnerability and exposure levels. 9, 14, 15 Such an approach is akin to the social determinants of health approach, which looks at the upstream factors behind health outcomes, including socioeconomic inequalities. 16 The positive implication of this more comprehensive approach is that mass gatherings, as with other forms of hazard, can be seen as amenable to prevention, and new avenues of policy and management to reduce the risk to people and their environment open up.",32.04825416257017,13.44144446122161

In addition to formal methods of surveillance by public health agencies at all levels of government, alternative forms of surveillance can provide early clues to the beginning of disease outbreaks. Sudden increases in ""rumors"" via Internet bulletin boards or cellular phone text messages were noted in the early stages of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 69 (a deadly respiratory infection that emerged from Asia in 2003 that is caused by a coronavirus and characterized by fever, diarrhea, and pneumonia 70 ). Formal electronic communication between infection control professionals has enhanced surveillance efforts. 71 Social distancing refers to physical separation of infectious and high-risk individuals from other susceptible individuals in the hope of controlling the spread of disease by reducing person-to-person contact. Social distancing on a global scale may entail curtailing air travel to prevent illnesses from ""hopscotching"" across large areas. For example, the 2003 outbreak of SARS originated in China and spread to Hong Kong and ultimately to 22 countries, in part, as a result of air travel. 72 Five international commercial airliners were linked to the spread of SARS from infected passengers to fellow passengers and airline crew. 73 A 1979 cluster of influenza A aboard a commercial aircraft was documented in which 72% of passengers had contracted the same viral strain. 20 Efforts to limit air travel, however, would require the isolation of many larger airports 74 and consistent adherence to advice that symptomatic passengers postpone travel or seek medical advice if they have flu symptoms. 75 The decrease in airline travel after the September 11, 2001, attacks provided an opportunity to observe a change in the spread of influenza resulting from altered travel patterns. The influenza season that year was delayed and smaller presumably because fewer travelers translated into fewer opportunities to disseminate flu across the country. 76 Mathematical models have been devised to predict the onset of peak incidence of influenza during an epidemic or pandemic as well as the role of air travel in spreading disease. Models suggest that air travel does add to the number of predicted cases of influenza across the nation, and such models can also help characterize an epidemic once it has started. 76 Another model suggests that if an influenza strain is highly transmissible (similar to the spread of SARS), a global outbreak could quickly spread if even a few infected individuals were allowed to travel to just 3 major destination cities. Isolating the top 2% most populous cities from the normal influx of visitors could cut the need to vaccinate by almost one half. 74 Community-level social distancing would be aimed at decreasing person-to-person contact. This could include steps such as canceling large-scale events and encouraging workplace strategies to decrease person-to-person contact, such as working remotely from home, teleconferencing, and increasing physical distance of workstations. 77 It is widely accepted that young children most easily transmit the virus. This is attributable to the observations that: (1) children experience a large number of contacts with other children in school or daycare, (2) children are assumed to be more susceptible because of lower immune status, and (3) children could be more infectious because they shed more virus and shed the virus for a longer time period compared with older individuals. 59 Modeling of social contacts suggests that teenagers may also substantially increase the spread of influenza. 78 Because children (especially preschoolers) are thought to play a major role in spreading influenza in the community, some social distancing strategies are directed specifically at children, including closure of schools and daycare facilities. One study estimates more than 40% of secondary flu cases are attributable to exposure to a sick preschool child. The effectiveness of social distancing targeting children is demonstrated by a study showing that the proportion of sick children decreased sharply once winter school recess commenced. The entire profile of this epidemic changed abruptly as a result of interrupting the cycle of infection by sending children home for the holidays. 79 Such a strategy is not foolproof, however, because some benefits could be negated by increased spread of illness in the home or neighborhood when school is canceled. Even with school closures, preventing contact with nonhousehold children markedly increased the efficacy of social distancing. 78 In the event of a pandemic outbreak of the flu, the multitude of persons expected to become ill will likely overwhelm hospitals and other health care facilities. This challenge of so-called ""surge capacity"" is a concern for clinic administrators and planners at the community public health level. Efforts are being made to increase surge capacity to meet the unprecedented demand for care anticipated during a pandemic. Measures include identification of temporary clinical care areas on the premises of health care facilities or makeshift patient wards in large structures (e.g., aircraft hangars, recreation centers, churches), predetermined procedures to facilitate and monitor home care, and caching of specific supplies. 80 Surge capacity also can be enhanced by restricting elective surgeries to free up beds and personnel. 81 Benefits of using various pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic control measures would be (1) a lower total number of cases of illness (versus no interventions), (2) a dampening of the peak number of cases during each outbreak, and (3) spreading out the number of sick patients over a longer time interval. 79, 82 Flattening and extending the pattern of an epi-demic or pandemic will make the outbreak more manageable and less overwhelming at any given point in time.",37.088152915439615,15.47245620943165

If anecdotal evidence strongly suggests that isolation and quarantine may be necessary to save thousands or millions of lives, and if this is all the evidence there is to go on, it may be imprudent to insist on the highest level of evidence (which would be especially difficult to come by during early stages of an epidemic involving a novel strain of disease).

On 2 April, the WHO announced the most sensitive, country-specific travel recommendations, namely, for Hong Kong and Guangdong (other travel advisories involved Beijing; Shanxi Province; Toronto; Tinjan; Inner Mongolia; Taipei, Taiwan; and Heibei Province). This announcement forced China into action, beginning national reporting and allowing a WHO team to enter the country. The team expressed grave concerns about the capacity of the Chinese health care system and its ability to engage in contact tracing and reporting. Even more worrying were rumours of systematic underreporting of cases by major hospitals in China. Finally, on 9 April, the bubble burst when a physician reported the true number of cases at Beijing's No. 309 hospital. This revelation forced China to reverse its course and adopt a policy of transparency. In Canada, the hardest-hit country outside of Asia, the response was hampered by lack of resources and poor leadership, communication and coordination (Markel and Stoney 2011) .

These initial bans were subsequently enlarged and extended in various ways (see Fig. 9 .12 and its legend). The ruminant feed ban resulted in the waning of the epidemic in cattle in Britain, but new cases continued to arise, whether the result of a long latent period of the infectious agent, or from contaminated ruminant feed that continued to enter the system, or from alternative modes of transmission, such as passing the infection from mother to calf. With the recognition of new variant CJD in people, the issue of eradicating BSE became more pressing and culling of cattle was undertaken.

School closures have been the most extensively studied social distancing measure. Wu et al. followed transmission of the 2009 pandemic influenza A/H1N1 in schoolchildren in Hong Kong, where primary schools closed for 4 weeks due to the pandemic, followed by summer vacation in primary and secondary schools [79] . During the periods of school closure, there was an estimated 70% reduction in intra-age group transmission. The estimated population-wide reproductive rate (R 0 ) -that is, the number of additional cases generated by an index infectious case -was 1.7 before school closure and declined to 1.1 by the end of summer vacation. While school closure may abate an outbreak, if the strain remains in the general population, the outbreak may resume once schools reopen. Wheeler et al. analyzed Arizona children over 4 consecutive school years and found that influenza incidence among the school-age population remained constant during winter breaks (when schools closed), but increased significantly after the winter break when schools reopened [80] . Similarly, in their study of Mexican schoolchildren during the 2009 pandemic [81] , Chowell et al. built a transmission model and found that during spring school closure, the overall population influenza spread decreased by approximately 29.6%.

Timing of school closures (both when school closure is initiated and concluded) seems essential to its efficacy; closure must occur early enough to prevent cases. As Cowling et al. found in Hong Kong [82] , school closures that occurred after influenza attack rates had already peaked had no significant effect on transmission in children. Similarly, in their study of school closure in rural Pennsylvania, Cauchemez et al. [83] determined that school closure was initiated after 27% of schoolchildren already had influenza symptoms and did not reduce influenza transmission among children. Several other models have attempted to identify thresholds of ill children at which schools should be closed to prevent an influenza outbreak but assumed indefinite school closure [84, 85] . Lee et al. showed the importance of school closure duration and that short closure durations could actually worsen an influenza outbreak [86] . School closure keeps a large segment of potential high mixers susceptible to influenza. If schools are reopened while the outbreak persists in the community, the sudden remixing of susceptible children with infectious individuals could simply refuel the outbreak, causing a new surge in cases. Therefore, once the decision to close schools is made, it may be important to maintain school closures until the outbreak has subsided, which in the case of a large epidemic can be over 8 weeks. This has tremendous implications from an economic standpoint, as will be detailed later.",43.409993569930734,16.86232702961377

In theory, perfectly executed social distancing measures should be nearly 100% efficacious.

In reality, social distancing measures are rarely perfectly executed. Typically, there are delays in identifying infectious cases and their contacts and implementing measures. Social distancing measures often are only partially implemented. For isolation and quarantine, completely eliminating contact with a child is practically impossible.

In addition to teaching children, schools employ teachers and other staff, care for students during the day while their parents are at work, and provide meals and other activities. Shutting down a school interferes with teacher, parent and other caregiver productivity. As Brown et al. demonstrated, the tremendous cost associated with school closure would dwarf the costsavings from preventing influenza-associated medical costs under 2009 H1N1 pandemic circumstances; an 8-week school closure would cost a median US $14,000-25,000 per influenza case averted, far higher than vaccination (< US $100 per influenza case averted) [1] . This suggests that long-term school closure to quell a large-scale epidemic would not be cost-effective and merited unless morbidity and mortality were much higher than in the 2009 pandemic.

They may also require quarantine of individuals exposed to the virus, once again in their own homes or in a secure environment. The rest of the public could go about its usual business. In contrast, in a severe influenza pandemic (4 or 5 on the 1-5 scale), not only would isolation and quarantine measures be implemented, so too would social-distancing measures be implemented.

Isolation is at its most useful when a disease becomes communicable after the onset of symptoms. One example of such a disease is Ebola virus, where effective isolation of suspected and known cases has been shown to reduce transmissibility significantly and can be incorporated into epidemic models (Shan et al. 2015) . In examples such as influenza, however, such strategies do not work because onset of symptoms is some time after the infective period has begun. Non-pharmaceutical countermeasures used to reduce influenza spread are therefore focused on reducing contact rates and improving public practices around personal hygiene in the context of the pandemic. Evidence from some epidemiological and a number of modelling studies suggests that school closures may be an effective tool in reducing the peak load on hospitals and health infrastructure during a flu pandemic and may buy time to roll out the vaccine (Earn et al. 2012; Jackson et al. 2014 ).",28.332703182634006,12.690460849143765

Community spread in the United States could require a shift from containment to mitigation strategies such as social distancing in order to reduce transmission. Such strategies could include isolating ill persons (including voluntary isolation at home), school closures, and telecommuting where possible. 9 A robust research effort is currently under way to develop a vaccine against Covid-19. 10 We anticipate that the first candidates will enter phase 1 trials by early spring. Therapy currently consists of supportive care while a variety of investigational approaches are being explored. 11 Among these are the antiviral medication lopinavir-ritonavir, interferon-1β, the RNA polymer ase inhibitor remdesivir, chloroquine, and a variety of traditional Chinese medicine products. 11 Once available, intravenous hyperimmune globulin from recovered persons and monoclonal antibodies may be attractive candidates to study in early intervention. Critical to moving the field forward, even in the context of an outbreak, is ensuring that investigational products are evaluated in scientifically and ethically sound studies. 12 Every outbreak provides an opportunity to gain important information, some of which is associated with a limited window of opportunity. For example, Li et al. report a mean interval of 9.1 to 12.5 days between the onset of illness and hospitalization.

However, although we discuss key conclusions and fi ndings of pandemic models, it is not our intention to do a detailed review of the subject (Halloran and colleagues 28 review the fi ndings of three models). In short, some models suggest that school closure combined with keeping all children at home might be suffi cient to stop a pandemic, 6 whereas others found a marginal eff ect on epidemic size but a substantial reduction of peak incidence. 10 Those diff erences in model outputs are because of diff erences in modelling assumptions. For example, if it is assumed that 50% of transmissions occur in schools, a conclusion will follow that closure of schools will have an important eff ect on spread, especially if children can be kept apart outside of school. By contrast, if only 20% of transmissions happen in schools, a much smaller eff ect of closures is expected. Whether the 20% or 50% scenario is the most likely cannot be determined a priori (and this might vary between pandemics as well as between cultures or Review settings-eg, urban vs rural).

This is illustrated by the recommendations that have been made by the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) which contrast with earlier recommendations. 39, 40 On the basis of information that many cases in the Mexican epidemic had severe illness, the CDC initially recommended school closure as an option to lessen the risk of infection from a potentially severe disease. However, as estimates of severity were revised downward, recommendations were changed and the early identifi cation and isolation of ill students and staff became the primary method to reduce the spread of infl uenza in schools. 40 The use of stringent and costly measures such as school closure should indeed be based on age-specifi c estimates of severity and local morbidity indicators. It is important to emphasise again that the WHO phases are not an indication of severity (phase six only means that there is a sustained spread of the virus in diff erent continents); WHO now makes parallel statements on severity and geographical spread. 41, 42 School closure will of course not be the only intervention used in a pandemic; it should be considered in combination with other interventions that are available, such as antiviral drugs, vaccines, and other nonpharmaceutical interventions. Modelling suggests that, in certain circumstances, the combined eff ect of a set of interventions might be larger than the sum of the individual impacts. 28 This can happen when the diff erent interventions are complementary, targeting diff erent places or groups of individuals (eg, school closure and banning of mass gatherings and closure of selected workplaces). However, if the interventions target the same place or group of individuals, then the combined eff ect might be smaller than the sum of the individual impacts. For example, if children are vaccinated, the additional benefi ts gained by closing schools might be very small. These complexities mean that predicting the eff ect of combined interventions is challenging, and modelling has an important role in assessing likely impact. But it is important as new data become available on the eff ectiveness of individual interventions-such as the eff ect of school closure 14 -that model parameters and predictions are updated.",24.13819168191517,9.585376059646185

For the Hong Kong 2008 and French 1957 pandemic examples, the intervention inevitably failed to have a detectable eff ect because of its implementation very late in the outbreak. Modelling suggests that if schools can be closed before 1% of the population get sick, the eff ect of the intervention remains close to maximum. 28 The desirability of closing schools at an early stage of local epidemics raises several questions about implementation and triggers (panel 2). One option would be to implement local reactive school closure-closing schools when a transmission of the pandemic strain is detected in the school or in a particular area. One risk for such an approach is that local surveillance might be lacking in sensitivity or promptness, meaning schools are closed too late. False positives might also be an issue, given surveillance of infl uenza-like illnesses will probably not be able to distinguish between pandemic infl uenza and other respiratory disease outbreaks. The second option is synchronised national (or, in larger countries, regional) closures that have the benefi ts of consistency and simplicity; they can rely on national surveillance systems that are expected to be more robust than local mechanisms. The health eff ect of national or regional closure is expected to be more substantial than that of local closure, but with a higher economic and social cost, since schools might be closed for longer and in areas with low local incidence. This is a particular issue with the highly heterogeneous pattern of the H1N1 pandemic so far, even within a single small country such as the UK. 34 The trigger for closure (whether local or national) is also crucial. Use of a trigger based on school absenteeism rates might lead to closure occurring only late into the epidemic, limiting any eff ect on spread. Even relying on sentinel surveillance of infl uenza-like illnesses might lead to decisions being made too late, given the limited sensitivity of such surveillance and the background incidence of non-infl uenza related illnesses. Arguably, triggers based on virological identifi cation of the fi rst few hundred pandemic infl uenza cases identifi ed in a country might be the most reliable, but as the H1N1 pandemic is Review demonstrating, seasonal variation in infl uenza transmission could mean that such a sensitive trigger might lead to schools being closed for months. Even if triggers could be identifi ed that took account of seasonality in the intensity of transmission but reliably initiated closure when only a one or two percent of the population had been infected (needed for maximum eff ect), schools could still end up being closed for 12-16 weeks. The decision to reopen schools might be equally challenging. An important limitation of social distancing measures is that their eff ect stops as soon as the intervention is relaxed. There were various examples in US cities in the autumn of 1918, in which the lifting of interventions was associated with a second peak in the outbreak. Lifting of non-pharmaceutical interventions therefore requires some assurance that population herdimmunity has been reached-whether through immunisation or natural infection. Cross-sectional seroprevalence surveys would be the most reliable method of determining if the population has suffi cient collective immunity, but proxy measures might be able to be identifi ed. Another possible rule-of-thumb is to reopen schools only once children (or the general population) have been immunised with a pandemic vaccine.",19.314418646082387,9.573337384397574

However, experience with other respiratory viruses suggests that travel restrictions have a limited effect. Mateus and colleagues (1) found that such restrictions decreased new cases of influenza by only 3% and delayed but did not prevent influenza epidemics. Similarly, Errett and colleagues (2) identified minimal evidence to support the effectiveness of travel bans as a control measure for emerging infectious diseases. Read and colleagues (3) suggest that, because only 5% of infections have been identified, even a travel reduction that is 99% effective may reduce the epidemic outside Wuhan province by no more than 24.9%. Other investigators (4) estimate that almost 59 000 cases occurred in Wuhan and 3500 in other regions of China before the travel ban was implemented. Hence, the ban may simply reduce the progression of the outbreak by only 3 to 5 days within China. Finally, a recent report (5) suggests that 46% of cases would be missed by airport-based screening because of COVID-19's incubation period, the spectrum of symptoms, and the time during the incubation period in which persons may fly.

In the 1918-1919 pandemic, stringent quarantine of the island populations of American Samoa and Australia was of benefit, 18, 19 although unlikely to be practicable in our age of international air travel. 11, 77 Restrictions on social movement within communities in 1919 also appeared to limit disease spread. 68 A caveat is that self-imposed behavioural changes can influence the apparent efficacy of government interventions during any pandemic. 10, 63 The effects of school closures on community-wide influenza transmission are not well defined. During the 1920 influenza epidemic on Kelley's island, Ohio, school contacts were found to be important in disease spread. Further, a decline in incidence followed school closure ( Figure 5 ). 60 More recently, a 30% reduction in paediatric visits to healthcare providers coincided with a 2-week teachers' strike during the epidemic influenza season in Israel. 78 Historically, the likely benefit of closing schools was thought to depend on the household living conditions to which children would be returned. 19 Accordingly, models exploring this intervention are sensitive to assumptions about age-specific transmission rates in the school compared with rates in the home. 11, 63 Transmission from infected individuals can be reduced by institutional or household quarantine. Household-based models of this strategy show a fall in effective reproduction rate, contingent upon the timeliness of tracing, the proportion of cases and contacts identified and their compliance. 11, 79 Infection control measures, including hand hygiene and personal protective equipment, can also reduce the individual risk of respiratory infections. 80, 81 Although aerosol spread of influenza can occur, 46 its importance, relative to droplet infection, is still controversial, with implications for the standard of protective mask needed to reduce exposure risk. 82, 83 Importantly, experience of the recent SARS outbreak has shown that well co-ordinated institutional responses can protect healthcare workers far more than would be predicted from the additive effects of individual measures. 81 ",38.0823173848988,14.873898648706128

The 1918-1919 pandemic, the first of the three that occurred during the last century ( > Table 82 -1), proved the most devastating with an estimated 50 million deaths among countless infections worldwide (Taubenberger and Morens, 2006) . There is mounting concern that the current avian strain H5N1, originated in Southeast Asia, may cause the next major global pandemic (Webster et al., 2006) , with a toll that could exceed that of the 1918-1919 pandemic (Cox et al., 2003; Jennings and Peiris, 2006) . The H5N1 strain has crossed the species barrier and shown the ability to replicate and cause fatal disease in humans (WHO Avian Influenza, 2008) . Since populations are entirely immunologically naïve to this deadly virus, the conditions for a pandemic will be met through the emergence of a re-assorted viral strain that can sustain human-to-human transmission (American College of Physicians, 2006) . Given the uncertainties regarding the timing, origin, characteristics and virulence of a future pandemic strain, planning strategies for an effective response have become the priority of global public health efforts. Pandemic preparedness measures encompass disease surveillance, case identification and treatment, prevention of community-wide spread of disease, maintenance of essential services, research and evaluation (WHO Checklist for Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Planning, 2005) . Specific approaches to influenza infection control include the use of pharmaceutical products (such as vaccines and antiviral drugs), and nonpharmaceutical measures (such as personal protective equipment and social distancing). During seasonal influenza epidemics, vaccination has proven the most effective strategy for reducing the risk of infection and subsequent complications (Bridges et al., 2000; Nichol et al., 1995) . However, the unknown characteristics of a pandemic virus pose major obstacles to developing new vaccine candidates, thereby limiting immunological control of the disease. Social distancing measures, including quarantine/isolation, school closure, cancellation of gatherings, and to some extent, travel restriction, have been considered as possible strategies during a pandemic (Inglesby et al., 2006) . These measures have in general only limited impact on disease containment for several evidence-based reasons: (1) influenza viruses replicate rapidly to transmissible levels in a relatively short period of time, usually within the first day of exposure; (2) there is a pre-symptomatic stage associated with the disease, during which the virus can be shed before symptoms appear; and (3) a sizable portion of infected individuals may experience an asymptomatic infection, and transmit the virus (at a low rate) without being clinically recognizable (Baccam et al., 2006; Fraser et al., 2004) . To overcome the existing limitations with these transmission reduction measures, response plans incorporate antiviral drugs as an important primary tool for prevention and treatment of pandemic infections (Democratis et al., 2006) .",23.94478953798246,8.917067878165552

In some of these countries, BSE-affected cattle were detected even after a probabilistic risk assessment integrating release, exposure and consequence assessments indicated a negligible probability that BSE was introduced and established (Morley et al. 2003) . Materials potentially contaminated with the BSE agent had been distributed around the world through the trade in live cattle and cattle by-products before export bans and import risk assessments were put into place. These products include a range of high-risk materials, some masked by trading patterns that have included processing and re-exportation of hazardous products. The occurrence of BSE in cattle in Europe and elsewhere raised new concerns about the precautions needed to ensure the safety of the international trade of cattle and cattle products. Many countries still have no monitoring systems or insensitive surveillance in place for BSE and may not have the financial and response capacity to eliminate BSE should cases occur. From 2001 to 2004, abattoir-based testing of asymptomatic cattle for BSE in European Union countries cost €1.6 million per BSE case detected, with an overall cost of approximately €1.6 billion (Enserink 2005) .",16.267008762840575,8.781939154316436

However, it is sometimes difficult for the average homeowner to visualise the association between housing management performance and property value because with the exception of physical conditions, the various performance aspects of housing management (e.g., financial management and dispute resolution) are not easily observable by outsiders. Therefore, assessment schemes for benchmarking the overall performance of housing management should be devised and implemented for all apartment buildings in Hong Kong. This step would make additional information available to the market and create a 'league of value' in the form of higher-scored properties that should command a higher rent or value. With a view toward the potential economic benefits, homeowners may perceive greater value in housing management and may be more likely to participate actively in housing management. Another approach would be to enhance collective interests by reinforcing social bonding among homeowners. If a strong sense of community and cohesion exists among neighbours within a building, homeowners may hold very similar values regarding housing management. As a result, each of them will expect a greater degree of reciprocity from the other and a close working relationship will be there to keep their building a pleasant place to live. The government and owners' associations can help amplify the collective or group efficacy in achieving the collective good by fostering long-term partnerships among homeowners. More supports or subsidies should be offered by the government and owners' associations to organise social gatherings and activities which can bring homeowners together. Mechanisms like mediation should also be put in place to resolve disputes or conflicts between homeowners in an amicable and non-destructive manner. Otherwise, a long-term relationship cannot be ensured.",19.283682581868018,8.711668150603955

These cases were temporally and geographically linked to outbreaks of BSE, making an aetiological link highly likely.

Additionally, given the significant traditional values attached to wet markets and the live animal trade, policies of that kind may abrade cultural sensibilities. For instance, abrupt and prolonged closures of live animal markets may deprive people of a traditional venue for social interaction (Goldman et al. 1999; Woo et al. 2006; Gao 2014) . Improving public awareness and knowledge has been one form of intervention, but more generally management has tended to take the form of response rather than prevention. But given the changing zoonotic risks, mitigation (e.g., management at the human-animal-wildlife interface in anticipation of mutation and spillover) is likely to be more cost effective than adaptation (e.g., reducing contact rates through social distancing and trade and travel restrictions after an outbreak) (Pike et al. 2014) .",31.911338013696323,12.503009936015482

Most relevant studies are cross-sectional and of the 26 studies recently reviewed 23 lacked robust theoretical frameworks [10, 11]. Several theoretical models for understanding health protective behaviours are available, including the cognitively based Theories of Planned Behaviour (TPB) [16, 17]/Reasoned Action (TRA) [18, 19], Health Belief Model (HBM) [20, 21] and Protection Motivation Theory [22]. Although HBM and TPB among others have been applied in some studies of cognitive interactions with health protective behaviours during RIDs [15, 23, 24], these models do not adequately accommodate affect in health behavioural change during RID epidemics/pandemics. Moreover, existing theories have poorly accommodated the spectrum of social influence, exceptions being the TPB/TRA, which include coercive influences from family and friends under “norms”, and Social Learning Theory (SLT) [25], which describes observational learning. Neither theoretical position includes both. Some studies have explored combinations of different theories. For example, attempts to predict hand-washing on an intensive care unit by combining SLT and TPB elements found only self-efficacy predicted hand-washing [26], suggesting established theoretical models may be inadequate. Because outbreaks of RIDs are dynamic, embodying significant uncertainty and often, invisible personal threat they differ from non-communicable disease.

On the contrary, it may be altered from within (individual decisions) or by the use of preventive or active public health policy decisions or recommendations, some “obvious” like vaccination or quarantine, others drastic like mandated social distancing, as in the 2009–10 flu pandemic in Mexico (Herrera-Valdez, Cruz-Aponte, & Castillo-Chavez, 2009). Now, whether the dynamical changes experienced by the socio-epidemiological landscape are slow or fast, will depend on many factors. It is within this, often altered, complex adaptive dynamical system, that individual decisions such as individually-driven social distancing, the use of face masks, frequent hand washing, increased condom use, and or the routine use of non-pharmaceutical interventions, takes place (Wang, Andrews, Wu, Wang, & Bauch, 2015). It has been theoretically and computationally documented (Barrett et al., 2009; Funk, Gilad, Watkins, & Jansen, 2009; Funk & Jansen, 2013; Hyman & Li, 2007; Misra, Sharma, & Shukla, 2011; Perra, Balcan, Gonçalves, & Vespignani, 2011; Tracht, Del Valle, & Hyman, 2010) that massive behavioral changes can impact the patterns of infection spread, possibly playing a critical role in efforts to prevent or ameliorate disease transmission. Today policies are implemented regardless of our knowledge of who are the “drivers” responsible for inducing behavioral changes. Modeling frameworks exist that allow for the systematic exploration of possible scenarios. Through a systematic exploratory analyses of appropriately selected classes of scenarios, it is possible to identify possibly effective (model-evaluated) public health policies. The use of highly detailed models including individual-based models has some advantages since they can incorporate individuals’ awareness of risk based on available of local information.

Furthermore, low-income countries generally have population health profiles not seen in developed countries, including the prevalence of diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV.49 Antiviral treatment of influenza cases coinfected with such diseases may be an appropriate intervention strategy given the poorer health outcomes which comorbidity may impose.12 The provision and use of antiviral agents will have challenges not faced by industrialised countries, due to the cost of providing an antiviral stockpile and subsequent distribution of antivirals in countries which have health systems already stretched to capacity.15",27.50426426182227,10.60295939919862

Reactive school closure during an influenza pandemic was often accompanied by other control measures such as intensive screening, border control measures and improved sanitation, which may confound the assessment of effects of school closure on influenza incidence. To differentiate the effects of school closure from other accompanied interventions and changed health-seeking behaviour, some studies have evaluated the effects of school closure on influenza transmission by focusing on school breaks rather than reactive school closures. As school calendars are usually set at the beginning of each school term, observed changes of influenza incidence before, during and after school breaks are believed to be less confounded than school closures aimed to control a pandemic.9
10 Significant associations between winter school breaks and temporary reductions of influenza-like illness (ILI) incidence have been found in Chile10 and Argentina,9 as children were less likely to be gathered during school breaks thus reducing the chance of influenza transmission. We hypothesised that the 4-week winter/7-week summer breaks in China might also be relevant to ILI incidence reductions among schoolchildren and adults.

Because of that securitization is seen as a concept of the Copenhagen School of International Relations. This school is closely related to the English School, represented by theorists as Barry Buzan (Buzan 2001). For Wæver security is a speech act. “It is by labeling something a security issue that it becomes one” (Wæver 2004, p. 13). Stating that a particular referent object is threatened in its existence claims a right to extraordinary measures to ensure the referent objects survival. The issue is then moved out of the sphere of normal politics into the realm of emergency politics, where it can be dealt with swiftly and without the normal (democratic) rules and regulations of policy making. For the content of security this means that it has no longer any given meaning but that it can be anything a securitizing actor says it is. Security—understood in this way—is a social construction, with the meaning of security dependent on what is done with it (Taureck 2006). “‘Security’ is the move that takes politics beyond the established rules of the game and frames the issue as a special kind of politics or as above politics. Securitization can thus be seen as a more extreme version of politicization. In theory, any public issue can be located on the spectrum ranging from nonpoliticized (…) through politicized (…), to securitized (…). This link between politicization and securitization does not imply that securitization always goes through the state, politicization as well as securitization can be enacted in other for a as well” (Taureck 2006, p. 23–24). Securitization studies aim to understand “who securitizes, on what issues (threats), for whom (referent object), why, with what results, and not least, under what conditions” (Buzan et al. 1998, p. 32). Translated to the dual use issue the main questions are: (a) did a securitization process take place in the life sciences and (b) if so how did it influence the dual use issue?",10.966130110112832,6.279880382985674

First, the database contained only the information of Korean individuals; non-Korean individuals were not included in the analysis. The number of new TB patients among foreigners has increased in recent years, while that of Koreans has tended to decrease, showing an opposite trend.37 Follow-up studies should be performed among foreigners with TB, whose numbers seemed to be on an increase. Secondly, the characteristics (gender and age, among others) of contacts of TB patients were not considered. However, the present study primarily intended to investigate the characteristics of clusters including type of facility and effect of timing after considering the characteristics of the index case; therefore, characteristics of contacts were not a major issue. Since the age of the contacts was a characteristic of the cluster they belonged to, the range was relatively similar and its influence was considered minor. Future studies should be performed with individual units considering the characteristics of contacts. Thirdly, the characteristics of the sub-categories in the congregated settings were not considered in this study. Schools maybe classified into kindergarten, elementary school, middle school, high school, and college; other facilities also have sub-types. In previous studies, the highest number of contact cases in Korean schools was found in high schools. Kindergartens and daycare centers also showed high LTBI rates.6 As for correctional institutions in the United States, prisons where they serve their terms, had a higher treatment completion rate than detention centers that held inmates temporarily.17 Since the details supplied by the facilities were incomplete, the data in the present study did not completely reflect all sub-types of facilities. However, this study had a different goal and those variables were not considered. Further studies are necessary to evaluate individual facilities according to sub-types. Lastly, the jobs among the first index cases in congregated settings were not classified. School populations could be sub-categorized as students and teachers, and medical institutions could be sub-divided into patients and healthcare professionals (doctor and nurse). These characteristics are likely to vary. For instance, the index cases in a study had different types of occupations depending on school type6; in another study, healthcare professionals had a higher risk of LTBI due to contact with patients.13 However, the analysis in the present study was based on various types of facilities. Therefore, they were not sub-divided to ensure consistency in the analysis. In future studies, analysis should be performed by facility type as well as by occupation in individual facilities. Despite these limitations, this study identified the impact of characteristics of the first index case, type of facility, and timing in each cluster on latent TB; the findings of this study are therefore significant.",10.026190882861439,4.845166047492562

Comparing with quarantining at a designated place, the advantage of cordon sanitaire is that it tends to keep the community intact, including its basic resources, businesses, and infrastructure. A method that is the opposite of it is called protective sequestration, which means that unaffected communities separate themselves from the outside until there is no risk of an outbreak. Social distancing is a voluntary, recommended restriction on physical contacts, such as staying at home and avoiding public places and activities. Some less drastic, but quite effective and more frequently used measures of social distancing include canceling mass gatherings, school, and workplace closures, travel restrictions, etc. Wilder-Smith (2020) believed that SARS-CoV has now been eliminated, indicating that we can completely stop this epidemic and interrupt person-to-person transmission. In the absence of vaccines and antivirals, only strict implementation of traditional public health measures made this remarkable achievement possible. In the early stages, isolating patients is particularly effective in interrupting the spread of infectious diseases. Since the infected can spread before he is symptomatic, isolation is often too late to prevent transmission and contain the pandemic. Quarantine is one of the oldest and most effective tools for controlling outbreaks of infectious diseases (Cetron & Landwirth, 2005) , which possibly apply at the individual or group level and usually involves restrictions on houses or designated facilities. Social distancing aims to reduce interactions between people in the wider community, where individuals may be contagious but have not yet been identified and therefore have not been isolated. Social distancing is particularly useful where community transmission is considered to be occurring, but the links between cases are unclear, or where restrictions on the known contacts are not considered sufficient to prevent further spread. Social distancing includes closing schools or office buildings, suspending public markets, and canceling gathering. If these measures are considered inadequate, then a community-wide containment is likely to be required. A community-wide containment is an intervention that applies to an entire community, city, or region, aiming to reduce physical contact between people. Implementing a community-wide containment requires close partnerships and cooperation with law enforcement agencies at the local and state levels, and inspection stations are usually established, and legal penalties may be required if there is a violation.",35.31423849888559,15.973728818295104

However, supportive measures by healthcare providers are important. Social distancing, including school closures, can limit COVID-19 cases. However, the evidence that the potential transmission reduction benefits of mandatory school closures exceed the costs of potentially imposing greater child care obligations on healthcare workers, thereby reducing the healthcare workforce, is not overwhelming. We provide the first explicit analysis of the school closure tradeoff between case reduction and labor force impact on patient survival probability. A 15% decline in the healthcare labor force, combined with reasonable parameters for COVID-19 such as a 15% case reduction from school closings and 2% baseline mortality rate implies that a 15% loss in the healthcare labor force must decrease the survival probability per percent healthcare worker loss by 17.6% for school closures to increase cumulative mortality. This means that the per infection probability of survival cannot increase by more than 2.4%; otherwise, school closures will lead reduce patient survival. Even if the only objective is to save lives, there is still a tradeoff associated with closing schools due to potential losses in healthcare labor force capacity.",35.09955179744486,12.781933111138477

The potential impact and optimal timing of city-wide social distancing interventions to reduce the spread of influenza and other respiratory viruses are largely unknown. Most estimates of social distancing impact are limited to studies of school closures, including both routine holiday closures and reactive closures due to influenza epidemics. School closures may reduce rates of medically-attended influenza in school-aged children, although with highly heterogeneous effects (2% to 29% reductions), and with lesser effects on younger children and adults. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Generalizing to broader social distancing efforts from these studies is difficult, however, as school closures tend to have limited impacts on working-age and older adults, and school-aged children may recongregate outside of schools. 4, [6] [7] [8] In February 2019, unusually high snowfall in western Washington State led to widespread school and workplace closures and to reduced regional travel.

Important for the current debate about the natural history of the disease, this policy would also work if there is a fraction of asymptomatic but infectious individuals in the population. Our results also show that from a practical point of view, a combination of all the analyzed contexts can have second order benefits. As already stressed, containment measures should not only be directed towards a full cutdown of the number of infected cases. Their efficacy is also given by other factors, such as delaying, even if only by a few days, the spreading of the disease. Such delays are always good for preparedness and to have more time for clinical research that can lead to new pharmacological treatments or vaccines. For instance, even if traffic restrictions are not effective on their own, they facilitate the control of the population and thus it would be easier to detect infected individuals and treat them. Similarly, self-protection measures and other social-distancing practices delay the spreading of the disease, freeing resources that would allow for a better management of the epidemic, in turn leading to an increase of the efficacy of individual isolation. Closing public places would, in practice, reduce the transmission, which again will lower the total number of infections and thus make them more manageable for the public health system. This also highlights the importance of having a coordinated response system, since simply adopting central measures like imposing mobility restrictions and closing public places is not effective in the middle-to-long term.",13.037390334130524,9.103518331003606
