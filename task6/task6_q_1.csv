The problem is usually modeled as a two-stage decision-making problem where the first stage decisions select the strategic locations for different facilities and the second stage decisions determine the operations of the network in a short-term horizon. The focus is to balance the trade-off between economic performance and environmental risk related to collection, transportation, treatment and disposal of medical waste [42] . However, when an epidemic disease breaks out, the generation of infectious medical waste as well as the other healthcare hazards may be drastically increased within a very short period due to the exponentially rapid spread of the disease at the initial stage. This leads to a significant challenge for the reverse logistics system of medical waste and puts forward another complex short-term decision-making problem on how to deal with the fast accumulation of medical hazards. In this regard, Figure 1 presents the framework of a reverse logistics system for effective management of medical waste in epidemic outbreak, where, besides the existing facilities, temporary transit centers and temporary treatment centers are established in order to provide sufficient capacity to treat the increased medical waste and to effectively eliminate the infectious virus before disposal.

Nevertheless, a specific transportation mode may be implemented in accordance with practical situations. characteristics, but the color selected, the waste classification and the requirement of maximum storage time in different regions are by no means identical [45] . For example, in Hubei Province, the maximum storage time of the medical waste at hospitals from the COVID-19 patients is 24 hours, while it is 48 hours for other medical waste [46] . The transportation of medical waste usually comprises of two parts, where the first part is to transport the infectious medical waste from hospitals to treatment centers and the second part is to send the residue to landfill [47] . Due to the hazardous nature, medical waste must be properly treated before the final disposal, otherwise it may has a significant environmental impact, i.e., contamination of surface and underground waters [43] . Medical waste can be treated by several methods, i.e., thermal processes, chemical processes, irradiation technologies, biological processes and mechanical processes [48] , among which the incineration of medical waste is the most widely practiced method today [43] . However, the fly ash, SO2 as well as other pollutants from the incineration of medical waste may result in air pollution and an improper location of incineration plant may hence impose a significant risk on nearby residents [49] .

It is also of interest to design a set of experiments which may be less expensive and laborious than those presented here, perhaps using fluorescent or photographic observations of cell cultures rather than virus titrations, and which can identify a fuller set of viral kinetics parameters. We are currently designing competition experiments for the A/Brisbane/59/2007 WT and H275Y mutant strains in which the predictions which follow from the parameters extracted here can be tested directly. When verified, the basic method of analyzing parallel plaque and viral yield experiments introduced here should be useful in other contexts.

As the contacts are undated, the model does not consider that they are only indicative of transmission events if they occur during the infectious period of the infector, potentially resulting in overconfident ancestry assignments if contacts frequently occur outside this time period. However, as epidemiologists generally only record meaningful contacts occurring within likely windows of infection, the assumption that recorded contacts represent epidemiologically plausible transmission pairs appears reasonable. As currently implemented, our model also does not account for different weights between contacts, which could be useful for example to stratify different types of sexual intercourse by their risk of HIV transmission [48] , or TB contacts by their duration of contact (e.g. household vs. casual). However, it could be easily extended to do so by using separate parameters for the reporting coverage (e.g. ε 1 , ε 2 , ε 3 ) and non-infectious contact probability (e.g. λ 1 , λ 2 , λ 3 ) of each type of contact. Furthermore, the contact model is undirected and treats exposure data and contact tracing data equally, resulting in a loss of information about the potential directionality of the infectious interaction which must instead be inferred from other data. Directionality could be incorporated with relative ease by treating reported contacts as asymmetric (individual i contacting individual j is distinct from j contacting i) and relating this to the infector-infectee relationship in the putative transmission tree (I infecting j is distinct from j infecting I). However, the current model generally inferred directionality successfully from temporal data simulated under realistic delay distributions (Fig 1) .",16.58803950574,9.315634586305418

The latter is a much more accurate indicator of the infectious potential of a bioaerosol but is infrequently performed due to poor sensitivity and other technical issues (53) . The development of sampling devices and techniques optimized to preserve pathogen viability would considerably advance the utility of studying bioaerosols for risk assessment and management. For other applications, a more rapid, field-ready point of care test would be useful and would offer remote sampling possibilities. Biosensors have the potential to fill this gap and integration into aerosol sampling devices is under development (26) . Finally, the collection of nucleic acid may be leveraged to obtain more sophisticated information than is available by PCR and Sanger sequencing.

These plasmid-based reverse genetics methods have provided scientists with a unique opportunity to study different aspects of the biology and pathogenesis of these viruses, both in vitro and in vivo, as well as to generate attenuated forms to be used as vaccines [135] . In this review, we discussed the use of reverse genetics for the generation of influenza vaccines with a special focus on LAIVs. In general, LAIVs are highly immunogenic, and immunization usually induces faster and substantially higher levels of both systemic and local mucosal antibody and T-cell responses, providing better protection than their inactivated counterparts. Prevention of influenza virus infection requires seasonal vaccinations, and identification of the correct virus subtype to include in the vaccine leaves little time for vaccine development, scale up and distribution. Although influenza vaccines work well most of the years, if a new viral variant emerges after the strain to be included in the vaccine has been selected, the efficacy of the vaccine would be sub-optimal for this new variant strain. This usually results in decreased efficacy of the vaccine. Reverse genetics approaches have also allowed the development of live-attenuated viruses that could be implemented, in the near future, as LAIVs. These new advances in reverse genetics approaches are reducing the potential time of recovery and production from months to weeks and represent an excellent alternative for the rapid development and implementation of LAIVs for the treatment of both seasonal and potentially pandemic influenza strains.

The main reasons are difficulties in breeding and keeping these species under laboratory conditions. Furthermore, many rodents as well as members of the orders Soricomorpha/Eulipotyphla and Chiroptera are protected species; therefore they are not available in large numbers for animal experiments or for in vivo studies in the laboratory at all.

There is an entire new range of science for the ecology of disease evolution that should be explored. For example, NBAF, the new BSL-4 agricultural facility for large animal research and vaccine/therapeutic development that is currently under construction in the U.S., will bring opportunities for new R&D strategies.

Because NPIs disrupt daily societal functions, it is important that they be implemented judiciously. This requires identifying effective initiating triggers, which is a challenging research task. Implementing NPIs will impede influenza spread; on the other hand, normal societal functions will be interrupted. The optimal control method takes both aspects into account and tries to find the best balance between them, given the decision makers relative weighting of the two. Based on Figures 2 and 3 , early implementation for moderate and severe pandemic is very important for NPIs to have impact on the outbreak and the impact is effective only if NPIs are implemented early. Late NPI implementation might still be optimal, but the impact is much less. For a severe pandemic, it is optimal to trigger NPIs at the beginning stage when susceptible population is large and infectious population is small. If we miss the beginning stage, it is not optimal to implement NPIs until the outbreak is significantly progressed. This is because once the pathogen achieves a certain level of infection, NPIs are not effective against it, and thus are not worth the cost. That is, the benefit of NPIs at a stage when the disease has progressed significantly is less than the cost of NPI implementation. This finding supports the CDC pandemic mitigation guidelines, which state that when the pandemic is Category 4 or 5, all NPIs are recommended for early implementation [7] . Furthermore, earlier NPI implementation reduces and delays the peak of the outbreak as illustrated Figures 3(a) and 3(b), which allows additional time for vaccine development. If a severe pandemic occurs, hospitals will experience an overwhelming influx of patients and need to operate at their surge capacities. Earlier NPI implementation can reduce the magnitude of infectious at the peak, which relieves some of the burden on hospitals and other health care infrastructures. In contrast, NPIs are not nearly as effective if disease has already spread into the community as the cases shown in Figures 3(c) and 3 (d). In both cases, NPIs are triggered after the peak of the outbreak, where hospitals might have already been operating at their surge capacities for a few weeks. Both cases start at states falling on the control thresholds recommended in Figures 2(c) and 2(d) [37] . This finding indicates that the additional complexity of our model is warranted when compared with the SI model used in [37] . Timely and sensitive surveillance systems are key to successful application of the optimal control method as knowledge of both the pathogen characteristics and the community state are assumed. The surveillance systems should be able to identify the virus quickly and provide accurate estimates for parameters which characterize the severity of an influenza. The effectiveness of the control policy depends on the accuracy of these estimates, which include infection rate b, death rate τ and recovery rate g. Once the control policy is computed, we also need to track the community state to determine if NPIs should be triggered. As early NPI implementation is found to be much more effective, we do not want to miss the beginning stage of the outbreak. Thus, the surveillance system should also estimate the community state, including the size of the infectious and susceptible populations.",18.5594098132728,9.256760450865572

This has resulted in large amounts of funding dedicated to socalled ''biodefense'' research, totaling close to $50 billion between 2001 and 2009 [4] . Genomics has benefited greatly from this influx of research dollars and as a result, representatives of most major animal, plant, and human pathogens have been sequenced (http://www.pathogenportal.org/).

According to Figures 2(a) and 2(b) , the NPIs should be triggered at this state. In Figure 3(a) , NPI implementation not only reduces the total death by 62%, but also eliminates the peak of the outbreak. Overall, NPI implementation saves 50% of the average person-days lost. In Figure 3(b) , where a more severe pandemic is considered, the reduction in total deaths is 19% and NPI implementation reduces and delays the peak of outbreak, which allows additional time for vaccine development.",17.77215474049237,8.052476349671634

Because the estimates of parameters governing an outbreak are often correlated, accurate knowledge of one can be used to refine the estimation of the others. For instance, specifying known transmission chains or imported cases will improve the estimation of the mutation rates, as well as the overall reconstruction of the transmission tree. Conversely, fixing the mutation rate to its 'true' value (or a good estimate thereof) is likely to improve the detection of imported cases. As currently implemented, our method allows for fixing any parameter as well as individual ancestries, which are used in the likelihood computations but not changed during the MCMC. This feature should be especially useful for incorporating known transmission events or introductions of the pathogen into the population, based for instance on clinical investigations and contact tracing information. However, results of contact tracing studies should always be considered cautiously, and could be contradicted by the analysis of corresponding sequences, as illustrated by the SARS outbreak in Singapore.",17.050329171997213,7.885769610786106

These data could provide valuable information to public health agencies with regard to planning for future outbreaks and pandemics and assessing risk communication and public education activities. In the current inter-pandemic period, it would also be beneficial to develop and test measures to improve perceptions towards and understanding of NPIs, particularly among potentially vulnerable populations. Ongoing efforts to systematically assess and standardize public education campaigns and risk communications for consistency and effect should also continue, as should the development of culturally and linguistically appropriate materials. This study has several limitations. Translation of some concepts (e.g., pandemic) into migrant languages was sometimes difficult. This difficulty was addressed by working with MCHWs to determine acceptable translations. Because this was a cross-sectional study with data collected at one time point only we were not able to measure potential changes in behaviour resulting from NPI recommendations. As such we are not able to say with certainty that our results are associated with decreased capacity to enact NPIs, though based on the literature presented it seems likely that this would be the case.

Validity may be threatened by our decision to request an individual volunteer from each randomly selected household. Census data is not available for this population, but comparison with socio-demographic data from relevant studies [7, 29] suggests that we obtained a representative sample. We were able to enroll a volunteer from each household that was sampled, but despite attempts to ensure completeness, 28 participants had to be excluded from data analysis due to missing answers.

With the exception of border measures, to which nearly all participants reported they would be adherent, attitudes towards recommended NPIs were generally negative or uncertain: measures to reduce risk that cases transmit infection would be implemented only by a minority; perceptions towards implementing measures to reduce the risk that contacts transmit infection were somewhat better, but still a cause concern; perceived efficacy of social distancing measures was low; and, less than half of participants thought that disinfection measures could reduce the spread of influenza during a pandemic. These results demonstrate the existence of potential barriers to NPI implementation during a pandemic, suggesting that vulnerable migrants in Thailand have a limited capacity to participate in pandemic preparedness efforts. In addition to negative perceptions towards NPIs, we also identified several other barriers: most had never worn a face mask before when sick, so are unlikely to know the correct way to do so if necessary in the future; many reported being unable to monitor their own temperatures, mainly due to not owning a thermometer and not knowing how to use a thermometer; and, most use clean water only for hand washing and disinfection, implying either a lack of knowledge about adequate disinfection or a lack of materials (e.g., soap or disinfectant).",14.759865582306068,5.856513398251542

The question currently asks caretakers 'if their children under age five had been ill in the two weeks preceding the survey with a cough accompanied by short, rapid breathing or difficulty breathing which the mother considered to be chest-related.' If yes, the caretaker is asked if he or she 'sought advice or treatment from a health facility or a provider', which excludes pharmacies, shops and traditional healers. The percentage of children with ARI in the past two weeks who sought care at a health facility or provider is reported by administrative region in the country (e.g., province). As there was no question in the DHS asking about healthcareseeking for adults and since the relative rather than absolute healthcare-seeking by province was more important for the adjustment, we used the same proportion for adults who sought care as for children from the DHS. We also assumed that healthcare-seeking for SARI in a province would be proportional to healthcare-seeking for ARI as defined in the DHS, and applied the ratio of these percentages to further adjust the rate of SARI for each province compared to the base rate province.",20.498182898203904,9.523330404265852

Several organizations such as the Microarray Gene Expression Data (MGED) Society and the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) have established guidelines to aid researchers in the design and implementation of microarray experiments [8, 9, 16] . In general, narrowing the objectives of a microarray study can provide insight into which biological samples should be compared. Clear and concise goals also help define the scope of the study, providing a framework within which subsequent experiments can be proposed and implemented. One of the most commonly sited proposals is the Minimum Information About a Microarray Experiment (MIAME) that includes a series of recommendations and standards on collecting and analyzing microarray data [16, 17] . This document was designed to allow data generated by microarray experiments to be interpreted and reproduced with certainty. In addition, repositories such as the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) created by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and ArrayExpress created by the EBI have been established to store and share gene expression data [16, 17] . array even extending to other experiments as long as the same reference sample is used [16, 17] . However, this setup can become costly if the goals of the experiment require multiple comparisons to be made. In contrast, the saturated design involves making every possible comparison exactly once [17] . This approach is balanced and simple to establish, however, it is not applicable to all conditions and is not appropriate when a series of experiments are planned. Ultimately, the design selected must address the goals and requirements of the experiment being conducted. Without these and other considerations, errors in analysis including the identification of false positives can result, masking underlying patterns and incorrectly deciphering biological behavior.",21.386244421044182,9.003203208936966

Enabling the same person to do large-scale experiments and analysis should result in a better integration between design, experiment, and interpretation -and eventually support the development of new hypotheses. Unfortunately, suitable bioinformatics resources aimed at the nonexpert user are currently scarce, and rarely web-based. In our experience, open source software packages such as Weka [38] are not capable of performing concurrent alignment and motif identification, and are not suited for treating large-scale data sets.

To the best of our knowledge, the optimisation of reference genes has not been performed in such a factorial design so far. Therefore, it is questionable whether the programs possess the capacity to generate a reliable ranking for an experiment designed in a factorial fashion. The gene expression stability analysis of reference genes has been reported in experiments exploring the roles of multiple factors; for example, geographical locations and ventilation in new born lambs [47] , multiple stress conditions and different developmental tissues in pear millet [48] and different developmental stages and hormonal stimuli on leaves of tea [49] . However, multiple factors have not been considered as independent effects in the analysis of stability of reference gene expression or for their interactions. We suggest these programs should add such a capacity or new programs should be available for the analyses of data produced from factorial design experiments.

A conference in Asilomar, California in 1975 (Berg et al., 1975) brought recombinant DNA science and technology to the public's attention and led to the development of guidelines by a new National Institutes of Health Committee, the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, that governs all recombinant DNA work at institutions that receive any federal funds for that purpose. The recombinant DNA guidelines addressed how to conduct experiments using this technology safely and forbid the performance of certain types of experiments.

muSOX could influence the ability of the virus to reactivate from latency,0.4339419311750569,1.895493507385254,2.6743574142456055,807d32e5-b39a-4375-9b7e-2d26d605b119,comm_use_subset/Establishment of Viral Latency,"The first major defect observed in an in vivo MHV68.DHS infection is significantly lower levels of the virus in the lymph nodes at 10 dpi. Following an intranasal infection, wild-type MHV68 undergoes lytic replication in the lung and upper respiratory track, after which the virus drains to the lymph nodes and spleen where a variety of cell types are infected, including macrophages, dendritic cells, and B-cells [37, 50, 51, 52] . A burst of lytic replication occurs at these sites [30, 32] , after which replicating virus is cleared and long-term latency is established. Lower levels of MHV68.DHS in the lymph node could be caused by a cell-type specific role for muSOX-dependent mRNA degradation in viral replication or immune evasion during viral transport to, and maintenance in, the lymphatic tissue. The observation that the EBV muSOX homolog (BGLF5) down-regulates HLA class I molecules and CD8 + T cell recognition in cultured cells may support this model [25] . The means by which the virus traffics to the sites of latency establishment remain unclear, yet it is likely that latently infected B cells carry the virus given that viremia is undetectable during an infection, and latently infected B cells are present in the lung very early after infection [37, 53, 54] . A failure of MHV68.DHS to establish latency in these cells might also cause their selective immune-based eradication and decreased accumulation in the lymph nodes. Alternatively, muSOX could influence the ability of the virus to reactivate from latency, as this process has been linked to efficient latency establishment. Mutations in a number of genes alter the frequency of lytic reactivation and lead to lower levels of latency establishment following an intranasal infection, such as vcyclin (ORF72) [55] , M1 [56] , M2 [57, 58] , and LANA (ORF73) [59, 60] , but unlike muSOX these genes are all expressed during latency as well as during lytic replication [61] . Mutations in the lytic ORF36 gene encoding a protein kinase also lead to defects in latency establishment and reactivation [62, 63] , which have been tracked to the requirement for ORF36 to inhibit the IRF-3 mediated type I interferon response [62] and its modification of the DNA-damage response protein H2AX [63] . Experiments are currently underway to examine MHV68.DHS replication, reactivation, and latency establishment in specific cell types relevant to in vivo infection.",16.729259064132762,8.825643771506526

We enriched our programs by incorporating parallel computation, which can reduce the execution time of our program by increasing the number of threads, depending on the number of sequences. In our program, we implemented two threads as a default parameter. However, the user can manipulate the parameter to single thread or multiple threads. The execution time of our method with two threads is shown in Table 3 . In the Table 3 , the execution time of our method for 50 sequences of coronavirus spike protein is 16 seconds by using two threads, which can be reduced to 7 seconds and 5 seconds by using threads four and six, respectively. In this study, we implemented statistical tools such as CC, RF-distance and ROC [27] [28] [29] curve to compare the result generated by our method with the other alignment-free methods. We performed comparative study between the RF-distance and the CC for each method for the ND5 and ND6 datasets.

Even though camels are quarantined, for 3 days if coming from Sudan and 10-16 days if coming from Ethiopia, the efficiency of clinical detection of RVFV infection is limited by the fact that infections in camels are often unapparent. Besides, about 10% of the camels imported from Sudan and Ethiopia in the last 5 years were tested against RVF by RT-PCR, and were negative (MALRE personal communication). However, the sensitivity of such non-statistically based testing protocol for detecting the infection, if present, is questionable. While the measures currently implemented in camels are likely to reduce some of the risk of RVFV introduction into Egypt, their effect is likely to be limited. Similar conclusions may be drawn from the strategies implemented in cattle with the particularities that all cattle are slaughtered within the quarantine premises, where the risk of RVFV transmission by vectors was estimated to be very low. Therefore, vaccination of imported cattle is unlikely to have a significant effect on the reduction of the risk of RVFV introduction into Egypt.",17.46424761697593,7.448958491779663

The researcher's choice will depend on a number of constraints such sample, resources and time availability (see Table 6 .4). Also depending on the method used the outcomes will vary. In certain occasions, observations will be immeasurable due to crystal cracking, shrinking or dissolving, in others observations will be easy to measure (lattice dimensions, mosaicity and resolution limits) and unfortunately, in others negative results will be the outcome (lack of diffraction, presence of ice rings or non indexable lattices). For these reasons it is advisable to correlate all the different information available and try to make sense of partial data. All the different types of dehydration experiments can be linked via their relation to Relative Humidity. By using available tabulated information (salt dehydration) or measuring empirical humidity (HC1/FMS) researchers can correlate results from different experiments. The idea is to try to extract as much information and try new experiments that may lead to a positive outcome with the available tools. For example, prior to any dehydration attempt, most researchers have already tried standard cryo-cooling, soaks and handled their crystals in a number of ways. Researchers are familiar with crystals stability under the microscope and their methods for soaking in cryo-protectant are useful when planning dehydration protocols either using the HC1/FMS or a vapour diffusion experiment. Similarly, measuring or calculating the equilibrium RH of these solutions can give to the crystallographer clues of why some of the solutions are better than others and suggest new cooling protocols. Often, cryo diffraction data is also available and so a quick comparison with room temperature data collection can possibly yield fruitful clues. Variable indexing in cryo lattices can be an indication of a varied initial crystal population suggesting a variable response to cryo making crystals interesting candidates for dehydration. A review of old crystal forms observed during past experiments (despite not diffracting well) can also give useful clues to plan dehydration experiments. During dehydration, the observation of lattice transitions, minimum lattices and points of loss of diffraction can be used later when defining starting points for cryo-cooling methods. Even dehydration itself can be used as a simple cryo-protecting strategy useful in preventing adverse effects of penetrative cryo-protectant ). Using Relative Humidity as a way of cross-referencing results from the different experiments allows decisions to be made on quantitative measurements and permits experiment planning that will yield easier to compare results.",14.7937464593224,7.384718699994712

Second, PrimerExplorer only runs in Windows operating systems, in a specific web browser. Third, PrimerExplorer cannot design signatures with loop primers, as discussed in Nagamine et al.

Information regarding the identification of local infectious disease outbreaks, such as school absenteeism, emergency room visits, and prescriptions of therapeutic drug against infectious diseases, are also subjects of the survey [2] . Syndromic surveillance can offer a rapid method to detect an outbreak of infection compared with traditional surveillance; such surveillance systems are currently used worldwide [3, 4] .",13.800563385515801,6.365024512658801

Most agencies responsible for setting standards for the care and use of experimental animals require investigators to consider the justification of the experiment and to implement the concept of the 3Rs (Reduction, Replacement and Refinement). The general principle of the 3Rs namely ""Reduction, Replacement and Refinement"" was developed many years ago and has become widely accepted as ethical principles (Balls et al., 1995) . The 3Rs have been defined as ""all procedures which can completely replace the need for animal experiments, reduce the numbers of animals required, or diminish the amount of pain or distress suffered by animals in meeting the essential needs of man and other animals"" (Smythe, 1978) . In general, the 3R measures can be implemented to improve the welfare of animals. The 3Rs also contribute to the quality of research findings through improved study design, reduced variability and increased statistical power. The reader may consult the NORECOPA (Norwegian Consensus Platform for Replacement, Reduction and Refinement of animal experiments) website (http://www.norecopa.no/sider/tekst.asp?side=19) for detailed information on the rationale behind and implementation of the 3Rs. Special guidelines have further been developed to improve the study design, analysis and reporting of research using animals, the so-called ARRIVE guidelines (Kilkenny et al., 2010) . These guidelines are endorsed by an increasing number of scientific journals and may be consulted at the following web URL: (http://www.nc3rs.org.uk/downloaddoc.asp?id=1206&page= 1357&skin=0).

The new research agenda must gather information on household and community perspectives about proposals for the use of their land. These perspectives are key to assessing the cost/benefit of a proposed project. Training local professionals in environmental, agricultural, and health science issues, with a particular focus on granting degrees in a new ""trans""-discipline linking health and the environment, would be emphasized. • Acting as centers of integrated analysis of infectious disease emergence, incorporating perspectives and expertise from a variety of natural, social, and health sciences. Research activities would range from taxonomy of pathogens and vectors to identifying best practices for influencing changes in human behavior to reduce ecosystem and health risks. • Incorporating a ""health impact assessment"" as an important cross-sectorial decisionmaking tool in overall development planning (parallel to an environmental impact assessment), along with the need for doing more research. • Equipping professionals with the ability to recommend policy toward maintaining ecosystem function and promoting sustainable public health for future generations. For example, the link between forest fragmentation and Lyme disease risk could lead to preserving more intact tracts of forest habitat by planning ""cluster"" housing schemes.

First, we scrutinize the TFBS problem. Then we examine the proposed algorithm's performance on standard [24] and present the obtained results in tables and diagrams. A web site is also available, ""lbbwcc.ir"". You can find some information about implemented algorithms and applied datasets on the web. The abovementioned algorithms run 100 times for each dataset with a different size of the motif length. The best, the worst, and the average score values, the elapsed time (based on second), the score values standard deviation, and the elapsed time standard deviation (based on second) are determined. The standard deviation (SD) that is commonly used for algorithms' confidence, is a criterion that shows how much data scattered around the mean. The fewer SD is, the more reliable algorithms are. The algorithms' parameters for the randomly created datasets are shown in Table 2 and the algorithms' parameters for the real datasets in Table 3 . Moreover, the obtained results from both the randomly created datasets and the real datasets are shown in Tables 4 and 5 , respectively. The figures are shown in Tables 4 and 5 indicate that dataset1 size is 10 Â 100, dataset2 size is 20 Â 200, dataset3 size is 30 Â 300, and dataset4 size is 40 Â 400. According to figures, all the real datasets are the same size (in a size 40 Â 60). As we mentioned earlier, the conditions for all algorithms are so similar that they are compared to the same terms and conditions. The end of the predefined numbers of iterations or seasons will bring an end to the algorithms. Figs. 9 and 8 depict Tables 4 and 5 as diagrams with over 100 times of independent execution. The horizontal pivot represents amounts of execution and the vertical pivot represents the fitness values. The best, the worst, the average and the standard deviation which is inserted in Tables 3 and 4, are obtained from over 100 times of independent execution for each algorithm with different motif sizes. Bold values for every group in Tables 3 and 4 indicate the best results compared with the other algorithms. Fig. 8 shows the average stability of algorithms for all randomly created and all real datasets by implementing over 100 times of individual execution. Algorithms' stability which indicates a fluctuation in the current outcome compared with the previous and subsequent outcomes, is one of the main criteria for a comparison between meta-heuristic algorithms. From this point of view, an algorithm whose results are in a straight forward line with maximum fitness values and a minimum undulation is considered as a proper algorithm [25] . The error bars which indicate the validity of the algorithms are represented in Fig. 8 . The above-mentioned criterion determines how similar or different measurements are. The error bars with a minimum height show the suitability of an algorithm as the benchmark that can be used in scientific papers with experimental results shown on graphs [26] . An algorithm's convergence is considered another criterion for a comparison between evolutionary algorithms. When the number of seasons, iterations or generations are augmented or when the allocated time to algorithms is augmented, the heuristic algorithms have to approach an optimal answer. An examination of the above-mentioned algorithms' convergence proved that these algorithms have a proper convergence. Since the number of generations or the number of iterations is not identical for the algorithms, we have to employ the allocated time (or the number of fitness functions callings) to compare different algorithms. The convergence of algorithms for all randomly created datasets as well as all real datasets is depicted in Fig. 9 . In Fig. 9 , the horizontal pivot represents the number of fitness functions callings and the vertical pivot represents the fitness values. Dash lines in Fig. 9 relate to the mean values of algorithms. The algorithms which are at the top of the dash lines are definitely better than the algorithms which are at the bottom of the dash lines.",20.088885276230116,8.665986565797704

Leadership that began as a genuinely shared north-south leadership, not merely tokenism, developed into a cohort of senior and sustained leadership of the south with a consultative expert role for the north. The leadership development model strongly endorsed in the early stages had its problems. The quick turnover of academic leadership such as deans and presidents in Asia, sometimes every 2 years in some countries, made it necessary to build a tier of support. The stature of the early leadership cohort and the support of global leaders of WHO and Stabilizing South-South Academic Collaboration UNICEF, as well as regional and national leaders, maintained the momentum in the first decade. 2. Resources were primarily from 1 source in the north (United States) in the initial stages. Subsequently, multiple funding sources were developed from other north members including Japan and Australia. In the later stages, the emerging south countries in East Asia (S1) and Southeast Asia (S2) assumed the major responsibility for funding through the Regional Center and Centers of Excellence. 3. The era of disasters and pandemics provided rapid exposure to the expertise and creativity of faculty and professionals and capacity of institutions in Asia to respond to these challenges. The ability to respond promptly to local conditions also gave leverage to south partners. The high-tech with high-touch cultural competencies in times of need with humanitarian response served to build credibility and trust, even under politically sensitive conditions among members. The APACPH Collaborating Centers in Injury Prevention and Disaster Management, Oral Cancer Prevention, Rural and Island Health, and Peace and Health brought together the expertise and commitment to address issues of common concern with resources largely coming from the lead university in the south and collaborating partners and donors from the north.

However, the mechanism by which MERS-CoV infects humans remains unclear. To date, there is no effective vaccine or antibody for human immunity and treatment, other than the safety and tolerability of the fully human polyclonal Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody (SAB-301) as a putative therapeutic agent specific for MERS. Although rapid diagnostic and public health measures are currently being implemented, new cases of MERS-CoV infection are still being reported. Therefore, various effective measures should be taken to prevent the serious impact of similar epidemics in the future. Further investigation of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of the virus, as well as the development of effective therapeutic and prophylactic anti-MERS-CoV infections, is necessary. For this purpose, detailed information on MERS-CoV proteins is needed. In this review, we describe the major structural and nonstructural proteins of MERS-CoV and summarize different potential strategies for limiting the outbreak of MERS-CoV.

From 1986 to 1999, almost every year, medical centers and regional hospitals grew over 10% in their volumes of ambulatory patients and physician fees, whereas community hospitals were around 8% [4] . It will harm the quality of patient care eventually if hospitals continuously increase their volume without improving their numbers of physicians, and necessary equipments and plants. On January 1, 2001, therefore, BNHI implemented a volume control policy to contain costs and to improve the quality of ambulatory care for regional hospitals and medical centers. By means of such control policy, referrals of some trivial severity of illness patients from medical centers or regional hospitals to the community hospitals are expected. A good referral system will assist medical centers and regional hospitals to take more care of the intensive or acute patients, which is one of their important social missions. Additionally, the referral system has an advantage of changing patient behavior by not squeezing them into medical centers or regional hospitals just for minor dis-eases. Although the policy is for regional hospitals and medical centers, it is recognized that this policy may have influence on both hospitals and physicians since most of the physicians are employees of hospitals in Taiwan.",16.005747585683498,6.065261043326359

These revolutionary changes are changing the face of academia and science in the United States, and they will have a profound impact on the future of science.

Meanwhile, the nation's biomedical research infrastructure is stressed, and support is diminished for animal facility renovation or construction-especially for rodents and nonhuman primates-at a time when animal-related research has increased significantly.

Other studies have focused on immunocompetent patients, which make former results less applicable in tertiary care centers with a large proportion of immunocompromised patients. Furthermore, with our non-randomized design in which the implementation of the rapid diagnostics for respiratory viruses during the second season was not 100%, we provide a truthful reflection of daily practice. Our study also has several limitations. First, given the before-after design of the study, outcomes can be biased due to residual confounders. However, we thoroughly adjusted our analyses for differences at baseline using a liberal p-value to select confounding factors and differences in viral pathogens for certain clinical outcomes. We thereby reduced the effect of confounders more thoroughly than former before-after studies on rapid molecular testing [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] 41] . Second, differences between the two seasons might also have been affected by trends in time not resulting from the diagnostic intervention per se. Adjustment for any possible trends in time with an interrupted time series analysis would have been appropriate. However, due to the short timeframe in this study and a limited number of patients per time point, this analysis was not feasible [44] . Also, we tried to maximize the potential effect of rapid testing by accompanying the implementation of this assay with specific instructions for the ED, by which we limited the possibility to distinguish the effect of the instructions and the rapid test as a sole intervention.

Researchers may additionally study, and thus select for, resistant microbes in order to demonstrate the activity of an antimicrobial, to confirm the mechanism of an antimicrobial, and to discover the functions of microbial proteins.

Increased tumbling of the molecule results in stronger peak intensities, whereas increased exchange rate lowers the intensities. When the temperature is raised, both the tumbling rate and exchange rates increase. Residues that are involved in hydrogen bonding, e.g., secondary structure formation, usually have slower exchange rates and are less prone to lose intensity when the temperature is raised. Thus, a plot of peak intensities versus temperature provides a qualitative view of the (un)folding process under equilibrium conditions. Such a plot for the RBD is shown in Fig. 6 for the b-sheet residues. The residues comprising the b-sheet fall into three categories: Q59 (numbered according to the full length of NP), which shows extreme loss of intensity even at moderate temperatures; T58 and Y110, which lose intensity at an intermediate rate; and the rest, which lose intensity only at higher temperatures. Our results suggest that the b 1 strand, which includes T58 and Q59, has a lower thermal stability compared to the other strands in the b-sheet. Thus, the strand b 1 likely unfolds first and folds last in the (un)folding process. The fact that most residues exhibit a transition at approximately the same temperature implies a high degree of cooperativity of the (un)folding process. Another way to analyze secondary structures is through the use of secondary shifts, which is defined as the difference between the observed chemical shift and the average random-coil chemical shift. This approach requires tripleresonance NMR experiments. We opted to observe only the carbonyl shifts because it employs a highly sensitive experiment and is sensitive to both the aand b-structures. Positive values imply a-propensity, whereas negative values imply b-propensity. We carried out this experiment at three different temperatures with the results summarized in Fig. 6 . Attempts to conduct the experiments at higher temperature were not feasible due to low signal/noise ratio.",16.370751966211248,9.077531661799119

Experiment 1 had the greatest number of DIA calves (68%), and the majority were classified as DIA within the first 5 d after arrival. These calves were estimated to be slightly older (but still under 1 wk of age) than those in the other experiments, due to their origin. As well, these calves had been transported the furthest (5 h transport time and 470 km) and were purchased from a dealer who had collected calves from multiple farms and commingled the calves before transport to our research facility. The calves from the other experiments originated from a single local farm, and research personnel selected them for inclusion in each experiment within 2 to 3 d of birth based on initial total protein and visual health assessment. Those calves were transported only 30 min and 38 km to the research facility. The proportion of calves classified as DIA in these experiments was much lower than in experiment 1, ranging from 11.1 to 27.3%. In general, we found lower incidences of DIA classification on the initial day after arrival in experiments 2, 3, and 4, but over the course of the 21 d incidence increased from d 10 to 15. Although the protocols for care were similar among experiments, the incidence, timing, and duration of diarrheic episodes in calves varied. The stressors (comingling, transportation) that calves in experiment 1 faced were likely greater than those in the other experiments, and may have impaired calves' ability to cope as well with enteric challenge (Davis and Drackley, 1998) .

Nonetheless, transfers between hospitals are common. In recent data from an allpayer multicenter cohort of critically ill patients, 6 .4% of patients in the ICU were admitted directly from another acute care hospital. 23 However, little is known about how and why these transfers occur or whether patients systematically move toward sites that provide better care. Patient transfers between two hospitals are known to be generally safe. 24 -26 The current system of interhospital critical care transfers is informal, but it is not random. Most hospitals transfer to only a subset of other nearby hospitals. Network analysis provides an approach for examining and improving these patterns and testing whether they achieve the same goals as formal regionalization.

In the case of HIV-1, this viewpoint has led to the claim that ''rational design represents the only approach that can elevate vaccine research from an empirical exercise to a scientific discipline'' [27] . It is argued here that such a view which denigrates the time-honoured empirical, trial-and-error approach that gave us all our present day effective vaccines is highly misleading and could even possibly jeopardize future efforts at developing an HIV-1 vaccine [107, 109] . It is not always clear what scientists mean when they refer to rational design and it may be helpful to briefly analyze these terms. The label rational tends to be used to describe any approach that relies on the probable outcome of an intervention as predicted from available scientific knowledge. The term rational is also used to describe common sense decisions such as focusing on known antigenic regions of a viral protein as primary targets for a vaccine [203] . Since all scientific work is based on reason, logic and currently accepted scientific theories, it makes little sense to oppose rational and empirical approaches since all scientific knowledge is derived from empirical observations made in the course of experiments that are necessarily planned and analyzed in a rational manner. It is therefore misleading to imply that trial-and-error experimentation is not rational since all novel findings and discoveries arise from the unpredictable outcome of controlled experiments rather than from purely rational, deductive thinking [107] . The term design can be defined as the deliberate and intelligent conceiving of an artificial object or process. The designer's task is to pose and solve an inverse problem, namely to imagine on the basis of existing knowledge what would bring about a desired outcome [204] .

However, as many emerging viruses have at least the theoretical potential to be bioweaponized, research on such viruses has profited from governmental investment in biodefense over the last 10 years. While this is controversial [113] , and clearly has directed funding away from areas that have a more obvious medical need in the here-and-now, there is no denying that huge strides have been made in understanding what were previously under-researched pathogens. Thus, the outlook over the next 5 years for new antiviral therapies targeting emerging viruses is exciting. In particular, in vivo efficacy studies are being initiated for many of the lead compounds identified over the last few years. In the United States, the latest round of funding for the regional centers of excellence for biodefense and emerging infectious diseases is rapidly approaching and it may be that much of the money invested in this area will begin to dissipate, with a more focused approach replacing the somewhat haphazard, unselective attitude to funding over the last 10 years. However, this should not dissuade investigators with novel ideas for screening drug targets or promising antivirals from applying for funding. More research in particular is warranted for the less popular viruses such as Lassa and chikungunya viruses that have been relatively neglected, but actually infect large numbers of individuals every year, in favor of viruses that grab the public imagination, but are unlikely to ever be a threat -terrorist, or otherwise.",21.179282095898344,9.057541534706159

The study was conducted using a number of bio-simulations with three different experimental groups of migrating waterfowl. The three flocks were chosen based on their close proximity to known primary sites of disease outbreaks (Rao et al. 2009 ). The initial infection in each experimental group was varied for analysis. Figure 8 .6 illustrates one of the trans-Atlantic transmission pathways to the continental US. We observed that the spread was determined by migratory pathways and timelines of different species of waterfowl rather than initial infection percentages (Rao et al. 2009 ). One of the interesting observations is that our experiments correctly predicted an outbreak in the UK (WHO 2006c). The graph in Fig. 8 .7 presents the impact of avian influenza outbreaks on poultry population in the continental US. Decrease in poultry population corresponds to H5N1 induced death and culling of birds to control the disease. Increase in poultry The data was recorded after the model was calibrated population reflects regeneration of poultry flocks after an outbreak. As illustrated by the graph, infections in poultry also follow a cyclic pattern that correlate with annual migration of waterfowl. The mortality figures can be translated to corresponding dollar figures for financial analysis.

With early enteric disease, malabsorption of these vital nutrients occurs thus leading to skeletal deformities. Lameness may have contributed to a decrease in BW due to the inability of lame poults to reach up to the feeders or waterers properly.

This explanation is seldom considered by microbiologists, who seem to have ruled it out on the basis of historical reports from the 1950s and 1960s, which concluded that chilling does not bring on vARIs [53] [54] [55] [56] . However, there is now so much clear evidence that chilling does increase vARIs that we need to look more closely at those historical experiments. I suggest above that they were flawed because they generally used ''pedigree"" viral strains which were passed by the investigators from volunteers to subsequent batches of volunteers in later experiments. Obviously the investigators would have thought carefully about the choice of strains that they used; they certainly didn't want to put the volunteers at risk, so mild strains needed to be selected. However they naturally wanted their experiments to fit into the time available -for example Andrewes worked with volunteers who each stayed at his unit for 10 days, and his experiments did not start until the volunteers had been in quarantine for three days. The incubation period of the strain that he used was most frequently two to three days. By selecting such a strain he and his colleagues may have eliminated the virus's natural temperature sensitivity during the early stages of infection (temperature sensitivity that is predicted by M4) -a flaw in the design of his experiments with potentially far-reaching implications.",20.905205725100338,9.928464900914175

Even in academic research labs, the downstream cost of testing individual biological constructs for function is often far more expensive than the costs of the synthetic constructs themselves. Thus, reduction in gene synthesis costs will not tremendously affect the throughput and scale of current experimental workflows. However, the types of experiments conducted might also significantly change. One data point to consider occurred a decade ago when microarrays were first leveraged for cheap oligo pools. Although initial reports used these pools as plug-in replacements for column-synthesized oligos, researchers quickly adapted to this increased synthetic capacity, using powerful bioinformatics tools to design large libraries of synthetic oligos and NGS-based multiplexed assays to measure their functional consequences simultaneously. This has recently led to many fruitful experiments at scales that only a few years ago would have been unimaginable for an individual investigator. Likewise, cheap gene synthesis will likely change how we use synthetic genes through the development of powerful design tools for libraries of genes, pathways and genomes as well as cheap, multiplexed assays to measure or select for their function. Such new experimental paradigms could engender far greater use of synthetic genes than is currently imagined today.

Increased tumbling of the molecule results in stronger peak intensities, whereas increased exchange rate lowers the intensities. When the temperature is raised, both the tumbling rate and exchange rates increase. Residues that are involved in hydrogen bonding, e.g., secondary structure formation, usually have slower exchange rates and are less prone to lose intensity when the temperature is raised. Thus, a plot of peak intensities versus temperature provides a qualitative view of the (un)folding process under equilibrium conditions. Such a plot for the RBD is shown in Fig. 6 for the b-sheet residues. The residues comprising the b-sheet fall into three categories: Q59 (numbered according to the full length of NP), which shows extreme loss of intensity even at moderate temperatures; T58 and Y110, which lose intensity at an intermediate rate; and the rest, which lose intensity only at higher temperatures. Our results suggest that the b 1 strand, which includes T58 and Q59, has a lower thermal stability compared to the other strands in the b-sheet. Thus, the strand b 1 likely unfolds first and folds last in the (un)folding process. The fact that most residues exhibit a transition at approximately the same temperature implies a high degree of cooperativity of the (un)folding process. Another way to analyze secondary structures is through the use of secondary shifts, which is defined as the difference between the observed chemical shift and the average random-coil chemical shift. This approach requires tripleresonance NMR experiments. We opted to observe only the carbonyl shifts because it employs a highly sensitive experiment and is sensitive to both the aand b-structures. Positive values imply a-propensity, whereas negative values imply b-propensity. We carried out this experiment at three different temperatures with the results summarized in Fig. 6 .

This hypothesis was tested by analyzing lesions obtained from macaques infected with Mtb [41] .

Two of these putative ''escapees,'' the viral ORF M1 (an RNAPII transcript) and the viral tRNA-like gene vtRNA1 (an RNAPIII transcript), exhibit enhanced steady-state expression during WT relative to DHS infection, perhaps due to increased transcription (Abernathy et al., 2014) . To test whether muSOX-induced transcriptional feedback was responsible for their increased abundance during WT infection, we first confirmed that the M1 and vtRNA1 half-lives were not altered during a WT versus DHS infection ( Figure 6A ). We then evaluated whether the transcriptional enhancement of these viral genes during WT MHV68 infection was linked to Xrn1 activity using the HEK293T cells expressing dox-inducible Xrn1-targeting shRNAs. Upon Xrn1 knockdown, M1 expression was significantly reduced during WT but not DHS MHV68 infection, and its expression was restored upon introduction of exogenous WT Xrn1 ( Figure 6B ). The requirement for Xrn1 appeared specific for RNAPII-driven transcription, as its depletion had no significant impact on expression of the RNAPIII-transcribed vtRNA1 ( Figure 6C ). RNAPII ChIP experiments confirmed that the reduction in M1 mRNA in the absence of Xrn1 was due to transcriptional repression ( Figure 6D ). We also observed reduced RNAPII occupancy upon Xrn1 depletion at ORF54, an MHV68 gene that is susceptible to cleavage by muSOX (Abernathy et al., 2014) , indicating that the role of Xrn1 in promoting viral transcription is not limited to transcripts that escape degradation ( Figure 6D ). In each of these experiments, the requirement for Xrn1 was only observed during WT infection and not during infection with the DHS virus. We did not detect any binding of Xrn1 to viral promoters by ChIP (data not shown), suggesting that it likely indirectly impacts viral transcription in cells undergoing enhanced mRNA decay. Finally, depletion of the Ccr4 deadenylase did not alter M1 transcription during a WT or DHS infection, in agreement with its dispensability for the repression of cellular transcription when depleted in isolation ( Figure 6E ). Collectively, these data demonstrate that in contrast to its role in transcriptional repression of many cellular genes, Xrn1 activity during muSOX-induced cytoplasmic mRNA decay is required for robust transcription of viral genes.",15.619462626534398,7.6509980500491395

SAPN design usually begins with an initial computer design that calculates the expected molecular mass, diameter, and symmetry in advance. In the past few years, other factors that impact design complexity, such as the rotational and translational degree of freedoms (Marsh et al., 2013) and different competing assembly states with similar stabilities (Fleishman and Baker, 2012; Ramisch et al., 2015) , have been also calculated computationally. However, some deviations from the predicted models have been reported (Brunette et al., 2015) . By taking advantage of molecular modeling and simulation programs, various α-helices and oligomerization domains have been combined to design novel selfassembling nanoparticles (Sanner et al., 2005) . Moreover, point mutations within the oligomerization domains and adjacent to the linker, or within the linker, and their impacts on the assembly can be investigated with these programs (Ardejani and Orner, 2015) .

In the PCR, the 3 0 ends of primers must anneal to templates to be elongated by a DNA polymerase. A high GCC content at the 3 0 end of a primer may obviate the need for complete complementarity and annealing of the remainder of the primer sequence, thus diminishing the specificity of the priming reaction [1] . A low GCC content at a primer's 3 0 end may, due to weak annealing, increase the importance of complete annealing of the remainder of the primer sequence [2] . On the other hand, such primers may not be elongated efficiently by DNA polymerase [1] . Although the importance of the 3 0 end triplet in primer design is recognized, many recommendations for 3 0 end triplet selection, based mostly on theory, have been put forth, and some contradict others. Recommended compositions of 3 0 ends are: no T at the 3 0 end and at least one W (A or T) in the 3 0 end triplets [3] ; S (C or G) at the 3 0 end and no GC or CG, due to potential formation of hairpins and primer-dimers [4] ; low GCC [2, 5] ; one or two S [6] .

Intellectual drivers for these experiments have, in many cases, been the virologists. This development will likely prevail over the coming decade as more and more of the traditionally specialized resource intensive experiments such as mammalian or baculoviral expression systems, automated high-throughput crystallization and the use of international and local synchrotron sources have been streamlined and implemented for widespread laboratory use. Examples like miniaturized and automated crystallization and imaging systems as well as next generation crystallization geometries have demonstrated how new technologies can accelerate discovery on challenging targets. The next wave of these technology developments is now being driven by new roadblocks in the quest for high content structural biology on challenging targets such as viral proteins and their host partners.",15.009391697461528,6.467308314914795

Fourteen percent of the fruit bats collected from several zoos in the western portion of Japan were positive for YOKV antibodies. These positive sera against YOKV were also tested using an ELISA with the JEV antigen. All samples were negative. Given that Leschenault's rousette bats have been bred in each zoo, and reared separately in openair cages, it seems likely that these antibody positive bats had been exposed to YOKV at the zoos themselves.

Although some of these manually classified virus sequences contain classification errors (Eom et al. 2004 ), we used the data with Table 1 , we provide the number and the length (the minimum, average ± 1 standard deviation and maximum length) of each type of the genomic data used in our experiments. In analyzing data in an experiment, we first decided on a length of oligos to use by calculating the smallest integer value l such that 4 l became larger than or equal to the average of the lengths of target and non-target sequences of the experiment. Then, 4 l candidate oligos were generated to fingerprint and binarize the data. If the length of oligos turned out to be not long enough during the pattern generation stage (see Remark 2), the data binarization stage was repeated with the value of l incremented by 1 and this process was repeated until the binary representations of the data became contradiction free. Next, procedure SC-pg was applied to generate patterns, hence, probes. In applying procedure SC-pg in these in silico experiments, we did not consider any oligo picking criterion that is non-theoretical in nature (refer to Remark 4) and selected a minimal set of oligo probes with using c j = 1 for all j ∈ N . For solving the unicost (SC-pg • i )'s generated, we used for ease of implementation the textbook heuristic procedure (e.g., Nemhauser and Wolsey 1988 ) that selects one variable at a time by the rule",14.588352844585062,6.971704927994985

Therefore, a partial reduction in tipDC recruitment was undertaken to lessen inflammation but retain the recruitment of beneficial antigen-specific CD8 + T cells. Initial experiments used varying doses of MCP-1 neutralising antibodies and MCP-1 ) ⁄ ) mice to reduce tipDC recruitment via the MCP-1 ligand CCR2, but neither of these approaches had any effect. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-c (PPAR-c) agonist pioglitazone, already a licensed drug for type II diabetes, has multiple pharmacologic actions including reducing MCP-1 (monocyte chemotactic protein-1 or CCL2), TNF-a and iNOS levels. Pioglitazone pre-treatment of mice given A ⁄ PR8 virus reduced morbidity and mortality significantly without affecting viral replication. Protection was found to be correlated with reduced MCP-1 and MCP-3 production and fewer numbers of tipDCs in the lungs after infection. The fact that viral replication was not altered with pioglitazone and yet mortality improved in some experiments suggests mechanisms other than viral clearance might be operative, perhaps the amount of damage caused by CD8 cells, the rate of injury repair or alterations in other cell types within the infiltrating inflammatory population. Interestingly, an early increase in lung neutrophils was observed in pioglitazone-treated mice, whereas some earlier studies have correlated increased neutrophil numbers with worse disease in 1918 virus-infected mice. 63 Another action of pioglitazone is to alter mitochondrial membrane potential, which might lead to other intracellular inflammatory pathways and apoptosis that may enhance inflammation in some circumstances, potential effects that should be explored future experiments. However, pioglitazone has also been observed to enhance mitochondrial biogenesis without altering membrane potential in neurons. 82 Initial studies suggest that another PPAR-c agonist drug, rosiglitazone, may offer superior effects to pioglitazone in the mouse influenza model. Further experiments are currently ongoing to address whether such agonists are therapeutically effective and to examine the effects of PPAR-c treatment combined with antiviral drugs. In aggregate, the results indicated that increased numbers of tipDCs correlate positively with pathology and mortality but that antigen presentation by tipDCs in the lung is necessary for optimal antigen-specific CD8 + T-cell responses in mice. Modulating tipDC trafficking by a PPAR-c agonist can protect from lethal influenza challenge in mice, and such drugs offer a possible therapeutic intervention for study in severe influenza disease in humans. In this regard, epidemiological studies of populations that take regular PPAR-c treatment to assess incidence of severe influenza and other inflammatory diseases would be of interest.",15.12325653352945,7.106974114194642

A part of this coordinated target selection management is the focus on biomedically relevant protein structures. In addition to the four production centers, six technology development centers have been created to continue the development of innovative technologies for the more challenging problems including studies on membrane proteins, large protein assemblies, and the more difficult eukaryotic proteins. deposition of solved structures in the PDB. Both single crystal X-ray diffraction and solution NMR structural determination approaches were used. Only distinct target sequences are taken into account for each center and in the total count (hence numbers of ""distinct"" targets reported for centers where sequences are duplicated or missing in XML files may be lower than those reported by the centers; note also that the number of targets in the total count may be less than the sum of targets for the centers due to target overlaps). HT pipelines employed a manufacturing style approach in that responsibilities were compartmentalized by function and processes were standardized through the use of quality assurance practices such as standard operating procedures (SOP). Whenever possible, common quality control practices were employed to monitor processes and materials from beginning to end. Data was uploaded to a common database to facilitate target management, process monitoring, and regular reporting.

Objective We offer a systematic analysis of NASBA design with a view toward expanding its applicability. Methods We examine the parameters that effect dimer formations, and we provide a framework for designing NASBA primers that will reduce false-positive results and make NASBA suitable for more POC diagnostic applications. Then we compare three different oligonucleotide sets to examine (1) the inhibitory effect of dimer formations, (2) false positives with poorly designed primers, and (3) the effect of beacon target location during real-time NASBA. The required T7 promoter sequence adversely affects the reaction kinetics, although the common abridged sequence can improve kinetics without sacrificing accuracy. Results We demonstrate that poorly designed primers undergo real-time exponential amplification in the absence of target RNA, resulting in false positives with a time to half of the peak value (t 1/2 ) of 50 min compared to 45 min for true positives. Redesigning the oligonucleotides to avoid inhibitory dimers eliminated false positives and reduced the true positive t 1/2 by 10 min.

Knight-Jones et al. (2016) have given a detailed account of global FMD research update along with gaps and an overview of global status and research needs. The conclusions are drawn to highlight that currently available vaccines and control tools have enabled FMD eradication from many countries of the developed world. However, in many developing countries, FMD remains uncontrolled. The main reason given is that biosecurity measures that have been fundamental to successful FMD control in the developed country are difficult to be implemented effectively in developing countries due to obvious reasons. In the present scenario, improved vaccines, with longer lasting protection against a wider range of FMDV strains and lower production costs, could be the single most important development to enhance our ability to control FMD. Although encouraging progress has been made with several novel vaccine candidates, addressing key limitations of the current inactivated vaccines, a commercial vaccine is yet awaited. While new discoveries are crucial, current vaccines have been used to effectively control FMD on numerous occasions. However, for imparting better immunity, FMD vaccines should be subjected to adequate quality assurance and be made available in sufficient quantity to provide desired coverage following appropriate strategy. There is also a need for better training and support in the design and execution of vaccine-based FMD control programmes. Another area of research is genetic and molecular studies on the virus to elucidate host-virus interactions. More powerful tools and analyses are increasing our understanding of various aspects of FMDV evolution, ecology and epidemiology. This, in turn, should benefit many areas of FMD research, from basic virology to the vaccine and diagnostic development. Furthermore, improved genetic technologies have the potential to reveal information crucial for control, such as transmission chains, vaccine match and level of virus circulation.",16.24682408314408,7.7385521432708835

If NPI support can be influenced through introduction to certain measures, then it may be possible to expose populations to NPIs in advance of an emergency. The exposure of populations to face masks prior to an outbreak is a particularly intriguing option, since they are inexpensive and easy to distribute. While the effectiveness of face-mask usage is currently under debate (MacIntyre et al., 2009; Cowling et al., 2010; Tracht, Del Valle, and Hyman, 2010) , their usefulness may go beyond their direct role in disease prevention and instead be a way to increase population compliance with other NPIs, such as quarantine. The effectiveness discussion is largely scientific; however, an individual may perceive an experience of face-mask usage as 'positive' with a much more simple perspective. This could happen when he/she does not become ill or does not make the family ill when wearing the mask, or simply when he/she finds the wearing of the mask to be non-burdensome. If face masks were shown to be completely ineffective or harmful in the future, though, this could lead to a negative gateway experience, potentially reducing future compliance. In much the same way as hand sanitizers came to be widely accepted before H1N1, the correct usage of pre-pandemic exposures to public health interventions may create a more public health aware and savvy population.",15.563733493326954,6.961661812924939

An important consideration in real or mock-up studies is the safety of researchers and the public exposed to such tracers, which must be carefully assessed. While some tracer gases (CO 2 , N 2 O) have health implications at high concentrations, the ability to conduct experiments with live micro-organisms is generally much more challenging. Although some early studies dispersed bacteria in occupied indoor environments and outdoors as part of biological warfare programmes, modern work is restricted to specialist facilities or studies sampling the background microflora in an environment. 102e104,119e123 Since all of these full scale experiments are within a real or mock-up hospital environment, they provide some of the closest tests to reality that can be done. Such set-ups allow the possibility of obtaining measurements in environments that are perturbed by people and activities, rather than the idealised spaces inherent in CFD or physical analogue models. 103, 122, 123 However, the techniques are not without their challenges. Many require extensive and costly equipment and realistic measurements can only be made at a limited number of points. They are also time consuming, with the need to reduce the tracer to background levels prior to the next experiment. It is therefore important that this is considered in the experimental design and acknowledged in analysing the results and final conclusions. Carrying out such experimental studies in conjunction with CFD simulations can offer a greater insight, enabling the validation of the modelling approach and the evaluation of aspects of the airflow that cannot be captured by the experiments alone.",20.246558647858663,9.123275154359785

The trigger points discussed by the universities for contacting the local health department would be the university's student health service experiencing 3 or more temporally related cases (would notify university hospital emergency department and critical events office) or 5 or more cases in the same day (would notify local health department and critical events office), noting that the university would rely on the local health department to contact any state and/or federal agencies. Stakeholders discussed the variability in state reporting requirements and their impact on the investigation.

Most cells are home made and adapted to the particular needs of the experiments conducted. Among the most important factors is how liquids are mixed in the cell. In some designs a flow system is included but it is very hard to avoid dead (unstirred) volumes and there is always an unstirred layer close to the surface under test. Molecules always must diffuse over this layer. Magnetic stirring is often used and has the advantage that the same liquid is in the cell all the time compared to a in flow system.

Opioid dependence is common in HIV clinics and there is a need to find alternative, effective and safe medications for HIV-infected opioid-dependent patients. The HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein, gp120 (HIV-gp120) is implicated in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders associated with HIV and interferes with opioid system. The goal is to examine and compare the chronic effectiveness of the most common clinically used medications for opioid dependence (methadone and buprenorphine) in presence of HIV-gp120 in the brain. First we monitored rat weight during 4, 7 or 14 day induction periods with buprenorphine (0.5, 1.5 or 3 mg/kg) as well as during subsequent ""withdrawal"" periods in the absence and presence of HIV-gp120 in the brain. Parallel experiments with methadone (5 or 10 mg/kg) afforded positive control data. Male S.D. rats (175-200 g) were weighed and injected s.c. at 10 AM daily with buprenorphine, methadone or saline as indicated above. The mean weight of rats receiving buprenorphine during induction did not differ significantly from that of control (saline) animals. Sudden, weight loss (on day 5 of ""withdrawal"") was associated with only the 3 mg/kg -14 day buprenorphine dosing schedule. The infusion of HIV-gp120 into the brain did not precipitate or alter weight loss during the spontaneous withdrawal period after the buprenorphine cessation. Rats on 5-10 mg/kg methadone for 7 days show a significant body weight lost on day 1 of ""withdrawal"" and during the treatment period (even in the absence of HIV-gp120 in the brain). Based on these data it appears that in the presence of HIV-gp120 in the brain, the chronic use of buprenorphine for opioid dependence has advantages over methadone.

This is also empirically evident by the remarkable speed at which RNAi techniques have been implemented in scientific research, and the number of successful RNAi-based experiments already published. It is speculated that this advantage is derived from the fact that RNAi is an innate biological response, and hence represents a more natural strategy for manipulating gene expression.

For most early-stage discovery programs, the following experiments are performed to answer the question: Is this hit likely inhibiting the screening target as an aggregate? If the answer is yes, it is unlikely that the hit will be a favorable starting point for lead design and it should be dropped from further consideration immediately, as the pain of throwing out compounds early in the process pales in comparison to the agony of abandoning leads that have been through several nonproductive development cycles. If the answer to the above question is no, then one element of the hit's potential has been reassuringly established.

In addition, we have shown that these reactions can be readily run without the need for extraneous heating or visualization equipment. In particular, the rapid mechanical disruption of infected leaf tissue into a reaction-ready lysate buffer eliminates the need for any nucleic acid isolation. While in these experiments the lysate was snap-frozen, they could equally be used for immediate analysis in the field. The ability of our methodology to selectively detect genomic sequences from CMV and PVY highlight the ability of the growing methodologies and design principles within RNA synthetic biology 18 to contribute to real world applications. Further modifications to sample preparation will undoubtedly be needed to simplify the user interface still further while improving the sensitivity of detection of lower replicating and genetically more diverse virus species.

U.S. Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the air change rate of a negative pressure isolation ward to be over 6 air change per hour (ACH) and the pressure difference to be over 2.5 Pa. However, pathogens could spread out to other areas under the abnormal conditions such as malfunctions of facilities or door opening unexpectedly. When the pressure difference of an isolation ward is unstable under abnormal conditions, it is necessary that the amount of polluted air leakage from the isolation ward is measured and the countermeasures are prepared. In this study, the tracer gas experiments were performed to measure the air leakage under abnormal conditions.

Under those conditions, the reaction was quite fast, reaching a plateau approximately after 10 min (Fig. 3, panels A and B) . For a quantitative comparison of the enzymatic activity of the ts and the wt Pro39, we lowered the rate of the reaction by decreasing the amount of enzyme in the samples. At a Pro39:Trx34 molar ratio of 1:32 the reaction proceeded linearly for a period of up to 10 min (Fig. 3C) , allowing accurate determination of the reaction rate. Thus, these conditions were used to compare the activity of the dif-ferent proteases at both the permissive and restrictive temperatures. For this, Pro39 was preincubated in buffer for 2 min in the absence of Trx34 in order to avoid any possible contribution of the substrate on the stability of the enzyme. Upon substrate addition, samples were withdrawn at time points 1, 2 and 5 min, and analyzed. We found the activity of the wt and mutant Pro39 to be practically identical when the reaction was performed at 28°C.

Third, there is the paucity of BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories available to use for the animal challenge experiments, as well as the experts to conduct the experiments. Fourth, there are the unanswered regulatory questions of what will be required in order to license a vaccine for human use. And finally, the potential market for a developed product must be considered. Who will be the consumer and how will they pay for the costs of the vaccine and its development?

In fact, that has been the goal of the BioWatch Generation 3 (Gen-3) program.

Two of these putative ''escapees,'' the viral ORF M1 (an RNAPII transcript) and the viral tRNA-like gene vtRNA1 (an RNAPIII transcript), exhibit enhanced steady-state expression during WT relative to DHS infection, perhaps due to increased transcription (Abernathy et al., 2014) . To test whether muSOX-induced transcriptional feedback was responsible for their increased abundance during WT infection, we first confirmed that the M1 and vtRNA1 half-lives were not altered during a WT versus DHS infection ( Figure 6A ). We then evaluated whether the transcriptional enhancement of these viral genes during WT MHV68 infection was linked to Xrn1 activity using the HEK293T cells expressing dox-inducible Xrn1-targeting shRNAs. Upon Xrn1 knockdown, M1 expression was significantly reduced during WT but not DHS MHV68 infection, and its expression was restored upon introduction of exogenous WT Xrn1 ( Figure 6B ). The requirement for Xrn1 appeared specific for RNAPII-driven transcription, as its depletion had no significant impact on expression of the RNAPIII-transcribed vtRNA1 ( Figure 6C ). RNAPII ChIP experiments confirmed that the reduction in M1 mRNA in the absence of Xrn1 was due to transcriptional repression ( Figure 6D ). We also observed reduced RNAPII occupancy upon Xrn1 depletion at ORF54, an MHV68 gene that is susceptible to cleavage by muSOX (Abernathy et al., 2014) , indicating that the role of Xrn1 in promoting viral transcription is not limited to transcripts that escape degradation ( Figure 6D ). In each of these experiments, the requirement for Xrn1 was only observed during WT infection and not during infection with the DHS virus. We did not detect any binding of Xrn1 to viral promoters by ChIP (data not shown), suggesting that it likely indirectly impacts viral transcription in cells undergoing enhanced mRNA decay. Finally, depletion of the Ccr4 deadenylase did not alter M1 transcription during a WT or DHS infection, in agreement with its dispensability for the repression of cellular transcription when depleted in isolation ( Figure 6E ). Collectively, these data demonstrate that in contrast to its role in transcriptional repression of many cellular genes, Xrn1 activity during muSOX-induced cytoplasmic mRNA decay is required for robust transcription of viral genes.",16.920644986478685,8.10641187602964

Since the biocontainment operations that directly involve the live pathogen are most difficult, time-consuming, and restrictive, it is reasonable to design a program that allows the majority of operations to be performed at the lowest required biocontainment level. Operations that can be done at lower biocontainment typically include all noninfectious steps, such as cell and reagent preparation, compound library manipulations, and data analysis. Steps that require high biocontainment include any direct work with the pathogen, such as assay preparation, assay incubation, and data acquisition. This requires the pairing of at least two dedicated laboratories for the global HTS effort. The first laboratory should be a BSL-2 laboratory for preparation of the reagents, cells, and needed assay materials, as well as compound manipulation and plating.

For example, priming the innate immune system with recombinant IFN-a prior to VSV administration reduced replication but significantly increased the threshold of virus toxicity in immunocompetent rats [174] . This strategy could potentially allow the use higher virus doses in humans than currently possible. A related strategy, the administration of low-dose virus before the actual therapeutic dose is currently being implemented in a number of clinical trials to minimize virally elicited immune-dependent toxicity [182] . However, adverse events may occur despite apparent tolerance to repeated virus dosing, as evidenced by a severe systemic inflammatory reaction that developed in a patient after the fourth dose of the dl1520 adenovirus via the hepatic artery in a clinical trial to treat liver-metastasizing gastrointestinal carcinoma [92] . Moreover, in addition to suppressing or desensitizing the immune system, viruses can be made less immunogenic. One strategy has been to mask viruses by polymer-coating. For adenoviruses, this method has enabled the simultaneous enhancement of targeting specificity and evasion of neutralizing antibody [257] . Another strategy involves the encapsulation of viruses in non-immunogenic liposomes, a technique currently employed in phase I/ II studies to target glioblastoma multiforme with SFV replicons [261] .

When the sequence identity is between 15% and 30%, conventional alignment methods are not sufficiently reliable and only sophisticated, profile-based methods are capable of recognizing homology and predicting fold. For regions of low sequence identity, threading methods [15] are often applied. Protein models that are built on such low sequence identities can be used for the assignment of protein function and for the direction of mutagenesis experiments ( Figure 2 ). Models that have a sequence identity between ~30% and 50% could facilitate the structure-based prediction of target drugability, the design of mutagenesis experiments and the design of in vitro test assays ( Figure 2 ). If sequence identity is greater than ~50%, the resulting models are frequently of sufficient quality to be used in the prediction of detailed protein-ligand interactions, such as structure-based drug design and prediction of the preferred sites of metabolism of small molecules ( Figure 2 ).",17.777004946447907,8.45258500795774

Using design of experiments, Bollin et al. (2011) optimized the yields of an antibody resorting to transient gene expression and found that the DNA concentration can be maintained at relatively low concentrations (1 mg/L range). Indeed, envisaging functional expression of a MP in the plasma membrane, the ratio of plasmid DNA added per reaction can be a crucial factor (particularly if a strong promoter is used), once too much plasmid can lead to intracellular accumulation of the protein and potentially misfolded (Andréll and Tate 2013) .

More recently, imaging has been used primarily for examining the strength of the association between an infectious agent and a disease by testing for its presence at the site of pathology [22] [23] [24] . Although rapid protocols for electron microscopy exist that allow the visualization of viruses in a few hours, they require substantial operator expertise and a high agent concentration. Immunohistochemical assays can be pursued using serum from either the affected individual or one with a similar disease, or with antibodies generated in animal models inoculated with the virus candidate or immunized with viral proteins [25] . Where serum is already available these approaches can be implemented rapidly; however, with truly novel agents the delay required to create immunological reagents is typically measured in weeks to months. An alternative is to pursue in situ hybridization.

Supported projects tended to be transnational, by convenience or necessity, even though transnationality did not become an eligibility criterion in its own right until 1985. The joining of forces by participants from different Member States and internal coordination are the most innovative and important factors differentiating research supported by the EU from that supported by other agencies or by the Member States. By rendering this condition compulsory, subsequent programmes made possible not only the mere working together but also to the planning among potential participants of their scientific future together. Transnational scientific and technological cooperation is widely considered by scientific and industrial communities and by European and international funding bodies to make a very positive contribution to maximising the socio-economic impact of research [33] . To this end, the early biotechnology programmes developed a networking approach, called European Laboratories Without Walls (ELWWS), which linked together individual researchers from different laboratories and different countries to carry out multidisciplinary precompetitive research projects. The ELWW approach emphasised a free and rapid flow of information and material between participants, and incorporated joint planning and evaluation of experiments.

CypA is not amenable to more stringent and rapid regeneration conditions (data not shown). Furthermore, CsA is a hydrophobic molecule with limited solubility in aqueous solutions and has a tendency to adhere to tubing and tips at concentrations greater than 1.2 lM. Ethanol (2%) was used in experimental running buffers to help alleviate solubility problems. Ethanol was used in preference to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) because this binds weakly to CypA [31] . The 60-min total regeneration time between experiments helped to eliminate any carryover of CsA [32] .

The following points suggest that the human situation is unusual. First, all of the changes mentioned above are specific to the human lineage, with the other hominids studied showing no differences amongst each other. Second, comparisons of the Siglecs of mice and rats show few differences [86] , despite the fact that these two species shared a common ancestor long before humans and chimpanzees did. Third, studies of the gene and protein sequences of the sialic acid binding Ig-like V-set domains of CD33-related Siglecs of multiple species show evidence of more rapid evolution in humans (with the sequences of the adjacent Ig C2-set domains providing good controls) [11] . Finally, we can construct an evolutionary scenario potentially connecting some of these changes to each other (see Fig. 1) [10] . Regardless, we must keep an open mind to the possibility that some of the human-specific changes in sialic acid biology are actually unrelated events, which happened to occur in a system that is intrinsically prone to rapid evolution. In this regard, it would be best to conduct a more detailed study of sialic acid biology in all the other hominids.

Two of these putative ''escapees,'' the viral ORF M1 (an RNAPII transcript) and the viral tRNA-like gene vtRNA1 (an RNAPIII transcript), exhibit enhanced steady-state expression during WT relative to DHS infection, perhaps due to increased transcription (Abernathy et al., 2014) . To test whether muSOX-induced transcriptional feedback was responsible for their increased abundance during WT infection, we first confirmed that the M1 and vtRNA1 half-lives were not altered during a WT versus DHS infection ( Figure 6A ). We then evaluated whether the transcriptional enhancement of these viral genes during WT MHV68 infection was linked to Xrn1 activity using the HEK293T cells expressing dox-inducible Xrn1-targeting shRNAs. Upon Xrn1 knockdown, M1 expression was significantly reduced during WT but not DHS MHV68 infection, and its expression was restored upon introduction of exogenous WT Xrn1 ( Figure 6B ). The requirement for Xrn1 appeared specific for RNAPII-driven transcription, as its depletion had no significant impact on expression of the RNAPIII-transcribed vtRNA1 ( Figure 6C ). RNAPII ChIP experiments confirmed that the reduction in M1 mRNA in the absence of Xrn1 was due to transcriptional repression ( Figure 6D ). We also observed reduced RNAPII occupancy upon Xrn1 depletion at ORF54, an MHV68 gene that is susceptible to cleavage by muSOX (Abernathy et al., 2014) , indicating that the role of Xrn1 in promoting viral transcription is not limited to transcripts that escape degradation ( Figure 6D ). In each of these experiments, the requirement for Xrn1 was only observed during WT infection and not during infection with the DHS virus. We did not detect any binding of Xrn1 to viral promoters by ChIP (data not shown), suggesting that it likely indirectly impacts viral transcription in cells undergoing enhanced mRNA decay. Finally, depletion of the Ccr4 deadenylase did not alter M1 transcription during a WT or DHS infection, in agreement with its dispensability for the repression of cellular transcription when depleted in isolation ( Figure 6E ). Collectively, these data demonstrate that in contrast to its role in transcriptional repression of many cellular genes, Xrn1 activity during muSOX-induced cytoplasmic mRNA decay is required for robust transcription of viral genes.",16.26763998946619,7.877860127075266

To that end, current spillover surveillance efforts could be leveraged. For example, plans could be made to process and share currently collected virus samples with multidisciplinary teams for longitudinal genomic analyses.

In these animal studies the compound was administered parenterally and over a prolonged time period. In contrast, clinical trials indicated rapid clearing of parasites thereby limiting treatment to few days only. This difference in treatment duration between intramuscular animal studies and the clinical situation greatly impedes risk assessment based on such data. Using a short administration period to compare both clinical and pathologic effects and the pharmacokinetics of oral and intramuscular routes of administration is considered a better basis for extrapolation to man, and for estimating a safety margin for neurotoxic effects of AM when used as intended in clinical trials. Therefore, in the present experiments treatment was limited to 8 days which is closer to the maximum 5 day treatment intended for humans, but long enough for neural lesions to develop (BREWER et al. 1994a) .

To the best of our knowledge, US-supported experiments to examine changes in transmission of avian influenza viruses have largely stopped. The Fouchier lab did publish a follow-up report to their original Science manuscript in which they narrowed down the exact mutations that enabled transmission in the ferret model, but based on the publication date, it appears that this work was completed prior to the moratorium [19] . In the MERS-CoV field, the development of a small animal model that faithfully reproduces human transmission and disease has been slowed significantly by the moratorium. MERS-CoV uses the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) protein as a receptor, and the human and murine proteins differ enough such that the virus cannot use the mouse molecule. Transgenic mice that express human DPP4 ubiquitously experience a broader set of symptoms than do humans when infected with wild-type MERS-CoV [20] [21] [22] [23] . This problem was recently overcome by developing a transgenic mouse expressing a mutant DPP4 in which two key amino acids were mutated from the mouse allele to the human allele. However, the authors still needed to passage the virus through these transgenic mice to derive a GOF variant that recapitulated human disease [24] . This GOF virus was subsequently used to show the efficacy of a promising nucleotide prodrug, originally initially developed for Ebola virus, for treating MERS [25] . Continuing efforts to produce a mouse-adapted MERS-CoV in wild-type mice have been prohibited [26; R. Baric, personal communication].",16.67053662916255,7.199288007746947

It is used to propose the next sets of experiments and, most importantly, to derive better understanding of biological processes. As stated, the number of pathogen sequence data in public databases is increasing rapidly, however, experimental approaches to study this large data pool for the development of immune interventions are time-consuming, costly and almost impractical. Through combination of bioinformatics and experimental approaches, it is possible to select key experiments and help optimize experimental design. Computer algorithms are increasingly used to speed-up the process of knowledge discovery by helping to identify critical experiments for testing hypothesis built upon the result of computational screening.

To be useful, the reference must contain detectable levels of all genes expressed in samples co-hybridized with it, therefore the reference is often a pooled sample of all experimental conditions. This design often makes the assumption that the effect of dye bias is equal across all comparisons with the reference (Maindonald et al. 2003) as the reference is generally labeled with the same dye on each array. Therefore any gene-specific dye bias not removed by normalization will affect all arrays in a similar fashion (Simon and Dobbin 2003) . One reason for using this design is when there is hmited availability of RNA from one or all of the samples. The orientation of dye labeling is applied in the same direction so that samples for comparison are always labeled with the same dye and the reference is always labeled with the same dye (Churchill 2002) . For spotted arrays, this design uses an aliquot of common reference RNA as one of the samples co-hybridized to each array so that comparisons between the reference and sample of interest can occur on the same spot (Simon and Dobbin 2003) . In the opinion of Maindonald et al. (2003) a direct pair-wise comparison for two treatments should be more precise than indirect comparison of all treatments through a reference. Similarly, Churchill (2002) argues that use of a reference sample is tmnecessary and results in inefficient experiments as half of the gene-expression measurements are made on the reference sample which is generally of no interest to the researcher.

Two-colour microarrays are analogous to matched pairs experiments -by co-hybridizing samples we control for many array and hybridization specific variables. To achieve similar power, one-colour arrays must be technically more stable and reproducible. With Affymetrix, the production methods and robotic control of hybridization ensures that this is generally the case (Irizarry et al. 2005) . In general two-colour competitive hybridization is good for small-scale experiments, but as the scale increases, one faces problems in choosing which pairs of samples to co-hybridize, shifting the balance towards one-colour systems. Also if hybridizations are to be conducted over long time scales then one-colour systems may be more appropriate than using a two-colour system with a common reference design (discussed later).",17.60678744304182,8.359300169307

After within-slide normalization, all normalized log-ratios will be centered around zero, regardless of the normalization method i.e. whether lowess or non-linear, however it is useful to examine boxplots displaying the spread of log-ratios for individual arrays to determine if scaling is required between arrays (Smyth et al. 2003) . Failing to perform scale-normalization could lead to one or more slides having undue weight when averaging log-ratios across experiments to an average of log-ratios across slides. One common method of scale normalization is to divide each intensity by the total of the intensities on the slide, so that all slides then have the same total intensity.

The effectiveness of treatment processes for virus reduction has mostly been assessed by use of indicator viruses such as MNV (murine norovirus), FCV and phages. In order to conduct a quantitative viral risk assessment, it is important to fi rst know which decontamination practices are used in food production, whilst acknowledging that lab experiments may produce different outcomes to standard virus reduction due to current practices in the fi eld. Secondly, process-specifi c infectivity rates for each virus, or an appropriate surrogate thereof, should ideally be included in the study. Unfortunately, the lack of cell culture systems for certain viruses, including NoV and HEV, have hampered such studies in the past. Alternative approaches, such as the use of animal models (Feagins et al., 2008 ) or cell infection experiments (Emerson et al., 2005 ) have been developed for HEV. The results of both experiments indicated that HEV was still viable when heated at 56 ° C for an hour.

Six different pin-onflat sliding experiments were conducted under two dry conditions and four wet conditions (distilled water), respectively.

An assessment scheme based on a hierarchy of building performance indicators concerning the quality of: (a) architectural design, (b) building services design, (c) the surrounding environment, (d) operations and maintenance, and (e) management approaches was developed. One hundred forty (140) apartment buildings were surveyed and assessed through site inspections, desk searches, and interviews. A performance analysis was conducted to examine and compare the overall health and safety performance of the buildings. We found that there were considerable variations in health and safety conditions across buildings, even though they are located within a single district.

Clearly, these methods are being pushed to their limits and continued development is required that will ultimately enable individual laboratories and large international teams to tackle viral proteomes of both, emerging and re-emerging diseases.

A significant advancement of what was accomplished over the past two years through the biology-guided approach, which demonstrated that many of these methods and instrumentation had reached a level of maturity so that they could be applied rapidly to new problems.

The SIRT1 band in the MT2 precipitate was less prominent, probably due to the smaller amount of Tax recovered (Fig. 5B, compare lane 3 to lanes 4 and  5) .

This difference reflects the much slower growth rate of eukaryotic cells and, in part, the complexity of virus replication in compartmentalized cells. Biochemical analysis of virus replication in eukaryotic cells has also been used to analyze the levels of virus and cellular protein and nucleic acid synthesis and to examine the intracellular events occurring during synchronized infections (Figure 4 .4).

Proponents and opponents of GOF work engaged in extensive discussion about the value, safety, ethics, and validity of this type of research. The debate was initially catalyzed by research experiments published in 2012, which reported that serial passage in ferrets rendered variants of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 transmissible in a mammalian species (1, 2). These experiments were performed, in part, because there was debate in the field as to whether H5N1 could become transmissible in humans. The result was accompanied by publication of the specific mutations associated with this new function, which was essentially a “species jump” to mammalian transmission. Although influenza virus has historically demonstrated the capacity to move across species, in this particular experiment, the GOF was the acquisition of mammalian transmissibility for a virus that previously lacked it. The debate over this type of experimentation (i.e., that which changes the transmissibility of an influenza virus to include a mammalian species) resulted in a temporary moratorium on GOF experiments involving HPAIV, followed by continuation of the work with additional biosafety precautions and regulations (3, 4). There followed a period of relative quiescence as the new status quo established itself. However, several papers describing similar experiments with other influenza virus strains have subsequently been published (5–7), along with accompanying editorials that explain the decision for publication (8, 9). In recent months the controversy over GOF experiments has been rekindled by reports of the generation of new viruses that are similar to the 1918 strain (6) and further fueled by two laboratory accidents at the Centers for Disease Control that heightened concern about accidental escape of laboratory strains with pandemic potential. With this backdrop, GOF experiments have been severely criticized in the general media, and 18 individuals, including both authors of this editorial, signed a statement of concern involving influenza virus GOF experiments (http://www.cambridgeworkinggroup.org/). The essence of this statement from the Cambridge Working Group (CWG) was a call for curtailment of such experiments, during which time there could be a risk-benefit analysis of future work and the convening of a conference to discuss the many issues involved in this developing situation. The CWG statement has been criticized, but there appears to be some agreement on the need for an Asilomar-type conference to explore the many issues involved in GOF experiments (http://www.twiv.tv/2014/07/20/twiv-294/). Most recently, a group called Scientists for Science posted its own statement emphasizing the importance of research on potentially dangerous pathogens and also calling for a conference to discuss the issues (http://www.scientistsforscience.org/). We note that both statements share many points of agreement, which provides a promising base for constructive dialog. In the past, mBio has provided a forum for discussion and debate on the merits of this work. Here we take up the pen (or keyboard) to highlight some issues pertinent to the ongoing debate and promote further discussion, our major goal in signing the CWG statement.

Much of the debate involving the H5N1 experiments which demonstrated the “gain” of ferret transmissibility focused on the publication of the specific mutations that conferred this property. However, the major scientific finding was the observation that this virus had the biological capacity to be transmitted between mammals after alterations in a few amino acids. In fact, this finding is of great value to humanity, because it suggested that a human H5N1 pandemic might be able to occur if and when similar mutations occurred spontaneously, as is characteristic of influenza viruses, along with conditions favorable for bird-to-mammal transmission. In another set of GOF experiments, the HPAIV H7N1 was shown to be capable of mammalian transmission due to mutations that did not change receptor specificity (5). As a result of these experiments humanity has much more knowledge and stands warned of the potential perils these viruses pose. This information emerged from GOF experiments. In fact, it is difficult to imagine another mechanism for obtaining the information that has been gained from GOF-type experiments, particularly because it is only through experiments that can control the expression of given determinants that proof can be obtained. Since proof of the germ theory, modern scientific proof generally requires the use of approaches that attribute a given property to a given determinant. Hence, GOF-type experiments are of particular epistemological value because they directly imply causality. Apart from informing on the potential for virulence and transmissibility, GOF experiments are powerful tools for dissecting questions concerning viral pathogenesis. For example, H5N1 mutational analysis showed that the efficiency of viral replication in avian and mammalian cells is dependent on hemagglutinin polymorphisms that facilitate activation at lower pH (7, 8). This finding could be exploited to increase the yield of virus during preparation of vaccine stocks. Furthermore, the identification of sequence changes associated with GOF could in theory lead to the identification of new antiviral targets, thus providing a potential societal benefit. The power of GOF experiments is that they are a highly efficient, reliable, and effective tool that can identify certain phenotypes that often cannot be identified by using other scientific approaches. Hence, we feel that there is ample evidence that GOF experiments can provide important information and are useful tools for investigation of influenza virus-related questions. In fact, we believe that the crux of the debate surrounding GOF experiments is not their value but their potential risk.",15.12776810193467,7.602853686536776

This could not be definitively proven without doing the PPP experiment to manufacture a potentially pandemic variant of H5N1 (24). While it is now undeniable that ferret-transmissible mutants of influenza A/H5N1 can be created experimentally, the impact on scientific opinion about the risk of a pandemic from H5N1 has been hard to gauge. Prior to the gain-of-function experiments, there was a wide range of expert opinion on the likelihood of an H5N1 pandemic (25). Some influenza experts questioned whether H5N1 was a major pandemic threat. After the publication of the experiments producing potentially pandemic H5N1, one prominent member of this group, Peter Palese, noted the shortcomings of the ferret model for humans and correctly concluded that the question of whether H5N1 can transmit efficiently in people remains unsettled (11), as it must until the phenomenon is directly observed in nature. From a practical perspective, responsible policy makers and public health leaders should have been planning for the possibility of an H5N1 pandemic before PPP experiments on H5N1 were undertaken. In some countries of the world, they were stockpiling vaccines against H5N1 (26, 27) and making plans for nonpharmaceutical (8) interventions in the event of a pandemic. The same remains true after the experiments. We have observed no discernible influence of the H5N1 PPP experiments on H5N1 policy preparations.",19.438552843528573,7.503247299739871

Here it was shown that the real-time PCR method was adequate as compared with the ddPCR method, which is considered a more reliable method for accurate quantification [32]. Nonetheless, real-time PCR is prone to interlaboratory differences, and utilization of ddPCR for quantification has been suggested to circumvent this problem, facilitating direct comparison of results between centers [33, 34]. Digital droplet PCR depends on partitioning of each master mix followed by end point PCR. Quantitation is determined using Poisson statistics to generate a result that is not dependent on a relation to a standard curve and should therefore exhibit lower variability between laboratories. However, the ddPCR assays still depend on amplification of a specific target sequence, and depending on the design of the primer and probe, the targeted sequence can vary. Recent work has shown that viral DNA in plasma samples is to a large extent free and not associated with viral particles and is also subjected to various degrees of degradation, influencing the results, depending on the amplicon length determined by the PCR-assay design [35]. Thus, standardization of the entire assay including primer and probe design, use of international standards, and assessment of the commutability of reference material is needed before a direct comparison of interlaboratory results can be made with absolute confidence, even with the use of ddPCR [36, 37].",14.911072342339006,8.204375178674853

Unlike other surveillance approaches, behavioral surveillance does not need to be frequently implemented, since behavior is notoriously resistant to change. To be effective as a prevention tool, behavioral surveillance should be a key component in a comprehensive infectious disease monitoring approach, implemented with high-risk populations in settings at increased risk of zoonotic transmission.2 Should an outbreak occur, a database that documents the social dynamics and behaviors essential to understanding transmission, as well as potential barriers and opportunities for intervention, could contribute to a rapid and feasible disease control and mitigation strategy. In addition, in order to facilitate impact evaluation, it is essential to conduct behavioral surveillance prior to the implementation of any policy or strategic intervention meant to prevent zoonotic disease spillover or outbreaks from occurring.

For future understanding of functions, it will be important to design experiments which can segregate helicases which serve direct, although perhaps overlapping and redundant, roles on HIV-1 from those that might participate indirectly in the viral life cycle.

This unique feature makes ORMA completely different from all the other available software for probe design in detection experiments. During the past years, academic software for species detection have been developed. ProDesign (13) is a tool based on a ‘spaced seed algorithm’ for the determination of probes capable of discriminating multiple pathogenic species, at different hierarchical levels. Similarly, YODA (14) performs design tasks on complete genomes against non-target species. TOFI-beta (15) implements a suffix-tree-based algorithm for isolating suitable candidate probes from a target genome and filters the list according to thermodynamical and specificity requirements. These three software are implemented for the design of probes for hybridization-based detection assays.

Notably, genetic disruption or antibody blockade of alternative pathway activation or CR3 function significantly inhibited TNF-α secretion from human or murine leukocytes after exposure to group B Streptococcus (41). Experiments that examine the relationship between CNS viral entry and cytokine profiles after WNV infection in complement-sufficient and -deficient mice may elucidate the molecular basis for this stage in pathogenesis.",9.308233873861422,6.521638339644756

The reported incidence of syphilis was over 60 per 100 000 in last 10 years, which was much higher than the national incidence.5 10 Consistent with the aforementioned characteristics of varied age groups, a rapid increase in syphilis incidence among older adults was observed in Shenzhen.11 Studies usually considered blood donors as a representative of the general population and used the prevalence data of blood donors for real-time surveillance and identification of high-risk groups.12 Whether the syphilis seroprevalence among blood donors agrees with reported incidence characteristics remains to be studied. Shenzhen launched a comprehensive programme, the Shenzhen Programme for Syphilis Prevention and Control (SPSPC), in November 2013 to enhance syphilis screening among blood donors and five other subgroups (HIV voluntary counsellors, methadone maintenance treatment users, female sex workers, men who have sex with men and women of childbearing age), as well as case management, including diagnosis, treatment and follow-up, for syphilis-infected adults.13 Based on the data from the SPSPC, this study aimed to examine differences in syphilis seroprevalence among blood donors and describe the distribution of serological titres among syphilis-infected donors with respect to age groups, to confirm the syphilis epidemic characteristics in southern China and support the design of effective interventions for older adults.",8.615500291801151,5.900064484492768

Analysis of non-denatured gel confirmed that both RNA constructs adopt a major conformation (Figure 3A). However, distinct gel mobility of these two RNAs suggested that they might have different conformations. The enzymatic probing data are shown and summarized in Figure 3B–E. We used DU177 RNA as the standard for comparison because its NMR structure is well defined (33). For both DU177 and CCC/GU RNAs, the distributions of cleavage patterns by ribonuclease T2, the probe for single-stranded region, are in agreement with the formation of the two loop regions. In addition, the distributions of cleavage patterns by RNase V1, the probe for duplex and stacked conformations, can be localized to the two predicted stem regions for both RNAs. Specifically, both RNAs possess signature V1 cleavage for the quasi-continuous helical region corresponding to the 3′-portion of stem 1 and the 5′-portion of stem 2 (Figure 3B,D). Therefore, these probing data indicate that CCC/GU RNA also adopts a pseudoknot conformation and suggest that the other mutants containing more base triples should also adopt the pseudoknot conformations. In the related UV-melting and single-molecule mechanical unfolding experiments for DU177 and CCC/GU RNAs, transitions corresponding to the melting or mechanical unfolding of stems 1 and 2 were also observed and are consistent with the probing data (33,38). In addition, an extra transition corresponding to the disruption of tertiary interaction network was also reported in single-molecule unfolding studies and can only be observed in DU177 RNA (38). Taken together with the mutagenesis studies above, the results of these experiments suggest that DU177 RNA can be converted into a −1 PRF-incompetent pseudoknot by disruption of the triplex structure spanning the helical junction.

Our objective is to measure this direct benefit; specifically, how much these policies slowed the growth rate of infections.

We aimed for breadth of species and social trait, prioritizing studies with several mixing frequencies (as opposed to a single 50:50 mix). We identified 39 studies that included experiments matching our criteria. We sought raw data from journal websites, public data archives, or directly from study authors. We reformatted datasets to 80 express each experiment's initial and final states as the number or density of individuals belonging to each strain, the proportion of individuals belonging to a strain, and/or the total number of individuals-whatever most closely matched the measured quantities. So that our results would not be overly dominated by a few studies with many mix experiments, we included a maximum 12 datasets per study, prioritizing those with most replication and covering the observed range of 85 interactions.

We test how useful different theoretical approaches are for analyzing experimental data from social interactions 60 among microbes. As a basis for comparison, we focus on a common experimental design we call a ""mix experiment"" which measures how microbial genotypes affect the performance of interacting individuals (Fig. 1A) . We analyze datasets from published mix experiments using the canonical formulations of kin and multilevel selection theory and use quantitative measures of statistical performance to assess what these approaches do well, where they run into problems, and how often these problems occur. For guidance on how theory might better handle the challenges of microbial data, we also identify analytical practices in empirical research that are robust across different microbial systems, provide insight into the causes of selection, and allow quantitative comparison of social selection across systems. A quantitative, data-driven approach can thus be a productive way forward to identify how theory can best aid our understanding of social evolution in all branches 70 of life.",11.395256511075003,5.235879677629416
