In these countries, some to a greater extent than others, many policies and strategies have been established and implemented to facilitate progress toward UHC. For example, in Thailand, since 2002, the political commitment to universal access to healthcare was emphasized in the National Health Security Act that states that 'Thai population shall be entitled to a health service with such standards and efficiency'. In Indonesia, in 2004, the Presidential Bill No. 40/2004 on National Social Security System to protect Indonesian citizens from catastrophic household expenditure due to illness and death was enacted. In Cambodia, in 2005, a Master Plan for SHI was adopted, signifying an essential first step toward establishing a unified health protection system. In Vietnam, in 2012, the Prime Minister approved the Master Plan on UHC with a roadmap to achieve universal health insurance (UHI) coverage levels of 70% by 2015 and 80% by 2020, and to reduce OOP payment to 40% by 2020. In Myanmar, in 2012, the Government has endorsed the goal of achieving UHC by 2030 with aims to improve the health status of the poor and vulnerable, especially women and children. In the Philippines, in 2013, the president amended the National Health Insurance Act of 1995 by signing Republic Act 10606 which mandates the government to shoulder the premiums for the insurance of the indigent and informal sectors thus benefiting many Filipinos. Singapore recently announced the expansion of MediShield, a health insurance scheme designed to avert catastrophic OOP expendi-ture, which currently covers 93% of the population. The expanded program would be named MediShield Life. It will be mandatory with 100% population coverage and a stated aim of reducing co-insurance levels from the current 10Á20% to 3Á10% (9) . In Malaysia, the shape of UHC continues to be debated, with discussions currently centered on whether the country should transition to a SHI model, 1Care, which would allow the insured to access private facilities. Civil society and trade unions have expressed concerns that 1Care will subsidize private providers at the expense of the public, and discussions have since stalled (10, 11) . Furthermore, during the 11th ASEAN Health Ministers Meeting hosted by the Thailand Ministry of Public Health in 2012, a joint statement emphasizing five main health topics, including Building UHC, was signed (12) . Whilst there does appear to be a political commitment expressed for UHC, in reality it is difficult for policymakers to balance competing interests of the growing for-profit private sector (in most countries) and the moral imperative to ensure equal access to healthcare.",35.43058959587627,15.025548692350334

(2) The period over which individuals are resampled must exceed that of the infectious period (and therefore the infectious period must be known). (3) The host's lifetime must far exceed the infectious period. (4) Pathogen must be detectable without lethal sampling. It is our contention that, if these conditions are met, it should be possible to distinguish among scenarios. In a population with waning immunity and cyclical reinfection, the probability that a given individual becomes infected is expected to be equal to the prevalence of infection among other individuals of similar age and the same sex. Therefore, past infection status is not expected to predict present infection status. In contrast, if individuals are persistently infected but shed episodically, the prevalence of infection among previously positive individuals will be higher than among the population, and past infection increases the likelihood of positive infection status (Table 1) . However, large sample sizes and intermediate levels of prevalence probably are required to distinguish cyclical reinfection from persistent infections, and alternative explanations for patterns of prevalence may be difficult to reject. For example, the individuals most likely to be exposed may appear to be persistently infected.

Mitigation objective In Stage I, the level of risk must be perceived to be acceptable by decision-makers. The ideal risk would be zero, but in its absence an acceptable level of risk is generally defined as a situation for which no special intervention activities need to be directed at the pathogen [7] . The acceptable status may be a historically free status, freedom from disease, freedom from infection, or contamination of food products maintained below a defined threshold. Policy makers also may be aware of certain endemic pathogens, but categorise them as low priority and therefore do not tackle them. In short, the Stage I mitigation objective is to sustain the acceptable status. Additionally, compliance with international regulations to document disease freedom may facilitate access to foreign markets. B. Surveillance and intervention Surveillance information is used to document that a pathogen is not present or only in less than a specified proportion of the population, that an endemic status remains stable and to give an early warning signal if the situation is altered. Even though intervention measures are generally not needed in this stage, they are anticipated to combat a pathogen quickly when it occurs and are usually laid down in national contingency plans or equivalent regulations. If surveillance gives an alarm, response interventions will be implemented to contain the disease and prevent further spread (e.g. outbreak control). In such cases, the free status may be (temporarily) suspended until response activities effectively contain the disease.

PiCV infections are spread worldwide due to the specificity of pigeon breeding [3] like, e.g., inability to follow biosecurity procedures, especially in the case of racing birds. These birds usually take part in pigeon races or shows where hundreds or thousands of birds originating from different geographic areas have direct or indirect (watering during transport) contact with each other. For this reason, the spreading of infectious diseases in pigeons is rapid and they are affected by numerous pathogens [2, 4] . The prevalence of PiCV is determined by age and health status, and affects about 70% of the global pigeon population on average [5] [6] [7] .

This study found that three or more different employment models coexisted in the HIAs in 2012. This may be due to the incomplete reform of the health inspection system. During the reform, some HIAs refused to adopt the civil service employment model possibly because they believed that a change in employment model may lead to decreases in salaries. This may have resulted in a compromiseto adopt a 'quasi-civil service' employment model where HIAs are still fully funded by the government, and the staff, although lacking the prestigious title and status of civil servant, would enjoy the same entitlements of a civil servant.

For each participant, we summed the scores and divided by the number of items to get the mean score for each of the factors/subscales. To obtain the overall total stigma mean score, we summed up the mean scores of each of the factors and divided by 30. Stigma was analysed as a binary variable (yes/no). Mean stigma score of zero means that none of the items (experiences) in each of the subscales (internalised stigma, verbal abuse, healthcare neglect, fear of contagion and social isolation) occurred since discharged from the ETC. A mean stigma score greater than zero indicated that at least one of the items in each of the subscales occurred once or twice or several times or most of the time. As a binary variable, mean score of zero was taken as the absence of stigma and greater than zero was taken present of stigma. We employed chi-square and Fischer exact two tailed tests to determine the association between stigma subscales and sociodemographic and health related variables. We conducted a backward stepwise regressions analysis to establish the most parsimonious model that determines the sociodemographic and health related predictors of internal and enacted stigma.

As a result, more than 95% population lost protection from any form of health insurance by the end of the 1990's [2] . Previous studies showed that lack of health insurance raised the number of rural households living below the poverty line by 44%, since low-income families had to cover high out-of-pocket medical costs by themselves [3, 4] . The barefoot doctors, called village doctors after 1985, became unemployed in 1981 and the village clinics were also privatized [5] . Consequently, the village doctors began to charge patients for curative treatment and sell drugs for profit, and shift their focus to lucrative medical services rather than preventative health care [6, 7] . However, the outbreak and epidemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 exposed the real weakness of China's public health system [8] . The government realized that the health status of 900 million rural population had considerable impact on Chinese social stability and global health [9] , and the fragmentary rural health systems should be re-established to make a quick response to public health emergencies [10] .

Covering undocumented migrants may be misconstrued as condoning irregular migration, even if international human rights instruments that guarantee the right to health to all people regardless of migrant status already exist. Given this situation, crucial policy decisions made by agencies from outside the health sector, such as those that deal with overseas labor, immigration issues and diplomatic relations, are critical. Ministries of Health of ASEAN countries therefore must actively negotiate with their counterparts in government to advocate for realizing the health rights of irregular migrants through UHC.

The social determinants of health have been consistently linked in the literature to chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, respiratory diseases, diabetes and cancer in Canada and worldwide; for example, it has been found that low socioeconomic status (SES), often measured by income and education levels, is associated with higher rates of cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, diabetes mellitus and asthma [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Research on Canadian cities has shown that people living in low income neighbourhoods experience significantly higher rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes and die several years earlier than their wealthier counterparts [10] . Job insecurity, characterized by unemployment, part-time employment and temporary employment, has been found to result in elevated blood pressure and higher risk of death from cardiovascular disease [11, 12] . Even in a financially secure job, poor working conditions that place high demands on the worker, combined with low support and low job control have been correlated with elevated stress and increased rates of coronary heart diseases as well as higher risk of cardiovascular-specific mortality [13] [14] [15] .

A policy analysis,"Even in a conservative political climate, it is clear that there are improvements that can be made within public health to foster a greater understanding of how to focus programming on the social determinants of health. The WHO Commission on the Social Determinants of Health notes that a comprehensive health equity surveillance system would capture the most upstream structural drivers of health inequities (the unequal distribution of power, money, goods and services) as well as more intermediate ones that encompass the daily conditions in which people live and work. Such a system could monitor health equity by stratifying morbidity and mortality data by indicators such as income, occupation, gender, region, ethnicity and immigration status [2] . Some such initiatives already exist, for example the EU Health Monitoring Programme, which could be used as a model for Canada [67] . Solid data on health inequities and the social determinants of health serve a dual purpose: not only do they allow public health professionals and provincial health care systems to understand inequities and design effective initiatives that address structural determinants, they can also be used as tools to advocate for change at a broader level, which may be outside the scope of the public health system. For example, data on the health effects of social exclusion faced by new immigrants and refugees could be used to advocate for progressive immigration policies.",35.651793547961844,14.584012216302561

Methods: Case crossover design was used. This study is based on the national health insurance claim (ICD : J45, J46), air pollutants [PM 10 (μg/m 3 ), CO(ppb), SO 2 (ppb), NO 2 (ppb), O 3 (ppb)] and climate [temperature(°C), humidity(%), visibility(km), wind speed(m/s), air pressure(hPa)] data from 2007 to 2013 in Seoul and Incheon, Korea. The socioeconomic status was classified into health insurance group and medical aid group. The daily maximum value of air pollutants and daily average climate were calculated. The daily numbers of asthma cases on the 'Event' days were compared with 'Control' days. To select event days, 2 criteria were applied: 1) exclude weekends 2) excluded reoccurred Asian dust events on the 14 days before and after the Asian dust event. It was observed for 7 days after the events days. Control days is defined as the 7 days before and after the event days. Log poisson regression was used to estimate the ratio of averaged asthma cases using age, gender, region and climate between event and control days. Results: 7 event days were selected. On the event days, the average numbers of asthma cases were much more than the control days on the gender, age, region and socioeconomic status. However, there was no significant difference statistically. Humidity of the event days was lower (p=0.0950) but wind speed (p=0.0203) and PM 10 (p=0.0376) were higher than control days. The estimated ratio of averaged asthma cases on event days was 0.96 (95% C.I.: 0.95-0.98). According to the socioeconomic status, the ratio of asthma patients during 7 days from 'day +0' to 'day +6' were as follows: 0.96 (0.95 -0.97) on the day +0, 1.27 (1.26 -1.29 ) on the day +1, 1.11 (1.09 -1.13 ) on the day +2, 1.25 (1.23 -1.26) on the day +3, 1.13 (1.12 -1.15 ) on the day +4, 1.06 (1.04 -1.07) on the day +5 and 0.83 (0.81 -0.84) on the day +6 in the health insurance group.

It appears that economic activity status either strengthens or weakens the magnitude of the temporal variations in charcoal burning suicide, rather than serving as a determinant that alters the temporal distribution. This may indicate that active employment only serves as a stabilizing factor that protects individuals from various lifethreatening forms of behavior (e.g. alcohol consumption or misuse of illicit drugs) [39] and thereby implicitly influences the timing of suicide among specific groups of individuals, but not the whole population.

A) Background: Asthma is considered as a common respiratory disease among farmers in many researches. In 13' International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health, farmers showed higher prevalence (8.0%) than all other population (6.7%). But there is no largescale research of the prevalence and current state of asthma among Korean farmers. B) Methods: Structured questionnaire was used to evaluate the demographic characteristics such as age, sex, place of residence, smoking, prevalence of asthma based on doctor diagnosis and possible risk factors like crop types, farming period, pesticide usage, indoor cultivation, respiratory protection usage. From 2013 to 2014, total 951 farmers answered the questionnaire. C) Results: Prevalence of asthma among male farmer was 5.2% and the prevalence among female farmer was 6.0%. Based on 2013 Korean national health and nutrition examination survey, prevalence of asthma among Korean male was 2.7% and the prevalence among female was 4.1%. The odds ratio of asthma for total pesticide use year (more than 20 years) was 2.07 (1.20-3.58 ) and the odds ratio for indoor cultivation was 0.97(0.49-1.90). D) Conclusions: The prevalence of asthma among farmers was higher than other population in Korea. Pesticide usage is considered as a risk factor of asthma. In further research, exposure measures and work-relatedness measures should be needed. Background: Dietary intake can have a positive or negative impact on both actual and perceived general health and immune status. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of dietary intake of a variety of nutrients on perceived immune status in young adult women. Methods: A survey on dietary intake and perceived immune status was held among young Dutch women, aged between 18-30 years old. Perceived current immune status was scored on a scale ranging from 0 (very poor) to 10 (excellent). Subsequently, participants could indicate whether they perceived their immune status as normal or reduced. A food frequency questionnaire was completed recording past week food and beverage intake. From this data, the amount of various nutrients could be estimated, including fibers, sugar, tryptophan, beta-carotene, calcium, niacin, folate, thiamin, carbohydrates, riboflavin, vitamin A (retinol), vitamin B6, vitamin B12, vitamin C, vitamin D, and cholesterol. Non-parametric correlations (Spearman's r) were used to examine the association between perceived heath, immune status and nutritients. Dietary intake of those with normal and reduced perceived immune status was compared using the Mann-Whitney U Test. Results: N=329 young women (mean [SD] age: 20.7 [2.7] ) completed the survey. Significant correlations were found between immune ratings and consumption of tea (r= 0.124, p=0.023), sugar (r= -0.173, p=0.002), and carbohydrates (r= -0.125, p=0.022). N=109 women (33.1%) reported having a reduced perceived immune status. Women with a perceived reduced immune status reported consuming significantly more alcohol (p=0.025), and had significantly higher dietary levels of cholesterol (p=0.022), sugar (p=0.044), and vitamin B12 (p=0.021) when compared to women reporting a normal immune status. Discussion: The findings show that dietary intake is related to perceived immune status. However, some nutrients have a bigger impact on perceived immune status than others. Future studies, including objective measurement of immune biomarkers and nutrients, should confirm these findings.",36.210189552902676,17.527234437197272

As foreign policy, observer status was a potential means of leveraging participation in other international organisations and, in time, regaining recognition and legitimacy as a sovereign state. While this long-term aim enjoyed cross-party support, there were significant differences in approach between the KMT and DPP in relation to the WHA. The KMT, given what it termed ""meaningful participation"" and acceptance of the compromise label of ""Chinese Taipei"" [13] , focused on securing a seat at the WHA as an end in itself. The DPP, as described by key informants, saw the achievement of observer status only as a step towards the longer-term goal of regaining Taiwan's international standing [14] . Indeed, observer status was seen by many DPP interviewees as a regrettable compromise. In 2007, the DPP-led Taiwanese government submitted a request for full WHO membership, a significant departure from the previous goal of observer status [15] .",38.15204692157697,15.065465314143964

In contrast to the annual applications for UN membership, which were viewed as political symbolism, there was an added sense that WHA participation was both practically important and feasible. To this end, Taiwanese government officials, even those within the pro-independence DPP government, considered the pursuit of observer status (which does not imply statehood or sovereign legal status) a compromise position which the PRC could accept. Changes in the choice of moniker for the application process track the degree to which the traditional issue of sovereignty was entangled in the WHA process. Between 1997 and 2006, allied governments (normally Paraguay) introduced an agenda item inviting Taiwan to participate as an observer and initiating formal WHA discussion on Taiwan's exclusion [14] . Taiwan initially sought invitation to the WHA under the name ""Republic of China (Taiwan)"" [24] . Increasingly less controversial names were used in applications between 2002 and 2006, including, 'Health Authorities of Taiwan' and 'Taiwan, health entity' [25] . Then, in the 2007 membership application, the deliberately provocative name of ""Taiwan"" was used. Some traditional allies who had previously supported observer status refused to support the 2007 bid, although a heated debate at the WHA was prompted when the agenda item was introduced by Taiwan's diplomatic allies [14] . According to interviewees involved in the 2007 application, patience had worn thin. Although the repeatedly failed membership efforts were seen by some as a ""fiasco"", after more than ten years of applying, there was a general sense of frustration with the continued refusal to grant WHA observer status. By 2007, the traditional issue of sovereign status and the WHA were once again conflated, with the WHA used as a forum for highlighting the 'injustice' of Taiwan's exclusion from the international community.",35.74663194359347,12.461487720105564

Also, it is important to highlight the potential existence of vaccination status biases in the dog lifestyle (free-ranging dogs) results considering that there were no data in the literature in order to adjust the OR. Thus, it is interesting to mention that the OR would be influenced by the fact that free-ranging dogs, especially non-vaccinated dogs, tend to be more exposed to CDV because of the greater possibility of contact with other non-vaccinated dogs and eventually CDV infected, especially in urban environments. However, for two studies [32, 53] among those included in the analyses of risk factors, we can infer the absence of biases of the vaccine status factor in the variables of age, race, sex and behavioral style of the animals in the regions of the Santa Cruz (Galapagos) and Cape Verde, considering that they are regions with no vaccination programs.",46.307236658021644,17.631722841928095

At each time period there are 4 stages. In the first stage the trade of cattle takes place. At this stage all the market decisions are taken, animals are traded, and susceptible nodes can be exposed to infection through the arrival of infected animals. Second, there is the infection stage in which susceptible nodes exposed to infection (i.e. directly connected to an infectious node) can change from the S-state to the I-state with probability λ. The probability of a node becoming infected depends on the number of infectious neighbors and can be computed as 1-(1-λ) N , where N is the number of infectious neighbors. After the infection stage the disease is detected with probability γ, which is equal to 1 if detection is perfect. Finally the control stage takes place, in which movement-restriction policies are implemented in two steps: first, the I dnodes are isolated with probability α; second, direct neighbors at the geographic network of infected and controlled nodes are isolated. Table 3 summarizes the main parameters involved in the transition between states. The transmission rate λ depends on the disease and may also depend on other factors such as cattle density [25] and environmental factors [13] , which affect vector capacity (ability of vectors to acquire and transmit pathogens). The detection rate γ depends on two factors: the characteristics of the disease and the efficiency of the detection tools. The former is associated with the length of the incubation period or the rate of subclinical cases while the latter may depend on the sensitivity of available tests. The parameter α reflects the efficiency of the authorities in implementing the MRP. Notice that the MRP isolates the nodes detected as infected as well as their geographic neighbors, which are considered to be those nodes directly linked through the geographic network. This simulates establishing a protection zone around the infected perimeter in which no infected animals have been detected but movements are restricted. The geographic network is simplified to a square lattice in which each node is connected to its immediate neighbors, so there are no hubs in the network. Both networks have the same number of nodes and are associated through a one-to-one mapping that randomly assigns the At the infection stage, the node changes to infected status with probability λ; otherwise it retains the S-status during the whole period. At the detection stage, an infected node is detected with probability γ and adopts the I d -status; otherwise it takes the I nd -status. When disease is detected the node is removed from the network with probability α. Nodes with I nd -status and those with I d -status that are not removed (I dnc ) remain in the network until the next time period when they are again at risk of being detected or removed. Nodes can be removed from the network if they are infected, detected, and effectively controlled (I dc at control stage I), or if they enter a protection zone triggered when any direct neighbor in the geographic network is infected and controlled (C at control stage II). node's location, which remains fixed throughout the simulation. The infection is introduced by infecting one random node in the first period and the spread of the infection is summarized by the number of infected nodes up to 300 time periods. Since the probability of selling was derived for weekly cattle trade networks, a time period can be interpreted as a week in this analysis. For each scenario explored, 300 simulations were performed using Matlab (MathWorks).",40.06555931403251,16.02040177406772

Briefly, MSHMP is an ongoing voluntary producer-driven nation-wide monitoring program for endemic swine diseases that affect the U.S. swine industry. Based at the University of Minnesota (UMN), this program collects weekly reports on the infection status of sow farms from participating swine-producing companies, veterinary practices, and regional control programs, which serves to capture the occurrence of infectious diseases in the country (Tousignant et al., 2015a,b; Perez et al., 2016) . Infection status data classifies farms into the following categories (Holtkamp et al., 2011) : Status 1: positive-unstable, Status 2: positive-stable, either through use of live virus inoculation (2lvi) or use of vaccines (2vx); Status 3: provisional negative; and Status 4: negative. The main difference between positive-unstable (Status 1) and positive-stable (Status 2vx or 2lvi) is that unstable herds have an active clinical outbreak and are weaning PRRSV RT-PCR positive piglets. In contrast, PRRSV may be still present in positive-stable herds (through use of field virus inoculation or modified live vaccine) but clinical disease is controlled and piglets weaned from such farms are PRRSV-negative as a result of herd immunity, decreased shedding, and maternal antibodies (Holtkamp et al., 2011) . MSHMP collects farm-level data from approximately 3.2 million sows, which represents approximately 50.5% of the United States breeding herd population (National Agricultural Statistics Service [NASS] , Agricultural Statistics Board, and United States Deparment of Agriculture [USDA], 2018). Specific production systems (companies involved in pig production) participating in the project also share the ORF5 PRRSV sequences identified on their farms as part of routine veterinary management. For example, samples may be submitted by veterinary practitioners to determine if circulating PRRSV on the farm is the same or different from the vaccine virus or a previous variant present on the farm.",34.768879597130415,13.79469980389878

The migrant population, often described as the ""floating population"", largely consists of people originating from rural areas to urban areas in search of better economic and social opportunities. The ""floating population"" constitute a salient and disadvantaged group in China accounting for more than 10% of China's total population [24] . The migrants are often poor and less educated than the general population in urban areas. They typically live in low quality housing with inadequate sanitation, and have limited access to local health services. The needs of the migrant population have not been taken into full consideration in health care policy-makers' formulation of relevant policies and regulations, such as health insurance, occupational injury and infectious disease prevention strategies including immunization. Meanwhile, the ""floating population"" itself is reluctant to spend its already limited discretionary resources on health care. It comes as no surprise that the overall health status of rural-urban migrants is generally lower than that of local urban residents [33] . In particular, migrants can be more susceptible to infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and sexually transmitted diseases (STD), as well as vector/food-borne diseases, and are less likely to receive proper treatment or be cured of infectious diseases than local permanent residents [7, 34] . Further, children of migrant parents are also shown to have poorer health, lower nutrient intakes and constrained access to education compared to children of local or permanent residents [36] . Additionally, vaccination coverage among migrant children is lower than the rates for children of local or permanent residents [36] . These factors, in addition to the large size, high mobility and poorer health of the migrant population, have the potential to contribute to the spread of infectious diseases, adversely impacting on national health. Access to health care, insurance coverage, education and community support needs to be extended to the migrant population irrespective of residence and employment status.",44.29192082176206,22.396746381435385

The five statistical models were based on maximum likelihood in estimating the predictors that allow for inference to the Norwegian pig population. It was appropriate to use multi-level analysis because of the hierarchical nature of the data. The data, having 5865 observations nested in the 1955 pigs, which in turn were nested in the 43 herds, were handled to account for the variations between individual pigs and between the various herds including unmeasured confounders like other infections at the herd or individual level. Pigs from the study sample of 43 herds were represented in the reference group of 887 seronegative pigs. Consequently, the effects of virus infection (primary predictor of interest) and the known covariates (predictors we wanted to control) were more accurately estimated. Such Table 6 . The gradient of the line joining the mean for each group and the confidence intervals indicate whether there is any difference between the groups due to their infection status. hierarchical models solved some of the problems mentioned in a similar study by Straw et al. [18] , in that this study was designed to control heterogeneities due to the environment, herd health status, host characteristics and management conditions inherent at the pig and herd level to reduce if not eliminate confounding [29, 30] . Furthermore, keeping the pigs at one location in a uniform environment and husbandry eliminated these factors as potential confounders in our model. Our models also proved to have a relatively high explanatory ability on the variance as the achieved adjusted R 2 were 51% (ADG), 59% (FCE), 51% (Age100 kg), 66% (ADFI) and 20% (OFI), which were proportions of variation that were explained by the predictors in the models. The longitudinal nature of the data for each pig allowed the statistical models to account for changes to FCE, ADFI and Table 7 . The gradient of the line joining the mean for each group and the confidence intervals indicate whether there is any difference between the groups due to their infection status. Comparisons were made between the four infected groups and the reference seronegative group. Abbreviations: INFGP = Infection status group; SEROPOS = seropositive pigs, SERONEG = seronegative pigs, VIR1 = PCR-positive pigs at bodyweight between 33 kg and 60 kg (GF1); VIR2 = PCR-positive pigs at bodyweight between 61 kg and 80 kg (GF2); VIR3 = PCR-positive pigs at bodyweight between 81 kg and 100 kg (GF3). hence ADG with respect to the stage in the pig's growth phase by including growth phase (GF) as a dummy variable in the statistical models thus controlling for confounding due to normal variation of feed conversion efficiency and daily feed intake with stage in growth phase. Our samples of 1955 pigs included pigs tested at the station over four years from 2009 and 2012. We saw in our models that birthdate was a significant covariate because pigs born later had better growth performance as a result of improvement over time due to genetic selection, improved feed, and management improvement. Pigs belonging to the five infection status groups were disproportionately distributed over these four years since all 194 virus positive pigs were sampled in a single year (2011) while 560 pigs from seronegative and seropositive group were sampled in 2009 and 2010. Despite these disproportions, we were able to account for the marginal effects attributed to improvement over time by including birthdate as a covariate in our multi-level regression models. This allowed us to increase the study sample and hence the power of our study.",36.52521235451839,16.210886895130173

People who needed medical care seemed more likely to have a USC than did people who did not need medical care. According to the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey in the United States, 63.0% individuals without a USC answered ""Seldom or never get sick"" as their main reason for not having a USC [25] , which was similar to our results. However, the second-most common reason for not having a USC differed between the two countries: In Korea, it was ""the preference to visit multiple medical institutions"" (27.9%), whereas in the United States, it was the cost of medical care (14%) [25] . The fact that there is a significant portion of people who prefer visiting multiple places (any kind of medical specialists) implies that voluntary participation, rather than mandatory registration, could be an important manner to disseminate having a USC without resistance of the public in Korea. Thirty-eight percent of the people who had a USC considered a community, general, or university hospital to be their usual place of care; these patients were likely to have chronic conditions, and patients with severe conditions need hospital care more than clinic care. Among the medical institutions for which usual physicians worked, the proportion of hospitals was 33.7% in this study. Because hospital ambulatory care can be easily accessed in Korea, a usual hospital physician who can provide multi-morbid patients with coordinated care may be a pragmatic alternative USC from the patients' perspective. In reality, however, care coordination in Korea is very poor, and actual health outcomes according to the types of USC are rarely studied. Previous studies in Western countries found that adults who reported having a primary care physician rather than a specialist as a USC had lower subsequent five-year mortality rates after initial differences in health status, demographic characteristics, health insurance status, health perceptions, reported diagnoses, and smoking status were controlled for [26] .

We randomly selected 50 cases from its TB registry according to the inclusion criteria: 1) being new sputum smear positive or negative pulmonary TB patients, 2) been registered in 2007 and successfully completed treatment by August 2008, and 3) having no record of any serious comorbidities such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hepatic disease or severe respiratory symptoms. All selected patients treated in the specialist hospitals were sensitive to first-line anti-TB drugs. Drug sensitivity tests were not available in other models. But all cases were unlikely to be drug resistant as they were recorded as 'treatment successfully completed'. Participants were surveyed using a structured questionnaire adapted from the National TB Survey [11] which had been used in other similar settings [21, 22] . Questions covered patient social-economic status, care pathways, patient expenditure on TB care, and delays. Costs covered by health insurance schemes and the free treatment policy were often deducted automatically at the point of payment, so patients were not aware of the exact amount of costs covered by health insurance or the free treatment policy. Thus, we only collected patient out-of-pocket health expenditure. Patient charts provided information on medical examinations and drugs prescription.",40.65059352953044,18.541077617442433

Considerable attention in the field of migrant health is devoted to the investigation and improved documentation of health indicators among migrant populations in receiving nations. 94 However, many of the health threats, risks, and challenges related to health outcomes due to migration result from factors and influences present outside the jurisdiction and hence the direct influence, of the migrant-receiving nations. 95, 96 Even in nations where long-standing immigration programs are a component of national policies, the health aspects of migration may not be addressed systematically 97 and much of the attention toward migrant health issues is only national in scope. 98 Some regional strategies have been proposed, but analysis suggests that they may not be evenly applied or supported. 99, 100 As a result, there is a paucity of systematic programs and policies to support the health of migrants. To improve global health management and preventive health practices, there is a need for coordinated international actions and partnerships between governments and organizations in nations of origin, transit, and destination. Studies have suggested that primary health prevention endeavors such as tuberculosis control 101 in countries of migrant origin are more economical over the longer term than traditional immigration screening programs and policies. They address better universal access in support of equity and the right to health, and have secondary preventive benefits manifested through the improvement of health indicators in migrant source countries. 102 There is growing interest in and appreciation of efforts to address the importance of health and migration at the global level. In 2008, the WHO World Health Assembly resolved to take on the issue through its member states by adopting a resolution on migrant health. 103 Approaching the topic through coordinated, international action will require considerable changes in many current national and regional health strategies and disease-control policies. National programs based on immigration status, nationality, historical roles of national borders, and traditional travel patterns will need to be redesigned to allow for equitable access to health services for migrants, and greater exchange of information and data to improve research into migrants' health. Threats, risks, and challenges will need to be conceptualized in terms of mobility and population dynamics, and to consider migrant origin and transit practices. 104 Developing multisectoral approaches The health of migrants is intrinsically linked to all determinants of health but particularly to the unequal distribution of socioeconomic determinants, including income status, housing and accommodation, education, nutrition, sanitation, and employment. 105, 106 As a consequence, societal responses will be most effective if they are multidisciplinary and involve stakeholders from all relevant sectors working together to reduce adverse outcomes and improve the health of migrants.",46.75895370200895,18.414653436387262

Second, the study used a facility level analysis, thus it did not draw a representative sample of the three TB models in China. The two facilities in the specialist model and the integrated model showed similar indicator despite their differences in economic development. However, large differences were found between the two facilities in the dispensary model. This reflects great variations in the dispensary model similar to that found in the literature. Third, we only studied uncomplicated TB cases in each model. This study did not address the complicated cases treatment as these cases account for a small proportion of total TB cases and national treatment guidelines are less specific for these cases. Complicated TB cases are commonly treated in specialist hospitals, and this study did not intend to address this role of the specialist hospitals. Fourth, patient per capita income varies greatly across China. We here presented patient health expenditures in both absolute monetary terms, and relatively in relation to catastrophic spending. Patient information on income, expenditure and time may suffer from validity problems due to recall and reporting bias. The problem was minimized as the survey was taken within half a year after treatment completion. Information regarding TB treatment in hospitals and TB dispensaries, where possible, was collected from patient charts to cross-check potential recall problems. Fifth, we did not collect total costs because costs covered by health insurance were not available. Rural health insurance plans have a lower coverage rates than urban health insurance plans. However, 18-30% of participants in urban areas did not have health insurance coverage, which may offset the effects caused by different reimbursement rates between urban and rural areas.

Even with the recognition of adverse health outcomes in migrant populations, providing secure access to equitable health services for populations of migrants can be difficult. These difficulties can exist even in nations with long-standing immigration programs. For nations that have only recently begun to deal with the growing dynamics of international migration, the difficulties can be much greater. Professional and population education, training, and orientation to societal values in health promotion and maintenance, disease prevention, and health services utilization also take time and commitment to achieve. 68 New and evolving populations of migrants and mobile populations can result in rapid arrival and growth of large communities with diverse characteristics, which include social, linguistic, cultural, and economic status; these can be associated with disparate health outcomes. Access to and utilization of health and medical services by some foreignborn communities may have a different pattern than those of the host population. 69, 70 Specialized services encompassing linguistically and culturally competent providers, designed for the problems of migrants, will be required to ensure adequate health-care programs and service delivery models. Similar features may need to be integrated into public health and disease-control programs designed to mitigate health threats or risks. 71 This is reflected in the need to have educational and instructional information prepared in the language of migrants at an appropriate level for comprehension, and the need for translation or visual tools to deliver messages in a culturally appropriate manner. 72 Depending on the location and health sector capacities, these forces can affect the design and function of the health program. Migrant-specific programs may be more effective for the migrant community, but they may engender additional costs and resource demands. Additional challenges occur as a result of migrant diversity itself and can be seen in many locations where demands or needs for culturally competent health services can extend across several nationalities and ethnicities. Strategies to deal with these situations include (1) support for acculturalization and integration to allow migrants to better use domestic medical and health services and (2) the provision of migrant-specific or migrant-friendly health services. 73 National, regional, and municipal differences in migrant history and demography make it unlikely that a single approach will be applicable to all venues. 74 However, modern information technology and networking does provide opportunities for the sharing and exchange of best practices and information across cultural environments. 75, 76 The legal or administrative status of the migrant does affect access to services and care. 77 Migrants in an unauthorized situation and some foreign-born women 78 have been shown to have a lower utilization of health services than the local population. For example, health services may be too costly for migrants who do not have health insurance coverage. Although linguistically appropriate health services are available and affordable, they may not be used because of migrants' lack of information about their rights and entitlements or out of fear for deportation. 79 Limitations to traditional responses to the health challenges of migration Traditional approaches to health and migration frequently deal with specific diseases, primarily communicable diseases of public health significance that may be associated with the arrival of migrants. 80, 81 Coordinated attempts at the international level to manage infectious disease transmission were organized and consolidated into the International Health Regulations (IHR), which was revised in 2005. 82 Some nations with integrated and long-standing immigration programs have systematically screened applicants for permanent residency status (immigrants) and some other classes of mobile populations (such as temporary resident applicants, including foreign students or migrant workers 83 ), for various health conditions and illnesses. Immigration medical screening, quarantine, and isolation have been used in attempts to address the possible introduction of health threats by exclusion. 84 Major immigration-receiving nations continue to use these processes to reduce the impact of health disparities in arriving mobile populations. 85 Important as they are from a legal and administrative perspective, programs and policies that continue to embrace responses of inspection and exclusion will be increasingly costly and ineffective in the context of modern migration and population mobility. 86 Furthermore, attempting to manage or mitigate health risks in arriving travelers, when many of the health risks may be latent or subclinical, without affecting international travel and commerce is operationally and logistically impractical.",38.17740679311026,17.016000594541868

[12] [13] [14] However, sustained migration between disparate health environments also affects the longer-term epidemiology of chronic noninfectious diseases; this has a downstream impact on health promotion, health services for disease prevention and management, and occupational health outcomes at migrant destinations. As a result of these impacts, migration exerts increasing influence on public health policy, 15 education of health-service providers, 16 health system design, and service delivery. 17 Examples of these influences include the need to regulate or manage the use of alternative medicines and pharmaceuticals imported by migrants, or the introduction of alternative medical procedures. [18] [19] [20] In terms of public health, migration has implications for recognition of threats, as well as for surveillance and response capacity. 21 Migration also influences broader aspects of the 'health of the public,' including the background burden of chronic or latent diseases (both infectious and noninfectious) and patterns of preexisting immunity; it also influences the use and uptake of disease prevention and health promotion interventions, and health-care service utilization in general. 22, 23 Ensuring that necessary information is both available and understood by diverse communities is an increasingly important aspect of public health planning and preparedness [24] [25] [26] in nations with large mobile populations. This was recently shown by responses to the threat of influenza A/H1N1 importation, which included quarantine, isolation, or preventive interventions. [27] [28] [29] Traditional regulatory approaches to public health risks in the context of migration are commonly disease oriented 30 or event based. 31 Frequently, these concepts assume or are based on the view that a degree of homogeneity or similarity characterizes migrant populations; they also relate to the administrative or legal status of the population. This article puts forth the observation that many of the important public health aspects of migration originate from or are based on the diversity and disparity of the populations themselves and extend beyond the legal and temporal processes involved in changing one's residence. Addressing migration-associated health threats and risks will be more effectively accomplished if approached from this population-based framework, rather than from traditional disease-or immigration status-based views. It is proposed that the development of standardized, programmatic approaches to health and migration that are based on collective international evidence would be an effective strategic and operational approach to global health.",35.137186457432975,15.504477249981148

Liver parenchymal fibrosis grade, an ordinal measure, was examined using ordinal logistic regression, a population averaged model using a sandwich type estimator for inference accounting for within-subject residual correlation [28] . Because ordinal logistic regression assumes the effect of a predictor on an outcome is constant for each stepwise increase in the outcome, the Brant test [29] was used to check that this parallel regression assumption was not violated. For all other liver and spleen measures and for predictors of S. japonicum infection status, generalized estimating equation (GEE) logistic regression with exchangeable correlation was conducted [30] . The Huber/White/sandwich estimator of variance was used which is robust to misspecification of the outcome distribution [31, 32] . The relationship between S. japonicum infection and ultrasounddetected abnormalities was first assessed by examining the impact of current infection status and, separately, infection intensity, on current ultrasound measures. Because infection intensity was highly right skewed, it was categorized into approximate quartiles among those who were infected. In order to examine the role of past infection on current morbidity, we also examined the relationship between infection status and intensity two to three years prior to the ultrasound examination and ultrasound-detected abnormalities (for example: 2000 infection status as a predictor of ultrasound-detected morbidity in 2002, and 2002 infection status as a predictor of ultrasound-detected morbidity in 2005). We hypothesized that age, sex and year of examination could modify the effect of infection on morbidity, so each model was run including all possible first-order interaction terms. The Wald test was used to test for significant interactions and if present, terms were removed from the model step-wise until only interaction terms significant at p-values ,0.05 remained. In the absence of effect modification, these same variables could confound the relationship between infection and ultrasound-detected morbidity. While occupation, village and educational status were considered potential predictors of S. japonicum infection, they are unlikely to effect ultrasound morbidity independent of infection status. As they do not fit the definition of confounders [33] , they were not controlled for in models examining the relationship between infection and ultrasound-detected abnormalities.

Additionally, for the purposes of this study of naturally infected cats either adopted from shelters or rescued, it was necessary to estimate the ages of the cats and to use the date that the cat first tested FIV-positive since the precise dates of infection were not known. It has been reported previously that age at time of first exposure to FIV can influence the course of infection (George et al., 1993) and can determine the outcome of disease (Akhtardanesh et al., 2010) . From a biological and behavioural perspective, the age of approximately 1-2 years old at the time of first diagnosis reported in this study is consistent with young cats engaging in territorial fights, especially if they are entire. The cats in our study were originally adopted from shelters and many were entire and had outdoor access at the time of shelter intake, both known lifestyle risk factors for FIV (Levy et al., 2006) . In our study population, infection was more common in male cats, confirming the results of previous studies (Grindem et al., 1989; Hosie et al., 1989; Ishida et al., 1989; Levy et al., 2006; Yamamoto et al., 1989) .

Steady-state mTOR bifurcation diagrams as a function of the parameter G for various values of λ 1 are presented in the top panels of Fig  S3. It shows the pushing and pulling properties of mTOR (see Figs S3(A-C)). The mTOR level (R s ) decreases with increasing α for the fixed G and λ 1 and the bifurcation curve moves to the right for the fixed λ 1 as seen in Fig S1. While the system exhibits the hysteresis (property of bistable systems) for the base parameter set and the increased λ 1 and various perturbed α's considered (λ 1 = 5.0, α = 1.0, 1.6, 2.0, 2.5). However, when λ 1 is decreased, for larger values of α, the response of the switch is slightly different. For example, the core control system loses the bi-stability property for larger α's (α = 1.6, 2.0, 2.5) when λ 1 = 3.0 (Figs S3A and S3D). Therefore, even for the base value of α (α * = 1.6) in this case, an increase (or decrease) in glucose leads to a smooth transition from T m -status (or T p -status) to T p -status (or T mstatus) along the branch. However, the system also illustrates an extreme case of hysteresis, a one-way switch, when λ 1 is increased (λ 1 =5.0 in Fig S3C) where the upper branches (T p -regime) stretches into the larger domain but actually need to be eliminated due to physiologically irrelevant regimes (G < 0) of glucose (for example, α=1.0 in Fig S3B and α=1 .0,1.6 (base) in Fig S3C) .

The country's major economic reform in 1979 has created a large economic disparity between rural and urban areas, resulting in a large population of floating immigrants (also known as 'peasant workers'). This accounts for 10% of the total Chinese population in 2005 [86] . The vast majority of these immigrants are from rural environments but work in urban areas, away from their families, and hence regularly travel between the two sites. In addition to the natural population growth of major cities, the inflow of internal immigrants substantially increases the population size and density in urban areas. These immigrants often live in overcrowded residential areas with compromised hygiene conditions. Female immigrants often become targets of those seeking to recruit them for commercial sex work [57, 87] . These floating immigrants are often more disadvantageous than the local residents. They tend to be less educated compared with others in urban areas who have permanent resident status and less likely to seek medical treatment when sick due to financial constraints or lack of health insurance [6] . Not surprisingly, the population of floating immigrants has been found to be more vulnerable to infectious diseases, especially STIs, HIV and viral hepatitis [6] . Additionally, their high-risk behaviours and mobility promotes transmission of infectious disease agents and creates a major challenge for disease detection and control. Given the characteristics, behaviours and the increasing population size of floating immigrants, it becomes apparent that the capacity of current Chinese healthcare system cannot meet the needs of both the surveillance activities and health problems of these migrant workers. The infectious disease surveillance system needs to be tailored for its high mobility, and a dramatic expansion of the private health sector is required to address the health needs of this population.",27.86127108317342,11.245803108747843

Estimates for exposure to non-SARS coronaviruses are high, particularly for 229E and OC43; however, less information regarding seroprevalence is available for HKU1 and NL63. To measure exposure rates to these four coronavirus strains (229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43), we devised an immunoassay based on amino-and carboxy-terminally tagged recombinant coronavirus nucleocapsid antigens. Four human and one feline coronavirus antigen were cloned into baculoviruses expressed in insect cells and recovered proteins bound in the solid phase of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based system. We screened sera from 10 children and 196 adults and established primary cutoff points based on immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody levels of the predominantly seronegative children. The proportion of seropositive adults for each coronavirus was as follows: 229E, 91.3%; HKU1, 59.2%; NL63, 91.8%; and OC43, 90.8%. No evidence of a significant serological response to the feline coronavirus was observed. Significant associations of coronavirus seropositivity and antibody levels with age, gender, race, socioeconomic status, smoking status, and season of the blood draw were tested with chi-square and regression analyses. The group II coronaviruses (OC43 and HKU1) were significantly associated with race (P < 0.009 and P < 0.03, respectively). Elevated OC43 IgG levels were further significantly associated with smoking status (P < 0.03), as were high NL63 titers with socioeconomic status (P < 0.04). The high-level immunoreactivity of each coronavirus was significantly associated with the summer season (P < 0.01 to 0.0001). In summary, high rates of exposure to 229E, NL63, and OC43 and a moderate rate of exposure to HKU1 characterized the seroprevalence among individuals in this population.

Not surprisingly, but serving as a data reliability check, age (P<0.001), performance status (P=0.006), WBC (P<0.001), secondary disease (P<0.001), cytogenetic risk (favorable or intermediate vs. adverse; P<0.001 for each comparison), and NPM1 mutation as well as FLT3-ITD status (NPM1 neg /FLT3-ITD neg or NPM1 neg /FLT3-ITD pos vs. NPM1 pos /FLT3-ITD pos ; P<0.005 for each comparison) were independently associated with being primary refractory to induction chemotherapy when considering all patients ( Table 3) . As shown in Figure 1A , age was the most important individual covariate in predicting failure to achieve CR followed by cytogenetic risk and NPM1 and FLT3/ITD status, as indicated by values of the partial Wald Chi-squared statistic. Despite the strong associations between such covariates and primary refractory AML, AUCs validated by bootstrapadjustment suggested that the predictive ability was less impressive. Specifically, in univariate models, AUC values were 0.68, 0.66, and 0.60 for age, cytogenetic risk, and NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutational status, A bootstrap-corrected multivariable model incorporating all covariates (age, performance status, WBC, platelet count, bone marrow blast percentage, gender, disease type [primary vs. secondary], cytogenetic risk, and FLT3-ITD as well as NPM1 mutational status) yielded an AUC of 0.78. Despite their strong associations with primary refractory AML, removal of FLT3-ITD and NPM1 from the model, while having a statistically significant effect on AUC, only decreased the AUC slightly (from 0.78 to 0.76; see Supplemental Figure 1 ).

Participation was strictly voluntary and no incentives were provided. The Institutional Review Board of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, the Advisory Panel on Ethics and Medico-Legal Affairs in the Ministry of Health, Jamaica, and the WRHA of Jamaica approved the study protocol before its implementation. Study Instrument and Data Collection. Data were collected from each participant using a pretested questionnaire administered by a study interviewer. The questionnaire addressed the following areas: sociodemographic characteristics (sex, age, marital status, education, employment status, occupation, income, and number of people in household), knowledge of and experience with VBDs, attitude toward VBDs, and practices of VBD control. Data Analysis. Characteristics of the study population are presented as means, SDs, ranges, and frequency tabulations. Each participant was assigned a separate score for knowledge, attitude, and practice based on the number of correct or appropriate responses. Each appropriate answer was assigned 1 point (incorrect responses were assigned zero points). The knowledge scale ranged from 0 to 17 points, the attitude scale from 0 to 6 points, and the practice scale from 0 to 10 points. The scores were further dichotomized into low (poor) or high (good) as follows: knowledge (low ¼ 0e7 points; high ¼ 8e17 points); attitude (low ¼ 0e3 points; high ¼ 4e6 points); practice (low ¼ 0e5 points, high ¼ 6e10 points). Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate crude and adjusted odds ratios as well as corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Each variable was first entered separately into bivariate logistic regression models to evaluate the crude association with sociodemographic characteristics. All predictors were then entered in multivariable logistic regression to get adjusted odds ratios. Bivariate and multivariable linear regression analyses were conducted to identify predictors of practice score.

In fact, if direct and indirect costs were included in the modeling, the incremental cost/death averted ratio of moving from Yellow Alert to Orange in pandemic (H1N1) 2009 increased to a staggering $8-$81 million for both hospitals. Although these indirect costs are not part of the infection control process per se, surge capacity response plans to ensure that the healthcare system has the reserve capacity to react to a full-blown community outbreak are critical to all pandemic plans (20) and contribute serious costs to the hospital. The major limitations of our study are that we have simulated a situation in which community infection is still relatively low and the outbreak in hospital arises from 1 index case. When a community epidemic is established, the incidence of new index cases entering the institution increases, especially if there are prevalent atypical or subclinically infected persons.

The use of empiric antiepileptic drugs in children with encephalitis has not been thoroughly studied. In a retrospective review of 46 children admitted to an ICU with encephalitis complicated by status epilepticus, 20/46 (43%) went on to develop refractory status epilepticus defined as seizure lasting more than 2 hours despite treatment with therapeutic dosage of benzodiazepines, phenobarbital, and phenytoin. Patients who developed refractory status epilepticus were more likely to have a generalized or multifocal pattern on their initial EEG and more likely to have poor neurologic outcome at 6 months on Glasgow Outcome Scale score and medically refractory epilepsy. 14 In the CEP, 56% of patients had seizure(s) responsive to standard medical therapy, whereas only 4% developed refractory seizures and required induced coma for management. In this cohort, patients with refractory status epilepticus were more likely to be young (median age 10 years); have fever (93%), prodromal respiratory illness (57%), or gastrointestinal illness (64%); and less likely to have a CSF pleocytosis (47%) or abnormal imaging (16%). The median interval from onset of status epilepticus to induced coma was 4 days (range 0-41 days) and patients were kept in coma for a median of 15 days (range 2-76 days). In-hospital mortality was 21% in patients with refractory seizures versus 9% in patients without seizure. At 2 years follow-up in the patients with refractory seizures, 28% had died and 56% were neurologically impaired or undergoing rehabilitation. 15 Given the high morbidity and mortality associated with refractory status epilepticus and the effects of seizure duration on outcome, we practice aggressive management of clinical or electrographic seizures. In general, a seizing patient is treated emergently with lorazepam or diazepam, followed by maintenance therapy with fosphenytoin. If a patient in status epilepticus fails to respond to initial dose(s) of benzodiazepines, it is unlikely that the next agent in protocols (phenobarbital, phenytoin) will be effective. In The Veteran Affairs Cooperative Study by Treiman and colleagues, 16 a randomized double-blind clinical trial of 4 intravenous treatment options for status epilepticus, the first antiepileptic drug administered failed to resolve status epilepticus in 45% of cases; in cases of nonconvulsive status epilepticus, the first agent failed in 85% of cases. Second and third agents were successful less than 10% of the time. To effectively treat status epilepticus in pediatric patients, clinicians should consider highdose continuous infusions of midazolam or pentobarbital to produce medically induced coma. Patients receiving this therapy require endotracheal intubation for airway protection and ventilatory support and often require hemodynamic support in the form of fluid boluses or vasopressors. EEG should be used to monitor and titrate the midazolam or pentobarbital infusion, with typical targets being suppression of Acute Encephalitis seizures or burst-suppression pattern. 17 It is our practice to titrate our therapy to burst-suppression with interburst interval of 10 seconds for 24 hours followed by a taper over 24 to 48 hours monitoring for recurrence of seizure activity. In adults with refractory status epilepticus, propofol infusion with or without midazolam may also be used to induce coma. However, because of the risk of propofol infusion syndrome (cardiovascular collapse, lactic acidosis, hypertriglyceridemia, and rhabdomyolysis), particularly in prolonged infusions and in children, we caution against its use in pediatric patients for treatment of refractory status epilepticus.",33.60722030017414,14.16104558393134

Although this measure is likely imperfect and thus may leave residual confounding, the analyst might take advantage of the breadth of outcomes available in electronic medical records that might act as negative controls by, for example, assessing whether BMI is associated with mammography screening after controlling for the socioeconomic proxy. If an association exists before controlling for ZIP code median income but drops close to zero after controlling, the analyst may conclude that residual confounding due to an error in the socioeconomic status measure is unlikely to result in strong bias in the primary analysis because such an error would need to be uncorrelated with screening status (though residual confounding can never be ruled out).

Relatively straightforward experiments could test the functional status of APCs in infected animals through intracellular or extracellular staining for EBOV gene products and cellular factors (e.g. cytokines). Ideally, such experiments would quantify the frequency of infection of different APC types and the cytokines secreted by different cells types. Isolation of in vivo infected APCs and testing their ability to process antigen and stimulate an EBOV antigen-specific response ex vivo would provide a more clear understanding their functional status and allow comparison to studies performed in cells infected in vitro. Given the copious production of cytokines, chemokines and possibly viral products, it is possible that APCs and other immune cells that are not directly infected will exhibit altered function. Therefore, it will also be important to assess the functional status of uninfected APCs and lymphocytes from the same infected animals. For example, it might prove fruitful to assess the ability of T cells to respond to either allo-or superantigens from competent non-infected MHC-compatible or incompatible APCs. Such studies would not only inform our understanding of APCs but also better describe the status of the adaptive immune response. This is particularly important in NHPs, which most closely mimic severe human infections. Functional T cells have been shown to be present in EBOV-infected mice (Bradfute et al., 2008) . Hopefully, by more precisely defining filovirus-APC interactions from the molecular perspective and the contribution of these interactions to pathogenesis in vivo, new specific and precisely targeted therapeutic interventions can be designed.",36.57877987503897,16.537869873225308

For example, they could not use monetary terms to capture completely the value of saving a life (e.g., a person contributes to society in many nonmonetary ways, such as providing emotional and psychological support to friends and families), so researchers began using ""life-years saved"" as a reward for some interventions. However, life-years saved could not adequately represent the benefits of some quality-of-life-improving interventions (e.g., pain medications, walking devices) that do not save lives or the suffering caused by non-life-threatening diseases.

Compartmental models are the most common class of models.

On the other end of the spectrum, detailed agent-based models, based on realistic mobility pattern models, provide extremely accurate predictions. However, these models require significant computing power and are not suitable for analytical treatment. Our research aims at bridging the gap between these two approaches, toward time-varying network models that are sufficiently accurate to make predictions for real-world applications, while being computationally affordable and amenable to analytical treatment. We leverage the novel paradigm of activity driven networks (ADNs), a particular type of time-varying network that accounts for inherent inhomogeinities within a population. Starting from the basic incarnation of ADNs, we expand on the framework to include behavioral factors triggered by health status and spreading awareness. The enriched paradigm is then utilized to model the 2014-2015 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) spreading in Liberia, and perform a what-if analysis on the timely application of sanitary interventions in the field.

In 1982 CE, two Etobicoke, ON, firefighters fought their then mandatory retirement age of 60 years. They argued that Section 4(1) of the Ontario Human Rights Code prohibited their employer from discriminating in the hiring or firing of workers, based on their race, creed, colour, age, sex, marital status, nationality, ancestry or place of origin. However, the Borough of Etobicoke pointed out that Section 4(1) of the legislation does not apply where age is a bona fide occupational requirement (BFOR). In other words, if age is affecting your ability to be a capable firefighter, then you can indeed lose your job because of your age. The issue was appealed to the Canadian Supreme Court. In 1999 CE, this body ruled that a BFOR must be ""objectively reasonable,"" and it set specific guidelines to evaluate BFOR tests and standards. This judgment prompted extensive research by Occupational Physiologists, particularly a group at York University led by Norman Gledhill. Their mission was to determine the physical demands of various occupations where public safety was at stake, and to design appropriate, job-related tests to determine the physical competence of employees who wished to continue working beyond the normal retirement age (Gledhill et al. 2001) .

Social insurance was more than state-sponsored insurance, which had been gaining adherents at the turn of the century. State insurance provided for government-funded medical care of the poor and sick through municipal clinics, free hospitals and convalescent homes. Countries such as Germany, France and Russia were early innovators in such practice. Despite such efforts, however, care was fragmentary. State efforts were frequently small compared to private care provided by charitable or religious organizations or private fee-for-service care that precluded the poor. Social insurance, or social welfare, expanded the notion of state insurance to include other social aspects. It is a social safety net which includes income support, nutritional support, provision of housing and access to medical care for highly vulnerable populations such as the elderly (who no longer earn income), women, children and the poor whose physical or social circumstances prevent equal ability to access essential goods. Deficiencies in these goods make people more susceptible to death and disease; those highly vulnerable groups have fewer resources with which to mitigate harmful outcomes. In some cases, they are less able to respond to risks because of physical reasons. For example, women of childbearing age may be particularly vulnerable to physical conditions associated with childbearing, such as nutritional deficiencies, which can compromise their immune systems and make them susceptible to other diseases. These populations may be more vulnerable because of social or institutional structures as well. Consider the legal status of women in some areas following World War II where women were not allowed to enter the work force either because of formal rules or informal social norms. Those women who had engaged in work as part of the war effort were expected to return home at war's end. Their means of economic support was tied to spousal income or family wealth. In some regions, women were not allowed to own property. With no independent means of support, women were dependent upon the largess of men or upon social policies which would provide access to material support.",38.43006194132951,15.797735645119701

Terms that are less useful without detailed additional information include specific pathogen free (SPF) and conventional. In general use, SPF refers to animals that are (1) considered to be free of major pathogens and some or all opportunists, (2) maintained under housing and use conditions designed to protect this high-quality status by excluding infectious agents, and (3) monitored closely to assure that there is no undetected introduction of excluded agents. Conventional animals are usually considered to be those that originate from uncontrolled colonies that are not subjected to routine health monitoring, or those in which some degree of monitoring occurs but there is no action taken if infectious agents are found. However, these terms are not really descriptive or representative enough to use when assigning risk to animals proposed for introduction to monitored, disease-free animal facilities. For example, animals from an institution that experienced an outbreak of rat coronavirus and decided not to undertake the steps needed to eliminate the agent from the facility can still be considered to be ""SPF"", since by definition this status is only defined by the particular list of agents of which the animals are specifically free. The term conventional also suffers from some ambiguity, since it can be used to refer not only to animal health status but also to facility design. For example, a facility that allows direct staff entry into rat rooms without changing out of street clothes would be termed a conventional facility rather than a ""barrier"" in the purest sense, but if microisolators and high-efficiency particulate air-filtered changing hoods have been used to successfully institute pathogen exclusion at the cage level, the animals themselves might possess a high-quality health status that is far from ""conventional.""

Model building examined potential confounding factors identifi ed a priori from demographic and clinical measures of child's sex, in-utero HIV exposure, maternal age, maternal smoking, and socioeconomic status; because no clear confounding factors were consistently identifi ed based on appreciable changes in the point estimate for pathogen-pneumonia associations, models presented account for matching factors only.

They propose that discrete choice experiments in a nationally representative sample be used to elicit WTP for health insurance products that would cover a new health intervention with specific attributes.

Levels of susceptible individual, generation, and household were considered as a unified analytical framework under the context of generalised linear random-effect models [13] . Such a typical example can be noted in the O'Neill et al. study [14] that extended the flexibility of the Becker model by using the random household effect models in conjunction with the MCMC method to model the escaped probabilities at community and household level each of which was specified by a statistical distribution to account for the heterogeneities of the levels. Although their approach has advanced in the Becker model it still leaves room to be desired and may have several extensions. First, the mechanisms of disease transmission such as the Greenwood model [15] and the Reed-Frost model [16] originally proposed by the original Becker's framework can be incorporated to make the model biologically plausible. Second, the heterogeneity of escape probability across households (socioeconomic status) and individual attributes (such as age and sex) can be also taken into account by using the random-intercept model. Third, allowing for regression coefficients to vary with different levels can be accommodated by using the random-slope model. The classical example of this situation is that the effect of vaccination on protecting individuals from disease vulnerability should also consider contextual factors, such as the heterogeneity of socioeconomic status across households, which have been confirmed as significant factors in previous studies [5, 6, [17] [18] [19] [20] . In spite of the attractiveness of these random-effect models, it should be noted that considering the effect and variation across different levels increases the number of parameters and makes estimation of parameters intractable from the viewpoint of statistical computation. The most serious problem is the problem of identifiability between parameters already noted in the O'Neill study [14] . To tackle these statistical technique problems, we resorted to the application of Bayesian underpinning together with the two transmission models.",32.491450661250994,14.3131755032541

Free-stall housing, associated primarily with large herds, presents considerable challenges when combating manure-transmitted pathogens. Freedom of movement in free-stall barns allows cattle to have direct contact with manure from other members of the herd, and it facilitates fecal contamination of common feed and water sources. Disposal of manure in liquid form by irrigation or application of slurry (as opposed to use of a broadcast or solid spreader to discard manure) has also been associated with Salmonella shedding. Manure in liquid form may be conducive to Salmonella persistence and can be dispersed broadly into the environment, increasing the likelihood of cattle exposure to the organism. Use of sprinklers or misters for heat abatement during the warmer months has also been associated with Salmonella-positive herd status. It is possible that this is related to the ability of Salmonella to thrive in moist environmental conditions. Alternatively, use of heat abatement practices may simply be a proxy for warmer geographic regions where Salmonella prevalence tends to be higher. Other herd-level risk factors for Salmonella shedding include lack of an enclosed building for feed storage and cow access to surface water such as ponds and streams, underscoring the importance of biosecurity measures. Finally, feeding anionic salts to cows near the time of parturition was found to be a risk factor for Salmonella-positive herd status, although the mechanism underlying this association is unclear. Obviously, some of these herd-level risk factors for Salmonella shedding are more amenable to intervention than others.",32.729716822186774,14.270942482985935

Metapopulations may first have no explicit within-patch dynamics (each patch is considered to have a global infection status). Such an approach has been used to study the persistence of a metapopulation when infected by a pathogen (Gog et al. 2002; Hess 1996; McCallum and Dobson 2002) or pathogen spread and persistence when local infection dynamics rapidly reaches an equilibrium (e.g., avian flu: Le Menach et al. 2006; foot-and-mouth disease: Le Menach et al. 2005) . When the within-patch infection dynamics is modelled, the infection status of each individual is considered (Cross et al. 2005; Hess 1996; Jesse et al. 2008; Park et al. 2002) and the status of patches is derived from patch composition. This approach is useful when there is a high variability in the within-patch prevalence among infected patches or for a given patch over time. For example, considering bovine paratuberculosis, infected animals may exit the herd long before being infectious because of a long latency period between infection and shedding (Marcé et al. 2011) . These models are more realistic and give a better overview of all possible epidemiological situations, but are also far more complex.",35.21057625392748,15.144343415130033

Educational attainment, income and occupational status have been used as SES indicators, separately or combined. Education has been linked with health outcomes through disease morbidity, mortality, health behaviour and functional limitations, which does not necessarily imply causation (Hernandez and Blazer, 2006) . Knowledge and skills acquisition have been hypothesized as causal pathways for better health outcomes, including health promotion, health literacy improvement, higher social status and prestige and employment prospects (Cutler and Lleras-Muney, 2006) . The effect of income on health is complicated and difficult to measure because of its dynamic and mutual relationship. The causal pathway of income and health linkage suggests that health is strongly associated with level of household income, with lower income relating to worse health status (Case et al., 2002) . On the other hand, there is evidence that health status is improved in higher income groups (Costello et al., 2003) . Income certainly allows individuals to pay for necessary goods and services, allowing them to maintain their health status, and provides a psychological sense of control and mastery over their environment. Thus higher income is also related with healthier behaviour (Case and Paxson, 2002) .

This means an association between occupational status and health can partly reflect reverse causation (Hernandez and Blazer, 2006) .

IHD is a case in point. It is probable that about half of the substantial reduction in deaths from IHD were related to improvements in health behaviours (attributable largely to public health), with the remaining half attributable to medical care. 61 Both medical care and public health have reduced income-related disparities in IHD, and much of the remaining income-related disparity could be reduced by either public health or medical care interventions. Canadians of lower socioeconomic status are known to have a higher prevalence of various cardiovascular disease risk factors. 49 62 Recent studies have reaffirmed the role of these risk factors for IHD. 63 64 For medical care, the Polypill may substantially reduce IHD 65 and if socioeconomic groups were to adhere equally to the recommendations, income-related IHD disparities could diminish as well. However, it should be noted that differentials in Polypill use and adherence might lead to an increased income-related IHD mortality disparity. Studies conducted by Alter et al 5 66 and Kapral et al 6 have shown that Ontarians from lower income neighbourhoods were less likely to receive specialised health services for acute myocardial infarction and stroke, respectively. However, in both studies, lower income was shown to be associated with mortality independent of medical service characteristics, suggesting that patients of lower socioeconomic status experience greater disease severity owing to factors stemming from outside the medical care setting as well.",41.2300230422895,19.991754483754267

Those in opposition maintain that using taxpayer-funded services to support individuals who enter and remain in the United States illegally undermines the legal system. However, some scholars and legislators have argued that it is both unethical and impractical to deny access to health care services for illegal immigrants living in the United States. 16 They view health care as a basic human right and an obligation of a just society to provide health care for everyone. Leading medical professional societies such as the American Medical Association (AMA), American College of Physicians (ACP), the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), and the American Nurses Association (ANA) reaffirm the position that all individuals living in the United States, regardless of their immigration status, should have access to quality health care, including the opportunity to purchase insurance. These leaders maintain that providing this population with access to health insurance is an evidence-based way to reduce health care costs. [17] [18] [19] Another argument, from a cost perspective, is that many UIs will benefit from preventive care and early treatment of chronic diseases before they advance to lifethreatening and costly complications. 20, 21 Proponents of this strategy advocate for improving health literacy and vaccination rates, and offering health screenings to the UI population to try to prevent long-term adverse health outcomes and control cost. Moreover, UIs may harbor infections such as tuberculosis (TB), which, when undetected, can easily be transmitted to the general public, thus posing a public health risk. 22 In contrast, some have argued that treating UIs creates more expenditures for the United States while saving their countries of origin the costs of providing health care. 23 Furthermore, they argue that sharing inadequate health care resources with UIs will reduce the availability of those scarce resources for US citizens. In the last 2 decades, several states have attempted to advance legislation designed to deny UIs access to publicly funded health services. One such initiative was California's Proposition 187. This law, later deemed unconstitutional, required health care professionals to verify immigration status and report UIs to authorities. 24 In addition, some believe that continued unabated treatment of UIs is an incentive for persistent violation of the immigration laws and threatens national security in the post-9/11 era. 25 Proponents of this argument suggest that denying health care to UIs will discourage others from attempting to immigrate without proper documentation. 24 ",47.982859111845244,19.163627491351875

The UI population is often of lower socioeconomic status, which adds to the difficulties accessing health care. Given that most of the federal insurance plans are unavailable to the UI population, UIs are susceptible to higher out-of-pocket costs for care. In addition, because of undocumented status, they may not have sick leave days and may have difficulty negotiating time off from work to seek care. 8 Decreased proficiency in the language of the host country and fear of deportation may also present barriers to health care for UIs. Studies have shown that patients with limited English language proficiency (LEP) are at higher risk of poor health and have decreased access to health care. Patients who have LEP had increased difficulty in understanding their health status as well as accessing preventive services. 9 Fear of deportation may lead to the avoidance of seeking care and risk of severe health complications, 8 and this also affects health care for US-born children of UIs. In addition, shame and discrimination are common feelings experienced by the UI population and contribute to poor access to health care globally. 8 Many of these issues in health care are not unique to the United States. In a study by Chauvin and colleagues, 10 22% of the UI population in Europe had access to health coverage, and, of those, only about 36% had true access because of barriers such as administrative difficulties, limited language proficiency, and lack of awareness of available services. Of the main reasons for lack of access, administrative difficulties in obtaining health care and finances were cited as the most common.

The risk of getting caught in an avalanche in their own homes or while in a car, bus or train is independent of the individual resident's age. 18 Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the avalanche risk for non-skiers is 14 Previous sensitivity analyses have shown that models assuming a Weibull or log-normal distribution of the error term leads to similar findings concerning the sensitive factors on WTP. Additionally, also a logistic and normal distribution was used, simultaneously allowing for a positive probability of zero responses (analogous to Tobit models). The results in these models also correspond quite well with the findings for the Weibull and log-normal distribution. However, regarding the log likelihood values, the Weibull model is superior to the other distribution assumptions. 15 The error term in the Weibull follows the Type I extreme value distribution where the scale parameter varies across individuals: w i = exp(X i b). 16 CBA are associated with potential pareto improvements. A change is favoured if nobody is getting worse but at least one individual can improve his/her status or, respectively, if the winner of an action could compensate the loser.

The Cooperative Medical Scheme collapsed in most rural areas, due largely to the weakening of collective economies emanating from de facto privatisation of agricultural production. 31 Less than 10% of the rural population was covered by insurance schemes from the late 1980s to 2000. This decline hit the most disadvantaged in the rural areas hardest. In urban areas, a new Urban Employee Basic Health Insurance Scheme has been developed to replace the Government Insurance Scheme and Labour Insurance Scheme, which led to a rapid escalation in health-care costs in the 1980s and early 1990s. Overall coverage of government-run schemes decreased from 44% to 39% over the period 1998 to 2003, while there was an increase from 11% to 16% in coverage by non-mainstream insurance, including commercial schemes. The proportion of the urban population without any form of health insurance was static at around 44% over these 5 years. 32 Coverage increased with age and was highest for men and high-income groups, and Xu and colleagues 32 concluded that inequities in the urban insurance system were increasing. In addition, between 1993 and 1998, the proportion of the population who had to pay out-of-pocket for health care increased from 28% to 44%. 33 In poor rural areas, the proportion having to pay out-of-pocket was estimated as being as high as 90%. 34 Data from the Chinese National Health Service survey in 1998 shows that 7% of the whole rural population was below the government-set poverty line, but when out-of-pocket medical spending was taken into account, the proportion living in poverty increased by 3 percentage points, which is an increase of over 44%. 35 Medical expenditure has clearly become an important cause of transient poverty, and, indeed, one of the major poverty generators in rural China. 26, 35 Recent studies of tuberculosis and poverty in China reveal that, although drugs to treat the disease are free in China, patients still had to pay for other related medicines and diagnostic tests during the course of their treatment. 36 Such a heavy fi nancial burden is one of the main reasons why many patients do not complete the appropriate treatment. 37 Use of and access to health-care services have declined, especially for the poor. 38 Outpatient service use declined for all income groups in urban and rural areas over the decade from 1993 to 2003, with the largest percentage declines in use in the lowest income group (fi gure 5). This decline was related to unaff ordable costs and poor-quality facilities and equipment. 38 Government fi nancing of health care over the past two decades or so has clearly been insuffi cient, as discussed by Hu and co-workers in this Series. 26 Investment in prevention and health protection before the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic was also seriously inadequate. Such problems of low health investment were coupled with rapid rise of medical costs and low effi ciency of service delivery, resulting in an underperforming health system. 39 Local governments in China are commonly asked to take many responsibilities for education, health and social services, but lack suffi cient fi nance to do so. Such unfunded mandates have brought about increased disparities in social services in the regions with diff erent economic development levels. Government recognises that it has to do more but the diffi culty of gaining a stronger appropriate role should not be underestimated.",35.63467037398422,15.294238596176918

In this case, it is a study of how social factors (e.g., class, race, gender, religion, ethnicity, kinship network, marriage, educational status, age, place, and cultural practices) influence human health. The idea of social patterning indicates that these social factors could be the determinants of human health status (see Chap. 4). It is in this sense that some diseases may be referred to as diseases of poverty (e.g., malaria and TB) because they are much more prevalent in poor regions or among the poor. For example, a person residing in a slum is at a higher risk of being exposed to certain diseases which a person in affluent area may have lower risk of being exposed to. Medical sociology is distinct in its approach because it considers the ""import that social and structural factors have on the disease and illness processes as well as on the organisation and delivery of health care"" (Hafferty and Castellani 2006, p. 334 ). Hafferty and Castellani further observed that these factors also include culture (e.g., values, beliefs, normative expectations), organisational processes (e.g., hospital setting), politics (e.g., health care policy, health budget, political ideology), economic system (e.g., capitalism, the costs of health care), and microlevel processes such as socialisation and identity formation.",45.981394891057114,19.780733247041496

The major focus is on the social factors responsible for differential mortality rates in different social groups and societies in general.

During the following 3 months, the vitamin C status of the young animals remained unchanged.

Thus there was a reduction from 75 nmol /L in 1988-1994 to 60 nmol/L in 2001-2004 in the large National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey in the USA (Ginde et al. 2009a ) . Epidemiological studies in several parts of the world indicate that an insuffi cient vitamin D status may be widespread, even in sunny countries. For example, 31 % of a large representative adult population in Australia, 21.4 % of women of child-bearing age in Oman, and 57 % of women and 49 % of men, aged 65 and above, in England all had 25(OH)D levels <50 nmol/L. Efforts have been made to construct models using the action spectrum from the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to previtamin D 3 in the human skin to predict how much sun exposure an individual requires under different climate conditions to ensure a satisfactory vitamin D status ( McKenzie et al. 2009 ( McKenzie et al. , 2011 Diffey 2010 ) . This approach has been supplemented by actual measurement of 25(OH)D levels in volunteers with different skin types, exposed to the simulated sunlight present at particular latitudes at different times of the year (Rhodes et al. 2010 ).",35.994363277813406,14.312628941119923

Inequalities within countries due to race, ethnicity, class, and locality all influence exposure to pathogens, the prevalence of certain risk behaviors (e.g., smoking), and access to health services. Poverty produces its own pathogenic environments, influencing interpersonal and community-level violence, depression and anxiety, work place, vehicular and everyday accidents, and physical and mental trauma from war and displacement, affecting people of all ages.

Terms that are less useful without detailed backup information include specific pathogen-fi'ee (SPF) , and conventional. In general use, SPF refers to animals that are 1) considered to be free of major pathogens and some or all opportunists, 2) maintained under housing and use conditions designed to protect this high-quality status by excluding infectious agents, and 3) monitored closely to assure that there is no undetected introduction of excluded agents. Conventional animals are usually considered to be those that originate from uncontrolled colonies that are not subjected to routine health monitoring, or those in which some degree of monitoring occurs but there is no action taken if infectious agents are found. However, these terms are not really descriptive or representative enough to use when assigning risk to animals proposed for introduction to monitored, disease-free animal facilities. For example, animals from an institution that experienced an outbreak of rat coronavirus and decided not to undertake the steps needed to eliminate the agent from the facility can still be considered to be ""'SPF"", since by definition this status is only defined by the particular list of agents of which the animals are specifically free. The term conventional also suffers from some ambiguity, since it can be used to refer to not only to animal health status but also to facility design. For example, a facility that allows direct staff entry into rat rooms without changing out of street clothes would be termed a conventional facility rather than a ""'barrier"" in the purest sense, but if micro-isolators and high efficiency particulate air (HEPA)-filtered changing hoods have been used to successfully institute pathogen exclusion at the cage level, the animals themselves might possess a high-quality health status that is far from ""conventional."" In practice, it may be more effective to evaluate a specific panel of agents that animals have been tested for than to assign quality descriptions.",38.01659796558637,14.704587985803549

As personal income increases, and this can be measured on a national scale by GDP, there is an increased propensity to travel although other factors including personal and national security, length of annual holidays, and attitudes to travel may be constraints. In destinations, a range of pull factors encourage visitors to select one specific destination over its competitors. Pull factors include the uniqueness of a destination's attractions, its cost structure, security, image and ease of access. In the case of destination H, if its attractions were considered to be unique or even iconic in nature, tourists may be encouraged to increase the size of their travel budgets beyond CC 1 to fund travel. This could be achieved in a number of ways including sacrificing other non travel expenditure, or by changing their holiday cycle from one trip per year to a trip cycle of one trip every two years.

Since these other positive cases imposed additional work load to medical officers, the Other Positive Alarm Rate (OPAR) was also of interest to the system designer. If a traveler who was sick with another illness with fever, and his or her trip was interrupted at a screening station (in airports in the United States, the traveler was sent to the CDC's quarantine station within the airport terminal), the subsequent medical response is required but it is beyond the scope of this research. The OPARs were computed by dividing the number of interrupted travelers who were sick with other illnesses with fever (outcome I SEF |¯), by the total number of travelers who were sick with other illnesses (health status S). The computations of OPARs were presented in Table 4 . As in FAR, in Strategy 0, OPAR = 0.00% because there was no screening. As Strategies 1, 2 and 3 were implemented, the number of interrupted travelers who were sick with other illnesses with fever (outcome I SEF |¯) increased. However, when P SE (¯) remained constant, the total number of travelers who were sick with other illnesses (health status S) stayed the same. The ratio of the two caused the OPAR to increase with Strategies 1, 2 and 3. It was observed that for the same screening strategy, when P SE (¯) was varied between 0.005 and 0.015, both the number of positive alarms as well as the number of travelers who were sick with other illnesses increased. Overall, with the same screening strategy, when the P SE (¯) was tripled from 0.005 to 0.015, the increase in OPAR was at most 0.12%. Comparing the magnitude of 0.12% with OPAR in the range of 14.56%-20.01%, it was concluded that, although the P SE (¯) estimate was not certain, the OPAR was insensitive to the change in P SE (¯) values. Brown et al. (2014) reported that, between August and October 2014, 80,000 travelers left the Ebola affected countries, of which 18,000 arrived in the United States. The exit screening at the airports of the disease affected countries in West Africa did not identify any traveler who was sick with Ebola (carrier or spreader, with health status SE). There was no entry screening at airports in the United States during that period. This screening scenario was similar to Strategy 1 but most likely without proper execution, and the results were similar to what was obtained with Strategy 0. In this situation, the correct detection rate was zero, even when the number of travelers with health status of SE between August and October 2014 was unlikely to be zero. There were two travelers with health status SE who entered the United States uninterrupted. In fact, their health status was SEF at the time of arrival, but they developed a fever not long after.

At the beginning of the interview, respondents were asked to identify the characteristics of people most at risk of TB. The item aimed to explore whether layers of stigma might be associated with TB. Sixteen response options were offered from which respondents could choose four (Table 1) . Options included both social and environmental factors considered to be relevant in a high TB prevalence setting: HIV-co-infection, poverty, overcrowded living conditions, low social status indicated by lack of education and employment, and a tainted character or lack of social respectability indicated by non-conformist or socially discredited behaviour such as laziness, promiscuity, not going to church regularly, frequenting shebeens, and excessive drinking and smoking. Table 1 shows that over four rounds of responses, the highest proportion of respondents identified people who 'drink and smoke a lot' to be at the greatest risk of TB. With 71%, the 'drink/smoke' option was endorsed by far the highest proportion of voters, followed by exposure to dust (59%), HIV-positive status (50%), and poor living conditions (48 and 34%, respectively). The 'drinkers and smokers' option crowded out characteristics that might be regarded as markers of lower social status associated with joblessness, poverty, and lack of education; or with social deviance or a flawed character (Goffman 1963) as in the case of laziness, having served a prison sentence, engaging in promiscuous sexual relationships, or failing to attend church on a regular basis.",32.03469710215022,15.277287654404157

Two studies have examined this and reported conflicting results. The first study from Kenya demonstrated a significantly higher mortality rate in breastfeeding mothers compared with a formula feeding group in the 2 years after delivery. The hypothesized explanation offered by the authors for this difference was increased metabolic demands, greater weight loss, and nutritional depletion. 189 A second study from South Africa showed an overall lower mortality rate in the two groups with no significant difference in mortality rate over 10 months of observation. 66 In summary, breastfeeding of infants by HIVpositive mothers does lead to an increased risk of HIV infection in the infant. There is much still to be understood about the mechanisms of HIV transmission via breast milk and the action and efficacy of interventions to prevent such transmission. The complete avoidance of breastfeeding remains a crucial component for the prevention of perinatal HIV infection in the United States and many other countries. In resource-poor settings, where breastfeeding is the norm and where it provides vital nutritional and infection protective benefits, the WHO, UNICEF, and UNAIDS recommend education, counseling, and support for HIV-infected mothers so they can make an informed choice concerning infant feeding. Mothers choosing to breastfeed should receive additional education, support, and medical care to minimize the risk of HIV transmission and to optimize their own health status during and after breastfeeding. Mothers choosing to use replacement feedings should receive parallel education, support, and medical care for themselves and their infants to minimize the effect of the lack of breastfeeding. The decision about infant feeding for the HIV-positive mother remains a true dilemma-a choice between two equally unsatisfactory alternatives. It is only through continued research and education concerning the potential interventions to prevent HIV transmission via breast milk that we can minimize transmission and optimize infant nutrition and health.",36.74060955905146,15.000632723591021

Unfortunately the nature of this change is not clearly documented and still being studied. Some states are more attractive to elderly. However, limited research exists on association between an extensive set of location-specific factors and the migration of retirement-age individuals. For instance, Duncombe et al. (2003) estimated an individual-level location-choice model by using a combination of place-characteristics data and Census county-to-county migration data, identifying income taxes to have the largest relative effects. However, other factors, including climate, economic conditions, and population characteristics, appear to play much larger roles in migration and location decisions. Such findings may provide clues to understanding geographic distribution and the change in the level of health care demands, particularly in the context of aging America. Understanding of the temporal pattern of the geographic distribution of the population, including the urban elderly, will provide insight into the future trends and facilitate strategic planning of needed services.

Thus, precarity has been called 'shadowy and contested' (Vosko et al., 2009: 1) . Vosko (2011: 194) notes that it is 'work for remuneration characterized by uncertainty, low income, and limited social benefits and statutory entitlements'. Despite on-going debate, Vosko (2015) notes that the term can refer to a host of employment security deficiencies, and it is increasingly understood as labour market insecurity that extends beyond older debates about a precarious-secure jobs dichotomy to include multiple forms of labour market insecurity that can define any job (Vosko, 2015) . Precarious employment is defined by gender, nationality, race, ethnicity, (im)migrant status, (dis)ability and age inequalities (Bakan and Stasiulis, 1997; Vosko et al., 2009; Zeytinoglu and Muteshi, 2000) . As Cranford and colleagues note, '… the growth of precarious employment is gendered and racialized ' (2003: 6) . Building on Rodgers and Rodgers' (1989) work, Vosko (2015) argues that four key dimensions are central to measuring precarity. 'Degree of certainty' captures the impacts of short-term contracts, short-term employment relationships, and risk of termination. 'Regulatory protection' considers whether workers are protected by labour standards, statutory and social employment benefits, and whether regulations are enforceable. 'Control over the labour process' reflects the work organization and its execution. Finally, 'income level' measures the total direct and indirect income that workers receive, including their wages and payment as well as government transfers and government-and employer-sponsored benefits. Measurement of precarious labour requires documenting and contextualizing labour force conditions, including part-time, temporary and agency work. The ways in which precarious work is experienced in different sectors requires on-going scholarly attention.",45.94585276269684,17.82389698245445

This is likely because the crowd density is much lower and because collective housing is not common at these events. Large music festivals, by contrast, share some characteristics with the Hajj regarding crowd density and housing conditions in tent camps. The younger age of the participants at music festivals likely account for the distinct pattern of pathogens responsible for outbreaks in this context, compared to that of the Hajj. 89 Other large religious MGs, like the Kumb Mela, have been poorly studied and the data concerning the health status of the pilgrims and potential health risks are scarce. 90 Hopefully, public health research projects, developed in the context of international scientific collaboration, will elucidate the dynamics of communicable diseases transmission during the MGs and the consequence for their international spread. Large multinational cohort surveys are needed to better assess the risk of respiratory pathogens acquisition at MGs. The role of host factor including vaccination status, underlying chronic diseases age, and so on, and the role of environmental factors on the transmission of viruses and bacteria also warrant investigation.

Asylum seekers and persons applying for refugee status are funded by the State Agency for Refugees. In case they have acquired refugee status or the right to asylum, they are obliged to pay health insurance themselves to access the basic package of health care to which Bulgarian citizens are entitled under the insurance system. However, the vast majority of refugees cannot cover their health insurance. For this reason, in March 2017 the Bulgarian government passed a normative act creating an obligation for municipalities to cover health insurance expenses of migrants with official refugee status already granted. After strong public outcry the government withdrew the proposed act and this issue remains open. Moreover, even when migrants fulfil their financial contribution, the number of refugees with an assigned GP is limited due to language barriers and the reluctance of many GPs to take on patients whose residence is likely to be temporary [27, p. 6] . The other important recommendation of the WHO assessment mission to Bulgaria is the revision of the disease surveillance early warning and response system, introducing syndromic surveillance to increase early detection of outbreaks and effectively monitoring selected disease trends [27, p. 6] . Such a syndromic surveillance system has not been created yet and it is unknown whether the government plans to implement one.

However, a perfect reference test (often termed a ""gold standard"") is rarely available and for endemic diseases, which is the case for BRSV and BCV in Norway, no reference population with complete certainty regarding disease or disease freedom exists. Consequently, the underlying true infection status for test subjects remains unknown. Test validation studies (erroneously) assuming perfect reference tests are common, even though this has been shown to introduce bias in the estimation of accuracy parameters (Valenstein, 1990; Lijmer et al., 1999) . Latent class analysis (LCA) allows for the estimation of test parameters in populations where the underlying true infection status cannot be determined (Hui and Walter, 1980) .

Due to the cross-sectional nature, it was not possible to ascertain the vaccination status of calves in the study with certainty, instead we relied on the in-person surveyreported vaccination protocols, although respondents were asked to answer the questions with respect to the current cohort of calves on their premises during the visit. If calves were older than the age of vaccination stated in the questionnaire they were considered vaccinated. However, the true vaccination status and time since vaccination may have been different for an unknown number of calves. No associations between reported vaccination status and BRD were found when calves at least 7 d older than age of vaccination were considered vaccinated to account for time to initiate an immune response. Our findings correlated with a randomized clinical trial by Windeyer et al. (2012) of 2,874 heifer calves on 19 commercials dairy farms in Minnesota and Ontario, in which they found no difference in risk of BRD between calves vaccinated at 2 or 5 wk of age or both with a commercial multivalent modified live vaccine against the common respiratory viruses compared with a placebo control group. Those authors cited interference by maternal antibodies, unresponsiveness of the neonatal immune system, timing of immunity relative to pathogen exposure, disease caused by pathogens other than the viruses in the vaccine, or herd immunity as possible explanations for their findings. The vaccination of dams may only be effective in preventing calfhood BRD in combination with adequate transfer of passive immunity. Many factors can affect the efficiency of transfer of passive immunity, from the amount, quality, and timing of colostrum fed to the storage time and temperature (Pithua et al., 2013 , Williams et al., 2014 , Lago et al., 2018 . It is possible that any positive effect of dam vaccination may have been diluted by other variables affecting transfer of passive immunity. In a longitudinal study following over 11,300 preweaned calves on 5 dairies in California and associating management factors to BRD in the calves, vaccinating dams with either a killed or a modified live vaccine reduced the risk of disease in calves. . The longitudinal study design combined with close follow-up of management practices by verifying changes every 1 to 4 mo in a few dairies may have been the reason that study found these associations, whereas in the present study they were not apparent. The complexity of factors involving vaccination of neonatal calves combined with the present study design make it difficult to extend recommendations based on our findings.",32.00423286381123,14.276315247098259

Apart from the patient demographics (e.g., age, sex, race, mode of arrival, insurance status) and clinical factors (e.g., chief complaint, triage category), LOS is highly dependent on factors that are either at the ED or hospital level (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) . The former includes disposition status, patient census, and bed occupancy rate, whereas the latter includes hospital census and inpatient bed occupancy rate (3, 4, (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) . Similarly, waiting times are another key indicator of ED performance, and prolonged waiting times can increase the risk of health (1, 6, 11, 12) . Although there have been a few studies regarding the effect of non-urgent patients on crowding in the ED, little is known about how emergent patients affect crowding and the consequent service delay to the majority of non-emergent patients in the ED (12) .

In Hong Kong, the Hospital Authority has set waiting time targets for patients since 1999, and thus has created intense pressure on health systems to meet these targets (13) .",37.462431268927276,17.263117864691104

The roles in these veterinary-physician relationships would need to be established from the start so that the veterinarians would not be at risk of appearing to practice medicine. For example, veterinarians could provide an assessment of an animal's health status to a physician whose patient is immunocompromised and insists on keeping his or her companion animal. Since companion animal ownership has psychologic and physiologic benefits, this type of collaboration and cooperation between the 2 professions would be invaluable to patients. The veterinarian would provide regular checkups to the companion animal to ensure that its health status is closely monitored. In the occupational setting, regular veterinary monitoring of all involved animals' health may not be possible; however, if a worker were immunocompromised, then a careful assessment should be made about his or her continuing that line of work.

Most scoring systems predict mortality; however, few assess other clinical outcomes such as physical functional ability, cognitive ability, need for nursing home care, and overall quality of life which are important outcomes for older adults (15) . The pneumonia severity index (PSI) derived and validated by Fine et al. is a two-step 20 variable scoring system that is best at identifying patients that can be treated as outpatients. However, many older adults fall into the high-risk groups purely based on their age; therefore, it is not as useful at predicting treatment outcomes in this group of patients (15) . Lim et al. derived and validated CURB65, a modified version of the scoring system of the British Thoracic Society. This system consists of five parameters: c onfusion, u remia, r espiratory rate, low b lood pressure, and age ³ 65 years (16) . CURB65 has been shown to be useful in the emergency department because of its simplicity of use and ability to identify low-risk patients (17) . Modifications to CURB65 to account for age ³ 85 years and higher blood urea levels further identify those of the older cohort with severe pneumonia (18) . In one scoring system derived and validated among seniors ³ 65 years of age, five features were independently predictive of hospital mortality: age > 85 years, impaired motor response, creatinine level of >1.5 mg/dL, presence of coexisting disease, and extremely abnormal vital signs (19) . In all of these scoring systems, age > 85 years has been shown to be the greatest predictor of mortality. Currently, no scoring systems exist that predict outcomes other than mortality in the care of older adults with pneumonia but several observational studies in nursing home populations document a decline in function after pneumonia. In a prospective study of nursing home residents with lower respiratory tract infection, the incidence in decline of functional status was 29%. Those that had a decline in functional status at 30 days after pneumonia episode were less likely to recover to their baseline status at 90 days (20) . Similarly, in a large prospective trial of older adults, functional decline occurred more rapidly among subjects who developed infection and there was a dose response with an increased risk of decline as the number of infectious episodes increased (20) .",33.11450625914172,15.661560612025283

Monitoring of nutrition status, discussed in detail in Chapter 8, is of fundamental importance to population health evaluation. Periodic large-scale national surveys, such as the NHANES, initiated in 1971 in the USA, provide meaningful information on nutrition status in the country. Within the USA, the surveys provide vital information for adjusting recommended dietary allowances and national, state, or local nutrition programs. This information is of great importance for the food industry, which is obliged to follow federal government standards of labeling and content of packaged and processed foods. Safety of community water, management of solid and toxic wastes, air and noise pollution, and ambient air standards are all factors in the health of the community. Organized public health has traditionally focused on these issues, but they remain public policy issues in virtually all countries and internationally. Healthy societies are dealing with these issues with a very high degree of public awareness, sometimes overcoming strong economic interest groups to force improved attention to the environment by governments, communities, and businesses. Environment includes housing, recreation, schools, businesses, parks, urban and rural planning, and many other aspects of community life that are addressed in ""healthy community"" initiatives.

Those in opposition maintain that using taxpayer-funded services to support individuals who enter and remain in the United States illegally undermines the legal system. However, some scholars and legislators have argued that it is both unethical and impractical to deny access to health care services for illegal immigrants living in the United States. 16 They view health care as a basic human right and an obligation of a just society to provide health care for everyone. Leading medical professional societies such as the American Medical Association (AMA), American College of Physicians (ACP), the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), and the American Nurses Association (ANA) reaffirm the position that all individuals living in the United States, regardless of their immigration status, should have access to quality health care, including the opportunity to purchase insurance. These leaders maintain that providing this population with access to health insurance is an evidence-based way to reduce health care costs. [17] [18] [19] Another argument, from a cost perspective, is that many UIs will benefit from preventive care and early treatment of chronic diseases before they advance to lifethreatening and costly complications. 20, 21 Proponents of this strategy advocate for improving health literacy and vaccination rates, and offering health screenings to the UI population to try to prevent long-term adverse health outcomes and control cost. Moreover, UIs may harbor infections such as tuberculosis (TB), which, when undetected, can easily be transmitted to the general public, thus posing a public health risk. 22 In contrast, some have argued that treating UIs creates more expenditures for the United States while saving their countries of origin the costs of providing health care. 23 Furthermore, they argue that sharing inadequate health care resources with UIs will reduce the availability of those scarce resources for US citizens. In the last 2 decades, several states have attempted to advance legislation designed to deny UIs access to publicly funded health services. One such initiative was California's Proposition 187. This law, later deemed unconstitutional, required health care professionals to verify immigration status and report UIs to authorities. 24 In addition, some believe that continued unabated treatment of UIs is an incentive for persistent violation of the immigration laws and threatens national security in the post-9/11 era. 25 Proponents of this argument suggest that denying health care to UIs will discourage others from attempting to immigrate without proper documentation. 24 ",48.72005156899434,19.421644851354056

The UI population is often of lower socioeconomic status, which adds to the difficulties accessing health care. Given that most of the federal insurance plans are unavailable to the UI population, UIs are susceptible to higher out-of-pocket costs for care. In addition, because of undocumented status, they may not have sick leave days and may have difficulty negotiating time off from work to seek care. 8 Decreased proficiency in the language of the host country and fear of deportation may also present barriers to health care for UIs. Studies have shown that patients with limited English language proficiency (LEP) are at higher risk of poor health and have decreased access to health care. Patients who have LEP had increased difficulty in understanding their health status as well as accessing preventive services. 9 Fear of deportation may lead to the avoidance of seeking care and risk of severe health complications, 8 and this also affects health care for US-born children of UIs. In addition, shame and discrimination are common feelings experienced by the UI population and contribute to poor access to health care globally. 8 Many of these issues in health care are not unique to the United States. In a study by Chauvin and colleagues, 10 22% of the UI population in Europe had access to health coverage, and, of those, only about 36% had true access because of barriers such as administrative difficulties, limited language proficiency, and lack of awareness of available services. Of the main reasons for lack of access, administrative difficulties in obtaining health care and finances were cited as the most common.

In 1958, a new citizens' health insurance law formally committed Japan to universal health coverage by making enrolment in governmental insurance systems mandatory for people not covered by employee-based plans, and by 1961 all municipalities had established insurance programmes with near-complete coverage. 52 The Japanese Government has been providing free hepatitis testing since 2002 for all citizens aged 40-70 years as part of routine health examinations.

Having both parents in paid employment increased the ILI costs probably due to the primary carer and the partner taking time off work to look after the sick child. The lost productivity due to time off work plus costs of recreation time lost accounted for the majority of ILI costs in this study that is consistent with the literature. 20, 21 In our study, particularly where both parents work, even simple ILIs without a GP visit can be costly because of carers' taking time off work. Apart from economic impact, qualitative interviews conducted with a subsample of the carers in this study also demonstrated that these parents have larger quality-of-life impact in terms of daily and social life disruption. 22 To our knowledge, ours is the first study that demonstrates the duration of respiratory infection, when managed outside a hospital, is associated with higher economic costs. This finding may suggest that for future efforts in assessing the economic impacts of a respiratory disease, the measurement of infection duration should be taken into account as a proxy for economic burden.

While the former may register to work and receive a permit, and eventually a South Africa identification number also enabling access to the health-care system, to do so, they are required to renew this on a regular basis. In early 2017, the South African government changed the length of such a permit from six to one month. That means that a worker, a teacher for instance, must take at least a day of leave every month, venture into the overburdened Department of Home Affairs, and hope for a clerk on duty who will apply the stamp to extend the permit. Very often, one day in line is inadequate. 3 Whether or not an employee requiring such onerous and unpredictable paperwork is retained becomes an open question with myriad human security consequences: for instance, for pupils in school and for any family members dependent upon the employment status of the migrant worker for their own residency permits.

Moreover, the procedures applied for intentional infection (feed back) of the sow population to speed up the induction of immunity to be passively transfered to the litter could be considered as a potential cause of worsening of the clinical status of the suckling pigs. In fact, that practice can also be a source of other pathogens for gilts/sows and/or for newborn piglets.

However, it lacks technical sophistication and typically operates outside regulatory purview, and its practice overlooked and tolerated by local authorities. Animals pose a risk to human health and other animals, are a public nuisance, and contribute to the waste accumulating on streets and the run off contaminating the environment and water sources. Livestock products, raw or processed are sold in street markets and may enter the urban food chain. Animal ownership is difficult to establish in slums and livestock population difficult to determine. Under these circumstances, veterinary services and disease-control programs may be hard to implement. Good hygiene, good manufacturing practices, and animal slaughter inspection turn into an impossible task to implement and enforce.

Financial realities must be considered. It is important to address the cost of care and give clients a schedule and treatment plan (including a cost estimate) for upcoming visits so that they can plan for these expenses. The AAHA strongly suggests that all pet-owning families consider their ability to meet unexpected expenses that may be incurred for veterinary care (Box 8-1). The expenses may be met through existing savings, credit card reserves, Care Credit or other medical payment cards, monthly budgeting for pet care expenses, or pet health insurance policies. Pet health insurance has become a good method of mitigating health care expenses. The proportion of cats insured varies greatly among different countries, but it is almost invariably lower than the proportion of dogs insured. Pet insurance can provide excellent value for the cost and allow patients to receive highly expensive urgent care and crisis management that may not be feasible otherwise. Many policies now offer preventive health care coverage. Each insurance company works differently, and clients are encouraged to review policies carefully. Few clients are aware of pet insurance without a specific veterinary recommendation; the veterinary team should explain benefits and possible limitations of pet insurance. The National Commission on Veterinary Economic Issues (NCVEI) position paper, ""A veterinarian's guide to pet health insurance,"" contains excellent information to help veterinarians and veterinary teams learn more about pet insurance. 100 In the United States there is also a website that helps consumers compare various pet health insurance companies (Pet Insurance Review, see Box 8-1).",35.93707178435666,16.091242152856587

Longitudinal data since 2002 showed that community health centres in urban areas could provide better health care, demonstrated by an increased breastfeeding rate and decreased prevalence of lower respiratory tract infection compared with hospital outpatient clinics. 265 In Fuzhou, patients at community health centres are more likely to report better experiences with primary care attributes than patients visiting hospital facilities. 267 In Shanghai, a survey of residents showed that they consider community health centres for convenience, good services, and low cost. On average, they paid ¥16·2 ($2·4) less for their first visit when using these centres between 2006 and 2010. 268 However, community health centres in China are still not functioning as the first contact points and regular sources of care. There are still many problems in the development of these centres, including unsustainable governmental roles, inadequate human resources, laggard general physician practices, poorly designed payment schemes, and a crisis of trust. 265 Additional policy efforts are needed to help community health centres to develop. Recent government investments in public health and primary care alone are not sufficient and might not be sustainable. It will not relieve an omnipotent government until long-term self-sustaining mechanisms are established, including a competent general practitioner system, supportive social insurance reimbursement, appropriate financial incentives to providers, better transparency and accountability, more regulations for the referral system, and a legitimate, sustainable, and quality community health system. 269 Health insurance is an important means of achieving universal health coverage. The health reform that started in 2009 has a clear mandate to increase access to health care. To fulfil that mandate, the three types of state-sponsored insurance schemes (Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance, Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance, and new rural cooperative medical system) have been expanded dramatically in China. Findings from consecutive Chinese National Health Services Surveys 270 showed that medical insurance coverage has increased from 29·7% of the total population in 2003, to 87·9% in 2008, and 95·7% in 2011 ( figure 12) . Only 17 million urban residents (4·1% of all urban residents at the time) enrolled into a medical insurance programme when they started in 1998. 7 By 2016, the number of people enrolled in urban medical insurance programmes had already increased to 743·9 million (93·8% of all urban residents). 8 This increased coverage is associated with a substantial increase in health service utilisation and decrease in economic burden; for example, the Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance scheme reduced out-of-pocket inpatient expenditure by 64·5% and the Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance scheme reduced it by 45·6%. 272 As a result, the out-of-pocket expenditure as a percentage of private expenditure on health declined from 95·6% in 2000 to 72·3% in 2014. 273 The national reimbursement ratio, which reflects the average reimbursement level of state-sponsored insurance, increased from 22·4% in 2009 to 26·4% in 2011. 274 However, the effect of health insurance in China is highly heterogeneous among different population subgroups. Overall, health insurance leads to greater reduction in economic burden in retired people but has a smaller effect on decreasing the burden for individuals with a low income and low levels of education. 272 There is a discrepancy between the reimbursement rate estimated from health expenditure (26·4%) and the reported reimbursement rate for listed services (50-60%) in 2011. This discrepancy suggests that the services covered by state-sponsored health insurance were not sufficient to meet residents' demand. 274 Furthermore, the current health insurance scheme offers weak protection against rare diseases. It was estimated that, at a national scale, 247 620 urban residents could be lowered into poverty because of the medical cost caused by seven rare diseases in 2014. 275 The uneven results are mostly caused by the decentralised and incremental approach to universal health coverage in China. The varied financing capacity of local governments leads to high variability of benefit packages for health insurance. For example, a 2011-12 survey of people aged 60 years or older in Xi'an, Wuhan, and Shanghai showed that the inpatient reimbursement rate was 45·5-81·2%, and the outpatient reimbursement rate was 4·1-100%. Multiple insurance schemes reduce efficiency and increase abuse and barriers to access at the same time. 276 The Chinese Government announced its plan to merge Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance and new rural cooperative medical system in early 2016, which is a starting point for the ultimate consolidation of all state-sponsored health insurance schemes and for the achievement of equal benefits for all. 277 Rural migrants, elderly people, and those with non-communicable diseases in cities will benefit the most from the consolidation of the existing health insurance schemes with extended funding pools. 278 Health services to migrants have been strengthened. 98·2% of migrants are covered by at least one type of medical insurance and 97·9% of migrant children are covered by the national imunisation programme. 279 Nevertheless, there is room for improvement. For example, in a comparative study 280 done in eight cities in the Pearl River Delta, female migrants of reproductive age were less covered by health insurance schemes and had less free health care than women with permanent urban residence.",34.026369831579395,16.0632906631292

In the 1970s, China was a model of health equity for the rest of the world for its provision of universal health care. However, the first health reform, which stretched from the mid-1980s to the end of the 1990s, changed China's health-care system permanently. The reform successfully introduced market mechanisms but undermined universal access to health care. In 1981, 70% of the population was covered by three insurance schemes: the Government Insurance Scheme, the Labor Insurance Scheme for urban residents, and the Co-operative Medical System for rural residents. Preventive care was provided by the government at nearly zero cost to recipients. During the reform, many people lost their insurance coverage when state-owned enterprises were shut down and when collective farms were dismantled. Coverage under all insurance schemes dropped to 20% in 1993. 184 Because of these and other factors, health inequity across sex, age groups, and geographic locations is increasing in terms of disease burdens and life expectancy. For example, life expectancy for men in Tibet in 1990 was 18·9 years (95% uncertainty interval 16·0-21·8) shorter than their counterparts in Shanghai; life expectancy for women was 21·4 years (18·7-24·3) shorter. Less developed regions also had higher burdens of infectious disease (eg, tuberculosis) than did developed regions. 56 Equity in the health-care system deteriorated so rapidly that, in 2000, the WHO considered China one of the least equitable systems in the world; fairness of financial contributions to health care in China were ranked 188th of 191 countries and regions. 185 The Chinese Government started the second stage of reform in 1998 but health inequity was not a central focus. Health inequity was still ubiquitous; for example, life expectancy in different regions still varied by as much as 11·8 years (95% uncertainty interval 9·3-14·5) for men and 12·8 years (10·7-15·0) for women in 2013. 56 The difference in height between urban boys in east and west China actually increased during 1985-2010, highlighting the disparity in child development in different regions. 186 Among Chinese adults, the values of the Apouey index of health inequality increased by 126·8% between 1997 and 2009 in urban areas. 5 Professional, income, sex, and age distinctions have an ever-greater role in Chinese society, with social and economic inequalities contributing to increased health inequity. Widened income inequality is one reason why economic growth since the second stage of health reform did not improve health equity in China. The Gini coefficient of family income in urban areas of China was 0·51 in 2012, 187 significantly higher than the national value of 0·40 for the USA and the average value of 0·32 for Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries in the same year. 188 Between 1991 and 2006, income changes in urban areas accounted for 7·1% of rising inequality of urban health. 189 In 2013, economic status was estimated to account for 13-14% of health inequality in urban populations. 190 Urban residents can be divided into groups of poor, lower middle, upper middle, and rich based on household income and regional characteristics. 191 The minimum living standard for urban residents set by local governments is used as an urban poverty line for the practical purposes of providing social relief or assistance to poor urban households. With the expansion of rural-to-urban migration and the extensive urban economic reforms of the late 1990s, the population of the urban poor substantially increased, only levelling off since 2010 (figure 10).",35.09243385994017,13.482885406427116

One modified procedure of the technique is ""the twice-application method"" of the tree drawing technique. The technique is administered by drawing a tree in the first picture and then immediately drawing a tree again in the second picture. It has been demonstrated that through this technique the subject expresses their self-image in two different projection levels-""social attitude"" in the first picture, and ""internal self-image"" in the second. However, little recent studies have addressed the validity of the technique. Therefore, the present study aims to examine the relationship between the twice-application method of the treedrawing technique and ego identity. The participants were 277 university students who completed the twice-application method of the tree drawing technique and the ego identity status scales. In the present study, we scored the forms of the tree trunk drawing because the relationship between the indices in that element of the drawing and ego status has already been examined. The results of the ego identity status scales demonstrated that the subjects were distributed in identity statuses as follows: 15 identity achievements and 46 identity diffusions. The tree drawings of two groups were compared by chi-square tests. As a result of chi-square tests, we observed that identityachieved individuals who drew a trunk at the center in the first picture with consecutive lines also drew a trunk of medium thickness in the second picture. On the other hand, identitydiffused individuals who drew a trunk on the left side or the right side with a considerably wide trunk base in the first picture also drew a trunk with discontinuous lines and a thin trunk in the second picture. These results reveal that the uncertainty and the conflicts of their self-images were expressed in the twiceapplication method of the tree drawing technique. Adolescent smoking in China has become a major public health problem, with initiation rates on the rise, comparable to those in Western countries (Unger et al, 2001) . While many studies have documented the associations between peer influences and smoking behaviors in the U.S. (Hoffman et al, 2006 ) and among Chinese adolescents (Weiss et al., 2008) fewer studies have shown how these influences occur in relation to one's popularity and social status as measured by an individual's position in their social network. Furthermore, recent advances in social media channels now serve as an extension of one's social network and sphere of influence. Online social network sites such as Facebook (QQ in China) and mobile phone text messaging are rapidly gaining popularity. This study examines the interplay between these new media channels, peer influences, and smoking outcomes. Data were collected from 5,563 students from 24 professional and vocational high schools in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, China. Exploratory factor analysis of 12 Internet usage items revealed two types of online activity-social and non-social. Students' social status was measured by the number of ""wellliked"" nominations from classmates and the outcome variable was past-month smoking. Multilevel logistic models were constructed, controlling for school-level random effects and subject-level covariates such as age, gender, SES, friend smoking and friend media use. Results indicated that social Internet activity (gaming, chatting) was a risk factor for smoking (p=.01), while non-social Internet activity (news, forums, homework) had a protective effect (p<.01) among adolescents. High social status was positively associated with smoking (p<.01) and was found to significantly moderate the association between mobile phone usage and smoking (p=.04). Findings suggest that media usage may have differential effects on risky adolescent behaviors, which may have implications for designing tailored Web or mobile phone-based applications for health promotion interventions. Whereas race/ethnic disparities in health have been widely documented in pediatric populations, there is a dearth of information regarding disparities in quality of life (QOL) of children in the general population. Reflecting the child's wellbeing across multiple domains, QOL captures well the broad meaning of health espoused by WHO. This research therefore examined whether there are race/ethnic disparities in QOL. A multi-site study enrolled 4,824 5th grade children from one of the three major race/ethnic groups in the U.S. (Hispanic=38%, African American=36%, White=26%). Children reported their QOL with the PedsQL providing scores for their physical and psychosocial domains, as well as with instruments to measure selfworth and social well-being. Parents rated children's overall health status and provided demographic information on the household. Complex sampling analysis revealed non-White children reporting significantly lower QOL in all domains than White children. However, after controlling for SES differences (parent's education, income), these race/ethnic disparities remained only in the domains of school, self-worth, satisfaction with appearance, and social well-being. After also controlling for family contextual differences (family structure, English proficiency), disparities remained in the domain of social well-being only. Findings suggest that disparities across race/ethnicity in children are, mainly, products of sociodemographic differences, rather than being endemic to minority race/ethnic groups. As one of the first studies examining racial/ethnic disparities in QOL of children in the general population, this study provides a basis for further exploration of contextual influences on the QOL experienced by children. Correspondence education was introduced into Japan from the United States in 1946, and many working young people used it to learn. However, since many of the students today have mental or physical health problems, in this study we conducted a questionnaire survey by mail of 1984 students enrolled in correspondence high schools in two regions of Japan in order to determine the health status of the students and factors that affect it. 1083 students out of 1452 students (reply rate: 73.2%), who were included in the analysis, were between 15 and 29 years of age and were not being treated for any diseases and had replied to all of the items on a psychosomatic complaints scale (valid reply rate: 54.6%). The chi-square test was used to statistically analyze associations between psychosomatic complaints and both personal attributes and lifestyle habits according to gender, and the t-test was used for age and the self-esteem scale scores. We identified items which has a significant difference, and then performed a multiple logistic regression analysis. The results for factors that affected psychosomatic complaints among the males showed that low self-esteem (OR=0.90,95% CI=0.87-0.94,p<0.001), irregular or skipped breakfasts (OR= 1.91, p=0 .01), being a fussy eater (OR = 1.84,95%CI = 1.17-2.89,p = 0.008), and age (OR = 1.13,95% CI= 1.03-1.24,p=0.008) increased psychosomatic complaints. Among the females, low self-esteem (OR=0.89,95%CI=0.86-0.92,p<0.001), poor health status during puberty (OR=2.93,95% CI=1. 75-4.90,p<0 .001), being a fussy eater (OR=2.57, p<0.001) , and being a smoker (OR=1.95, p=0 .011) increased psychosomatic complaints. ""Low self-esteem"" and ""being a fussy eater"" increased psychosomatic complaints in both sexes. Thus, we would like to make a program which allows correspondence high school students themselves to reconsider their diets by increasing their self-esteem for the future investigation. BACKGROUND: US adolescent obesity increased from 5% to 18.1% between 1976-1980 and 2007-2008 . In addition to health complications (e.g., type 2 diabetes), adolescents who are obese are at risk for developing negative body image which is related to depression and is a risk factor for eating pathology. Having a supportive peer group is an essential part of healthy adolescent development, and for overweight adolescents, could be a protective factor against negative body image. PURPOSE: To examine whether the association between adolescent weight status and body image varies by peer support. METHODS: A US nationally-representative sample of 6,909 students in grades 6 -10 with over-sampling of African-American and Hispanic students completed the 2006 Health Behavior in School-aged Children survey. Body image, was assessed with 5 items (α = .87) asking for agreement or disagreement with statements about one's body. Weight status, determined from body mass index, was computed from selfreported height and weight and categorized using CDC 2000 growth charts. Peer support was computed as the average of 8 items (α = .67) asking about interactions with peers; higher scores indicated greater peer support. Linear regressions, separately by gender and controlling for age, race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status, were conducted with an interaction term (weight status x peer support). RESULTS: Adolescents' overweight status was related to poor body image in boys and girls. However, peer support moderated the relationship between weight status and body image for girls but not for boys. Overweight girls with higher peer support were more likely to have a positive body image (β=−0.69, p<0.000) compared to overweight girls with lower peer support (β=−.99, p<0.000). Overweight boys had lower body image compared to their normal weight peers, regardless of the level of peer support. CONCLUSION: Encouraging adolescent girls to develop strong healthy relationships with peers may prevent a negative body image. More research is needed to examine whether these findings vary by individual (e.g., race) or familial (e.g., presence of parental support) characteristics.",37.8236072795904,18.168141414529156

The aim of this study was to describe the evolving RTW-process in a 5-year follow-up period after a 4-weeks inpatient occupational rehabilitation program. Methods: The sample consisted of 584 patients (66% females, mean age 44 years [sd=9.3], long-term sick-listed; mean duration 9.3 months [sd=3.4] for psychological (47%) and musculoskeletal (46%) diagnosis. Register data from The National Insurance Administration in Norway over a 5-year follow-up period was analysed. Outcome was measured in an 8 state-model: working, part-time sick-listed, sick-listed, medical rehabilitation, vocational rehabilitation, part-time disability pension, time-limited disability pension and permanent disability pension. Extended statistical tools for multistate models were used to calculate transition probabilities between the different states. Results: During the 5-year follow-up period the patients had on average 4.6 [range [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] shifts between the 8 different states. During the first 30 days after rehabilitation 9% returned to full time work, 23% were graded sick-listed, 45% were full-time sicklisted, 15% were on medical rehabilitation, 6% on vocational rehabilitation and 2% on graded disability pension. After 5 years 58% had returned to full-time work, 0% was sick-listed or on medical rehabilitation, 10% were on vocational rehabilitation, 14% on part-time disability pension, 5 % on time-limited disability pension and 13% received permanent disability pension. Conclusions: The RTW-process for long-term sick-listed individuals is long and complex. Despite poor RTW during the first 30 days after occupational rehabilitation, the long-term RTWprospects seem advantageous. It is of interest to examine what role environmental and legal system factors and of the work-place and health-care providers play in this prolonged RTW-course. Background: the influence of self-efficacy in the RTW process has been emphasized; however, a comprehensive understanding of the role of self-efficacy on RTW behavior is still lacking. Aim of the study is to investigate the association between self-efficacy for RTW (SERTW) and: a. the intention to change, and b. RTW status, in a cohort of injured workers with work-related musculoskeletal conditions. Methods: A baseline telephone interview was conducted in 632 claimants one-month post-injury and 446 claimants (six-month post-injury). Return-to-Work Self-Efficacy (RTWSE) was measured with a validated questionnaire consisting of three subscales: RTWSE with regard to 1. Controlling pain at work; 2. Obtaining help from supervisor and 3. Obtaining help from co-workers. Intention to change was assessed with the validated Readiness for Return-To-Work (RRTW) Scale, reflecting closely the five stages described in the Readiness for RTW model [1, 3] . RTW status was measured based on the workers' responses to the question whether they returned to work at one-and six-month follow-up. ANOVA tests were conducted to compare relationships for each of the three RTWSE subscales with the stages of change and the RTW status. Results: with regard to intention to change all univariate F-tests were significant at both measures in time, except for the co-worker RTWSE subscale at one-month follow-up. RTWSE is at its peak in workers who are actively preparing to return to work, however, it decreases significantly for people who start working again on all three RTWSE subscales. Comparing RTWSE with RTW status significant differences were found only for the Pain SERTW subscale at both time measures. Workers who returned to work showed higher Pain RTWSE scores compared to those who were still sick-listed. Conclusion: a strong association between SE-RTW and Readiness for RTW stages was found, however the association between SE-RTW and RTW status was only strong for RTWSE. Our findings suggest that self-efficacy is more strongly associated with intention/motivation for the behavior (internalized processes of behaviour), than strictly behavioural ones. Message: 1. Self-efficacy for RTW is significantly associated to the intention to change but not to the actual behavior, i.e. RTW status. 2. Self-efficacy for RTW changes over time during RTW. It is at its peak in workers who are actively preparing to return to work, however it decreases significantly for people who start working again. 3. Our findings suggest that self-efficacy is more strongly associated with intention or motivation for the behavior, than strictly behavioural ones. Background: Smoking and work disability are major public health and welfare problems. The health consequences of smoking are well-documented but less is known about the independent effect of smoking on disability pension of various diagnoses. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of smoking on subsequent disability pensions among middle-aged public sector employees. Methods: Baseline survey was collected in 2000-2002 among middle-aged employees of the City of Helsinki (n=6373, 80% women). Data on disability pensions were obtained from the Finnish Centre for Pensions (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) and were linked to the questionnaire data. Cox regression analysis was used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) for disability pension. To examine the independent effect of smoking age, socioeconomic position, working conditions, alcohol drinking, physical activity and body mass index were adjusted for. Results: There were 232 (4%) disability pension events during the follow-up. Age adjusted smoking strongly predicted disability pensions (HRs 1.5-1.6) among women and men. Risk for disability pension increased with number of smoked cigarettes. Especially strong was the effect among those who smoked more than 20 cigarettes per day. Adjusting for confounders attenuated the effect but it remained.",37.65995340068868,16.940422467210947

The assumption has been that all mothers and children in lowincome and middle-income countries were equally poor and that there was no need to account for subnational inequalities when strategies were designed for the scaling-up of health interventions. Practical difficulties in the stratification of health status by socioeconomic position contributed to this lack of visibility. The most inequitable indicators are skilled birth attendant, followed by four or more antenatal care visits, whereas the most equitable was early initiation of breastfeeding.

Regression modeling in STATA 10 was used to estimate the associations between study outcomes and maternal employment. Results: 19% of young adults aged 16-21 reported poor self-rated health, and mean GHQ-12 was 10.1. Approximately 40% of mothers worked at some point during age 0-4 of their child. This proportion increased to 59% at age 5-11 and 68% at age 12-16. Children of mothers who were not employed reported OR of poor SRH 1.48, 1.11 and 1.28 for 3 periods of exposure, however these effects were mostly explained when adjusted for maternal education and household income. The differences in GHQ-12 by maternal employment were similarly reduced by indicators of social position. Conclusions: The associations between maternal employment in childhood and young adults' health exist at least partly because of the generally higher social position and more stable family structure of households with working mothers. The design of invitation and reminder letters to screen for cancer has been influenced by studies comparing the psychological and attitudinal differences between participants and non-participants. Participation in cancer screening has been thought to follow the continuum of resistance model, which assumes the same factors influence early and late participation. This study investigated the validity of the continuum of resistance model for explaining participation in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. People aged 50 to 74 years, recruited from the electoral roll who had completed a baseline survey and were in the early stages of readiness to screen (n =376) were subsequently invited to complete a faecal occult blood screening test. Multivariate analyses examined the predictors of early participation (kit returned in weeks 1-6) and late participation (kit returned in weeks 7 -12). Results confirmed that different factors influenced early and late participation. Early participation was associated with employment status and barriers to screening, with retired people more likely to screen early than employed people (relative risk RR=1.

Emphasis on the direct impact of homelessness on population health may be misplaced. Instead, homelessness may be viewed as a sentinel event, a marker for dysfunction in multiple sectors including the housing market, job market, health care system, and social welfare system. Homelessness represents the extreme end of a larger distribution of socioeconomic status and housing status, and it attracts attention precisely because of its dire nature. This conceptualization has been well-described in work by Rose (1985) . As shown in Figure 1 , the curve shown with a solid line represents the distribution of housing quality within a hypothetical population. Homelessness represents the extreme low point along the dimension of housing quality. This approach views one's housing situation as a continuum and avoids creating a simple dichotomy between being homeless and being housed. For the sake of this discussion, we assume that housing conditions have an impact on health, an assertion for which there is ample support (Fuller-Thomson, et al., 2000; Krieger and Higgins, 2002) . Figure 1 also illustrates two different approaches to improving health through improving housing conditions. The greatest effect in terms of population health may be gained through approach A (shifting the entire population distribution for the factor upwards slightly, to the distribution curve indicated by a dotted line) rather than approach B (focusing on improving conditions for the highest-risk group at the worst extreme of the distribution). A similar argument could be applied to the relationship between poverty and health, where the x-axis on the diagram would represent income rather than housing quality.",46.127349351591796,18.1922746123487

For acute infectious diseases, the health status of the population often changes quickly over time, with the number of people infectious, susceptible to being infected, and immune to the disease changing substantially over the course of an epidemic. Further, the membership in each of these groups does not vary arbitrarily over time but is driven by often well-understood biological processes (Box 1). For instance, in the simple example of a permanently immunizing infection spread through person-to-person transmission such as measles, new susceptible individuals only enter the population through birth and immigration; these individuals can then only become infected by contact with existing infectious individuals, who, in turn, will eventually become immune or die and be removed forever removed from participation in the epidemic process.",34.092692301995996,12.927357108607495

CORRESPONDING AUTHOR","The sample size of 150 was based on power estimates contrasting (1) meditation vs control and (2) exercise vs control. To control for multiple testing, we chose a P ≤.025 cutoff for null hypothesis rejection. One-sided testing was justifi ed by previously published research, all in the direction of positive results. To arrive at the primary outcome of area-under-the-curve global severity, we fi rst computed daily WURSS-24 scores by simple summation and then applied trapezoidal approximation over illness episodes. For the less than 2% of missing WURSS-24 data, we assessed patterns of missing data, which satisfi ed missing-at-random criteria, then applied a multiple imputation strategy, using an expectancy maximization algorithm, 40 which was undertaken before unblinding. Unadjusted between-group contrasts were calculated using 1-sided t tests for continuous variables and proportional difference testing for binomials. Because most participants did not experience ARI illness, zeroinfl ated regression models were used to control for potential confounders. These models take into account both logistic (incidence) and linear (days of illness or global severity) data. Covariates used in these models were age, sex, education, smoking status, body mass index, baseline physical and mental health (SF-12), and cohort. Because global severity was skewed, Box-Cox transformation was used for this outcome in these models. To explore potential causal pathways, we assessed the relationship of secondary outcomes measured just after interventions to the main outcomes. The statistical framework for potential mediation was based on the Baron and Kenny model, 41 modifi ed by Krull and MacKinnon, 42 and by coauthor Brown. 43 Additional detail on the results of the zeroinfl ated regression models and potential confounders is available in Supplemental Table 1 and Table 2.

The low rate of breast-feeding for mothers enrolled in WIC is of particular concern because that agency has a specific policy to encourage breast-feeding. Many states now depend on formula manufacturer rebates to fund part of their WIC programs, however, creating a conflict of interest.

Importantly, this interplay depends on how and when these bacterial factors are expressed. Defining the role of host immunity in disease outcome is crucial if tools to predict disease severity are to be built, but equally, we must be able to predict the virulence potential of a bacterial strain from its genome sequence. Although sequencing can list which virulence factorencoding genes are present in a genome, without an understanding of the regulatory and epistatic processes that control their expression, the contribution of this list of genes to virulence cannot be quantified. With a more comprehensive understanding of the combinations of genetic backgrounds, regulatory networks and virulence factors that produce virulent strains, researchers might be better able to rapidly predict the propensity of a particular strain to cause severe and transmissible disease.

China began the reform era as an international outlier, having achieving high population health status for its relatively low per capita income level. One might have hoped that China's above-average economic growth would have reinforced China's previously above-average health indicators. Instead, compared to unprecedented economic growth, health status measures have improved more slowly, or even stagnated at the aggregate level, with growing population disparities. By 2000, life expectancy, infant mortality and under-five mortality rates were all about average for countries of similar per capita income.

These can be grouped as patient factors, processes of care factors, physician factors, and other factors. Fine and co- workers 8 derived a pneumonia severity of illness score based on 20 items that included demographic factors, comorbidity, physical examination findings, and laboratory and radiographic data. Scores ranged from 0 (no points are given for patients Յ 50 years of age without comorbidity and no physiologic abnormalities) to 250, with higher scores indicating more severe pneumonia. In the original study, patients were grouped into five risk classes for mortality; classes I to III (Յ 90 points) are at low risk for death, while the mortality rate in class IV was 9%, and 27% in class V. Since the mortality for patients in the risk classes I and II in our study was very low and insufficient for estimation, the pneumonia severity was analyzed as a continuous score. Even though age is the major driver in the Fine risk score (one point is given for each year of age for male subjects and 10 points are subtracted from the total age points for female subjects), we found that increasing age still contributed to the risk of mortality over and above that which was accounted for in the severity score. Thus, we carried out additional adjustment for age in the final logistic regression model due to the residual confounding. An additional independent association between age and mortality was observed in both multivariate logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models. The pneumonia severity score does not consider other factors that might be important in mortality, namely functional status, site of care, and processes of care. Ethnicity is also an important factor influencing mortality due to pneumonia. Haas et al 15 found that Hispanics and Asian Americans had a lower risk of death from CAP than whites in California. In one study, African-American men admitted to Veterans Affairs hospitals in the United States had lower risk-adjusted mortality for a variety of conditions, including pneumonia. 16 Most of the population of Alberta is white. One hundred thirteen of our patients (3.7%) were Aboriginal Canadians. In an administrative database study of all persons admitted to hospital with pneumonia in Alberta over a 5-year period, patients of Aboriginal treaty status constituted 7% of the 43,642 comprising the study population. 17 In that study, Aboriginal status was not associated with increased mortality. In the current study, the mortality rate among those of Aboriginal descent was very low at 0.8%. However, these patients were considerably younger than the remainder of the pneumonia population and were more likely to be in risk classes I to III. A major finding in this study was the contribution of functional status at the time of hospital admission as an independent predictor of mortality. Thus, patients who were in wheelchair or bedridden were 1.4 times and 4 times, respectively, more likely to die compared to patients who walked without problems. Two hundred nineteen persons (7.1%) were using wheelchairs, and 103 persons (3.3%) were bedridden. In a case-control study of 101 patients Ն 65 years of age with pneumonia, Riquelme et al 18 reported a crude mortality rate of 26%. Bedridden state had a relative risk of 10.75 for mortality. 19 In a study of patients with COPD, Oga et al 20 noted that exercise capacity and health status were significantly predictive of mortality independent of age or airflow limitation. Davis and co-workers 21 studied persons admitted to a tertiary teaching hospital between 1987 and 1992 for cerebrovascular disease or pneumonia. They found that functional status had as much predictive value for in-hospital mortality as laboratory data. Indeed, the requirement for total assistance with bathing was the best single predictor of in-hospital mortality.",36.512912606172016,15.628607890248585

China's experience,"2 For example, Indonesia and China both dramatically decreased under-five mortality rates from similarly high levels in the mid-1960s, but with divergent paths. Indonesia achieved steady falls in under-five mortality rates along with increases in per capita income. By contrast, China's under-five mortality rate fell rapidly during a period of meager economic growth to a level that was by 1980 comparable to that of Indonesia in 1995. However, China's under-five mortality rate has virtually stagnated since then, while per capita income has grown dramatically (Wagstaff, 2004 The data show that China began the reform era as an international outlier, achieving high population health status for its relatively low per capita income. Indeed, China's dramatic improvement in population health between the 1950s and 1970s is well known (Hsiao, 1995; Jamison, 1984) . Over the reform era, economic growth outstripped improvement in health status indicators. Currently, health status indicators are about average for China's level of per capita GDP. This ''regression to the mean'' is evident in the infant mortality rate (Fig. 1) , the under-five mortality rate (Fig. 2 ) and life expectancy ( Fig. 3 ; also see working paper appendix Fig. 1 ). What factors explain China's experience? We explore several alternative explanations. (2000) . 4 Thus, an upward-sloping line suggests that the indicator (e.g., life expectancy or health expenditure) is higher in countries with higher per capita income. A downward-sloping line, such as for the infant mortality rate, shows the opposite: higher levels of income per capita are correlated with lower infant mortality.

Secondly, we select inpatient care over outpatient care because the former has lower demand elasticity than the latter; thus, hospitalizations are more likely to reflect actual changes in health status (Manning, Newhouse, Duan, Keeler, & Leibowitz, 1987; Ruhm, 2003) .",42.04622522302795,19.0968980248562

If the stock market performs poorly, there will be a general reduction in their wealth, which could lead to higher stress levels and greater depression, thereby resulting in higher incidences of stroke. There are some inherent limitations of this study which should be taken into consideration. Firstly, the NHIRD contains no information on the socioeconomic variables of patients.

One explanation is selection bias: if more severe clinical cases are reported and if these cases are also more likely to have vaccination status recorded within Disease Watchdog, this could result in vaccination status appearing as less of a risk factor. Equally, this finding may simply demonstrate the multifactorial nature of this disease, with other factors such as co-infection, stress, parasites and nutrition, potentially influencing the outcome in these cases. Vaccination against CPV with a live attenuated vaccine is reported to prevent the development of clinical signs, reduce viral shedding, limit disease severity and reduce hospitalisation time, all together resulting in significantly lower case fatality rates in vaccinated dogs compared to unvaccinated dogs (Meunier et al., 1985; Spibey et al., 2008) . These patterns were not found in the present study (Table 1) : there was no significant difference in case fatality rates between dogs that were unvaccinated (16.4%) and those dogs that had received a vaccination within the previous 12 months. Age should be considered as a potential confounding factor for this result; however, the majority (89.5%) of dogs that had a history of vaccination within the previous 12 months that developed disease due to CPV were less than 12 months of age. In addition, exposure to parvovirus was not measured in this study and might account for the lack of association between veterinary clinic reported vaccination status and risk of parvovirus death.

Industrial manufacturing previously centered in high-income countries began to outsource production to EPZs, which are tax-free and provide a low-paid and often minimally regulated workforce (Martinez, 2004) . Most of the world's trade no longer occurs between nations, but between multiple subsidiaries of transnational companies. Much of the value added (and the profit) is captured by the firm at the top of the chain, often in offshore financial centers ('tax havens'), and often by way of relentless pressure on competing suppliers to bear most of the risk associated with investments in plant and equipment and to contain labor and other production costs. Corporations' ability to relocate production to lower cost jurisdictions limits the ability of workers to negotiate better wages and working conditions, and to expand social provision through the political process that was at the core of the postwar compromise between workers and capital in the high-income world. The result: 'most workers are being squeezed' (Woodall, 2006) . This is occurring in all countries of the world. Even those in low-and middle-income countries who have seen their incomes rise as a result of the growth in global production chains live in conditions variously described as 'vulnerable' or 'precarious,' where their employment is often informal, temporary, part-time, or generally lacking in adequate remuneration, security, or benefits (Standing, 2011). Social protection programs can compensate, at least in part, for job and labor income losses that result from trade liberalization. However, given the extent of global market liberalization in capital, goods, and services, most of the world's governments find themselves converging on a policy model in which they strive to make their own geographic location as competitive as possible in international markets. Both labor market 'flexibilization,' with its stress-related health risks, and limits on the taxes that could finance improved health and social protection policies constitute important elements of competition state policies (Schrecker and Labonté, 2011 ).",34.10033613723491,17.36677858629516

In most shelters, the control of infectious disease is a major challenge (see Chapter 8). In a study of respiratory and enteric viruses in 162 cats entering shelters in the United States, feline calicivirus (FCV) was isolated from 11% of healthy cats upon entry, feline herpesvirus (FHV) from 4% and feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) from 33% of cats (Pedersen et al. 2004) .

In a typical implementation of epidemic models, nodes can be in one of three different states at any given time: susceptible to the infection, S; infected, I; and recovered/removed from the system, R (following complete immunization or death). Different epidemic models are then formulated by varying the rules that permit hosts to transition from one state to another. For example, a very common model is the SI, where nodes can pass only from S to I. In the SIS models, infected nodes are allowed to roll back to the susceptible state without gaining immunity (I → S) according to a certain probability, which enables a disease to cycle in a host population by re-infecting individuals that have recovered from a previous infection. Simulating individuals gaining permanent or temporary immunity requires the addition of a third compartment that sees nodes removed from the network (I → R), which creates more complex models, such as the SIR and the SIRS (note that, besides immunization, the R status may indicate the death of a node) (Pastor-Satorras et al., 2015).",34.99171773289374,14.660568834276557

Thus far, the impact of specific AGP alternatives in the presence of particular pathogens is not well understood, and information about health status is mostly absent in published AGP alternative studies (Schweer et al., 2017a). Documentation of the pathogens present in a group of pigs that may influence the outcome of a study will help to build an understanding of how AGP alternatives may perform under varying health conditions. In this study, the collection of oral fluid and serum samples as well as necropsies of pigs that died allowed for the identification or exclusion of critical pathogens, including PRRSV, as influential factors in this group of pigs. Collection and testing of diagnostic samples, especially at the beginning and end of a study, can be used to assess and document pathogen exposure.

Specifically, we identified thousands of genes for which gene expression levels in peripheral blood cells depend not only on current social status, but also on the effects of past social status. Social history effects were themselves dependent on other factors, however, with much more extensive effects in unstimulated cells than immunechallenged cells, and in females with a history of low status than for females with a history of high status. These observations are consistent with several possibilities. First, a history of high social status (i.e., low social adversity) could confer increased plasticity in response to environmental change (e.g., subsequent losses of status). Second, historical exposure to social subordination-induced stress could blunt responses to future high-quality environments. Third, social history effects may dissipate over time, but at a faster pace for formerly high status females. Given that the effects of current rank dominate after immune stimulation, external environmental challenges might hasten this process.

As we showed in previous analyses (18) , genes involved in immune defense, inflammation and cytokine signaling are biased towards higher expression in low-ranking females, in LPS condition samples (Fig. 2C) . In contrast, genes involved in viral defenseassociated type I IFN signaling are biased towards higher expression in high-ranking females, in the same condition (Fig. 2C) . A trade-offs model would predict a similar dichotomy after challenge with a viral mimic. Surprisingly, this is not what we observed: in the Gard condition, low status predicted increased expression of both proinflammatory/cytokine signaling-associated and type I IFN-associated genes. For example, for rank-associated genes in the Gene Ontology category ""type I interferon signaling"" 57% of genes measured in the LPS condition were more highly expressed in high status females. However, for rank-associated genes in the same category, measured in the Gard condition, only 25% were more highly expressed in high status females. Consequently, status-related effects for type I IFN genes differ significantly between LPS and Gard conditions (Wilcoxon test, p=6.4 x 10 -4 ). This pattern holds for key viral defense genes such as OAS2 and OAS3, which are involved in inhibition of viral replication; the IFN-inducible genes IFIT2, IFIT3, MX1 and MX2; and STAT1, a master regulator of interferon-mediated defense (Fig. 2D) . It also extends to measures of the response to immune challenge (i.e., the change in gene expression levels between control and challenged cells): genes involved in type I IFN signaling tend to be more strongly up-regulated in high status females after LPS challenge, but more strongly up-regulated in low status females after Gard challenge (SI Appendix, Fig.  S3 )",24.01591012696151,12.798451654482914

We took advantage of this study design to investigate whether past social status affected immune cell gene expression independently from social status at the time of sampling (""current rank""), in support of biological embedding. Strikingly, we identified a strong global signature of past social status on gene expression levels as well: past Elo score was correlated with PC2 within each condition (control: Pearson's r = -0.76, p=2.4 x 10 -9 ; LPS: r = -0.58, p=8.0 x 10 -5 ; Gard: r = -0.44, p=3.8 x 10 -3 ; SI Appendix, Fig. S2 ) .",21.477583590271347,12.764882091773346

First, high social adversity, including social isolation, early life insults, and low social status in adulthood, tends to predict higher expression of genes in pro-inflammatory pathways. This observation dovetails with associations between chronic social stress and elevated levels of protein biomarkers of inflammation, including those produced by peripheral blood cells (e.g., interleukin-6; (13, 29, 30) ). Second, high social adversity tends to predict lower expression of genes that function in the innate immune defense against virus, especially genes involved in type I interferon (IFN) signaling. In most cases, this pattern has been shown based on data in unstimulated cells (6) ; however, in bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated cells, induction of type I IFN-associated gene expression responses are also attenuated in low status (compared to high status) rhesus macaques (18) . Third, these findings are explained in part by socially patterned differences in the use of immune defense-modulating transcription factors. For example, genes that are more highly expressed in low status female rhesus macaques are enriched near accessible binding sites for the transcription factor complex nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), a master regulator of inflammation. In contrast, genes that are more highly expressed in high status females fall near accessible binding sites for interferon regulatory factors, which coordinate type I IFN-mediated responses (18, 31) .",28.607415209701212,12.64373789198368

Chronic social stress is thought to generate a proinflammatory state characterized by elevated antibacterial defenses and reduced investment in antiviral defense. Here, we manipulated long-term social status in female rhesus macaques to show that social subordination alters the gene expression response to ex vivo bacterial and viral challenge. As predicted by current models, bacterial lipopolysaccharide polarizes the immune response such that low status corresponds to higher expression of genes in NF-κBdependent pro-inflammatory pathways and lower expression of genes involved in the antiviral response and type I interferon (IFN) signaling. Counter to predictions, however, low status drives more exaggerated expression of both NF-κB and IFN-associated genes after cells are exposed to the viral mimic Gardiquimod. Status-driven gene expression patterns are not only linked to social status at the time of sampling, but also to social history (i.e., past social status), especially in unstimulated cells. However, for a subset of genes, we observed interaction effects in which females who fell in rank were more strongly affected by current social status than those who climbed the social hierarchy. Together, our results indicate that the effects of social status on immune cell gene expression depend on pathogen exposure, pathogen type, and social history -in support of social experience-mediated biological embedding in adulthood, even in the conventionally memory-less innate immune system.",28.34717754455278,12.33480929907316

If temporally separate exposures independently tap into the same gene regulatory mechanisms, then the genome can be viewed as a mosaic, in which some loci retain more of a long-term signature of social history than others. This perspective is consistent with studies of organism-level traits. For example, in nonhuman primate models of social stress, behavioral signatures of status are highly plastic with changes in dominance rank, whereas the development of coronary artery plaques are explained by the combination of present and past social status (59, 60) . A key contribution of genomic approaches rests in their ability to compare levels of plasticity across thousands of traits simultaneously.

Because biomarkers of inflammation in turn predict disease and mortality outcomes (50), these findings suggest that social regulation of immune gene expression may partly mediate social gradients in health. However, contrary to current predictions based on data collected in unstimulated conditions, low status females did not mount attenuated gene regulatory responses to viral challenge (6, 32) .

Strikingly, that dichotomy disappeared when samples were stimulated with a viral mimic. In the Gard condition, the promoter regions of genes that were more highly expressed in low status animals were enriched for TF binding sites for virtually all immune-associated TFs, including NF-κB, several IRFs, and STAT1 (Fig. 3) .

Our findings are consistent with previous reports that social status interacts with LPS and glucocorticoid exposure (18, 31) , and that genetic effects on gene expression can also be altered by local cellular conditions (i.e., gene-environment interactions, e.g., (51) (52) (53) (54) ).
