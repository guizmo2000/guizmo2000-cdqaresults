Among the numerous methods, the gravity model (also known as the potential model) and the two-step floating catchment area method are the most widely used [24, 25] .

It is also difficult to set a reasonable search radius for each medical facility [27] . This current study used an improved two-step floating catchment area model to overcome these limitations.

The present study aimed to describe the financing strategies and mechanisms to improve access to public health for all, identify the strengths and weaknesses of the different approaches, and showed evidence on equity improvement among different regions. Methods: We reviewed the relevant literatures and identified 208 articles after screening and quality assessment and conducted six key informants' interviews. Secondary data on national and local government health expenditures, NEPHSP coverage and health indicators in 2003-2014 were collected, descriptive and equity analyses were used. Results: Before 2009, the government subsidy to primary care institutions (PCIs) were mainly used for basic construction and a small part of personnel expenses. Since 2009, the new funds for NEPHSP have significantly expanded service coverage and population coverage. These funds have been allocated by central, provincial, municipal and county governments at different proportions in China's tax distribution system. Due to the fiscal transfer payment, the Central Government allocated more subsides to less-developed western regions and all the funds were managed in a specific account. Several types of payment methods have been adopted including capitation, pay for performance (P4P), pay for service items, global budget and public health voucher, to address issues from both the supply and demand sides. The equalization of NEPHSP did well through the establishment of health records, systematic care of children and maternal women, etc. Our data showed that the gap between the eastern, central and western regions narrowed. However the coverage for migrants was still low and performance was needed improving in effectiveness of managing patients with chronic diseases. Conclusions: The delivery of essential public health services was highly influenced by public fiscal policy, and the implementation of health reform since 2009 has led the public health development towards the right direction. However China still needs to increase the fiscal investments to expand service coverage as well as promote the quality of public health services and equality among regions.

[1] [2] [3] The infection control measures employed in response to this crisis were extraordinary and unprecedented. Actions to control SARS in the Greater Toronto Area included the closure of four hospitals, the cancellation of all non-emergency surgical services, an almost complete curtailment of inter-hospital patient transfers, and the postponement of most hospital-based outpatient clinics. [4, 5] Moreover, access to physicians, hospital laboratories, imaging studies, and other hightechnology services was limited by infection control procedures. [5] The effect of these measures on access to health care was underscored by media reports of inappropriate delays for cancer therapy and the inability to perform urgent surgeries, sometimes resulting in death. [6] [7] [8] [9] The effects of widespread limitations of access to medical services have been studied from different perspectives. Studies of influenza outbreaks from the early 20 th century provide insight into healthcare restrictions and are applicable to the SARS experience because both are contagious respiratory illnesses with high mortality rates that are largely controlled through isolation procedures. Previous work has documented increased cardiovascular and other non-influenza related deaths during influenza outbreaks. [10] [11] [12] However, these increases were likely related to the effects of the infection itself rather than limited access to care. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] Studies of diminished health care access due to withdrawal of medical services during physicians' strikes have documented significant alterations in health service utilization, intermediate outcomes, and various health-related processes of care. [18] [19] [20] However, no rigorous study has examined the effects of physician job action on overall population mortality. [21] While there is little debate regarding the necessity of a concerted response to control the SARS outbreak, the delivery of health care to the general population was clearly reduced. Evidence suggests that in Toronto more essential services were less affected than services for lowacuity conditions. [5] An important question is whether sharply curtailed access to health care had an impact on population mortality due to causes other than SARS.

Perhaps, in countries where access to health care is very limited, concerns about the prevention of HAIs might be seen to be a luxury [38] . In most lowmiddle income countries efforts to provide universal health coverage are so challenging that prevention of infections due to health care associated infections might be seen as a secondary target. However, failures in preventing the transmission of microorganisms at PHC level can affect the entire health care system, and contribute to the spread of epidemiologically relevant pathogens. The major pandemics have shown that all health services must be prepared for an efficient and coordinated response to prevent amplification of any epidemic phenomena. This perspective was evident in episodes of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome -SARS, pandemic influenza and more recently in the epidemics related to Ebola virus [14, 39] . Nonetheless, the literature from high income countries is also quite silent about potential HAIs due to procedures in PHC, except for some coverage of outbreaks [9, [15] [16] [17] .",33.88164786023256,16.554867291776585

If herding induced market crash leads to a reduction in inflow of medical services, products and equipments to these countries, there is a greater tendency to perpetuate inequity in healthcare in these countries [65] . This stems from the fact that consequential scarcity of healthcare resources will lead to disproportionate allocation of few resources to China dependent countries. Coupled with the expected increase in the cost of the available healthcare resources such as drugs and other supplies (due to scarcity), the resulting high cost of healthcare may likely be monumental as most of these ASEAN and African countries continue to reel under heavy economic challenges at both national and individual level. The effect on global and regional health inequity is thus unlikely to be insignificant. Consistent with previous studies, these findings elicit serious policy response to ameliorate any potential harmful effect of herding behavior on health equity in both China and other China dependent countries. Similar to the heavy involvement of Chinese government in the business sector, our analysis support the views of [9] of the necessity for the state to provide a greater proportion of public funding for health so that health care provision is not at the peril of private, for profit interests.

Financial constraints within hospitals and the host country may benefit from a routine-use concept, although such facilities demand more frequent maintenence due to damage on technical equipment. In addition, access to routine use beds for training of HCWs is reduced, and patients need to be relocated to other rooms once the facility receives an HID case. In contrast, reserved bed capacities demand additional personnel and material for routine functional checks, thus considered cost-ineffective.

As we know from Ferguson's Anti Politics Machine [22] and from the many transactional works by Barth, Bailey and others, some reluctance stems from fears of local populations changing the implementation of technologies in line with local objectives and understandings, away from scientific and technical advice. There appears to be little effort to address this shortfall [23] . The Communal Areas Management Programme for Indigenous Resources (CAMPFIRE), with its research groups interfacing with ecologists in the Zambezi Valley, represents a good example of a project focusing on creation of local awareness of studied issues [24] . However, even in this case efforts have generally stopped short of including local communities' knowledge and expertise as evidence for decisionmaking and involving communities in policy decisions. Support for interdisciplinary and integrative approaches may potentially help mitigate the impact of disease on people's health, lives and livelihoods. They can also create legitimacy for science, and lay the foundation for the adoption of policy.

Advances in care systems, instrumentation, biotechnologies, genetics and drug research have to be supported and regulated, considering their ethical and social consequences (as in the cases of GMOs, cloning, access to drugs in developing countries, etc.). Social innovation may spread in welfare services with a greater role of citizens, users and non-profi t organisations, renewed public provision and new forms of self-organisation of communities. (279) Such a policy can be built in Europe using existing institutions, policy tools and resources, pushing economic activities towards the protection of health and welfare and putting Europe on a sustainable path of long-term environmental transition on the basis of a green industrial policy. The welfare state and public health reduce inequalities Inequality is a major concern in this context. Since the 1980s, as a result of neoliberal policies, advanced countries have experienced sharp increases in income and wealth disparities. Because of its nature as a supplier of goods and services based on individual and social needs, the welfare state has been a key factor in reducing inequalities after the Second World War. As argued in our book Explaining inequality (Franzini and Pianta, 2015) , the reduction of the policy space, the privatisation of public services and the extension of the market in areas previously protected by public action have introduced new mechanisms that generated economic and social disparities. In Europe a report from the European Commission recalled that ""[i]n all countries with available data, significant differences in health exist between socioeconomic groups, in the sense that people with lower levels of education, occupation and/or income tend to have systematically higher morbidity and mortality rate"" (2007) . And, considering the economic effects of disparities in health conditions, the EU report calculated that the number of deaths that can be attributed to health inequalities in the European Union (EU25) as a whole is estimated to be 707,000 per year and the number of life years lost due to these death is about 11.4 million. Health inequalities also affect the average life expectancy at birth of men and women, decreasing it by 1.84 years. The total costs due to health inequalities -obtained from the combination of data relating to mortality and morbidity -is close to 980 billion euros, 9.38% of EU25 GDP in 2004. In other words, the loss of health due to socio-economic inequalities represents 15% of the costs of social security systems and 20% of the costs of health care systems in the European Union as a whole (Mackenbach, 2007). 6 The relationship between inequalities and health has been analysed in several countries by considering different social and professional conditions (Wilkinson and Pickett, 2009; Costa et al., 2004) , showing that mortality rates increase in proportion to economic and social hardship, lower incomes, education and social class. Thus, reducing economic inequalities would make it possible to reduce health disparities; at the same time, greater universal and egalitarian health protection would signifi cantly reduce the costs of public health and welfare.",32.909593929741824,13.956715025964295

The WHO and UNFPA have a common objective to achieve this goal and the best way to do so is through the achievement of Universal Health Coverage (UHC), which would allow everyone to obtain the health services they need, when and where they need them, without facing financial hardship. Doing so will require the government to reach all vulnerable populations with a full range of quality services that are based on their needs, such as: contraceptive services; maternal and newborn care; prevention and control of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV; comprehensive sexuality education; safe abortion care, including post-abortion care; prevention, detection, and counselling for genderbased violence; prevention and treatment of infertility and cervical cancer; and counselling and care for sexual health and wellbeing [14] . However, during the global health emergencies, there is a total reversal of priorities and, as a result, the availability, accessibility and affordability of SRHR services may become challenging especially in resource-poor settings. All these global epidemics have been weakening the health care systems and increasing the barriers to access reproductive health services in the LMICs, especially by impacting the economic, social and personal decision-making of women.

Furthermore, in the past decade, internship period in internal medicine has been reduced for medical students whose major is psychiatry in many medical schools in order to extend their training in mental health. All these factors could limit their clinical competence to control the potential transmission of COVID-19 in psychiatric hospitals. In addition, the lack of community-based mental health services has led to an over-reliance on psychiatric services provided by large psychiatric hospitals [10, 11] . For the vast majority of patients with serious mental illness, they can only access appropriate mental health care in hospital settings, which are mostly located in city areas. Therefore, they are more prone to exposure to infectious diseases such as the COVID-19, unless the psychiatric hospitals themselves implement stringent measures of infection control similar to general hospitals. Clearly, preventive measures such as the provision of adequate medical supplies and protective equipment, public education on the risks of COVID-19 for hospital staff and patients, and restricting family visits to hospitals, are essential to reduce the likelihood of disease transmission in major psychiatric hospitals. Moreover, all people including patients' families and health care workers need to be advised to wash hands regularly and maintain good personal hygiene. Measurement of body temperature should be performed at least once a day to closely monitor any suspected infectious symptoms.

Vaccination production can take up to six months to complete, with the burdens of delays, likely shortages, and virus mismatch reducing the potential impact of the vaccine. Furthermore, pharmaceutical interventions often require consultation with a physician or, in more severe cases, hospitalization. These requirements reduce the potential impact of pharmaceutical interventions due to the fact that many people do not have access to health care or refuse to be seen by a health care provider. Additionally, it is often impossible to satisfy this requirement during a pandemic influenza outbreak because the demand for staff, facilities, and equipment often exceeds the supply [5] .

Lessons learned,"4. The implementation of preventive measures that precluded a major contingency from occurring was possible thanks to the maturity with which all Mexicans behaved and their trust in governmental decisions. The trust of the population resulted in part from the fact that Mexicans were permanently informed with transparency and formality throughout the different stages of the epidemic, in real time. Moreover, the international organizations involved certified the data generated on a daily basis and endorsed the actions implemented by the federal government. 5 . The presence and solidarity of international organizations, foreign governments and private businesses provided the technical support that facilitated both confirming the presence of a new virus and the access to the scientific knowledge accrued internationally. Additionally, the in-kind contributions increased the country's stores of medications and health supplies, thus helping to lessen the contingency. 6 . The rest of the world benefited from the Mexican experience thanks to the timeliness with which the government issued the sanitary alert and informed about the course of the epidemic. The knowledge shared by Mexico provided the countries who have faced the human influenza virus A(H1N1) with information about its epidemiologic characteristics, its clinical picture and the chance of cure if timely healthcare is provided. This, in turn, has led to mitigating the economic, sanitary and social effects. Upon donating the strain of this new virus to the world through WHO, Mexico has contributed to developing a specific vaccine that will make it possible to prevent and control this new variety of human influenza. Moreover, the country has given proof of solidarity and responsibility for global health even at a time of a major economic crisis. 7. Even though quick and effective action was taken, the need to strengthen the epidemiologic surveillance systems, the laboratories and the information networks became clear to us. We also need to update the legislation so that it allows us to act appropriately under pandemic situations, facilitate vaccine production and distribution, and promote the national scientific research on priority health topics. 8 . As mental health is not a minor issue, mental health programs specific for sanitary emergencies are necessary to address their psychological effects on the healthcare personnel, patients, their families and the general population. The latter effects, however, did not occur during this pandemic because the people were oriented and referred accordingly through the toll-free number. 9 . The epidemic had a positive effect on the population from the perspective of the personal and environmental preventive hygiene measures. We therefore constantly urge the citizenship to turn the latter into a healthy habit that becomes part of self-care and to adopt other healthy personal habits.",41.934511833764276,15.56395374753277

End-user physicians (neurosurgeons, operating room surgeons and anesthesiologists), the critical care unit resource nurse, and the most entitled service (trauma program) all identified circumstances in which they might make independent bed allocation decisions. This may explain why some end-user physicians experienced frustration in their attempts to access critical care unit resources. While official accountability for bed allocation decisions rested with the critical care physician, ""parallel track"" decision makers could allocate beds without this participant's knowledge. Previous investigators have demonstrated that parallel track decision makers may view the critical care unit physician as responsible for making decisions about the appropriateness of discharges, but may not consult with them about decisions to admit patients [10] . This exclusion from the decision making process may cause the official gatekeeper to be unable to explain why beds are not available in the critical care unit at a given time. When ICU beds are readily available, decision makers find it difficult to deny patient access to a bed-the "" non triage mode"". When there is a high census or full occupancy, decision makers must prioritize admissions to the ICU-""triage mode"". Involvement of the ICU physician in triage mode involves reviewing and prioritizing proposed admissions and decision making about discharges of patients who can safely be discharged or transferred. Review of patients who are not responding or benefiting from continuing intensive care also occurs [11] . ""Parallel-track"" decisionmaking resulting in ICU bed allocation occurred in both modes in our case study. When ICU beds are readily available, parallel -track decision makers such as the resource nurse, clinical fellow or end user physicians might reasonably make bed allocation decisions based on ICU admission criteria, improving the responsiveness and flexibility of the resource. However, the importance of direct communication between parallel -track decision makers and the critical care physician -gatekeeper is not diminished because admissions in the ""non -triage"" mode increase the probability the unit will later enter "" triage"" mode conditions.

Irrespective of ethnicity or culture, people who are poor ""tend to experience more health problems in general over the course of their lives than do their more socioeconomically advantaged counterparts"" [ [42] , p.504]. In large measure, disparities in health status reflect coping practices that are mediated by socio-economic position and ability to access and use health-care opportunities [28, 43, 12] In the global South, the most common social and economic determinants of medical problems and suffering are poverty, undernourishment, lack of access to safe water, absent or deficient sanitation, unhygienic housing conditions, [44, 45] and, increasingly, a critical shortage of trained health workers -many of whom have emigrated to rich countries [46] . Individuals and families on the move frequently confront additional health risks associated with ""health-compromising working and living conditions"" along with inequities in health-care access and medical treatment [[47], p.126, [48, 49] ]. Individual health-care abilities and opportunities are not independent of forces linked to globalization -including economic, political, and military incursions that result in displacement and migration [50] . A recent African war-zone study carried out by Physicians for Human Rights concluded that the ""first killer is flight"" for desperately poor persons driven by conflict from a fragile existence into a hostile and personally threatening environment where health services are nonexistent or not functioning [51] . Migrants who leave behind safe social settings often are obliged to congregate in vulnerable spatial surroundings. Mobility simultaneously facilitates cumulative social-change processes (including isolation, marginalization, segregation, and discrimination) and risk-taking behaviors that are associated with increased susceptibility to and spread of noncommunicable as well as communicable disease [47, 49, [52] [53] [54] ]. For this reason, HIV/AIDS researchers are devoting increased attention to the role of social disruption and migration to ""hot spot"" environments in fueling the epidemic [47, 12, 55] . To add insult to injury, the health problems of displaced and otherwise dislocated people tend to be officially ""invisible"" and are likely to be bypassed by potentially beneficial interventions [56] .",45.545410892558316,17.438766615010575

Total expenditure on health rose from ¥313 per person in 1997 to ¥2096 per person in 2013. 16 This trend reflects a large expansion in fiscal space for health, 33 driven by economic growth, an increase in government spending as a share of GDP, and greater government commitment to health. 16, 34, 35 Household out-of-pocket expenditure also increased over this period, fuelled by rising demand for health care and escalating health-care costs. 36 Over time, hospitals were allowed to increase fees and mark-up charges on medications-changes that resulted in increased costs of care, misuse of services, and overprescription of medications. 37 Out-of-pocket spending peaked at 60% of total expenditure on health in 2001. Since then, major health sector reforms-particularly the expansion of health insurance schemes for both rural and urban residentshave reduced exposure to out-of-pocket payments through greater health financing from government tax revenue and social health insurance contributions. (appendix p 12). The rural New Cooperative Medical Scheme was introduced in 2003 in response to increasing rates of impoverishment due to health service user charges. 38 The main objective of the scheme is to provide universal coverage and to improve equity and access to health care to the rural population. It is a voluntary insurance scheme funded from a mix of flat-rate household contributions and subsidies from the central and local governments. 38 This scheme operates at the county level, with different counties having different designs and benefit packages. 38, 39 According to the 2012 Report on the Work of the Chinese Government, 40 the scheme had covered 832 million rural residents, or 97·5% of Chinese farmers, by 2012. This high level of participation has partly been attributed to government efforts to encourage participation and to features in the design of the scheme to avoid adverse selection (such as compulsory enrolment of all members in a household). 38 The government contribution to the insurance premium increased from ¥10 per person in 2003 to ¥380 per person in 2015. The New Cooperative Medical Scheme has resulted in increased use of village clinics and inpatient and outpatient services. 38, 39 Despite the expansion of social health insurance, medical care expenditure has continued to represent a great proportion of total household spending, with substantial variation in total and out-of-pocket health expenditure across provinces. For example, per-capita health spending is four times greater in Beijing than in Guizhou. Perhaps surprisingly, in view of the regional disparities in health outcomes, health expenditure is greater in the eastern provinces and only slightly less in central provinces than in western provinces (figure 1). Moreover, with the exception of Tibet, western provinces seem equally reliant on out-of-pocket expenditure as a source of health financing as the rest of the country.",40.62330310990957,16.897295213815486

exposure to a pandemic can be avoided if one simply does not come to his or her job as a HCW,0.13272153012759505,1.79158616065979,2.884514331817627,6915fd19-477a-4800-a070-39a656efd00e,comm_use_subset/In the name of the greater good?,"Obligations to minimize harm and promote the goods of public health are not particularly controversial in times of relatively stable 'good-health' measures among the populace. The more troubling question emerges from the scenario in which promoting health and minimizing illness and death demands more from HCWsFhow can, or should, we compel HCWs to attend to their duties in the event that a highly lethal form of communicable disease should start spreading? 7 Although current debates focus on questions of duty, and how much personal risk invalidates that commitment, utilitarian aspects of that obligation are not given enough weight in the debate. In many of the debates, the question of risk is posed in terms of how we do not expect a trained 'first responder' to recklessly endanger his or her life to save the life of another. The classic story of the lifeguard is offered as exemplar: a lifeguard is not expected to rescue a drowning swimmer if a shark is clearly present. 8 Although this statement seems reasonable, it does not justify itself. By contrast, the consideration of the utilitarian aspect makes the point that in attempting to save a life, two are likely to be lost, thus propagating a greater total harm. The same holds true for the example of firefighters rushing into a house badly damaged by an active fire. Although there may be a life on that second floor to save, we do not expect any number of firefighters to sacrifice their lives for the doomed soul because the loss of many, including the original life in peril, is a maximization of harm, when harm should be minimized. When you control for the risks involved, such as using precautions to assure a level of safety for the rescuers, such as shark nets for the lifeguard, or safety gear for the firefighters, then the obligation to assist comes back into full force, as the potential for greater harm is manageable. 9 It is the variable of risk, which creates variable demands on those whose duty it is to care for the population in times of crisis. We consider not only the risk to the obligated but also a question of the scope of risk to the population. In academic and public debates regarding the compulsion to attend to duty in the face of danger, one fallacy has been allowed to stand: the notion that exposure to a pandemic can be avoided if one simply does not come to his or her job as a HCW. Although it is true that working in a hospital during times of influenza outbreak puts one at a greater risk for contracting the illness, 10 the more widespread the outbreak, the more people become sick, and the more likely the 'stayat-home' HCW will become sick even after having avoided contact in the course of his or her duties. We could reasonably state that, by virtue of staying home during a time of need for his or her service, the HCW improves the odds that he or she will contract this illness outside professional practice as part of the greater number who will be exposed. Another feature of the argument offered to defend dereliction of duty is to suggest that this risk that the HCW takes with his or her own health is a fixed variable, and thus should be considered as an exception to duty. On the contrary, it is a common feature of the infection-control literature that states that doctors and nurses are overwhelmingly neglectful toward their own basic infection-control protocols. 11 Therefore, the threat is not a fixed variable, but one that is actually quite within the scope of the control of a HCW. Ethically, one cannot willfully or negligently enhance the exceptions to duty. At the same time, it is an obligation of the management to ensure that diligent HCWs are equipped to do all they can to reduce their risks. During the SARS crisis in Toronto, health-care administrators did not effectively communicate which precautions should be undertaken by HCWs to protect themselves. 12 It bears mentioning that once clear direction could be given about the type and execution of masking procedures, the intrahospital transmission of SARS decreased to 0%. 13 This fact speaks to the issue of risk, as the non-transmission of SARS correlated with the increased attentions of management and staff to infection-control precautions and the provision and use of proper equipment. 14 When we speak in terms of risk and pandemics from the utilitarian perspective discussed herein, we recognize that it is completely nonsensible to sacrifice highly trained HCWs by rushing them ill equipped into dangerous situations. Much as with the example of firefighters and the unsafe burning house, we find it morally unacceptable to treat them as disposable, because of the singularity of their lives and their right to exist as individuals. There is also the detriment we would cause in an event such as a pandemic by losing the people trained to save us to the very threat they were trained to save us from. By that same logic, it could be argued that HCWs should have first access to available and medically accepted vaccinations by virtue of the fact that those HCWs are absolutely essential to our survival. The fear of an Avian Influenza outbreak brought with it much debate about scarce Tamiflu supplies and giving HCWs preferential access. 15 However, the added value of a HCW is the fact that he or she will be facing the greater risk by virtue of faithful and responsible execution of his or her duty, and if this is trueFand we have seen from the example of SARS that it is not always the case that HCWs exercise due diligence or face unmanageable risks of infection simply by being 'on-site'Fthen we should do more to protect them. Nevertheless, if the claim is that they can excuse themselves from duty because of risk, then we excuse ourselves from privileging their protection, through the preferential access to measures such as Tamiflu. The same should be true for access to vaccines or treatments: those who are compelled into service to defend the overall health of a society at tremendous risk should be first in line, as their opportunity for infectionFand to act as a vector for infection both within and outside their health-care facilitiesFmeans that the greater good is served by privileging their access to prophylaxis. A common objection to this comes from the perspective of social justice. The objection would point out that those who are least able to prevent their own infection, such as those from the lower socioeconomic classes, retirees and pensioners, and other vulnerable groups, would be denied access to the protections and treatments that are going to HCWs whoFto varying degreesFenjoy more comfortable socioeconomic positions. Although this question of access is valid in questions of many public health interventions, the preference of HCWs in questions of preferential access to vaccines and treatments is not unjust in these terms. Fundamentally, justice addresses unjustified imbalances in treatment. Aristotle famously mandated that equals should be treated as equals, and unequals as unequals. 16 The key point of justice is that there should be a valid justification for differential treatment, and in that light, in this context, we are describing pandemics that pose a unique and credible threat to the public in a manner that could fundamentally undermine our way of life. Preferential treatment of HCWs, in this limited context, is a just and defensible practice.",35.71451378567921,15.539545145098042

In food safety, this was shown by the rising incidence of hepatitis, typhoid and paratyphoid from 1979 to 1988 (19) . Public preventive health activities (public goods without direct benefit to consumers) that were not profitable were often neglected or ignored; fees were even charged for vertical disease control programs (such as those against TB and schistosomiasis) despite national targets indicating their priority in the 7 th and 8 th five-year plans (7), an acknowledgement of the reliance on their implementation by staff whose participation could only be guaranteed with a financial incentive (or who charged fees regardless of services being notionally free). New charges for specific activities such as vaccination, control of schistosomiasis, TB, leprosy and also MCH reduced their uptake and impact. However, rather than cancel vaccination fees, the government introduced an immunization insurance scheme to counter falling coverage (apparently with good effect) (15) , and fees for routine vaccination were only officially banned in 2007; the sale of optional vaccines (including several of the new vaccines recommended by WHO) remains a significant source of income for CDCs in China. Decentralisation of social service funding resulted in differential services according to counties' and townships' ability to fund them and the level of prioritization of public health by local authorities. Vertical lines of communication and control of the health system by health authorities also weakened (19) . Administration of township health services gradually devolved from county to township governments, and the township health facilities divided into clinical and preventive sections, with separate funding, revenue and reporting streams (15) . Most EPSs reported to local government rather than to higher levels within the health hierarchy, exacerbating the politicization of data and probability of its desensitization. Local government was usually more concerned with economic than social indicators, and disinclined to report bad news like disease outbreaks. They were also disinclined to spend public money on CDC when they could use it to make the county rich.",35.55922978603334,15.851879204503913

First, several online mental health services have been constructed across different areas, however, unified national management and coordination policies are still inadequate, which could result in uneven distribution and wastage of medical resources, let alone evaluating the efficacy of these services. Second, online mental health services are the predominant assistance measure and therefore, some people (e.g., older adults) who may have limited access to smartphones and the broadband internet, may benefit less from the services [42] .

Consequently, HIV/AIDS causes depletion of savings and productive assets, and increases the indebtedness of the HIV-affected households [8, 9] . Moreover, the higher health care expenditure of the households reduces investment for nutritional food for the family members, investment for farming or business, and the children education. Death during the working age of the patient is a major factor in the economic impact of HIV/AIDS. The household level impact of HIV/AIDS includes direct costs, including medical and non-medical costs, and productivity costs such as loss of labour time, as a result of the morbidity of HIV positive household members, as well as time spent by others caring for them [10] .

When analyzing a pandemic outbreak one must view the impact on the economy as a whole. One study presented at a forum conducted by the Australian Center for Economic Research on Health performed an in-depth analysis of a pandemic influenza and its alteration of global economic output [32] . This study by Sidorenko et al. divided a potential pandemic into four scenarios: mild, moderate, severe, and ultra, with each based on the mortality rate of a possible pandemic and their resulting economic consequences [32] . These divisions are necessary when analyzing a hypothetical pandemic because the potential economic impact varies depending on the severity of the virus. The estimated death total in the United States for these four scenarios would be 20, 201, 1,000.9, and 2,018.9 (in thousands), respectively. These estimates are multiplied by 2x to 10x if estimating mortality in developing countries. Examining the estimates for the economic impact in the US alone, the estimated reductions in gross domestic product (GDP) for these four categories are −0.58%, −1.38%, −3.00%, and −5.50%, respectively [32] . Globally, a mild pandemic like the current 2009 H1N1 virus would cost USD $330 billion or 0.8% GDP. An ultra pandemic, akin to the 1918 Influenza A virus, is estimated to have a substantial global economic impact with a cost of USD $4.4 trillion or 12.6% GDP [32] . The astounding economic cost is a result of decreased productivity, changes in behavior (i.e., avoidance of public places, going to work, etc.), adjusted interest rates, inflation, and shear shock to the public and society. Specifically, in an ultra pandemic the study estimated an additional 2.22% rise in inflation in the United States, a 9.6% decrease in exports, and −101 basis point reduction in short-term interest rates [32] . Given that the US is a first world society with a modern health care system capable of combating a potential pandemic, these totals are even more pronounced when looking at projections for the developing world. In sum, the developing world death rates and GDP reductions would be far greater than the US. The economic impact in the developing world would be substantial due to the shock from human loss of life as well as the flow of capital from emerging markets to ""safe havens"" such as the US and the EU [32] . While the ultra pandemic is an extremely rare event one never hopes to encounter, these astounding numbers underscore the need for rapid targeted treatments. The emergence of antiviral resistant strains indicates the need for the harnessing of DNA synthesis as a means to develop target therapeutics to replace current antivirals. These de novo DNA-based therapeutics could be customized to sequences as they are isolated in the field, allowing for adaptability of treatment.",40.92076143669061,16.919891710742714

Interestingly, these are simply policies with no new regulation as such, since they were supposed to be compatible with existing rules. However, as we have seen, the philosophical justification for therapeutic access at an individual level is different from the philosophical justification for population-level restrictions on access to new medicines, which is principally to benefit patients in the future through gathering evidence. The particular FDA policy change of interest here, expedited development, is to remove the requirement for Phase III evaluation of drugs intended to treat life-threatening and severely debilitating diseases. Earlier trial phases, however, would then have to be designed with controls and probably extended in numbers to compensate for the absence of a separate Phase III. Importantly, therapeutic access would be restricted to research during the early phases. Further, postmarketing surveillance studies might also be required to supplement these data. While this means that patients as a group might have access to treatment sooner, expedited development does not solve the issue from an individual patient's perspective since the patient might still be too ill to wait for routine access after licensing, whenever that might be.

Those infected may use the Schistosomiasis Control Stations (SCS) although many of these have been integrated into the Centres of Disease Control (CDC). Treatment for schistosomiasis in these facilities is free at the point of delivery. However, before reaching these facilities, patients often pass through general health facilities (e.g. village health stations). There are certainly financial restrictions to access to these general health facilities for the poor, which can lead to further transmission of the disease mainly among the poor. The problem is that Yu et al's study in 6 villages of Hunan Province in 2001 found "". . .both the willingness and the amount that people were willing to pay for treatment were low among villagers in the endemic areas in this region, especially in heavily endemic areas where villagers are most affected and have the lowest ability to pay"" [33] . Although many are covered by the diverse forms of government sponsored health insurance in P.R. China, regulations on co-payments and ceilings negatively affect access. Linked to this are cases of rent seeking behaviour by providers such as supplier induced demand and mark-ups on medicines. Research into treatment of TB patients has also shown a certain lack of interest by general health care providers in referring patients on to the free care at the SCSs and CDCs, thus helping their own health care facility to reap the financial rewards [34] .

This outdated model concentrates physical resources in centralized hospitals for the convenience and efficiency of healthcare providers. For patients, this design creates access challenges and encourages detrimental cross-pollination like hospital-acquired infections or medication mix-ups.

These previously under-recognised vulnerabilities to disease intersect with socio-economic power relations and other structural factors, which in turn constrain health-seeking behaviour. For example, a study of women's experiences when seeking treatment for fever, which was carried out in a deprived urban community in Tanzania, highlighted the sense of helplessness experienced by these women when negotiating the health system:",35.66069788305547,15.974950556943863

Applied research should increase our understanding of the health system needs of schistosomiasis control, while development strengthens the capacity of the health system to meet the needs of disease control. In so doing, there are four important considerations. a) An important theme running through this paper is to shift away from the commercialisation of the public sector and move towards strengthening of the role and integrity of the public sector in schistosomiasis disease control. This is apparent in the strengthening of policy-making in government, intersectoral action for health, the importance of equity as a key value, the access to treatment, the provision of public goods and the strengthening of resource management and planning. These need to be broken down into specific measures, such as strengthening surveillance systems, urban and rural health insurance, and funding for public goods and services. b) An underlying value of the whole approach to the control of schistosomiasis is that of equity. On the one hand, this requires a reaffirmation of public service values around health systems based on improved and more equitable health and health care. On the other, it is a disease of poverty, the control of which needs to get to the foundations of that poverty.",35.57756966160299,13.342480794412857

Significant EID threats have major implications for distribution of scarce resources, access to and regulation of health services and maintenance of social order. As described above it is also clear that policy and legal responses to EID threats are often highly politicised and compromised by failure to communicate clearly with the public. Policymakers responsible for responding to disasters such as EIDs typically find that there is a dissonance between transparency that may appear alarmist versus withholding information to avoid panic. Regardless of advice, people will make their own decisions based on their interpretation of available information, from formal and informal channels.

Even with the recognition of adverse health outcomes in migrant populations, providing secure access to equitable health services for populations of migrants can be difficult. These difficulties can exist even in nations with long-standing immigration programs. For nations that have only recently begun to deal with the growing dynamics of international migration, the difficulties can be much greater. Professional and population education, training, and orientation to societal values in health promotion and maintenance, disease prevention, and health services utilization also take time and commitment to achieve. 68 New and evolving populations of migrants and mobile populations can result in rapid arrival and growth of large communities with diverse characteristics, which include social, linguistic, cultural, and economic status; these can be associated with disparate health outcomes. Access to and utilization of health and medical services by some foreignborn communities may have a different pattern than those of the host population. 69, 70 Specialized services encompassing linguistically and culturally competent providers, designed for the problems of migrants, will be required to ensure adequate health-care programs and service delivery models. Similar features may need to be integrated into public health and disease-control programs designed to mitigate health threats or risks. 71 This is reflected in the need to have educational and instructional information prepared in the language of migrants at an appropriate level for comprehension, and the need for translation or visual tools to deliver messages in a culturally appropriate manner. 72 Depending on the location and health sector capacities, these forces can affect the design and function of the health program. Migrant-specific programs may be more effective for the migrant community, but they may engender additional costs and resource demands. Additional challenges occur as a result of migrant diversity itself and can be seen in many locations where demands or needs for culturally competent health services can extend across several nationalities and ethnicities. Strategies to deal with these situations include (1) support for acculturalization and integration to allow migrants to better use domestic medical and health services and (2) the provision of migrant-specific or migrant-friendly health services. 73 National, regional, and municipal differences in migrant history and demography make it unlikely that a single approach will be applicable to all venues. 74 However, modern information technology and networking does provide opportunities for the sharing and exchange of best practices and information across cultural environments. 75, 76 The legal or administrative status of the migrant does affect access to services and care. 77 Migrants in an unauthorized situation and some foreign-born women 78 have been shown to have a lower utilization of health services than the local population. For example, health services may be too costly for migrants who do not have health insurance coverage. Although linguistically appropriate health services are available and affordable, they may not be used because of migrants' lack of information about their rights and entitlements or out of fear for deportation. 79 Limitations to traditional responses to the health challenges of migration Traditional approaches to health and migration frequently deal with specific diseases, primarily communicable diseases of public health significance that may be associated with the arrival of migrants. 80, 81 Coordinated attempts at the international level to manage infectious disease transmission were organized and consolidated into the International Health Regulations (IHR), which was revised in 2005. 82 Some nations with integrated and long-standing immigration programs have systematically screened applicants for permanent residency status (immigrants) and some other classes of mobile populations (such as temporary resident applicants, including foreign students or migrant workers 83 ), for various health conditions and illnesses. Immigration medical screening, quarantine, and isolation have been used in attempts to address the possible introduction of health threats by exclusion. 84 Major immigration-receiving nations continue to use these processes to reduce the impact of health disparities in arriving mobile populations. 85 Important as they are from a legal and administrative perspective, programs and policies that continue to embrace responses of inspection and exclusion will be increasingly costly and ineffective in the context of modern migration and population mobility. 86 Furthermore, attempting to manage or mitigate health risks in arriving travelers, when many of the health risks may be latent or subclinical, without affecting international travel and commerce is operationally and logistically impractical.",41.68094569700239,17.539750013649932

Systematic actions that support migrant health improvement access to health services, and those that address the specific vulnerabilities of certain migrant populations, will assist nations in developing programs to meet current and future demands. 110 These measures are in the global and national public health interest of sending and receiving communities from a social equity and equality perspective. 111 Prioritized programs to reduce disparities responsible for the greatest health risks Several of the adverse health outcomes related to migration, particularly those associated with infectious diseases, are already the subject of international and in some cases global attention. Many of these diseases are being addressed through initiatives that involve international and regional programs dedicated to improving global health. They include international efforts to expand immunization (GAVI), 112 reduce the impact of high-burden diseases (such as tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and malaria), 113 manage the implications of pandemic influenza, 114 and improve public health responses in general (IHRs). 115 Although migration and population mobility may feature in some aspects of these endeavors, there is a paucity of integrated collective action on migration-associated components. Integrating a migration component into these activities can facilitate the global approach to disease control and demonstrate immediate benefit for both source and recipient nations. Mobile populations are one of the means by which locally arising risks can become global challenges. Mitigation programs and control strategies must encompass migration components in terms of both threat-to-risk assessment and intervention planning. The importance of these issues has been noted during responses to global health events such as SARS (2003) and the more recent pandemic influenza (2009) event, wherein travel-related control measures included screening, inspection, isolation, quarantine, and exclusion.

Such shared awareness reflects the multiple and complex drivers behind health problems. In reference to the social determinants of health identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) commission (13), social drivers for integrated approaches include lack of participation, cohesion, and welfare, as well as the presence of ignorance, poverty, poor governance, inequality, violence, mental and physical illness, or high risks for these. Environmental drivers include climate change, land degradation, reduced biodiversity, and ecosystem changes rooted in both natural phenomena and human actions. Economic drivers are mostly related to the globalization process, dominated by market deregulation and financial capital, and largely irrespective of social needs at the local level (14, 15) . In this context, the capacity of nations to support public health services and welfare has been progressively eroded and the increasingly scarce resources require enhancement of inter-sectoral synergies, establishment of adequate governance structures, and effective achievement of multiple outcomes simultaneously. Human, animal, and plant populations are affected in many different ways by this process, potentially further widening the gap in human's access to health and welfare. These examples are by no means exhaustive, and there is clearly an interplay between different drivers. For example, globalized trade agreements may lead to land acquisition by large multinational companies, thereby creating land shortages for local populations who are pushed to intensified extraction of available natural resources. Increased poverty in conjunction with close contact to previously unexploited environments puts human and animal health at risk (16) . At the same time, economic crises and financial deregulation reduce public resources for interventions, thereby reinforcing negative environmental, economic, and social drivers and exacerbating negative health outcomes (17) .",34.341150602197516,13.018691271219208

Almost 60% of responding families provided a moderate or large amount of caregiving between 1 and 9 months after hospital discharge. Just under half had to leave work after 1 month, and more than a third of families had lost savings after 1 year; families moved to a less expensive home, delayed educational plans, or delayed medical care for another family member [12] . A Canadian study, which consisted predominantly of previously healthy and relatively young patients (median age of 43) , reported that only 49% had returned to work 1 year after discharge from and ICU, increasing to 73% at 5 years.

The Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) also is a major concern for the developing countries because pharmaceutical patent would prevent generic drug production, which is vital to address various epidemics in developing countries.

Total expenditure on health rose from ¥313 per person in 1997 to ¥2096 per person in 2013. 16 This trend reflects a large expansion in fiscal space for health, 33 driven by economic growth, an increase in government spending as a share of GDP, and greater government commitment to health. 16, 34, 35 Household out-of-pocket expenditure also increased over this period, fuelled by rising demand for health care and escalating health-care costs. 36 Over time, hospitals were allowed to increase fees and mark-up charges on medications-changes that resulted in increased costs of care, misuse of services, and overprescription of medications. 37 Out-of-pocket spending peaked at 60% of total expenditure on health in 2001. Since then, major health sector reforms-particularly the expansion of health insurance schemes for both rural and urban residentshave reduced exposure to out-of-pocket payments through greater health financing from government tax revenue and social health insurance contributions. (appendix p 12). The rural New Cooperative Medical Scheme was introduced in 2003 in response to increasing rates of impoverishment due to health service user charges. 38 The main objective of the scheme is to provide universal coverage and to improve equity and access to health care to the rural population. It is a voluntary insurance scheme funded from a mix of flat-rate household contributions and subsidies from the central and local governments. 38 This scheme operates at the county level, with different counties having different designs and benefit packages. 38, 39 According to the 2012 Report on the Work of the Chinese Government, 40 the scheme had covered 832 million rural residents, or 97·5% of Chinese farmers, by 2012. This high level of participation has partly been attributed to government efforts to encourage participation and to features in the design of the scheme to avoid adverse selection (such as compulsory enrolment of all members in a household). 38 The government contribution to the insurance premium increased from ¥10 per person in 2003 to ¥380 per person in 2015. The New Cooperative Medical Scheme has resulted in increased use of village clinics and inpatient and outpatient services. 38, 39 Despite the expansion of social health insurance, medical care expenditure has continued to represent a great proportion of total household spending, with substantial variation in total and out-of-pocket health expenditure across provinces. For example, per-capita health spending is four times greater in Beijing than in Guizhou. Perhaps surprisingly, in view of the regional disparities in health outcomes, health expenditure is greater in the eastern provinces and only slightly less in central provinces than in western provinces (figure 1). Moreover, with the exception of Tibet, western provinces seem equally reliant on out-of-pocket expenditure as a source of health financing as the rest of the country.",40.10149516214855,16.71466243209913

These requirements could pose diffi culties if a government sought, for example, to oblige hospitals to operate on a non-profi t basis.

The costs of healthrelated goods and services directly affect health by reducing the demand for necessary health care or by increasing consumption of unnecessary care. Leaving people vulnerable to economic barriers therefore would fail to reduce deprivations in health. Additionally, the uncertainty of health need, the catastrophic costs of medical care, and the risk-averse nature of individuals places risk pooling (eg, through insurance) at the centre of health-care financing. 20 An expensive medical event can prevent access to health care or be a primary cause of financial ruin. From a capability point of view, ""protective security"", 14 through health insurance, is a necessary safety net. And the economic burden of health care should be justly shared by all through the redistribution of funds from the well to the ill and the rich to the poor, using progressive financing and community rating. 21 Sixth, one of the most difficult tasks in applying an ethical framework that values health intrinsically is the conceptualisation and measurement of health and inequalities in its many domains. There are many approaches to measuring health equity. As Sudhir Anand and colleagues have shown, 22 the choice depends on numerous considerations, ranging from health domains to the weights attached to those domains. 22 Another consideration is the choice of groups for stratification. 22 Even within the capability perspective, one would need to determine what set of inequality measures would be most appropriate for a given exercise, although certain types of inequality assessment-for example, a goal of complete ""health equality"" (levelling down to lowest common denominator)-have less appeal than others. And certain health equity evaluations-for example, deciding how much priority to give the ""worst-off""-will undoubtedly require public reasoning about values imbedded in the health equity concept. Although the capability view of health does not come down on an exact formula for judging inequalities in health, Sen has noted the potential use of ""partial ordering"" (eg, ordering some alternatives as opposed to ordering them all) of health states for assessing relative inequalities. In a collective exercise, incomplete theorisation may facilitate evaluation in health policy. 15, 16, 23 Incompletely theorised agreements Incomplete theorisation is useful to a theory of health and social justice because it provides a framework for understanding collective decision-making on human goods that are plural and indistinct (such as health and inequality), and allows individuals to take divergent paths to a common, though often partial, agreement. It describes how people with divergent, even opposing, views on health, equity, and health-policy issues might reach agreement in specific situations and thus generate health-policy decisions that are legitimate and stable and reflect mutual respect. 15, 16, 23 The method of reaching agreement described here is called incompletely theorised agreements, developed by Cass Sunstein, 24 and it holds promise for health-policy decision-making at several levels. 15, 16, 23 An incompletely theorised agreement is one that is not uniformly theorised at all levels, from high-level justifications to low-level particulars. It complements and extends the capability approach by providing a framework for operationalising the capability approach at three or more levels. The first level is the conceptual level, which specifies the valuable functionings that constitute human flourishing and health. The second level is the policy level, which specifies policies and laws. The third level is the intervention level, which specifies actions in particular cases and decisions about medical treatments, public-health interventions or social services. This framework constitutes three different types of incompletely theorised agreements: incompletely specified agreements, incompletely specified and generalised agreements, and incompletely theorised agreements on particular outcomes.",41.33904507680644,15.951518143448912

If there are substantial numbers of adult losses, the secondary impact may be the loss of primary caregivers for children in some urban communities. If the losses are more among the working population, there are essential businesses and services that may be short-handed and unable to perform indispensable functions.

The right to health hinges upon international agreements such as the WHO Constitution. It is, however, dependent upon the commitment, capacity and/or coordination of each national state. Each state is legally responsible for the security-expanded to arguably include health-of its citizens, but only according to its ability to protect and provide. This can lead to gaping holes in both the conceptualization and the implementation of interventions to support health security. While the movements to demand healthcare, leading to increased access to HIV and AIDS medications, for example, are beyond the scope of this book, it is worth noting that health for all in principle has not translated into health for all either in policy or in practice. Non-citizens, for instance, can easily be excluded from the citizen-rights /state-responsibility relationship, with little recourse to alleviate their situation. The current migration streams are set to exacerbate this challenge. If and when (political) refugees are granted asylum, they are entitled to health benefits, among others.

As such, oncology specialists as well as other providers regularly involved in the diagnosis, active treatment, and longitudinal follow-up of patients with cancer must consider how to 1) balance a delay in cancer diagnosis or treatment against the risk for a potential COVID-19 exposure, 2) mitigate the risks for significant care disruptions associated with social distancing behaviors, and 3) manage the appropriate allocation of limited health care resources in this unprecedented time of health care crisis.",34.6863595245374,13.965816497736421

However, some (but not all) of these hospitals have recently been subsumed by new public arm's-length organizations known as regional health authorities (RHAs), which were established by the provinces beginning in the late 1980s. This change, commonly referred to as regionalization in Canada, involved the provincial governments carving up their respective territories into geographic regions and then creating RHAs to administer the delivery of a continuum of health services, from hospitals and nursing homes to home care and public health. As arm's-length public organizations established under provincial law, RHAs have a mandate to meet the health needs of the populations within their boundaries as both purchasers and providers of services. The type and extent of services purchased from independent facilities or professionals vary considerably among RHAs and among provinces. As can be seen in Table 1 , the population size of RHAs varies considerably from province to province. Although the provincial governments are responsible for administering most public health care in Canada, the federal government nonetheless plays a critical role in health care beyond upholding the broad principles and conditions under the Canada Health Act. These other activities include: funding health research; collecting health data through Statistics Canada; financing and administering health services for First Nations people and Inuit, inmates of federal penitentiaries, war veterans, and active members of the Canadian armed forces and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police; as well as regulating the pharmaceutical and natural health products industries.",32.02129100427268,13.923726238139801

This implies that recent training could have influenced the reported behavior of the workers in a more protective direction, although our survey could not confirm this possibility due to its cross-sectional nature. Additionally, this suggests the possibility of the value of enhanced training and awareness of disease risks of wildlife workers in general. Along with training, it is imperative that wildlife workers have access to the necessary PPE to help mitigate risks. The extensive use of gloves reported in most wildlife work tasks indicates that consideration of personal protective equipment is routine among the survey respondents. The fact that the use of other types of personal protective equipment such as N95 respiratory protection varied by task and type of animal contact situation, with the highest rates of use reported during high-risk activities such as necropsy of diseased animals suggests that workers are making task-based judgments about risk. A number of respondents indicated that they took extra precautions when animals appeared to be sick, including extensive use of PPE and increased vigilance in performing tasks. At the same time, there was variability in the reported degree of access to PPE. These results underscore the importance of ensuring adequate access to personal protective equipment for this at risk population.

To mitigate SARS impact on Singapore's economy, the government took every precaution and spared no effort to contain the SARS outbreak in Singapore. Two aspects of SARS warranted government intervention to mitigate economic impact. First, the information that needs to be collected and disseminated to effectively assess SARS displays the characteristics of public good. Second, there are negative externalities related to contagious diseases in the sense that they affect third parties in market transactions. Public good and negative externalities are typical areas where government action is needed (Fan 2003) . There are three major factors which can explain why some economies are more vulnerable and susceptible to the effect of SARS than others (Asian Development Bank Outlook 2003) . These factors are structural issues (e.g. shares of tourism in GDP and the composition of consumer spending), initial consumer sentiments, and government responses. As the research shows, the Singapore government implemented a USD 132 million (SGD 231 million in 2003) SARS relief package to reduce the costs for tourism operators and its auxiliary services. On the other hand, an economic relief package worth USD 131m (SGD 230m) was created to aid businesses hit by SARS. 5 In addition, the government incurred USD$109m (SGD 192m) in direct operating expenditure related to SARS, and committed another USD 60m (SGD105m) development expenditure of hospitals for additional isolation rooms and medical facilities to treat SARS and other infectious diseases.

To enhance the number of patients who can receive life-sustaining interventions, the Task Force on Mass Critical Care (hereafter termed the Task Force) has suggested a framework for providing limited, essential critical care, termed emergency mass critical care (EMCC). This article suggests medical equipment, concepts to expand treatment spaces, and staffing models for EMCC. Methods: Consensus suggestions for EMCC were derived from published clinical practice guidelines and medical resource utilization data for the everyday critical care conditions that are anticipated to predominate during mass critical care events. When necessary, expert opinion was used. Task Force major suggestions: The Task Force makes the following suggestions: (1) one mechanical ventilator that meets specific characteristics, as well as a set of consumable and durable medical equipment, should be provided for each EMCC patient; (2) EMCC should be provided in hospitals or similarly equipped structures; after ICUs, postanesthesia care units, and emergency departments all reach capacity, hospital locations should be repurposed for EMCC in the following order: (A) step-down units and large procedure suites, (B) telemetry units, and (C) hospital wards; and (3) hospitals can extend the provision of critical care using non-critical care personnel via a deliberate model of delegation to match staff competencies with patient needs.

Weather-related conditions (e.g., high winds, dust storms, sudden floods, blinding rain, or snow) are factors contributing to fatalities and injuries that were discussed in Chapter 7 as being of concern to both transportation and public health officials. In many cases, the weather-related event itself can result in fatalities. For example, the National Weather Service (NWS) reported 116 people killed in floods, 106 from extreme heat, 43 from hurricanes, and 20 from high winds in 2018 (note: this report did not include updated estimated deaths from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico). Fifty percent of the 418 flood deaths from 2015 to 2017 occurred in vehicles (NWS, 2018). 2. Transportation provides accessibility to all sorts of land uses, including medical and health care facilities. Widespread disruptions due to extreme weather can cut access to such facilities seriously affecting the ability of health caregivers to provide medical help. This also impacts the supply chain of medical supplies and personnel trying to access the affected areas. During the recovery period, transportation facilities and service provide the channel for water and food to reach disaster zones, as well as supporting the social determinants of health that are stressed during times of disruption. 3. Roads, and in some cases transit services, helicopters, and airplanes, can provide a means of evacuating either areas that are likely to face a disaster (e.g., hurricane) or those that have experienced one (e.g., earthquake). Having a means of evacuation is especially important when there is only one way to leave. A wildfire in California in 2018, for example, surrounded the only road serving isolated campgrounds and other recreational sites that were later burned as well, resulting in fatalities for those not heeding the advice to evacuate before the fire reached those sites. Hurricane Katrina is partially remembered for large groups of the population stranded in New Orleans with no means to evacuate (the city has since identified bus stops designated for pickups of those without vehicles prior to a hurricane hitting the region). Another (nonclimate change) example is the effort of the Oregon DOT to establish routes into the state that would survive a major earthquake given that the major interstate serving the state (I-5) is expected to be destroyed in many locations (ODOT, 2014) . Alternate routes are being hardened; redundant command and control centers have been established; and prepositioning of emergency supplies has occurred to provide access to water, food, and medical supplies assuming that the road network is disrupted. 4. In some cases, transportation facilities and services can provide refuge for those seeking shelter. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, many people sought higher elevations, that is, bridges, to avoid rising flood waters. In many cities during heat waves, those without air conditioning ride airconditioned buses to avoid the heat (some transit agencies offer free trips for this purpose); during extreme cold, many likewise ride the transit system seeking heat. 5. Transportation agencies are often one of the few agencies with monitoring and public information capabilities in forewarning the population about an impending disaster and to communicate after a disaster occurs. These include communications about emergency routing, roadway closures, wide-area alerts, early warnings, evacuation, re-entry into disaster zones, and disaster travel information. Variable message signs that are common on major highways throughout the world can be used to convey messages concerning the locations of shelters and the most efficient paths through a road network. 6. In the aftermath of a major disaster, transportation agencies provide the physical barriers to isolate areas that are targeted for recovery to keep out those who do not belong. In addition, one of the key challenges facing many communities after a disaster is removing levels of debris that far exceed the capacity of a community to remove. State DOTs have the capability to transfer resources from one location to another and thus have become an important source of debris removal (if authorized to do so by the legislature). As an example of one state's efforts in debris removal, the Georgia DOT has formed ""strike teams"" for every segment of the state's freeway system that will respond quickly to system disruptions; staff from the state's forestry service are part of these strike teams in order to bring power saws to remove downed trees, often a major obstacle in reopening a road.",33.91733704034991,14.835684405849154

Current hospital reliance on ""just-in-time"" and stockless material management systems to reduce storage and inventory costs 14 leave institutions with vulnerably low reserves of key consumables and durable medical equipment. 15 Critical care equipment is no exception (Lewis Rubinson, MD, PhD; unpublished data; December 2007), so the quantity of additional critically ill patients a hospital can care for without resupply is impressively small. (See ""Definitive Care for the Critically Ill During a Disaster: Current Capabilities and Limitations."") Avoiding preparation to increase the availability of key medical resources will profoundly limit the capabilities of hospitals to offer many victims lifesustaining care when needed during a mass critical care event. Nevertheless, expecting all hospitals to stockpile multiples of every conceivable piece of critical care consumable and durable medical equipment for use only during low-frequency/ high-consequence events is unrealistic and perhaps even reckless. 14 Optimal critical care disaster preparedness calls for a resource strategy between these two extremes.

However, most countries, including those with widely available critical care services, lack sufficient specialized staff, medical equipment, and ICU space to provide timely, usual critical care for a large influx of additional patients. Shifting critical care disaster preparedness efforts to augment limited, essential critical care (emergency mass critical care [EMCC]), rather than to marginally increase unrestricted, individual-focused critical care may provide many additional people with access to life-sustaining interventions. In 2007, in response to the increasing concern over a severe influenza pandemic, the Task Force on Mass Critical Care (hereafter called the Task Force) convened to suggest the essential critical care therapeutics and interventions for EMCC. Task Force suggestions: EMCC should include the following: (1) mechanical ventilation, (2) IV fluid resuscitation, (3) vasopressor administration, (4) medication administration for specific disease states (eg, antimicrobials and antidotes), (5) sedation and analgesia, and (6) select practices to reduce adverse consequences of critical illness and critical care delivery. Also, all hospitals with ICUs should prepare to deliver EMCC for a daily critical care census at three times their usual ICU capacity for up to 10 days. Discussion: By using the Task Force suggestions for EMCC, communities may better prepare to deliver augmented critical care in response to disasters. In light of current mass critical care data limitations, the Task Force suggestions were developed to guide preparedness but are not intended as strict policy mandates.

Stigma is not the determining factor in treatment seeking but, instead, economic and logistical barriers decide who will be able to avail themselves of care (Castro and Farmer 2005) . In the case of EVD, poor infrastructure and weak public health systems were undeniable contributors to the spread of the disease. Additionally, as Castro and Farmer (2005) indicate, EVD differentially affected people based upon economic resources. In one of the stories we analyze later in this chapter, the family was able to pay an exorbitant sum for the pregnant wife to access care, but many others did not have the economic means to pursue even regular obstetric care at any cost. These infrastructure and economic constraints, when combined with a high case fatality rate and rapid progression of clinical EVD, dramatically set Ebola apart from HIV/AIDS. Taken together with the criteria of Maman et al. (2009) for stigma, particularly as related to the fears of suffering and death and the fear of transmission, the weak state in many of the affected countries provided the perfect storm for the development of strong and pervasive Ebola stigma. We argue here that it is likely that health care workers and community members fell back on stigmatization as, what they saw as, one of only a few possible ways of protecting themselves. Pregnant women, even those unaffected by the virus, suffered the consequences of people's fears, which took the form of increased stigma that caused many women to be refused care at health facilities. The health care system was undeniably overwhelmed by the number of Ebola patients and the particular needs for quarantine and supplies these patients presented. The fact that an Ebola epidemic was able to effectively shut down any and all routine health care services, particularly vital functions related to obstetric care, is a testament to the long-standing weaknesses of these systems (Chothia 2014) .",45.57734312132471,19.103926353955423

Her brother took her to two other clinics, where she was also refused treatment. Finally, a fourth clinic let them in, but by that time her baby had died-and she did not have Ebola. The staff member did not have the supplies to further treat her and the retained dead infant, so Sheriff called numerous doctors, prepared to offer them a large sum of money ($400 USD). But no doctor answered his calls, and his sister died, adding to the maternal mortality of the epidemic (Moore 2014). Stories abound of uninfected pregnant women who died as a result of pregnancy complications or miscarriages because they could not get health care. Fatuma's story, similar to Comfort Fayiah's above, also demonstrates an additional burden on poor women; even though her brother was prepared to offer a very large sum of money for her care, it was still impossible to get appropriate medical attention. For many other women and their families, such sums of money would be absolutely out of their reach. Under more normal circumstances (i.e., without the added stressors of a highly fatal epidemic), a family might fundraise from relatives and/or neighbors and friends to acquire enough money for treatment. However, with so many people infected, and rapidly deteriorating infrastructure making daily life more difficult than normal, this network might, logically, rapidly start to fray and become less reliable. It must be considered that women coming from wealthier families would not only have more cultural capital to exert when trying to access care during pregnancy or while giving birth, but would have more physical capital to put on the line in the search for care, as well. Women and families with more funds would be able to pay higher costs that might be charged for scarce medical supplies or that might be given as incentives for transportation or health care services. This differential access to capital would further enlarge the already present gap between those women living at a subsistence level and those who might be considered more middle or upper middle class in these countries. Being able to put resources on the line in the effort to attain care could possibly have helped to mitigate the stigma associated with pregnant women and treating them. However, the story of Fatuma suggests that pregnant women were so highly feared and stigmatized that even large sums of money could not induce health care workers to overcome this stigma.",44.26715920416117,17.683055125839115

Failure to do so may lead to situations that are ethically compromising and undermine public trust, such as when access to critical care resources is denied based on crisis standards by one institution without referral to a nearby institution capable of providing critical care. Regions should institute an Incident Management System (IMS) at the facility, local, regional or state, and national level to exercise command and control over scarce resources. 16 Furthermore, decision-makers should communicate with community emergency services and local hospitals to ensure a coordinated approach to patient transfers, standards of care, and resource allocation. 16 , 17 2. We suggest critical care only be rationed when resources have, or will shortly be, overwhelmed despite all eff orts at augmentation and a regional-level authority that holds the legal authority and adequate situational awareness has declared an emergency and activated its mass critical care plan.

Similarly, in some jurisdictions, the relevant authority will be responsible for declaring an emergency and activating a mass critical care plan but may not have statutory powers. Nevertheless, a decision to ration critical care should not be made unilaterally at an institutional level because individual institutions do not possess the situational awareness in isolation to operationally or ethically justify such a decision. Similarly, the decision to cease triage should occur in a graduated and coordinated manner by altering the prioritization criteria and exclusion thresholds as resources become available. 19 3.

The decision to place the ventilators with end users accomplished the goals of having the ventilators in the field where they would be readily available and maintained and could be utilized in day-to-day emergent interfacility and intrafacility transports. The supplemental oxygen component of the program provides low-flow oxygen within the community-based alternate care facilities that are supported by state legislation during mass casualty events and public health emergencies. Critical to this effort was state support and legislation as well as the effective use of sub-state public health regions to support planning and command and control response activities. Within the regions, coalitions supporting this effort included a core group of critical partners providing medical control and subject matter expertise and multiple supportive agencies and NGOs. Space included public schools, college facilities, community centers, and NGO facilities. Staff comprised community volunteer groups, the state Metropolitan Medical Response System (MMRS) team, hospitals, private practices, and other practitioners.

In addition to essential new investments in traditional medical education, the shifting or sharing of clinical tasks from highercadre to lowercost health workers will be needed to improve healthservice efficiency and expand the reach of health services, especially for remote and marginalised communities. Increased use of trained community health workers offers an important taskshifting strategy for rationalising health spending and bringing services closer to the communities that need them. Compensation and training costs for community health workers are much less than for highercadre health workers, and the availability of community health workers enables doctors and nurses to focus more time on the skills for which they are specially trained. 192 Numerous models for community health workers are already in operation in diverse regions, including in highincome countries. Ideally, community health workers are drawn from the communities they serve, receive extensive training that enables them to diagnose and address multiple health conditions, and are compensated, supervised, and fully integrated into health systems. Integrating community health workers into health systems has been shown to increase immunisation rates, enhance access to diverse health services, and reduce childhood mortality. [193] [194] [195] The financing of health care can have a major effect on the efficiency of health services. To improve efficiency and quality of care, policy makers are advised to optimise the mix of payment strategies (eg, capitation, casebased reimbursement, feeforservice, per diem) that incentivises service access, quality of care, satisfaction of provider and client, and other system priorities. 196 Evidence suggests that carefully designed financial incentives to patients could increase use of preventive care, which improves health outcomes and potentially averts more costly therapeutic interventions in the future.",33.205023980778876,13.177128819450584

In 2016, the percapita gross domestic product (GDP) in North America was more than 34 times higher than in south Asia or subSaharan Africa and nearly 92 times higher than in lowincome countries generally. 23 These extraordinary disparities in access to the fruits of the global econ omy are inevitably reflected in health outcomes because lower socioeconomic status is closely correlated with poorer health. 24 In addition to differences between countries, persistent social and economic inequalities within countries increase vulnerability to disease and diminish service access. In diverse countries, lowerincome households consisten tly have poorer access to health care than the more affluent and experience comparatively greater morbidity and mortality. 25 Existing global health mechanisms and practices fail to ensure ready, equitable access to international public goods such as medicines and diagnostics. Although the 2001 Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health recognised the flexibility of countries under international law to obtain access to essential medicines, the global community has yet to find a workable balance between trade and the right to health. Unfortunately, the HIV response, which achieved a 99% reduction in the annual cost of firstline ART between 2000 and 2015, largely remains an outlier with respect to medicines access in resourcelimited settings. Affordable diagnostic tools are also often in short supply. Nearly half of African countries have no cancer radiotherapy services, leaving four of five Africans without access to radiotherapy. 26 The 2014 Ebola outbreak in west Africa underscored the ongoing crisis of global health governance. 27 Although the International Health Regulations were designed in part to discourage restrictive and coercive responses to health emergencies, nearly a quarter of the WHO member states imposed restrictions on trade and travel in response to the Ebola outbreak. 28 WHO, a cornerstone for global health governance, remains chronically underfunded and hobbled by a decentralised structure, which often inhibits rapid and effective responses to emerging health crises. 29 Deteriorating environment for human rights, sound governance, and global cooperation",33.30456037297296,12.231371432764396

Although guided by a market Health Care in China approach, the central government has responded to growing public criticism for affordable access to health care services with greater financial risk protection from outof-pocket spending on health services. Funding for health care in China derives from several newly enacted governmental sources. 12 They include subsidies to rural and urban residents not covered by the Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI) program through the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) or the Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance Program (URBMI), respectively. With a goal of increasing funding to cover at least 75% and 50% for hospital admissions and outpatient services, more than 96% of the population is covered together by NCMS, URBMI, and UEBMI. There has been a parallel increase in governmental health service coverage for hospital payments. Primary health care providers receive governmental funds to deliver a package of basic health services. Health care providers and government-appointed hospital officials, motivated by profits and behavior similar to other for-profit organizations, have been incentivized to prescribe excessive and high-tech diagnostic tests and to prescribe pharmaceuticals to earn profits for later distribution. In 2011, expenditures on drugs accounted for 43% of total health expenditures, 12 nearly triple the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's (OCED) average of 16%. With providers permitted to charge a 15% markup on pharmaceuticals, and public hospital profits tied to utilization of services, there is neither the motivation nor the incentive to find cost-effective approaches to health care service delivery focusing on aspects of disease prevention, health promotion, and disease management or a more functional coordination between primary, secondary, and tertiary health care providers.",43.04494211616855,17.80000436643719

The business continuity team should then review these processes for criticality and prioritize them, creating an official critical process list. Planning for recovery of the critical processes is the primary concern. Noncritical processes should be recovered and resumed after the critical processes. Resource and time limitations do not allow for resumption of all processes at the same time. Processes critical to the business must have top priority. Any processes determined not to be critical should be planned for during the later stages of the resumption effort. • Critical process interdependencies: As part of the critical process assessment, particular emphasis must be placed on information systems and process interdependencies. For example, an information system in and of itself may not be determined by its process owner to be critical. However, if it supports a critical process and that critical process can't be completely restored without the information system, then that information system itself becomes critical. Examining processes as part of a system is essential in the assessment of criticality. Interdependencies need to be identified in order to properly assess criticality to the business. Other interdependencies may exist in the form of relationships with organizations outside of the enterprise. These too must be considered. Different methodologies can be used to estimate potential impact a contingency or disaster may have on a critical process. When considering the criticality of a process, the financial effect, operational effect and any less tangible or quantifiable concerns, such as customer satisfaction, must be addressed. • Resources: Critical process recovery requires an assessment of resources. Planning for process restoration means considering what resources may no longer be available and will need to be acquired or obtained to get the critical process up and functional again. What type of facilities will be needed and where? Will additional hardware, software, or equipment be required? Will people capable of managing and working the processes be available? Will there be effective means of communications? If not, what must be done to provide a minimum capability of communications until full communications can be restored? These are some of the resource issues and questions the team must grapple with. • Mitigation strategies: For those processes identified as critical, preevent actions can be taken to help mitigate the impact, both operationally and financially, of interruptions to the business. When developing contingency plans for critical processes, strategies will become apparent that may be implemented prior to an event that will lessen the impact of an event if and when it occurs. A cost/benefit analysis may be required to assess the feasibility of implementing a preevent action and if the analysis shows it to be an effective action, it should be taken. For example, an old building not built to current building codes may be vulnerable to damage from an earthquake. If that building supports a critical process, it may be more cost effective to retrofit the building with the necessary structural supports and bring it into compliance with current standards than to risk severe damage in the event of an earthquake, rendering a critical process inoperative. • Vital records: The ability to recover vital records is critical to the recovery and restoration process. Having a vital records protection and management program will enable the recovery of essential information during a contingency. • Customers and suppliers: The importance of considering input, participation, and impact to customers and suppliers cannot be overstated. Any business continuity planning must take into consideration customer and supplier relationships. Moreover, it is important to work with your suppliers and providers of goods and services to ensure they too have contingency plans in place. In the event a supplier supports one or more of your critical processes, a disruption to their business will impact your business operations. • Communications: Communicating during the recovery and resumption process can be just as important as communications during other phases of a contingency. Employees who may have been affected by the events of a crisis or disaster need to be kept abreast of developments affecting them and their employment. Customers and suppliers need to understand the progress made toward resumption of business, as it may have a serious impact on their operations. Even the external worlds of stakeholders and shareholders have an interest in these events. • Lessons learned: There is an old adage that lightning doesn't strike twice in the same place. If only that were certain and true, and applicable to the critical processes of a business. However, it is not. Therefore, much can be learned from each phase of managing and recovering from a contingency. Documenting the process of recovery and restoration will help in identifying the things learned, both good and bad, and will go a long way toward helping to deal with other crises when they occur.",32.887541125667425,14.374667180238482

These include using compulsory licensing or parallel importing for access to generic drug treatments, restricting in non-discriminatory ways imports of unhealthy food products while reducing tariffs on imports of healthy foods, reviewing investment treaties to ensure that intellectual property rights are not considered in the definition of 'investment' and considering, as is the case in South Africa, not renewing such investment treaties that may be expiring.

Considerations of infection prevention and the avoidance of crosscontamination may additionally dictate that infected patients be placed in a geographically separate location. In situations where there are inadequate numbers of individual rooms, patients with confirmed infections may be cohorted in common areas to reduce the risk of cross-contamination. 40 During a standard hospital surge, it is anticipated that institutions can tolerate a 20% increase in critically ill patients with minimal impact. Increases of up to 200% of normal capacity may occur, but only at the cost of degraded capability and a possible modification in the standard of care. When ICU capacity is exceeded, less-ill patients may need to be transferred to other levels of care, such as patients not requiring mechanical ventilation, vasopressor support, or intensive neuromonitoring. Conversely, areas of the hospital capable of ICU-level monitoring, such as a postanesthesia care unit (PACU) or a monitored step-down unit, may need to be repurposed as temporary ICUs, especially if cohorting of seriously ill patients is planned.

After all, health care is a human activity; what people actually value is the capability to attain good health. He further notes that equitable social processes should inform evaluations of equity in the health space.

The WHO, World Bank and other IGOs have long advocated health districts and local clinics to provide essential services such as maternal care. Health systems failed due to stagnant funding, inadequate flow of aid and loss of health care workers to the private sector or over international borders (WHO 2005c) .

Although full agreement as to the inclusion of social insurance within the health policy domain and purview of LNHO was never fully accepted, the debate about the appropriate catchment area for health had begun. The LNHO, the International Labor Organization (ILO) and a number of nation-states entered the fray. Support for social insurance was especially strong in a number of European states.

Although in our previous study (Abu-El-Noor et al., 2016) we called for immediate interventions from health care policy makers and hospital administrations and to offer adequate treatment and counselling for those affected by the war stress and to take further interventions to improve their mental health, to reduce the incidence of chronic PTSD and other possible psychiatric disorders, improve their job satisfaction and reduce burn out to retain them in their professions, but on the ground, there were no actions taken. The only actions that were taken were sporadic interventions that were taken by international organizations, such as Doctors of Spain. We believe that this was not enough. There are several possible reasons that health policy makers did not intervene to offer help and counselling to health care providers affected by the war. First, it is possible that health policy makers are not aware of the impact of PTSD. A second possible reason is lack of financial resources. Gaza Strip passes through crises and under siege for the last decade. Financial resources are very limited; therefore, priorities are in a continuous dramatic change. Meeting physical needs such are water, food, and electricity supplies come first in the priority list of the government. A third possible reason is that international health organizations are not engaged in offering such help as they are also considering meeting physical needs as a priority. Only a few number of organizations had offered counselling to health care professionals after the war. A final possible reason could be related to the gap between research and policy makers as some policy makers don't take seriously the results of research studies into their considerations. The literature described the gap between research and practice in health care and public health as large and troubling (Glasgow & Emmons, 2007; Lenfant, 2003) . Again, we encourage our health policy makers to reconsider their policy and to intervene to save these doctors and nurses from chronic complications to PTSD.",43.502040932378364,17.477678889463757

These included unanswered questions concerning the emergence of novel infectious diseases; understanding the space-time dynamics of influenza spread; influenza mortal-ity in pandemics and seasonal outbreaks; the impact of global air transportation on the spread of diseases; the role of models in public health planning and decision making; the evolution of pandemic influenza viruses; and the potential for novel means to prevent these pandemics. Dr Julien Arino (University of Manitoba) outlined the objectives of an ongoing data-driven project that aims to draw out the likely patterns of disease spread through the network of all international airports in the world with direct and indirect connections. This investigation can have important implications for heading off a global pandemic, with a particular focus on the optimal allocation of containment resources in the most probable ports of disease introduction and spread in Canada. This presentation was followed by an overview of the Ontario Government's Pandemic Preparedness Plan (Allison Stuart, Assistant Deputy Minister of the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care), which provides the most comprehensive provincial plan in Canada, having undergone five iterations developed over a 5-year period. This plan details guidance to local planners and specific strategies for health sector sub-groups (critical care, pediatrics, laboratories, long-term care, persons with chronic diseases, mental health settings), first responders, faith groups, private sector organizations, and First Nations communities. This presentation also included a list of concerns which modeling should address relating to acute care services (e.g., estimated hospital surge capacity for a given jurisdiction during a pandemic); local implementation (e.g., identification of the tipping point when primary care will not be able to meet the 24-48 hour standard of care); and antivirals (e.g., identifying the optimal use of drugs and distribution methods for treatment and prophylaxis to decelerate the spread of a pandemic). Dr. Joanne Langley (Co-chair, Canadian Pandemic Vaccine Working Group) presented a detailed analysis of the potential benefits and uncertainties relating to the standard pillars of pandemic influenza contingency plans, covering antiviral drugs; healthcare delivery planning; vaccines; public health measures; and infection control practices. This included the importance of personal protective equipment such as the N95 mask in the healthcare setting, the need for regular and frequent hand washing, and a risk analysis of potential amantadine resistance. Dr. Langley also stressed the need for ''real time'' modeling to provide a rapid analysis of alternative tactical decisions following the onset of a pandemic. Dr. Mark Walderhaug (Associate Director, US Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, FDA) discussed a stock-and-flow model used for simulating the impact of an influenza pandemic on the US blood supply. The model assumes that susceptibility to the pandemic virus will be universal; multiple waves of infection can occur and each wave adversely impacts infected communities for 6-8 weeks; and absenteeism may reach as high as 40% dur-ing the peak periods. Model simulations for the entire US blood supply were presented, and the need for acquiring detailed data of inter-regional flow of blood was emphasized. These data are essential for projecting various scenarios, including run-out for hospitals despite adequate national supplies and time frames for elective surgery cancellations while the blood supply recovers, which highlight the significant challenges involved in supply distribution.",37.167753418264226,16.165703330429494

More research is needed on this increasingly important issue because many governments are adopting health policies to contain expenditure, which could result in reduced quality of care, especially for those with severe mental illness. We herein propose several recommendations, based on our findings that health policymakers may find useful. The government should identify psychiatric patients with major psychiatric disorders so that adequate care can be provided, even in the event that the expenditure cap is exceeded. It is also important to carefully evaluate the future impact of health policy prior to its implementation, and subsequently design a more stable strategy to avoid reducing these patients' quality of care (e.g., by limiting the use of SGAs). Furthermore, it is important for the government to value the important contribution of public psychiatric hospitals and to maximize the financial aid and quality of care in the public sector. Further suggestions include the following: after the implementation of GB, outcomes can be compared regarding medical quality or patients' quality of life such as readmission rates, years of hospitalization, suicide rates, and level of patient satisfaction. In addition, the same model can be applied to assess the extent of change in the prescription pattern for other psychotropic medications such as antidepressants, anxiolytics, and mood stabilizers.",32.12085849980509,14.091856038858477

In absolute terms, the US government has contributed great amounts to ODA; however, as depicted in Fig. 2 , the relative amount contributed in 2009 was only 0.20% of US GNI, a figure less generous than the percentage contributed by most European countries, Australia, and Canada. The US government's global health program, compared with that of many other donor governments, cuts across many departments. It draws upon both the foreign-assistance structure but also the government's extensive public health capabilities. In addition to well-known actors, such as the US Agency for International Development and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, executive branch agencies with a significant involvement in global health include the departments of state, defense, agriculture, homeland security, labor, and commerce, as well as the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Peace Corps, and the Health Resources and Services Administration. These agencies carry out programs in more than 100 countries and are overseen by more than 15 congressional committees. 26 The US financial commitment to global health has dramatically increased over the last decade, especially with the implementation of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the President's Malaria Initiative (Fig. 3) . Originally authorized in 2003 at about $15 billion, PEPFAR focused on 15 countries, mostly in Africa. Over its first 5 years, PEPFAR sought to support antiretroviral treatment for 2 million people infected with HIV; prevent 7 million HIV infections; and provide care, including care for orphans and vulnerable children, for 10 million individuals. The program has been viewed as a major success for US global health policy. 27 With wide bipartisan support, PEPFAR was reauthorized in 2008 for another 5 years at $39 billion, with substantial increases in the prevention, treatment, and care targets. The legislation also authorized $4 billion for tuberculosis programming and $5 billion for malaria efforts. 28 Although PEPFAR represents a landmark US achievement in global health, it also illustrates how policy can be skewed by nonscientific factors.

Although HIV/AIDS still dominates the GHI, increased investments are being made for neglected tropical diseases, malaria, maternal and child health, and family planning (Box 3). The aims of the GHI are to implement a woman-centered and girlcentered approach; increase impact and efficiency through strategic coordination and integration; strengthen and leverage key partnerships, multilateral organizations, and private contributions; encourage country ownership and investing in country-led plans; improve metrics, monitoring, and evaluation; and promote research and innovation. 30 The US government's policy commitment to global health has been greatly lauded as a reflection of our vital health and economic self-interests, our humanitarian values, and ""smart power."" [31] [32] [33] In many ways, it is an important form of diplomacy; however, some aspects of it may also hinder diplomatic prerogatives. Some forms of ODA can be used as leverage in diplomatic negotiations, but once a patient infected with HIV is taken into a PEPFAR-funded treatment program, it would be unethical for the US government to threaten the loss of those lifesaving drugs for diplomatic advantage. 34 ",33.12859835652323,13.494161614276308

When the policy was promulgated in 2012, roles and responsibilities were not well defined by the USG in the document. It was assumed by many that the IBC would take the lead on the issues as they relate to DURC research because the committee has recognized knowledge of the research being conducted by investigators and because of its members' many years of experience evaluating research involving rDNA, performing risk assessments, and assigning bio-containment levels. Of particular significance, 2014 policy reassigns the burden back to the Principal Investigator to initially identify their project as DURC. Further, the institution is required to establish an Institutional Review Entity (IRE). The IRE can be a committee established to review dual use research, an extant committee such as an IBC with the addition of ad hoc members to meet the established requirements of the committee, or an externally administered committee to review dual use research [31] . The IRE must be set up for the sole purpose of conducting review of research for dual use potential. The IRE must meet several criteria including that the group must be composed of at least five members and empowered by the institution to ensure it can execute the relevant requirements of the Policy for DURC Oversight. The members must have knowledge to assess the dual use potential of the range of relevant life science research conducted at a research facility. In addition, the committee must have individuals with knowledge of relevant US Government policies and understanding of risk assessment. The panel must also be conversant in risk management, biosafety, and biosecurity. The IRE is responsible for communications with the US Government funding agencies regarding mitigation plans and will have ongoing oversight of the project [31] . Not surprisingly, the requirements for the IRE align with the established mandates for an IBC. In most circumstances and at the majority of establishments, the IBC is the logical choice for the review and oversight of DURC at the institutional level. However, putting the burden of DURC review on the IBC increases the workload and regulatory burden on an already overtaxed committee that is not compensated for their time and effort.

Regarding the content, governments can identify the most suitable approaches to increase the usefulness of the messages and thereby mitigate public health risk by analyzing the types of information that citizens want or/and need, the preferred format, and the appropriate level of detail. Furthermore, it is important that such e-government services can prevent inaccurate, incomprehensible information, by monitoring the system and adopting filtering tools. As for social media channels, the public health risk communicators should engage in clear, balanced and beneficial approaches to deal with potential emotional responses of the public because social media is a personalized network with subjective norm-based communication infrastructures (Graham et al., 2015; Mergel, 2016) . Furthermore, our study highlights that the ICT competence level of target citizens is a crucial condition for the use of government social media services, which reveals the need to enhance the citizen's media literacy (Lallmahomed et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2011) .

The limited work thus far on the wider macroeconomic impact of pandemic influenza, alluded to above, has considered different aspects of an influenza pandemic but, in each case, the financial sector has been aggregated together with other service industries and sectors. As a result, little can be said about the sectoral impact of a pandemic over the results for the aggregated economic effect. The work presented here therefore focuses on assessing the macroeconomic impact of an influenza pandemic on a single country economy using a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model, which allows for a disaggregated finance sector, as outlined in the sector listing in the Appendix, to generate greater specificity in analysis. Application of this model to multiple countries is possible, as the model specification would not differ if applied to different countries with large financial sectors. Although the underlying database would differ between countries, as would some model parameters such as elasticities, the results should be seen as reasonably comparable across ""similar"" countries.

The balance of safety and providing quality results for patient care continues to be a delicate balance for the laboratory. Two future areas that may impact the laboratory overall, but are clearly needed for the high containment labs, include access to specimen collection devices that have the capacity to inactivate pathogens but still allow for the specimen to be acceptable for testing and the development of automated instruments by manufacturers that provide work flow efficiencies that includes close system testing along with specimen tracking. The development of specimen collection devices containing chemicals that can render a pathogen inactive while still stabilizing the specimen for testing has only recently been commercially developed for HIV testing [31, 32] .

The UI population is often of lower socioeconomic status, which adds to the difficulties accessing health care. Given that most of the federal insurance plans are unavailable to the UI population, UIs are susceptible to higher out-of-pocket costs for care. In addition, because of undocumented status, they may not have sick leave days and may have difficulty negotiating time off from work to seek care. 8 Decreased proficiency in the language of the host country and fear of deportation may also present barriers to health care for UIs. Studies have shown that patients with limited English language proficiency (LEP) are at higher risk of poor health and have decreased access to health care. Patients who have LEP had increased difficulty in understanding their health status as well as accessing preventive services. 9 Fear of deportation may lead to the avoidance of seeking care and risk of severe health complications, 8 and this also affects health care for US-born children of UIs. In addition, shame and discrimination are common feelings experienced by the UI population and contribute to poor access to health care globally. 8 Many of these issues in health care are not unique to the United States. In a study by Chauvin and colleagues, 10 22% of the UI population in Europe had access to health coverage, and, of those, only about 36% had true access because of barriers such as administrative difficulties, limited language proficiency, and lack of awareness of available services.

Health-care funders facing these facts might focus spending on primary and preventive care. The present global recession and heightened disparities are drawing attention to decades-old questions. How eff ective is critical care? How cost eff ective is critical care? How can we ration a service perceived to rescue lives at imminent risk of death? 92 Despite these realities, US clinicians perceive little or no resource restraints on their ability to deliver intensive care. 93 Data for structure, casemix, care processes, and outcomes of critical care in least developed countries (as by the UN defi nition based on low income, human resource weakness, and economic vulnerability) are restricted to descriptive studies suggesting few beds in intensive care, infrastructure, personnel, and equipment. Patients are thus admitted to ICUs with very high illness severity, and, not surprisingly, narrative reviews suggest that clinical outcomes are poor. 94 Maximising use of this scarce resource (table 2) implies attention to regionalisation and integration, based on prevailing local realities. 39 Some have argued that fi nancial inequities and cultural expectations make the notion of considering intensive care in developing countries misguided, and a universally applicable critical care ethic impossible. 95 Mitigating arguments emphasise philosophical principles of universal justice and harm to national economies 96 of untreated critical illness. Extrapolating from diseasespecifi c data from the WHO's Global Health Observatory, infection and perinatal complications are much more common causes of admission to an ICU in the developing world than complications of chronic cardiac, vascular, and pulmonary disease, which predominate in the developed world.

Those in opposition maintain that using taxpayer-funded services to support individuals who enter and remain in the United States illegally undermines the legal system. However, some scholars and legislators have argued that it is both unethical and impractical to deny access to health care services for illegal immigrants living in the United States. 16 They view health care as a basic human right and an obligation of a just society to provide health care for everyone. Leading medical professional societies such as the American Medical Association (AMA), American College of Physicians (ACP), the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), and the American Nurses Association (ANA) reaffirm the position that all individuals living in the United States, regardless of their immigration status, should have access to quality health care, including the opportunity to purchase insurance. These leaders maintain that providing this population with access to health insurance is an evidence-based way to reduce health care costs. [17] [18] [19] Another argument, from a cost perspective, is that many UIs will benefit from preventive care and early treatment of chronic diseases before they advance to lifethreatening and costly complications. 20, 21 Proponents of this strategy advocate for improving health literacy and vaccination rates, and offering health screenings to the UI population to try to prevent long-term adverse health outcomes and control cost. Moreover, UIs may harbor infections such as tuberculosis (TB), which, when undetected, can easily be transmitted to the general public, thus posing a public health risk. 22 In contrast, some have argued that treating UIs creates more expenditures for the United States while saving their countries of origin the costs of providing health care. 23 Furthermore, they argue that sharing inadequate health care resources with UIs will reduce the availability of those scarce resources for US citizens. In the last 2 decades, several states have attempted to advance legislation designed to deny UIs access to publicly funded health services. One such initiative was California's Proposition 187. This law, later deemed unconstitutional, required health care professionals to verify immigration status and report UIs to authorities. 24 In addition, some believe that continued unabated treatment of UIs is an incentive for persistent violation of the immigration laws and threatens national security in the post-9/11 era. 25 Proponents of this argument suggest that denying health care to UIs will discourage others from attempting to immigrate without proper documentation. 24 ",41.90847415095443,15.326824631323975

Governments may decide to invest in the development of primary care and disease prevention services to maximize cost-benefit indices, or tertiary care and treatment may be prioritized for fund distribution. Judgments must also be made about investment in research and development of medications, technologies and vaccines. Resource allocation decisions about health services relative to other national services are necessary. These decisions are political and vary greatly by nation and ideologies (Coburn, 2004) . They are likely to influence health by determining what kinds of services are available, how accessible and affordable they are and what sectors of the population have access (Mehrotra, 2006) . National policies regarding other domains of public life, including welfare, education, social security, subsidized housing, and employment, are also likely to play an important role in determining both quality of population health, as well as distribution of health outcomes in the population (Marmot, 2002) . Finally, political ideologies at the national level have been hypothesized to influence health by differential support of welfare policies and recognition of and attention to the needs of the population (Franco, Alvarez-Dardet, & Ruiz, 2004) . For example, a recent study found a link among good governance measured by accountability, political stability, absence of violence, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law and the control of corruption and national HIV prevalence (Menon-Johansson, 2005; Widdus, 2005) Economic decisions regarding resource allocation and distribution are likely to influence population health through various pathways with resounding health effects. For example, Freudenberg and colleagues (2006) describe the impact of city, state and federal budget cuts on a TB/HIV/homicide combined epidemic in New York City during the 1980s and 1990s, which they term a ""syndemic"". These authors argue that budget cuts undermined the ability of city health and social service infrastructures to respond to health emergencies and emerging health threats; reduced education, policing and drug treatment services; and amplified social trends. These factors then contributed to increased risk of violence and disease in the population. Other authors have posited that national policies influence health through the mechanisms of social capital, empowerment and access to information, which are differentially accorded to populations living under different political economic systems (Franco et al., 2004) . Perhaps most relevant to globalization and health are arguments delineating relationships between government policies shaped by capitalist ideology and health outcomes mediated by increasing income inequalities and lowered social cohesion (Coburn, 2000; Muntaner & Lynch, 1999) .

Segregation by socio-demographic characteristics is known to accompany differential exposure to poor quality environments, including toxins, crime, violence, poverty and infectious diseases . Poor, segregated populations have restricted access to health care services, shortages of health care providers and many under-or un-insured individuals (Mayberry, Mili, & Ofili, 2000) . Finally, segregation and income inequality can cause both perceived and actual inequity, which erodes social trust and diminishes social capital with the resulting health effects as discussed above.

Meltzer, Cox, and Fukuda (1999) estimated economic impact of vaccination-based interventions to support priority setting. They estimated the age distribution of those infected and the rates of hospitalization by age, based on experience in three pandemics in the 20th century. The U.S. Health and Human Services Pandemic Influenza Plan (2006) recommended that hospitals defer elective admissions to increase their capacity to treat influenza patients in the event of a surge in demand. However, there were neither specific regulations in place to enforce that recommendation nor a plan for financial incentives to encourage or facilitate it. Lim et al. (2004) and Wu, Yang, and Wu (2004) found that deferrals of elective admissions during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) viral outbreaks in Toronto and Taiwan, respectively, resulted in hospitals losing net revenue, at least in the short term.

At the global level, international policies regulate trade in goods. As this partially predicts income distribution, governance, trade, and income are closely intertwined. At the national level, income mediates the effect of global governance on population health. A classic example is the debate over generic pharmaceutical production in developing countries that arose over the need for antiretroviral (ARV) medication for HIV. Under the TRIPS agreement created by the WTO, the production of patented medications was prohibited at the global level. The result was that national access to expensive medications was determined by national income; rich countries could afford to buy life-saving medication for their populations and poor countries could not. To pursue this example to the community level, countries with enough income to purchase limited supplies of ARVs might offer better health outcomes to high income communities that could afford the high prices. Alternatively, these nations might choose other distribution criteria, offering the medications to government employees or to those seeking care at a certain health facility. It is easy to understand how, in a community with high HIV prevalence, differential access to ARVs might erode social cohesion and trust (Bennett & Chanfreau, 2005) . High medication prices may also divert resources from other necessities, such as food and school fees, producing resounding population health effects.",38.66997132782963,15.397549855010602

At the global level, rising income inequality encourages migration and fosters conflict (Wade, 2004) .

At the national level, unequal global income distribution provides differential access to necessary goods and services (Baum, 2001) . These goods and services help to determine national income which affects community-level access to resources necessary for good health through providing the means for infrastructural development, provision of social services, and provision of employment opportunities. Differential global income distribution therefore affects the local distribution of health resources. Sizeable income inequality also suppresses income growth at the national level (Cornia, 2001) and reduces the rate of poverty alleviation (Ravillion, 2001) .",33.41211108066218,15.061567152481793

For example, communities that lack access to good quality health services may have higher burdens of disease because sick individuals will delay seeking care or will turn to alternative options, such as traditional healers or self-treatment (Chen et al., 2004; Meerman et al., 2005) . Delayed treatment can have serious health consequences. For example, Gambian children presenting with severe malaria were significantly more likely to have delayed seeking treatment by more than four days than were those presenting with mild malaria (Meerman et al., 2005) . Furthermore, self-medication may encourage drug resistance, as has been observed with malaria (Evans et al., 2005) . Because poor or nonexistent welfare services can lead to increased poverty, malnutrition, homelessness, and starvation (Marmot, 2002) as well as reduced access to good education, such services have long been considered a ""fundamental"" determinant of health (Adler & Newman, 2002; Adler & Ostrove, 1999; Link & Phelan, 1995) . Education also may affect health by increasing knowledge of healthy behaviors and by increasing employment opportunities that provide income to meet basic health needs (Ross & Wu, 1995) . Individuals with better education live longer and suffer less morbidity than do their more poorly educated counterparts (Bobak, Hertzman, Skodova, & Marmot, 1999; Hemingway, Shipley, Macfarlane, & Marmot, 2000; Lynch, Kaplan, Salonen, Cohen, & Salonen, 1995) . Research by Winkleby and others (1992) revealed that even after controlling for the effects of income and occupation, education reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. Emergency services provide urgent care, which can lessen population morbidity and mortality. Security services such as fire fighting and policing help to deter crime and violence, which have serious implications for health. For example, the 1975 fiscal crisis in New York City led to a 20% reduction in the number of city police employees, which likely contributed to the homicide epidemic of the 1980s (Freudenberg, Fahs, Galea, & Greenberg, 2006 ).",37.25462195350288,14.69945557888096

For example, unequal distribution of education in communities in New York City has been shown to have salutary effects for all residents, suggesting benefits of actions of highly educated individuals (Galea & Ahern, 2005) .

Adequate nutrition requires either enough arable land for local food production or access to markets with imported food and income with which to purchase the food. Not only are the absolute quantities and costs of these resources in a community important, but the distribution of these resources also contributes to shaping health outcomes.

Even though globally many countries are grappling with common problems, such as increased health needs and demands for healthcare, alongside the rising costs of providing it, there is not one, simple international line of convergence towards a common form of health system. The reason is that health systems are shaped significantly by their centuries-old economic and political regimes. In addi-tion, they take their form from 'national logics', that is, how a society defines and deals with issues of health and illness. Equally, cultural factors influence how populations respond to proposed changes to their health system as well as how those external to a country relate to it. Even so, without undue risk of overgeneralisation, we can point towards a worldwide drive towards the commercialisation of health systems and, where public provision exists, such as in our case example of the UK, to the rollback of state or public provision in favour of the free market principles. Thus, most health systems around the world have or are moving towards a mix of public/private provision. With this point in mind, it has been argued that health services are now as much about investor potential as access to care for patients. Tritter and colleagues maintain that Health systems are no longer important primarily because they ensure that people gain access to health services when in need and irrespective of their ability to pay, that epidemics are prevented or controlled [...] or that the social determinants of health are addressed as part of public policies. In the emerging context of the reform policies, health systems are important not only as providers of products and services for which people are willing to pay, but also as an investment opportunity within global financial markets. (Tritter et al. 2010: 36) Although they manifest in different ways across health systems, we can point to a set of three shared global influences: neoliberalism (see also the discussions on neoliberalism in Chaps. 4 and 6) as the dominant politico-economic policy framework driving system change; macroeconomic policies and structural adjustment programmes (SAPs); and international trade agreements.",53.041761807206015,20.387528139413355

The Cooperative Medical Scheme collapsed in most rural areas, due largely to the weakening of collective economies emanating from de facto privatisation of agricultural production. 31 Less than 10% of the rural population was covered by insurance schemes from the late 1980s to 2000. This decline hit the most disadvantaged in the rural areas hardest. In urban areas, a new Urban Employee Basic Health Insurance Scheme has been developed to replace the Government Insurance Scheme and Labour Insurance Scheme, which led to a rapid escalation in health-care costs in the 1980s and early 1990s. Overall coverage of government-run schemes decreased from 44% to 39% over the period 1998 to 2003, while there was an increase from 11% to 16% in coverage by non-mainstream insurance, including commercial schemes. The proportion of the urban population without any form of health insurance was static at around 44% over these 5 years. 32 Coverage increased with age and was highest for men and high-income groups, and Xu and colleagues 32 concluded that inequities in the urban insurance system were increasing. In addition, between 1993 and 1998, the proportion of the population who had to pay out-of-pocket for health care increased from 28% to 44%. 33 In poor rural areas, the proportion having to pay out-of-pocket was estimated as being as high as 90%. 34 Data from the Chinese National Health Service survey in 1998 shows that 7% of the whole rural population was below the government-set poverty line, but when out-of-pocket medical spending was taken into account, the proportion living in poverty increased by 3 percentage points, which is an increase of over 44%. 35 Medical expenditure has clearly become an important cause of transient poverty, and, indeed, one of the major poverty generators in rural China. 26, 35 Recent studies of tuberculosis and poverty in China reveal that, although drugs to treat the disease are free in China, patients still had to pay for other related medicines and diagnostic tests during the course of their treatment. 36 Such a heavy fi nancial burden is one of the main reasons why many patients do not complete the appropriate treatment. 37 Use of and access to health-care services have declined, especially for the poor. 38 Outpatient service use declined for all income groups in urban and rural areas over the decade from 1993 to 2003, with the largest percentage declines in use in the lowest income group (fi gure 5). This decline was related to unaff ordable costs and poor-quality facilities and equipment. 38 Government fi nancing of health care over the past two decades or so has clearly been insuffi cient, as discussed by Hu and co-workers in this Series. 26 Investment in prevention and health protection before the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic was also seriously inadequate. Such problems of low health investment were coupled with rapid rise of medical costs and low effi ciency of service delivery, resulting in an underperforming health system. 39 Local governments in China are commonly asked to take many responsibilities for education, health and social services, but lack suffi cient fi nance to do so. Such unfunded mandates have brought about increased disparities in social services in the regions with diff erent economic development levels. Government recognises that it has to do more but the diffi culty of gaining a stronger appropriate role should not be underestimated.",38.142875281386516,15.861560530061055

Although health gains have continued, concern for the equitable distribution of social benefi ts of economic progress has grown. China's health inequalities are increasing, gains slowing, and public dissatisfaction mounting. The Chinese government increasingly recognises these challenges and is responding to them. Reform of health care has been ongoing for several years, 2 And earlier this year, after the 17th Chinese Communist Party Congress, the Ministry of Health announced major new policy directions for achieving Healthy China by 2020: 3 ""Health is the cornerstone of comprehensive human development…assurance of health equity is now regarded as the key parameter for the social justice and fairness in the country…Accessibility of basic medical and health care services is a basic right of the people.""",35.52502613164637,15.455520533662822

The combination of rapid economic growth and unprecedented rate of commercialisation has brought about notable market failures, none more spectacular than those in the health-care sector. Market failures occur when public goods, such as public health, are not produced suffi ciently and in proportion to need. These failures have been compounded by information asymmetry, in which health providers have much greater information than patients on prices and quality of treatments and drugs. Under such conditions, providers can use their knowledge to persuade patients to spend more on services that will not necessarily lead to the best health gains, as has been happening in China. 26 Providers, for example, have been prescribing tests, drugs, and procedures that will make them the most profi t-causing cost escalation, unnecessary or even dangerous practices, and poorer quality care. Furthermore, government fi nancing as a proportion of total health expenditure decreased from almost 40% in the early 1980s to 18% in 2005, while out-of-pocket payments rose from 20% to more than 50% in the same period. 27 Before the economic reform launched in 1978, over 90% of the rural population in China was covered by the Cooperative Medical Scheme, 28 while the Government Insurance Scheme and Labour Insurance Scheme provided almost free health care to the employees of the government agencies and public institutions in Chinese cities. 29 Both schemes also partly covered the cost of health care for dependants of employees. According to a national survey in nine provinces in 1986, less than 14% of the urban population was not covered by any health insurance or plan. 30 As a whole, the Chinese population was able to access basic health care at a low and aff ordable cost before the mid-1980s.",34.67722317878392,15.213830700083525

The publication of WHO's report 16 -Globalization and Access to Drugs, Implications of the WTO/TRIPs Agreement in 1997-by the action programme on essential drugs was ostensibly a defence of public-health principles over trade principles. Alongside the report was a proposed resolution to the World Health Assembly on a revised drugs strategy that called on member states to ""ensure that public health rather than commercial interests have primacy in pharmaceutical and health policies and to review their options under the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights to safeguard access to essential drugs."" 17 Both the report and resolution were strongly criticised by the pharmaceutical industry and US government, 18 instigating a further year of consultation and heated debate. These initial disputes prompted WHO to strengthen engagement with trade issues, and to show ""needed leadership"". 19 In 2000, a small programme on globalisation, trade, and health was established to strengthen knowledge, develop analytical methods, and produce training materials for supporting member states in addressing trade and health issues.

Rather than confronting diffi cult issues or advising ministries of health on how to protect health amid trade liberalisation, the study was cautiously worded and largely descriptive.

Instilling trust in communities needs access to health systems that provide a comprehensive breadth of essential health care. Communities do not compartmentalise their health issues into vertical pillars. If they cannot access quality maternal health or diabetes care, it erodes their faith in the same systems later pursuing them to manage Ebola and other infectious threats. Additionally, the health security threat of non-communicable diseases cannot be mitigated without provision of horizontally integrated primary care that can prevent, diagnose, and manage a wide range of illnesses. Unless all countries have eff ective universal health coverage, populations will also be inclined to travel across borders to seek care, increasing the potential for infection to spread and posing social and economic burdens and possible threats to law and order in other nations. Indeed, Ebola has been seeded and reseeded in the three countries most aff ected by the current epidemic as people moved across borders in search of social support and health care. 125 Second, universal health coverage can substantially improve human security by providing fi nancial security against impoverishing medical costs. In Thailand, for example, extension of health coverage to the entire population reduced annual impoverishment from medical costs from 2·71% of the population to 0·49% in 10 years. 126 Achievement of the fi nancial protection goal enshrined in universal health coverage can therefore be an eff ective strategy to reduce poverty and ensure human security.",35.150159365726445,14.81300338146838

Fear and uncertainty concerning the fi nancial consequences of ill health and inequitable access represent large welfare losses to populations. 127 Concern about falling fi nancial access to health services has sometimes resulted in political demonstrations and violent unrest. 128 In responding to these pressures, some governments have launched socialised health fi nancing reforms primarily to reduce political tensions and improve national security. This has been the case in China, where the architect of their recent health reforms suggested that his government's main motivation in achieving universal health coverage had been to bring about ""a more harmonious society"". 129 Therefore, as well as being a means to deliver improved health security, universal health coverage can also improve economic security for households, strengthen social solidarity systems resulting in improved national security, and has even been used to facilitate unpopular climate change policies. 130 Advancement of the goal of universal health coverage can therefore simultaneously address several key development priorities, in addition to strengthening global health security.

Children may require specialized supplies, medications, and treatment. They also require additional supervision and family support [27] . Additionally, pandemic planning for children and families is often addressed locally, with little coordination among the various levels of planning [28] . This continued neglect of pediatrics, both by policy makers and researchers in pandemic planning, is problematic, as difficulties associated with psychosocial concerns or ethical decision-making are magnified for HCP, children and families [29] .

First, priority setting is necessitated, and is an attempt to solve the fundamental economic problem of scarcity and choice. 45, 50 Frameworks for priority setting practice, and indeed their evaluation should therefore consider how best to achieve health system goals, given scarce resources. 45 This essentially entails making choices such that desired outputs are maximized within the available resources. The choice of economic tools for priority setting is, however, dependent on, among others, the level of priority setting activity. For example, while CEA is more feasible at the national level, it might not be practical at the regional or hospital level. Challenges would include the limited technical capacity and availability of data required for these analyses. 45 It is perhaps more feasible to use methods such as considering affordability alongside effectiveness and the budget impact of choices at lower levels of the health system (such as hospitals). Second, the goal of maximizing desired outcomes must be traded-off against equity. Priority setting exercises in healthcare organizations should aim at achieving an appropriate balance between maximizing intended outcomes for a given resource level while considering equity. 14, 45 To achieve equity, the distribution of resources should be determined by needs rather than other factors such as ability to pay, favouritism or political consideration. Further, resource allocation should demonstrate a special concern for the worse off. 14 The worse off can either be patient groups in a worse medical condition right now (eg, medical emergencies), or, alternatively, the ones whose complete life in terms of health will be worse if not treated now. The worse off should also include vulnerable patient groups. Vulnerability is often context dependent but could include groups such as the disabled, the elderly, children and women. Also, allocation should not be based on simple aggregating rules.",35.646782562169655,14.647237388056148

In 2003, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) revealed gaps in Ontario's emergency response capability, and highlighted the need to prepare for future epidemics. The effects of this outbreak resulted in a total of 251 probable cases and 43 deaths in Canada [1] . SARS heavily impacted the health care system in Ontario and in affected areas across the globe. Recent memories of this outbreak, coupled with the threat of pandemic H1N1 (2009) warn of the impacts of a major outbreak in Canada. Accordingly, planning has become a pressing issue for stakeholders in government, industry and community. While the exact timing, pattern and impact of a future pandemic is unknown [2, 3] , in Canada an influenza pandemic could result in as many as 10.6 million people (35%) who become clinically ill, 138,000 (0.5%) who require hospitalization, and up to 58,000 deaths (0.2%) [4] . Such concerns have become a high profile public health issue, and fears of a potential global pandemic continue to grow. Governments, policy makers, and health care providers (HCP), are planning for future pandemics, in part, based upon the lessons learned from SARS. Health Canada [5] has identified gaps in the response to SARS that should influence current policies and planning. For example, there is still a need to address ethical concerns during a pandemic, for instance, governments may be required to infringe upon civil liberties to ensure infection control, and policy makers need to establish frameworks for decisionmaking to allocate scarce health care resources [6] . A lack of coordination and communication, the poor management of resources, and the absence of a clear leadership structure within organizations and government also had a detrimental effect on the effort to control the SARS outbreak [6] [7] [8] .",35.909460335911824,14.646158198991944

Data were anonymised, coded and analysed centrally. Results A cumulative total of 399 calls were made to the critical care teams in the six hospitals. The most common reason for referral was to request a critical care review of a patient (n = 319, 79.9%). Other reasons for referral included cardiac arrest, request to transfer patients from other hospitals and requests for vascular access. The average duration spent by the critical care team reviewing patients on the wards was 57 minutes. This increased up to 67 minutes for cardiac arrest calls. Of the 319 critical care reviews, 160 (50.2%) patients were subsequently admitted to critical care. A total 118 of this 160 had EWS of 7 or above, while 42 scored less than 7 but were still deemed to require admission to critical care. Conclusion Regardless of the EWS, critical care teams are heavily involved in the management of patients outside critical care units. Fifty per cent of patients reviewed by the critical care team subsequently required admission to a critical care unit. The trigger threshold (7 and above) for referral to a critical care team currently recommended by the EWS escalation protocol is more likely to predict need for critical care admission. However, one in four patients referred below the threshold also required admission to a critical care environment. This study questions the safety of introducing such a protocol into acute hospitals. Will noncritical care staff be forced to wait until patients deteriorate further and reach the trigger threshold for referral or will the role of the critical care team expand further to look after all patients with abnormal EWS in hospital?",35.77648718803107,14.517725315462974

Social deprivation is a key predictor of distribution of diseases and life expectancy. The social causes also include poor sanitation, nutritional deficiencies, poor infrastructures (e.g., water supply), lack of safety at work, overcrowded or poorly maintained housing, environmental pollution, stress, and lack of exercise due to a sedentary lifestyle.

In the case of food systems, diversity in farm scale and number, diversity of crops, type of market opportunities, and higher numbers of farms equate to high numbers of species that respond differently to external pressures in ecosystems where diversity provides Binsurance^if one component of the system declines or is lost. To overcome such risks, species with similar traits may be functionally redundant; if a crop is lost because of high disturbance sensitivity (drought or disease, for example), other crops will still provide agricultural product (Mori et al. 2013) . Some techniques such as biointensive agriculture which emphasize high biological diversity are most easily adaptable to small acreage. A concern can be about yield loss under such production techniques. However, intensively managed biointensive farms can produce yields which are comparable and often greater than conventional methods, while enhancing ecosystem structure and functions such as biogeochemical cycles and pest population controls. The contemporary food system is built on a complex network of related activities, ranging from on-farm production to harvest and sale to distribution, processing, and marketing, ending with consumer access, purchase, consumption and resource, and waste recovery. Many related factors including environmental, social, and economic disruptions have the potential to contribute both chronic and acute disturbance to all points in this complex system. It is important to consider resilience at all points in the food system, minimizing vulnerability in each individual sector. Therefore, it is crucial to link the shift in food production systems with a shift in the food distribution mechanisms. Indeed, greater crop diversity offers opportunities for more diverse markets, and a locally embedded network of markets for food sale and access may provide greater resilience by insuring multiple points of entry for sale and access if the system is disrupted. As the two models below, North Carolina Central Piedmont Network and the South Carolina Food Hub demonstrate, decentralized models that link producers to consumers provide opportunities for farmers that utilize high-yield, low input techniques such as biointensive and other agroecological techniques a convenient and reasonable access to markets. Since the techniques can be developed both in urban and rural areas on smaller acreage farms, they can reduce the upfront capitalization costs for a start-up farm and also provide access to food related entrepreneurial opportunities and to food for low-income, ethnically and racially diverse consumers. This paper explores the link between diversity and resilience in our food networks-from production to distribution. We first illustrate risks from loss of biological diversity in food production systems and discuss how biointensive techniques can help overcome such risks. We then discuss two models of food value chains in the Carolinas and how a shift in food distribution mechanisms built on principles of biological diversity can help build food security and community resilience. We also discuss the challenges of establishing such models on the ground and thus offer guidelines for practitioners on how to establish decentralized/local/ networked food production, distribution, and access systems.",39.56834947039653,14.816282462472609

As with staffing, some hospitals face shortages of critical care spaces, 46,71-73 although occupancy varies across the United States.

However, this expansion is still limited by the issues of stuff and staff discussed earlier. Therefore, even though the bed spaces may be available to use for critical care, if the hospital rents its ventilators and has no more on site, the ability to expand critical care remains limited unless specific advanced planning and preparation are undertaken.

Its effect will thus show up as a change in the composition of the economy rather than as a net addition to activity. An outcome of the CEP research, together with contributions by other critics of I-O modelling (e.g. the Nottingham group associated with Thea Sinclair and Adam Blake), was a greater awareness among tourism researchers that, for any given expenditure shock to a destination, the change in economic variables will vary according to features of the economy such as: the particular industries that are the recipients of the direct expenditure; strengths of the business linkages between the different industry sectors in the economy; the assumed factor constraints (supplies of land, labour, capital); the import content of consumer goods and inputs to production; the production and consumption relationships assumed; changes in the prices of inputs and outputs; changes in the exchange rate; the workings of the labour market; and the government fiscal policy stance.

Environment is a broad context and includes not just the physical environment of livelihood, environmental pollution e.g. (including indoor pollution such as radon) and water quality, but also the socioeconomic environment, including relative deprivation, healthcare quality and access, land mines, and the political economic context. For example, unlike Canada, where universal access to care based on need is provided for all citizens, in the United States, access to care depends on ability to pay. Thus, immunization is more easily available in Canada than in the US and this influences the infant mortality rate and life expectancy in the two countries. Genetic predisposition is important particularly for degenerative diseases. People with light skin pigmentation are more prone to skin cancer than others with a darker pigmentation. Similarly, recent research suggests that Ashkenazi Jewish women have a higher risk of breast cancer compared to other women. The human genome project is not only identifying genes responsible for several serious diseases such as Parkinson but also developing exciting new and effective therapies for them. Human behavior is the final component in the disease ecology model. Put simply, behavior facilitates or inhibits disease. Unhealthy behavior traits such as excessive alcohol consumption, overeating and failure to exercise, unsafe sexual practices and smoking are associated with various diseases. In contrast, regular exercise and other positive health behaviors, including proper diet, enhance health and prevent disease. Thus, spatial variations in Africa's environment, including widespread poverty that promotes extra-marital and transactional sex, poor healthcare environment with limited access to antiretrovirals, cultural practices such as circumcision, widow inheritance, and preference for unsafe sexual practices, combine with other factors to make HIV/AIDS rates the highest in the world. Similarly, variations exist between and within countries.

However, little research has examined the driving force behind this systemdthe Chinese government. China has endeavored to establish a socialist market economy over the past three decades, and the Chinese government, with a uniquely centralized party-state dualism, a largely internally driven policy making model, and a highly centralized bureaucracy, is still believed to exercise firm control over the trajectory of the majority of social and economic phenomena in the country (Chao & Dickson, 2001; Zhang et al., 2005) . The golden week holiday are no exception. The Chinese government's move to commute days from adjacent weekends and form week-long holidays is an example of the considerable executive leverage it has. This type of executive power has only been seen sporadically in countries such as France, Brazil, and Japan several decades ago (Samuel, 1993) . In addition, policy making in the golden week holiday has been unique because of the relative instability of the policy subsystem of the golden week holiday, with dynamic shifts in the structure and interactions of the components both outside and within the Chinese bureaucracy. Actually, as the paper is being written, hot debates are being conducted over further policy changes to the golden week holiday system.

In 2003, World Trade Organisation (WTO) members agreed that developing countries with insuffi cient manufacturing capacity in the pharmaceutical sector could make eff ective use of the compulsory licensing provisions contained in the TRIPs agreement, which was amended in 2005. These changes are designed to make it easier for poor countries to import cheaper generic medicines if they are unable to manufacture them. Developed countries have an obligation to help poor countries make the most of these fl exibilities with the aid for trade approach. 23 The General Agreement on Trade in Services is the fi rst multilateral trade agreement to cover trade and investment in services. It constitutes the legal framework through which WTO members progres-sively liberalise trade in services, including, where members wish, health-related services.

Unfortunately the nature of this change is not clearly documented and still being studied. Some states are more attractive to elderly. However, limited research exists on association between an extensive set of location-specific factors and the migration of retirement-age individuals. For instance, Duncombe et al. (2003) estimated an individual-level location-choice model by using a combination of place-characteristics data and Census county-to-county migration data, identifying income taxes to have the largest relative effects. However, other factors, including climate, economic conditions, and population characteristics, appear to play much larger roles in migration and location decisions. Such findings may provide clues to understanding geographic distribution and the change in the level of health care demands, particularly in the context of aging America. Understanding of the temporal pattern of the geographic distribution of the population, including the urban elderly, will provide insight into the future trends and facilitate strategic planning of needed services.

Indeed, the underlying reasons for food insecurity are frequently rooted in a myriad of political, economic and social constraints that preclude food attainment by vulnerable populations (Sunderland, 2011) . In war-torn regions of Central Africa, for example, the degradation of roads and trading routes has impeded the transportation of bulky agricultural commodities to markets (Redmond et al., 2006) . In cases where functioning markets do exist, rural dwellers may be far removed from these, often having limited transportation to permit access. The reality further remains that many poor people simply do not have the financial resources to purchase pricey domestic meat products, let alone the more expensive imported protein sources . Low cost, energy-rich staple crops have consequently become a central focus of policy makers in the quest for global food security. Often overlooked, however, is that food composition is as crucial to food security and nutrition as availability and access (Sunderland, 2011) .

Urban dwellers consuming bushmeat as a luxury item are unlikely to suffer nutritional hardship as a result of this forfeiture, since they can generally switch to other readily-available protein sources (Bennett, 2002) . The tragedy, however, is that the direct costs of biodiversity loss are expected to fall heavily and disproportionately on millions of rural people across the developing world, who have very few affordable alternatives at their disposal (Milner-Gulland & Bennett, 2003) . Despite the widespread reliance on bushmeat, surprisingly little research has been conducted to quantify the impacts of wildlife depletions on human health and livelihoods. Nevertheless, two seminal studies (Fa et al., 2003; Golden et al., 2011) have indicated that the loss of access to wildlifewhether due to strict enforcement of existing conservation policies or due to unbridled unsustainable harvestswill have direct and catastrophic effects on food security, nutrition and well-being, most markedly through waning supplies of crucial protein and micronutrients.

Many policy analysts questioned the opportunity costs of paying for the high cost of emergency care. Several researchers, however, reported that the marginal costs of ED care, especially for nonurgent problems, were actually much less than widely believed. Williams [9] provided evidence that the majority of ED costs were fixed because of the necessity of standby capacity for unexpected trauma and acute medical emergencies, and that the excess charges primarily reflected cost shifting to pay for the uninsured. Tyrance and colleagues [10] found that ''ED use accounts for a small fraction of medical spending'' and suggested that ''Attempts to restrict ED use would disproportionately burden minorities and the poor who receive much of their out patient care in EDs.'' They also recommended that ''Strategies that reduce demand for ED services should be pursued to improve health, not because of anticipated cost savings.'' Nonetheless, many health policy experts and politicians considered ''inappropriate ED use'' to be an important cause of high medical costs. This led to attempts by managed care organizations to constrain patient access to emergency services. One opinion of primary care specialists is summarized by Dowling [11] from the Department of Family Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles. He referred to ED care as ''fragmented, uncoordinated, incomplete, and inappropriate'' and said the real cost of an ED visit was its ''missed opportunity for prevention.'' These criticisms may have had more validity if, at the same time, there hadn't been a lack of access to primary care for a large portion of Americans based on inadequate or lack of health insurance [12] [13] [14] [15] .",34.97906777513104,13.809404646736652

After strong public outcry the government withdrew the proposed act and this issue remains open. Moreover, even when migrants fulfil their financial contribution, the number of refugees with an assigned GP is limited due to language barriers and the reluctance of many GPs to take on patients whose residence is likely to be temporary [27, p. 6] .

This aim can only be achieved if incoming refugees feel welcome and not the subject of stigmatisation or persecution. 7 Experience from around the world shows that many refugee groups-eg, Myanmar's Rohingya minority-have long been deprived of essential health care in their home countries, and arrive in host countries in extremely poor health. These poor baseline health conditions might be exacerbated by provision of inadequate health services at refugee reception or processing centres, which can thus become a risk to the collective health of host populations. For example, conditions in Australia's Nauru and Manus Island detention centres for off shore processing have resulted in outbreaks of infectious diseases. 21 By contrast, the strong system of vaccination surveillance in Germany identifi ed low measles immunisation in incoming refugees to Lower Saxony; measures are being taken to vaccinate arriving groups, illustrating how evidence can be used to reduce health inequalities in refugees and host communities. The European Vaccine Action Plan 2015-2020 22 details the importance of equitable access to vaccination and to encourage access for refugees and migrants with culturally appropriate services. 7 High-income countries have all the experience, knowledge, and resources to fi nd cost-eff ective solutions to health challenges that might arise from incoming refugees, as well as the institutional strength and innovative capacity to integrate and harness the potential socio economic benefi ts of these incoming groups. Innovative solutions to strengthen the control of infectious diseases in refugee populations could include mobile diagnostic and surveillance units similar to the Find and Treat service for tuberculosis for homeless and disadvantaged people in London. 23 These solutions could also include an integrated support function for psychosocial care and new public-private partnerships for health surveillance, delivery of messages about health promotion and phone-based incentives, and signposting of essential health services. Lessons could be learnt from the large US refugee resettlement programme 17, 24 and their electronic disease notifi cation system used since 2006, which has improved the timeliness and accuracy of infectious disease notifi cations. However, further studies should include economic analyses that account for longterm outcomes for conditions, such as latent tubterculosis infections, detected in incoming refugees. Sweden, where more than 100 000 refugees were taken in during 2015, is trialing creative approaches to integrate refugee communities, improve health literacy, and ensure adequate access to health services. Sweden has introduced many fast-track schemes to integrate refugees (particularly from Syria), who are already medically trained, into the labour market, thus addressing many diffi culties associated with staff shortages, language barriers, and cultural sensitivity. 25 However, for interventions to be eff ective, improved coordination and cooperation is needed by European countries. Additionally, there is a need for a more integrated and well managed role for humanitarian nongovernmental organisations to provide services for refugees in the absence of adequate provision by government and local authority agencies. In 2015, an important step was taken in this direction with the publication of a joint statement-by European countries, the European Commission, and WHO-addressing the health needs of incoming refugees to Europe 26 and the development of a patient health record that will be piloted at borders to evaluate refugees' medical needs and to reconstruct their medical history. 27 A joint technical statement by UNHCR, WHO, and UNICEF on vaccination for refugees entering Europe provides further support to harmonise and develop consistent standards in the continent. These eff orts are important and build on the continuing work of WHO's Europe Public Health Aspects of Migration in Europe project, 28 which has developed both evidence-based guidance and a series of tools to assist countries to assess and address the health needs of migrant and refugee populations. Unfortunately, the eff ectiveness of these initiatives continues to be limited by the insuffi cient fi nancial and political commitment to improve cross-border coordination for the health needs of refugees.",36.59370264311389,16.703520865389848

Surely governments have the ultimate responsibility to attend to the needs of their people and not themselves. Rarely observed, governments need genuine food, nutrition and agricultural experts as an integral part of the decision-making hierarchy. Such experts must have a proper understanding of the pre-conflict or pre-disaster food, fresh-water, and energy supplies and their distribution systems, and how they can be safeguarded, modified and employed to proper effect, and how alternative mechanisms can be deployed. Sadly, this aspect seems to be neglected at the present time in the chaotic condition of certain countries in the Middle East. Much can be learned from countries in Europe during the wars that raged in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Simply standing by and watching the population adapt slowly to acquiring barely adequate water and food supplies inflicts untold misery on innocent people. All governments should have readily accessible emergency supplies (reserve stocks) and transport systems, and be willing to introduce rationing if need be. Special protection measures are needed for water supplies and farms to make sure production can continue no matter the degree of impairment. In more settled times, each government should establish a group of experts to construct interactive databases as the foundation of an agriinformatics and metrics organisation. This would collate information on supply and demand changes, supply-chain details, imports, crop and livestock genetics, commodity production levels, labour-force composition, pricing, inputs, availability of decision-support systems, advisors and research bodies, grant funding, biotic and abiotic stress factors, natural resource constraints, predictive modelling of shocks to the agricultural system and disruptive events, etc. Other research organisations would interact with this organisation to ensure best practice and enhance agricultural resilience, demonstrate efficient use of inputs, exploit wastes, optimise the use of mechanisation, and foster skills.

The tendency is towards a growing imbalance between the demand and offer of intensive care worldwide -this making it necessary to ponder questions such as the prioritization of care, and to place greater emphasis on prevention and the early detection of potentially serious disease processes. The authors in turn underscore the ease with which natural disasters, epidemics and human conflicts can quickly overwhelm the capacity of the healthcare infrastructures and give rise to sanitary crises or even humanitarian catastrophes. Another universal deficiency refers to the training of intensivists, making it necessary to consider alternatives such as telemedicine, and explaining the emigration of professionals -these being circumstances that simply add to the existing regional imbalances.",39.66020274140595,16.107079327030537

WHO emphasises that results of infection screening should not be a reason to deport a refugee. 7 Refugees have suff ered long and arduous stressful journeys, enduring cramped and unhygienic environments, which take a toll on their mental and physical health and existing NCDs. Many European countries, including the UK, request medical screening in the host country and then complete further screening of refugees on arrival, including targeted tuberculosis screening for those in the UK. 15 The USA has an established programme of mandatory screening of refugees both before departure and after arrival to establish immunisation status and the presence of parastic infections or other communicable diseases. 16, 17 A review 18 of the screening stratetgy after arrival of Iraqi refugees in the USA completed between 2008 and 2009 identifi ed a 14·1% prevalence of latent tuberculosis infection. Additionally, the review 18 noted that despite the traditional focus of refugee medical screening, morbidity due to NCDs was of higher prevelance. This observation is mirrored in other refugee populations from the Middle East, particularly in those of Syrian origin, in whom NCDs are more prevalent than infectious diseases. WHO does not recommend compulsory mass screening of refugee or migrant populations, although it does recommend health checks for both infectious diseases and NCDs and access to health services while maintaining the dignity of refugees and migrants. 19 No evidence shows that mass compulsory checks have a benefi t or are cost-eff ective. Furthermore, these checks have a possible risk of causing anxiety to individuals and deterring refugees and migrants from seeking health care if needed. 7 Screening programmes should be rationalised and prioritised for incoming refugees from settings with a large disease burden, for conditions which can be shown to have eff ective treatments, 20 rather than attempt to cover all arrivals particularly where local services are overwhelmed by volume.

Nolan describes a system as ""a collection of interdependent elements that interact to achieve a common purpose."" 8 If one applies this definition to the clinical care environment, examples of interdependent elements that one might consider include such factors as the institution's culture (especially with respect to safety), the skill mix and competence of the staff, the availability of state-of-the-art equipment, and the quality of information systems, to name but a few. The health-care literature is rife with examples of system failures resulting in harm to patients; for example, significant medication errors (e.g., the death of the Boston Globe reporter, Betsy Lehman, who died of a massive chemotherapy overdose and the tragic loss of young Josie King), 9e12 wrong site surgeries that often top the Joint Commission's list of reported sentinel events, 13 and the relative epidemic of health care-associated infections. 6,14e16 Whereas any one of these events could be considered an error resulting from an individual provider's negligence, systems thinking compels us to consider these adverse events as failures in a series of interrelated and/or codependent processes or systems. In truth, in the current complex health-care environment such events almost invariably involve a series of missed opportunities to correct the errordhence they truly represent system failures. 14 This shift in focusdfrom the individual to the systemd forces organizations to broaden their analyses of incidents and, thereby, broaden the impact of any improvements. Because of the endemic nature of errors and system failures in clinical care, investigators and review bodies must collaborate with the health-care practitioners with whom they entrust their participants' safety to assure that the system/environment in which clinical research is conducted is safe and has the necessary infrastructure in place to support the study. Further, the research team must have strategies in place to monitor the clinical research environment to identify risks and clinical events that could contribute to adverse events and/or protocol deviations and to assure that processes are in place to prevent, mitigate, and manage risks.",33.84473357103589,13.40729955460442

FMEAs, or other risk assessments, identify process points that are associated with increased risk to the patient/participant, to involved providers, and/or to the scientific integrity of the study. As illustrated in the example above, these risks can be addressed by myriad clinical and organizational interventions that are aimed at reducing those risks. The next step in mitigating risk is the deployment of strategies to assess the effectiveness of interventions, and to survey the research and care environments continually for other risks to the participants and to the study. Measurement is fundamental to assessment efforts and improvement in the quality of care. The history of health-care quality improvement and measurement dates to Florence Nightingale's collection of mortality data and infection rates during the Crimean War, as well as to the work of Ernest Codman in establishing standards for hospitals in the early 1900s, including his provocative ""end results hypothesis"" that led to a Semmelweis-like estrangement from the health-care establishment (see Chapter 1). 32, 33 In a classic paper in 1968 Avedis Donabedian recommended measuring health-care quality in three areas: structure (the characteristics of a health-care setting); process (what is done in the health-care setting); and outcomes (the status of the patient resulting from specific interventions). 34 This paradigm remains the mainstay of modern health-care performance measurement programs and is the basis for the local, state, and federal programs designed to measure the quality of clinical care and identify health care-associated risks and adverse events. Clinical research programs, too, should implement processes to assess the performance of the clinical research enterprise systematicallydprimarily to assess for risks to the participants, investigators, and care providers, as well as for threats to the integrity of the study. Collecting and reporting adverse events that occur during the course of a research study is a mandatory component of both the research process and the protection of human subjects. However, event reporting in clinical research focuses on individual protocols, not on how the system of clinical research is performing as a whole. This ""protocolcentric"" focus fails to identify clinical care and clinical research system failures that potentially might impact participant safety across multiple studies. Murff and his colleagues 35, 36 have described the need for research teams to develop reporting systems that collect data about reportable adverse events, as well as ""near misses"" or ""latent failures"" in the clinical care and clinical research environments. Near misses or latent failures are errors that do not result in patient/participant harm; however, these events do have the potential to do harm if the circumstances of the event were somewhat different. Identifying and analyzing near misses or system failures provide the care and research teams the luxury of designing and implementing interventions to interrupt the error cycle prior to the occurrence of a serious error. Surveillance for errors, adverse events, and latent errors in the clinical care or research setting can be accomplished using a variety of strategies including 1 event reporting systems 2 ; electronic surveillance systems that utilize clinical triggers to identify errors; and 3 analysis of clinical performance measurement data.",32.729240565548,13.263199190464992

These experts include the World Health Organization, which cites the emergence of the H5N1 virus as a clear warning that we need to enhance preparedness for an influenza pandemic. 1 In light of these warnings, federal, provincial, territorial and local governments across Canada have been engaged in pandemic preparedness activities -activities that have also been driven by the country's recent experience with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreaks in 2003. Canada was one of the first jurisdictions to release a modern, comprehensive strategy to deal with an influenza pandemic. The A key priority of pandemic preparedness at both the federal and provincial levels is planning for the surge capacity that will be required across the health care system to assess and treat individuals who are ill with influenza. In Ontario, it is estimated that approximately 2.3 million people will be ill enough with influenza to require an outpatient visit during an influenza pandemic 2 (these numbers are replicable for all provinces and territories). Guidelines on strategies to curtail or eliminate non-critical services across the health care system and for a competency-based approach to health human resources planning have been developed in Ontario to mitigate this surge in demand; however, these strategies alone will be insufficient. The anticipated surge would still overwhelm current resources and the ability of the health care system to maintain life-saving services would be severely compromised. 3 As a result, the 2006 version of the OHPIP includes a strategy for a community-based approach to influenza assessment and treatment as a means to further mitigate the impacts of the predicted surge and to help ensure that critical health services continue during an influenza pandemic.

The costs of health-related goods and services directly affect health by reducing the demand for necessary health care or by increasing consumption of unnecessary care. Leaving people vulnerable to economic barriers therefore would fail to reduce deprivations in health. Additionally, the uncertainty of health need, the catastrophic costs of medical care, and the risk-averse nature of individuals places risk pooling (eg, through insurance) at the centre of health-care financing. 20 An expensive medical event can prevent access to health care or be a primary cause of financial ruin. From a capability point of view, ""protective security"", 14 through health insurance, is a necessary safety net. And the economic burden of health care should be justly shared by all through the redistribution of funds from the well to the ill and the rich to the poor, using progressive financing and community rating. 21 Sixth, one of the most difficult tasks in applying an ethical framework that values health intrinsically is the conceptualisation and measurement of health and inequalities in its many domains. There are many approaches to measuring health equity. As Sudhir Anand and colleagues have shown, 22 the choice depends on numerous considerations, ranging from health domains to the weights attached to those domains. 22 Another consideration is the choice of groups for stratification. 22 Even within the capability perspective, one would need to determine what set of inequality measures would be most appropriate for a given exercise, although certain types of inequality assessment-for example, a goal of complete ""health equality"" (levelling down to lowest common denominator)-have less appeal than others. And certain health equity evaluations-for example, deciding how much priority to give the ""worst-off""-will undoubtedly require public reasoning about values imbedded in the health equity concept. Although the capability view of health does not come down on an exact formula for judging inequalities in health, Sen has noted the potential use of ""partial ordering"" (eg, ordering some alternatives as opposed to ordering them all) of health states for assessing relative inequalities. In a collective exercise, incomplete theorisation may facilitate evaluation in health policy. 15, 16, 23 ",45.36899178880058,17.39197151839893

Consequently, the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (MOHLTC) applied a network approach to foster collaboration across the community health care system to encourage an integrated approach to the delivery of community health services during a pandemic. The decision to use the network approach was based on evidence that suggests that allowing for a network of relations in emergency management can significantly improve the emergency management effort. A study of 164 emergency preparedness and response organizations by the University of Colorado (1993) found that: (i) the more contacts and the more cohesion, the greater the emergency preparedness; and (ii) the higher the hierarchical autonomy, the lower the preparedness. 4 The network tasked with developing the strategy for Ontario was struck by the MOHLTC and comprised a collection of provincial associations from the community health sector, including community health centres, public health, family physicians, long-term care, home and community care and not-for-profit emergency management organizations. Through a series of collaborative workshops, the network developed the overall strategy to divert all but the most severely ill from hospitals and to sustain individuals in their current environment. As well, the network identified which services and resources each of their members could potentially contribute to the overall strategy. As a result of this process, the network proposed that individuals who may be stricken with influenza-like illness during a pandemic be assessed and treated remotely and also through the implementation of alternate assessment, treatment and referral centres (Flu Centres).

The estimated cost of decontaminating parts of the Hart Senate building in Washington, DC, was $23 million, the economic impact involving potential exposure to anthrax was estimated at $26.2 billion/100 000 persons exposed (indirect/economic target), and the cost and resources needed to decontaminate the environment should be added to this. Health damage could be both somatic and psychological. Therefore, biological attacks cause two types of epidemics: epidemic of infectious disease and epidemic/ pandemic of fear and panic. Epidemic/pandemic of fear and panic multiplies economic damage (losses in tourism, investment, and export). Today, the main objective of bioterrorists is to propagate fear, anxiety, uncertainty, and depression within the population, induce mistrust of authorities/government, inflict economic damage, and disrupt travel and commerce. The cause of physical disease is the second important objective.

Global and national-level policies have highly influenced access to health care and education in many developing nations. Following independence, many newly emerging nations began to accumulate a large amount of debt and experienced a growing financial imbalance. Loans were sought from the WB and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Large loans were given with the stipulation that the country would restructure its economy by improving the management of payments, increase economic efficiency, and encourage private sector investments: Structured Adjustment Programs (SAP). The emphasis was on economic development, not social services. Education and health services were viewed as nonproductive, and to ''save the country's economy'' many service programs were sold to private firms where unfortunately, profits took priority over services. Governmental social safety nets were lost as user fees for health care and education were another stipulation for WB and IMF loans. Local governments received an immediate cash flow and shed the responsibilities and expense of providing services to the citizens. Local officials were happy but the people suffered. Relegating social services to the private sector meant limiting access to health care and education. User fees for these services, including the purchase of clean water, deepened the level of poverty and of health as the poor could not afford even modest fees and did without. Some SAPs demanded an increase in exports of goods and food, which limited domestic consumption. To their credit, members of the WB saw the deterioration of health care and educational opportunities, and recently have tried to reverse these trends. But it is too little too late, certainly too late to meet the MDGs.

The UI population is often of lower socioeconomic status, which adds to the difficulties accessing health care. Given that most of the federal insurance plans are unavailable to the UI population, UIs are susceptible to higher out-of-pocket costs for care. In addition, because of undocumented status, they may not have sick leave days and may have difficulty negotiating time off from work to seek care. 8 Decreased proficiency in the language of the host country and fear of deportation may also present barriers to health care for UIs. Studies have shown that patients with limited English language proficiency (LEP) are at higher risk of poor health and have decreased access to health care. Patients who have LEP had increased difficulty in understanding their health status as well as accessing preventive services. 9 Fear of deportation may lead to the avoidance of seeking care and risk of severe health complications, 8 and this also affects health care for US-born children of UIs. In addition, shame and discrimination are common feelings experienced by the UI population and contribute to poor access to health care globally. 8 Many of these issues in health care are not unique to the United States. In a study by Chauvin and colleagues, 10 22% of the UI population in Europe had access to health coverage, and, of those, only about 36% had true access because of barriers such as administrative difficulties, limited language proficiency, and lack of awareness of available services. Of the main reasons for lack of access, administrative difficulties in obtaining health care and finances were cited as the most common. France and Belgium were found to have the most complicated systems for obtaining health care and, for those who had access, the fear of deportation or imprisonment was prevalent.",41.63357365302974,16.539677793388137

Matthews and colleagues [41] analyzed Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from 30 developing countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America to determine indicators of maternal health care among the urban poor, as compared with the rural population. Their purpose was to see if there was an ''urban advantage'' or ''urban penalty'' for women. The investigators recognized a gap between different urban populations and speculated that the urban poor in many countries were at a disadvantage from their previous rural neighbors who did not migrate to the city. They found massive inequality in both urban and rural areas but greater inequality between slum urbanites or nonslum urbanites. The inequalities arose from exclusion; the urban poor did not have access to health care services and in some cities the slum dwellers were treated as if they did not even exist. However, there was a vast difference in the service gap among different countries. In some, the exclusion was not limited to the poor; services were insufficient for all strata of wealth. In others, it was primarily the poor who were excluded. And in some countries the urban population was well served without wealth or class distinction; a goal to strive for! Even when governmental programs to provide public clinics are established in a country, few of these are constructed in slum areas because of their tenuous nature [42] . Health care access is minimal at best in urban slums and is often predominated by private for-profit clinics [43] . Government investment in health care infrastructure in slums is limited. A study in Nairobi slums indicated that of 503 clinics serving what is reportedly the largest slum community in all of sub-Saharan Africa, only 6 (1%) were public and 79 (16%) were private not-forprofit clinics. Nearly all of the private for-profit clinics 418 (83%) in Nairobi slums are of dubious quality [44, 45] . The more qualified practices are expensive, forcing the use of cheaper private facilities that are often not licensed and operate out of small shacks and maternity homes without complying with any standards of care.

New York City has the nation's largest public health system, composed of the Health and Hospitals Corporation (HHC) and Community Health Care Association of New York State, whose members include FQHCs and migrant health programs. These organizations provide much of the health care for uninsured and undocumented patients. Both systems rely on Medicaid (and, to a lesser extent, Medicare) reimbursements. They also depend on federal Disproportionate Share Hospital funding and other sources of state Indigent Care Pool funding. In addition to primary and preventive health care, HHC ambulatory centers offer uninsured patients access to on-site pharmacies and referrals to medical specialists and diagnostic and other services located in HHC medical centers. 47 California offers a Medi-Cal health insurance plan that provides a full range of lowcost health care options for uninsured Californians, with some benefits provided regardless of immigration status. In addition, Kaiser Permanente offers a Child Health Program for uninsured California children younger than 19 years who do not have access to Medi-Cal or other coverage, regardless of immigration status. My Health LA (MHLA) is a no-cost health care program that offers comprehensive health care for low-income, uninsured Los Angeles county residents, regardless of immigration status or medical condition. It offers care through 164 community clinic medical home sites, where patients receive primary and preventive health care services and some diagnostic services. Los Angeles County Department of Health Services facilities also provide county clinic medical home sites, plus emergency, diagnostic, specialty, inpatient services, and pharmacy services. Healthy San Francisco (HSF) is a lowincome program for San Francisco County residents regardless of employment status, immigration status, or medical condition. Unlike MHLA, HSF charges a participation fee and point-of-service fee to all patients except for those at less than 100% of the federal poverty level and those who are homeless. 47 The Harris County Health System, which includes the city of Houston, Texas, offers Access Care, a financial assistance program open to uninsured and undocumented Harris County residents, and provides access to discounted health care at more than 20 community clinics, a dental clinic, and surgical and other subspecialty clinics. The Harris Health System has a dialysis clinic as well as a long-term care facility. 47 In Massachusetts, all immigrants are eligible for some form of health coverage. There is 1 application for all available programs, including the insurance marketplace. Mass Health Limited is the state version of emergency Medicaid. It is available to UIs and some immigrants who are PRUCOL (Permanent Residence Under Color of Law), defined as aliens who are living in the United States with the knowledge and permission of the federal government, and whose departure the agency does not contemplate enforcing. 47 In Nevada, the nonprofit Access to Healthcare Network (AHN) offers medical discount programs, specialty care coordination, a health insurance program, nonemergency medical transportation services, a pediatric hematology/oncology practice, and a toll-free statewide call center.

Individuals residing in slums rank low on the social gradient and political agendas. The lower the socioeconomic position a person occupies, the worse the health and the lower the life expectancy. Some of the specific social determinates that affect health include the wealth index of the household, the employment of the head of the household, the presence of the mother to care for the children, the level of social support, the degree of crowding within the home, the educational attainment of the mother, food security, access to clean potable water, sufficient sanitary facilities, and available close-by quality health services and schools. Slum dwellers score low on these determinates. These social determinates of health are largely responsible for the great differences in the types of morbidities, the severity of illnesses, and the level of access to treatment for them. Although country-level disparities are readily apparent, many statistics internal to a nation merely dichotomize by urban versus rural. This hides the slum outcomes in the urban figures, thereby worsening the urban figures and making rural dwellers a bit better off than all those who live in the city. Yet in reality, rural dwellers fair better than those who live in slums, but far worse than those urbanites that do not live in slums [81] . Household-level factors, combined with an overarching lack of recognition from local and national governments, manifested through lack of land rights, exclusion from census, and lack of investment in schools and health care centers delivers the message of ''no worth''; the ultimate in exclusion.

Those in opposition maintain that using taxpayer-funded services to support individuals who enter and remain in the United States illegally undermines the legal system. However, some scholars and legislators have argued that it is both unethical and impractical to deny access to health care services for illegal immigrants living in the United States. 16 They view health care as a basic human right and an obligation of a just society to provide health care for everyone. Leading medical professional societies such as the American Medical Association (AMA), American College of Physicians (ACP), the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), and the American Nurses Association (ANA) reaffirm the position that all individuals living in the United States, regardless of their immigration status, should have access to quality health care, including the opportunity to purchase insurance. These leaders maintain that providing this population with access to health insurance is an evidence-based way to reduce health care costs. [17] [18] [19] Another argument, from a cost perspective, is that many UIs will benefit from preventive care and early treatment of chronic diseases before they advance to lifethreatening and costly complications. 20, 21 Proponents of this strategy advocate for improving health literacy and vaccination rates, and offering health screenings to the UI population to try to prevent long-term adverse health outcomes and control cost. Moreover, UIs may harbor infections such as tuberculosis (TB), which, when undetected, can easily be transmitted to the general public, thus posing a public health risk. 22 In contrast, some have argued that treating UIs creates more expenditures for the United States while saving their countries of origin the costs of providing health care. 23 Furthermore, they argue that sharing inadequate health care resources with UIs will reduce the availability of those scarce resources for US citizens. In the last 2 decades, several states have attempted to advance legislation designed to deny UIs access to publicly funded health services. One such initiative was California's Proposition 187. This law, later deemed unconstitutional, required health care professionals to verify immigration status and report UIs to authorities. 24 In addition, some believe that continued unabated treatment of UIs is an incentive for persistent violation of the immigration laws and threatens national security in the post-9/11 era. 25 Proponents of this argument suggest that denying health care to UIs will discourage others from attempting to immigrate without proper documentation. 24 ",40.938323541345206,14.987271917960745

The International Health Regulations put in place a framework under which the world can work together to better ensure collective security and develop and strengthen core capacity in public health through development assistance and national funding; treaties such as the conventions on tobacco control and biological and chemical weapons are in place that protect individual health security and provide sustainable models for the future. Donations and global funds that increase access to vaccines, medicines, and health services might be less sustainable as conceived, and longerterm solutions must be sought that include affordable goods and a will of countries to budget for and sustain their own procurement and health systems. This aim needs national skills and economic development; and technology transfer, price negotiation, intellectual property considerations, and continued innovation and ingenuity at the global level. There is a long way to go to ensure both individual and collective health security.",36.14557277323526,13.575547081297662

COVID ventilation practices focus on limiting lung damage and minimising staff risk, and withdrawal of ventilation at end of life also has to minimise any risk to staff of aerosol exposure. Extubation, practiced at end of life in many countries but less commonly in the UK, is an aerosol generating procedure and may have to be reconsidered above turning off ventilators. Nurses and teams have to provide care in extreme situations, and may even be providing care in critical care which is outside their area of usual practice. Offering clear, accurate and consistent communication to patient and families at end of life in critical care in this situation is challenging, with senior critical care nurses bearing much of the brunt of managing these scenarios. Having access to equipment to provide supportive end of life care, such as syringe drivers outlined above, is also increasingly difficult as demand for supplies increases day on day while we approach the height of the pandemic. Creative care planning can help mitigate some of these challenges, and staggering end of life care and withdrawal across units to ensure nurses can be fully present with patients as they are dying. Initiatives such as critical care gardens (Alexander & Tantam, 2020) are being expedited to ensure patients have humanising experiences in the midst of an unfolding disaster, and that end-of-life care provided is as good as it possibly can be. Ensuring a critical care nursing presence, an interpersonal process characterised by sensitivity, intimacy, vulnerability alongside empathy and holistic care, is key to this (Finfgeld-Connett, 2008) . Critical care nurses are swiftly finding alternative ways to communicate with families, such as videoconferencing, as most families will not be present, given pandemic visiting restrictions in place across critical care units worldwide.

The flow of people to cities can be arrested if urban attractions are not driving forces. This means improving the services available in rural areas by subsidizing farming, increasing employment opportunities, and upgrading and increasing educational offerings. There should also be improvement in rural health care facilities with professional and support staff, and well stocked with basic medications, and with ready access to diagnostic medical equipment. This solution is easily prescribed but difficult to bring to fruition mainly for economic reasons but also by the reluctance of some trained personnel to move to rural areas such as those needed to provide professional health services.

A pandemic flu is not specifically a compensable work-related condition at this time, but state-by-state regulatory changes could provide a partial payment mechanism for health care costs if the situation arises. 32 Outbreaks of disease can change societal goals and allocation of resources. During an epidemic of a disease, the goal may be to minimize death and disability; during a disease pandemic, the goal may shift to preserving basic functioning of society by devoting available resources to maintenance of critical infrastructure, such as law enforcement, emergency medical services and utilities. 109, 110 Major unsettling events-particularly ones with national or global implications-can adversely affect entire industries, and health care is not immune to such systemic shocks.

In addition to the reform of public hospitals to provide affordable services, establishment of primary care services will likely facilitate general geriatric care, early diagnosis and intervention of common geriatric disorders, with both clinical and cost benefits. Other socioeconomical topics to address among the aging issues in China include pension benefits and retirement policy. A longitudinal perspective calls for an attention to disease burden in the young population when implementing a healthcare policy in the elders (Fig. 3) . Close collaboration among researchers on different aspects of the Chinese aging studies, the government, international research institutions, research-funding agencies, and other associated health care sections is pivotal and should be encouraged. Increased allocation in research funding for aging studies in China should be given consideration of the top priority.",33.44588273261639,13.697085024149501

''Our [supplies are kept] off-site too, and, up until this situation, they would take these huge pallets and leave them on the loading dock. That's where ours were stolen from.

In addition to the traditional urban poor who have lived on low-income social security welfare, a new class of urban poor includes those who were unable to reap the benefits of rapid urbanisation and economic development. These include the unemployed and those underemployed because they do not have the skills required for emerging jobs or they lack the mobility needed to seek job opportunities. 192 Another group consists of those whose rural Hukou (mandatory system of residence regis tration) changed to urban as a result of government reclassification of their land (ie, from rural to urban). Without the proper skills and necessary social capital to help them to adapt to new urban life, these individuals tend to work in poorly paid, labour-intensive jobs without job security. Despite their access to urban Hukou and qualification for social security welfare, many of them have substandard living conditions. The new urban poor also tend to be spatially segregated and confined to certain old neighbourhoods (eg, urban villages) in cities. 193 Access to urban public services is another contributing factor to social segregation and poverty among migrants. 194 Although many migrants have established long-term de facto residences in places far from their Hukou registration, because the Hukou system is the basis for access to essential supplies and services, urban immigrants without a local Hukou are often unable to access these resources, including public schools and public health services. 195 In Beijing, Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Hangzhou, migrants do not qualify for public housing rentals; even in cities where they do qualify-such as Shanghai and Chongqing-strict rules apply. In Shanghai, about 70% of total housing poverty involves rural migrants. 196 Many urban villages are populated with migrant workers. Although these are not officially recognised as slums, they often have inferior environmental and housing conditions than other urban neighbourhoods. 193 In addition, the Hukou system also restricts migrant employment opportunities and increases commuter times because affordable local housing is scarce. 197 A new policy is expected to relax the Hukou system in medium-sized and small-sized cities but continue to strictly control it in the large cities where most migrants congregate. 198 The existence of different types of health insurance in urban China also adds to health inequity. The two major state-run medical insurance programmes-Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance and Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance-increase inequalities in out patient utilisation but reduce pro-rich Year inequities in inpatient utilisation. 199 In addition, subscriptions to less generous programmes, such as the Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance scheme, are associated with decreased utilisation of general physical examinations. 200 Inequity in access to health services for urban China is another major contributor to health inequities. Given that most of China's health service resources are located in urban areas, uneven urbanisation across the country is responsible for unequal availability of and access to various health services. 201 Among prefecture-level cities, there is inequity in the health service (table). The number of health-care personnel per 10 000 people based on populations in administrative areas or populations in urban districts both show that the divergence between the top-ranked cities and the bottom-ranked ones is substantial. Given that most of the bottom-ranked cities are third-tier cities located in the south and southwest of China, appropriate policies are needed to address this disparity. The National Plan for New Urbanization 2014-20 emphasises urbanisation in China should be focused on small-sized and midsized cities and towns, therefore these health service inequities need to be acted upon in a timely manner.",42.71674062937091,16.80922547127164

[4] [5] [6] [7] [8] While the worst-case scenario of a 1918-scale pandemic was avoided, there were reports of patients with severe disease stressing critical care services in communities throughout the world. 2, [9] [10] [11] These reports show that severely ill patients can divert resources and impact the balance of care delivery even in hospitals where the overall capacity is not exceeded. This problem is particularly acute in resource-limited settings where there is decreased capacity to manage severe illness. While building resource-intensive and highly technological ICUs is not feasible for many parts of the world, much can be done to improve care for severely ill patients in more austere environments. In this review, we discuss the inter-related issues of pandemic influenza, severe seasonal influenza, and severe illness more generally. Given the burden of severe illness in resource-limited settings, it is vital to improve capacity to care for severely ill individuals in these environments.",34.00592066061127,15.88064059440364

Results: 654 participants died during the follow-up. Those with lowest occupational position had 1.60 times higher risk of death than those with highest position in analysis adjusted for sex and year of birth. For all-cause mortality, this association was attenuated by 42% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 21%, 94%) when health behaviours assessed at baseline were entered into the model and by 72% (95% CI 42%, 154%) when health behaviours were entered as time dependent covariates. The corresponding attenuations were 29% (95% CI 11%, 54%) and 45% (95% CI 24%, 79%) for cardiovascular mortality and 61% (95% CI 16%, 425%) and 94% (95% CI 35%, 595%) for non-cancer noncardiovascular mortality. There was no association between occupational position and cancer mortality so no further analyses were undertaken. The difference between the baseline and longitudinal assessments was mostly due to an increased explanatory power of diet, physical activity and to a lesser extent, alcohol consumption. The role of smoking, the strongest mediator in these analyses, did not much differ when using baseline or repeat assessments. Conclusions: Health behaviours may be a more important explanatory mechanism for inequalities in mortality than previously estimated. According to South Africa's new constitution, access to health care is a fundamental right. In this paper we analyse the utilisation of ante-natal care services under the public health system of South Africa in order to inform policy concerned with equity of access about factors associated with the distribution of current services. We conceptualize access to care as covering three distinct but interacting dimensions of availability, affordability and acceptability.

Particularly, the Chinese health-care system faces substantial challenges in its transformation from a profi t-driven public hospital-centred system to an integrated primary care-based delivery system that is cost eff ective and of better quality to respond to the changing population needs. An additional challenge is the government's latest strategy to promote private investment for hospitals. In this Review, we discuss how China's health-care system would perform if hospital privatisation combined with hospital-centred fragmented delivery were to prevail-population health outcomes would suff er; health-care expenditures would escalate, with patients bearing increasing costs; and a two-tiered system would emerge in which access and quality of care are decided by ability to pay. We then propose an alternative pathway that includes the reform of public hospitals to pursue the public interest and be more accountable, with public hospitals as the benchmarks against which private hospitals would have to compete, with performance-based purchasing, and with population-based capitation payment to catalyse coordinated care. Any decision to further expand the for-profi t private hospital market should not be made without objective assessment of its eff ect on China's health-policy goals.",36.48071817695763,14.732272770493061

The solidarity principle of socially shared responsibility for funding universal access to health care is based on equitable prepayment for health care for all by nationally regulated mechanisms through place of work or general revenues of government. A society may see universal access to health care as a positive value, and at the same time utilize incentives to promote the use of services of benefit to the individual, such as hospital care, immunization, and screening programs. Some services may be arbitrarily excluded from health insurance, such as dental care, although this is to the detriment of children and a financial hardship for many.

Invasive alien plants species (IAPS) are considered to be one of the major drivers of biodiversity loss and thereby altering the ecosystem services and socio-economic conditions through different mechanisms. Although the ecological impacts of IAPS are well documented, there is a dearth of studies regarding their economic quantification, livelihood considerations, biotechnological prospects (phytoremediation, bioenergy, phytosynthesis of nanoparticles, biomedical, industrial applications etc.) and human health risk assessments of IAPS. In this context, the current panoramic review aimed to investigate the environmental, socio-ecological and health risks posed by IAPS as well as the compounded impact of IAPS with habitat fragmentation, climate and land use changes. To this end, the need of an integrated trans-disciplinary research is emphasized for the sustainable management of IAPS. The management prospects can be further strengthened through their linkage with geo-spatial technologies (remote sensing and GIS) by mapping and monitoring the IAPS spread. Further, the horizon of IAPS management is expanded to ecological indicator perspectives of IAPS, biosecurity, and risk assessment protocols with critical discussion.

Research priorities to reduce this knowledge gap include: • Detailed outbreak investigations in schools (before, during, and after closure) along with detailed follow- Review up of households of students. Such studies will provide information on the health benefi ts for students and their families and allow better understanding of transmission dynamics within the school and school-household interactions. Outbreaks that are investigated are usually atypical, in the sense that they are expected to be larger than an average school outbreak. Caution is therefore necessary when extrapolating from those outbreaks to nationwide estimates. For this reason, a metaanalysis will be particularly useful. • As part of the same studies, the economic and social impact of the closure on households should be established. Linking the epidemiological and economic components of household questionnaires will allow investigation of the cost-eff ectiveness of the intervention. • Collecting data on activities and interactions with other children during school term and during school closure. So far, the absence of such data reduces our ability to assess the eff ect of school closure on infl uenza spread, namely we do not know how mixing patterns of children outside school are modifi ed when schools close (so-called compensatory behaviours). • Assessing the eff ect of school closure on transmission in the wider community (ie, not just children and their families). This will be more challenging since it will require collecting good incidence data at a geographical resolution that matches the catchment area of the schools. Such spatial resolution cannot be achieved with traditional surveillance networks, so non-conventional approaches (such as polls organised by phone or on the web) will have to be considered. • There is also a need to refi ne our understanding of the implications of school closure for health-care and other essential services.

Examples of resources that need to be assessed include antiinfective medications, vaccines, respiratory protection, gowns, gloves, eye protection, and hand hygiene products.

Although the majority of schools reported training all staff on respiratory hygiene practices, many do not provide annual student training on basic infection prevention practices. Infection prevention training and access to PPE are important not only for disaster preparedness, but also for everyday minimization of infection transmission in schools. In 2002, Robinson 28 asserted that it is the role of school nurses to develop and implement infection prevention policies and programs to decrease disease transmission in schools, including educational programs such as respiratory hygiene. Schools need to partner with local planning agencies to ensure that they will have access to supplies during a disaster, including being designated as a priority group for receiving pandemic-related vaccines or medication and PPE. In this study, schools that reported being better prepared for a future disaster or pandemic were more likely to be designated as a POD and to have experienced increased student or employee morbidity or mortality related to H1N1 during the pandemic. The POD designation may be a significant factor in readying schools for disasters or pandemics, because it requires that the school be actively engaged in local or regional disaster planning efforts. This involvement likely influences the school in preparing for future disasters and may provide additional guidance to the school on disaster planning efforts, such as plan development and testing, through interaction with regional emergency managers/experts. Schools with better disaster and pandemic preparedness scores were also more likely to have had a lead nurse or a school nurse involved in the school disaster planning committee complete the survey compared with schools that had a non-lead nurse or a nurse not on the disaster planning committee participate in the study. This finding has critical implications for schools wishing to improve their disaster and pandemic planning efforts. One simple strategy for increasing school disaster preparedness appears to be involving school nurses in planning efforts. School nurses are the health professionals responsible for implementing policies and programs to prevent infection transmission in schools, 28 and thus are those best able to inform school disaster planning committees on aspects of plan development that will affect infection transmission. In addition, the National Association of School Nurses recommends that school nurses be involved in school disaster preparedness activities. 29 School nurses may require additional training in pandemic planning to feel comfortable in this role. Future research should evaluate competencies for school nurses related to pandemic planning and assess school nurses' current comfort and ability related to performing in this crucial role.",41.38244600201909,16.213250095514876

From the perspective of uptake of health services, what really matters is access to cash when it is needed to take care of an unexpected illness in the family. Furthermore, the cash must be accessible for the person taking care of the sick individual-eg, a mother taking care of her child, or a woman needing ongoing treatment for a chronic disease. Too often women do not have access to cash. Thus, gender becomes an important determinant of inequity.

Models have been used to test intervention effectiveness during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and a potential H5N1 pandemic. [46] [47] [48] Models that showed that preventing air travel and closing schools would have minimal impact on the size of the epidemic informed policy in the US and other countries. Individual-based models can be used to examine the impact of interventions on inequalities. Outputs can be measured by geographic area or wealth quintile, thus quantifying policy impact on not only reducing disease burden overall, but also on reducing inequalities in disease burden. 49, 50 Funding agencies should invest in computational modeling education programs in low-and lower-middle-income countries, similar to investments that the NIH has made in the US. 51 The last point becomes especially salient when decisions need to be made quickly by policymakers in a country. Policymakers are more likely to work with and trust researchers from their own country. Investing in social, epidemiologic, and computational public health research capabilities in low-and lower-middle-income countries will enhance understanding of social inequalities in disease burden and enable policies that reduce these inequalities, as well as disease overall, ultimately enhancing global health security. Although its outcome is not yet known, one example of this is the partnership among the CDC, China CDC, Suzhou CDC, Suzhou Children's Hospital, and Fudan University to examine the economic burden of seasonal influenza among children in China as part of an effort to address vaccine policy in that country. 52 Meeting the goal of ''responding rapidly and effectively to biological threats by improving global access to medical and non-medical countermeasures'' 3 demands that we address the major challenge of fair access to antivirals and vaccines. Farmer et al 53 discuss key steps to expanding access to cancer treatment in poor countries with a 2-pronged strategy: global pricing and procurement strategies in which multiple countries negotiate together for reduced prices, and careful planning so that treatment reaches resourcepoor regions within these countries. A similar mindset is required in pandemic planning. Vaccine donation and distribution systems coordinated by WHO during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic were designed to ensure access to vaccines at a basic level in low-income countries. However, in the WHO's evaluation of their H1N1 vaccine deployment efforts, they identified multiple challenges. 54 Although 122.5 million doses were pledged for donation, in fact those dosages would have covered only 10% of the populations of those countries eligible for donation. Given that eligible countries are low-and lower-middle-income countries, the likelihood of inadequate vaccine for populations already experiencing health inequalities is high.

Because vaccine stockpiles are limited, months will likely pass before supply can be increased to meet the demand. As priorities must be established in advance, the Health and Human Services Pandemic Influenza Plan and the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza are beginning to address prioritization issues. 63, 64 Although advance planning and training for distribution are critical, not every contingency can be anticipated on a theoretical basis. A number of lessons have been learned from preparedness exercises and from previous epidemics. First, at the individual level, the long wait time required for the large number of persons that will need to be vaccinated in the shortest period poses a major challenge (Table  3) . 65 Second, personnel dedicated to this effort are needed; identifying and locating HTR populations in this situation becomes more difficult if staff are diverted to other venues. Third, at the provider level, long wait times may necessitate the expansion of the provider pool to include additional nurses and pharmacists. 63, 66 And finally, reports have shown that maintaining adequate documentation under crisis conditions, especially for research purposes, may be challenging. 63, 67 Challenges at the structural level are even more pronounced. The domestic supply of influenza vaccine for A (H5N1) strain of concern is limited; the current annual capacity in the U.S. could manufacture enough vaccine for only 15 million Americans, leaving the vast majority vulnerable to disease. 63 Preparedness drills have shown that special consideration should be given to first responders (e.g., health care workers, emergency medical volunteers). In preparedness exercises, providers and their families have requested that they be given prophylactic vaccination ahead of time to increase their ability to participate after an outbreak (Gebbie, K., Columbia University School of Nursing, personal communication). Other high-priority groups include those at risk for severe disease: elderly, children, those with chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes, and immunosuppressed individuals. Points of distribution should be determined in advance based on their ability to handle large numbers of people (Table 3) . 63 These locations, which will most likely have to be flexible based on the exigencies of the situation and which, of necessity, have to favor access for the easy-to-reach masses, may be challenging for some HTR populations to access, especially those with limited mobility, distrust of government, or other constraints.",41.92634445383088,18.122914132315692

China's experience,"China, like most transitional economies, is moving from ''make'' to ''buy'' on the ''make or buy'' continuum. Village doctors and individual urban providers became self-employed, charging for services on a FFS basis. Clinics and hospitals are mostly government-owned or operated by SOEs. Recently, however, Chinese policymakers have increasingly come to view government hospitals as a form of SOE, meriting experimentation with managerial autonomy, incentives and property rights reforms (Li & Song, 2002) . Some of the same trends driving ownership reform elsewhere in the economy -such as harder budget constraints and competitive pressures (Cao, Qian, & Weingast, 1999 ) -also spur property rights diversification in the health sector. Official policy now differentiates providers by ownership and tax obligations. Hospitals and other health care providers must register as government, private nonprofit, or private for-profit entities. Government and private nonprofits are tax-exempt and subject to administered prices. Government hospitals continue to receive some direct financial support from local or provincial governments. Private for-profit providers are free to set their own prices but required to pay taxes. Eggleston and Yip (2004) calibrate a simulation model of the impact of China's ownership and pricing reforms on cost, quality and access. Both theoretic and simulation results show how providing implicit insurance through distorted prices leads to over/under use of services by profitability, which in turn fuels cost escalation and reduces access for the poor. The authors suggest that regardless of ownership structure, broadened insurance coverage and mixed payment are better options than continued implicit cross-subsidies through distorted FFS.

Inequity is usually described in economic terms, most frequently as wealth quintiles, based on possessions owned by the household. 71 This is a convenient approach that can be applied to information such as the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data to analyse income or consumption. In many settings, wealth quintiles eff ectively indicate other inequities within a society. They draw attention to diff erences in key markers of access and outcome between those who do and do not have material assets, which provide a mechanism to examine diff erences between countries in terms of how these assets are distributed. Some specifi c measures of inequalities in wealth have been developed, such as the Gini coeffi cient which measures the extent to which distribution of wealth is uneven. Other measures are the ratio of the incomes of the richest 10% or 20% of the population compared with the poorest 10% or 20%. 72 The use of wealth quintiles as a means to measure equity has featured explicitly in only one MDG target, MDG 1 target 1A, for which indicators include measurement of a poverty gap ratio (between lowest and highest wealth quintiles) and the share of the poorest quintile in national consumption. However, wealth quintiles have been used extensively in analyses of healthrelated MDGs undertaken by the World Bank, UNICEF, and others, 73,74 and very recently in work into the distribution of education enrolment rates. 9 But wealth, income, or consumption are not the only features of inequity. Factors such as geography and ethnic origin might be more important in identifi cation of inequities, both in access and outcome of health interventions. 75 In rural Papua New Guinea and Ethiopia, the most important determinant of access to health care, and health outcomes, may be geography. Asset indices do not always predict health outcomes. In some settings, geography, ethnic origin, or other factors might be more dominant factors. But the absence of measures that capture these other factors across diff erent societies means that these features of inequity in distribution are overlooked.",36.568375126857326,15.792308228928414

Strategies for program inclusion are often based on historical precedent rather than cost-effectiveness or evidence.

The use of drugs for treatment or prophylaxis leads to subtle, yet very significant policy differences. While the inclusion of prophylaxis as a protective measure attempts to maintain surge capacity in the healthcare system, it entails a prohibitively expensive public health policy. Other factors that would significantly influence decisions regarding prophylaxis include the severity of the pandemic strain, the availability of antiviral drugs, and the impact of other intervention measures. Nevertheless, in the absence of vaccines, antiviral prophylaxis has the potential to offer a protection comparable to that induced by vaccination.",32.032326246479634,15.65812076013567

Even in non-pandemic times, healthcare systems in many parts of the world are stretched in meeting the need for regular services. While the demand for healthcare services will substantially increase during a pandemic, health resources will be more quickly depleted and there may be fewer healthcare workers available. Assuming a viral strain with 25-35% clinical attack rate over the estimated 8-12 weeks of a pandemic wave, a sizable portion of healthcare workers may become infected during the early stages of disease outbreaks (Gardam et al., 2007; Lee and Chen, 2007) . The consequence is clear: a critical shortage of health personnel and care providers. While healthcare organizations often face staff-shortage during a natural disaster, the healthcare system may experience much higher absenteeism rates in the event of a pandemic. Considering the potentially reduced capacity of the healthcare system, and the lack of appropriate resources that is likely to arise, health professionals may be called upon to assume responsibilities outside their normal scope of practice. Such responsibilities may involve further exposure to the disease, and require strict adherence to infection control practices. In such circumstances, it is vital to ensure that healthcare workers are adequately protected and barriers to their participation are eliminated, especially in the presence of other potentially competing obligations that need to be addressed. The diversity among healthcare workers and facilities makes preparation and response to a pandemic especially challenging. Healthcare facilities are magnets for individuals with influenza-related illness, and are at high risk of disruption during a pandemic, primarily due to hospital outbreaks of influenza that affect both patients and staff (Salgado et al., 2002) . Such outbreaks can have serious consequences for a sustainable healthcare response: staff shortages can result or be exacerbated; admission maybe curtailed; and increased costs may be incurred. Published studies clearly demonstrate these outcomes (Horcajada et al., 2003; Lundstrom et al., 2002; Malavaud et al., 2001; Munoz et al., 1999; Sartor et al., 2002; Stott et al., 2002) , and therefore preventing > nosocomial spread of influenza is crucial for mitigating the impact of a pandemic on the population. While responding to the care of influenza patients, other health needs will continue and cannot be ignored during pandemic phases. Conventional wisdom considers access to inpatient and outpatient care to be central to any pandemic response. Were modern healthcare resources unavailable, ill individuals would not be able to access antiviral drugs, antibiotics, oxygen therapy, intravenous therapy, intensive care, and other therapies. These modern options are essentially irrelevant without personnel, and their application requires a competent healthcare workforce, professional experience, and practice in order to minimize possible unintended health consequences.",34.772197855815385,15.198536907292189

For instance, the WHO guidelines, Whole-of-Society Pandemic Readiness, aim 'to support integrated planning and preparations for pandemic influenza across all sectors of society, including public and private sector organizations and essential services' (WHO 2009, p. 5) . To strengthen organizational resiliency against the stresses and strains that may result from a pandemic, thorough preparation is required. 'In the absence of early and effective planning, countries may face wider social and economic disruption, significant threats to the continuity of essential services, lower production levels, distribution difficulties, and shortages of supplies' (p. 5). Emergency planning is furthermore imperative since '[t]he failure of businesses to sustain operations would add to the economic consequences of a pandemic. Some business sectors will be especially vulnerable (e.g. those dependent on tourism and travel), and certain groups in society are likely to suffer more than others' (p. 5). The 'Readiness Framework' therefore asks all organizations that provide basic services such as food, water, health, defence, law and order, finance, transportation, telecommunications and energy to prepare for pandemics via simulation exercises and drills based on different scenarios. Furthermore, business continuity plans have to be developed. For this purpose, a pandemic coordinator should be assigned to oversee the planning process. All organizations that are crucial for public life are strongly advised to prepare themselves for the next pandemic. Given the interdependencies between these organizations, general preparedness is the only way to prevent a complete breakdown. Or, as the guidelines put it: 'It is prudent to plan for the worst, while hoping for the best' (p. 8).",38.51789534738565,15.910190083859527

Epidemiologists have been modeling likely scenarios, but the models are notoriously inaccurate early on in a pandemic phase [11]. Using an attack rate ranging from 10 to 30% of the population with a hospital admission rate close to 1% and a case-fatality rate close to 0.14%, as in seasonal flu (an hypothesis supported by preliminary data [1]), the pandemic may have a major impact on health services and ICM in particular. Some models have predicted critical care demand at the peak surge of the pandemic to be well in excess of 100% of available facilities, even in the most developed countries [11]. This is of considerable concern to practicing Intensivists. Increasing intensive care support by a factor of two without additional skilled and trained specialists and without the usual range or technical facilities and support services may well force us to ventilate more patients than normal, but this would not be ‘quality critical care.’ If this increased surge was to occur, then the numbers of patients presenting would be well in excess of the available capacity to provide them with quality care. This will necessitate triage. The ethics of triage have been discussed several times [12–15], but the concerns as to whether the ethical or legal framework will ultimately support clinicians faced with these tribulations remain. Practicing for a greater good, rather than what is best for an individual patient, may be the pragmatic answer to the problem, but clinicians are rightly concerned that this may lead to future complaint and legal or professional censure.

This requires engaging our elected officials both directly and indirectly by continuing to educate them and the public at large about the importance of fundamental research in infectious diseases. The advocacy group Research!America has a number of helpful tips on its website (http://www.researchamerica.org). Second, we need to demonstrate to the public that we are being good stewards of their investment by working safely in the laboratory. There have been a number of high-profile biosafety lapses over the past year, and the negative publicity surrounding these events may lead to more regulation and less funding support for exactly the types of research that we most critically need. We therefore argue that each of us needs to pay special attention to biosafety in 2015 and the longer term. Third, in controversial areas, such as studies of transmissibility involving pathogens with pandemic potential, it needs to be clearly articulated why some types of experiments need to be done by vigorously engaging in scientific debate using the tools of science, all the while acknowledging that there are risks and taking every step to mitigate those risks. Third, every scientist needs to become a foot soldier in confronting the pervasive spread of antiscientific attitudes, such as the antivaccination movement, which threaten to undermine the great advances society has made in so many aspects of everyday life, including reducing mortality from many infectious diseases. Although virology is currently at the epicenter of these converging storms, the issues that it faces are relevant to all of microbiology and, by extension, to all of science and the society that it serves.

In China, health care is mainly financed by government investment, public health insurances, and out-of-pocket fees. The majority of government investments are from local government, rather than central government. The scale of resource input largely depends on local economic conditions.20 Public health insurance funds are also localized. However, provinces in China have had unequal economic development since 1980s, resulting in an uneven local financial capacity to pay for health services. For the indicator of beds/1000, the trends of sigma divergence in 1980s and 1990s could probably be explained by the imbalanced economic development among provinces. However, the obvious sigma convergence after 2000 probably represented the input from central government. The 2000 World Health Organization report on health system performance and the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome crisis pushed the central government to allocate resources toward public health services and health equity issues. Since then, the central government has expanded resource input dramatically to less developed areas in Central China and Western China to build and expand primary hospitals and public health facilities.21 Such enormous investment from central government and local government might contribute to the sigma convergence of structure indicators as well as beta convergence in procedure and outcome indicators in recent years. For instance, China’s New Cooperative Medical Scheme, a large government subsidized health insurance plan, has improved finances of township health centers since the start of its pilot program in 2003.22 Moreover, in 2009, the Chinese government implemented an ambitious health reform that is aimed to build up basic health services system for all.23 The success of these re-distributive measures on physicians per capita seems be more ambiguous than measured focused on beds.",32.89756664079853,16.0705576594159

One bed per OR was assumed. For hospitals that did not report PACU beds, a 1.5:1 PACU beds-to-OR ratio was assumed and ORs were multiplied by 1.5. One ventilator was assumed per critical care bed.

A typical ICU length of stay for COVID-19 patients was used to calculate the daily discharge rate from hospital critical care beds to recalculate critical care bed need for each day of the study period. 32 Once a hospital's critical care bed capacity was reached, patients who could not be admitted -i.e., new critical care bed need minus critical care bed discharges -were aggregated to calculate excess deaths due to lack of critical care access. Prior reports of the hospital course of care for COVID-19 patients showed that the vast majority of those admitted to the ICU were critical and only one-in-five of those who were critical survived, mostly because of ICU care. Thus, the percentage of critically ill patients that should have gone to the ICU but did not and survived should be much lower, likely only 5%; we therefore assumed a 95% mortality for patients that would have been placed in a critical care bed but did not because their local critical care bed capacity had been exceeded. 33",29.687140228918768,12.216318483054689

This paper attempts to fill this gap by highlighting the interrelationship between the long term structural health policies and the Covid 19 fatality rates among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries 2 . Definition of Austerity policies is a widespread cut on government expenditure which is targeted to reduce government fiscal deficit and enhance economic growth (Konzelmann, 2014; ) . Such a significant reduction in government spending has a disproportionately negative impact on government social sector expenditure (Health, Education, social security etc.) The negative impact of austerity policies in terms of lowering employment, economic growth and increasing inequality is well studied (Blyth, 2013; Krugman, 2015; Stiglitz, 2012; UNCTAD, 2017) . In the post.-2008 crisis period and under the impact of rising debts burdens, many countries in European counties imposed a policy of austerity in 2010. The most severe austerity policies were implemented in Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, Spain and Portugal (Leschke et al., 2015) . Among the OCED group, there is variation in the extent of reduction in their health expenditure in pursuit of Austerity policies(fiscal consolidation) across countries (Van Gool & Pearson, 2014) . The negative impact of such drastic funding cuts on access to health facilities and health indicators is well documented in many OCED countries (Antonakakis & Collins, 2014; Ayuso-Mateos et al., 2013; Ifanti et al., 2013; Kentikelenis et al., 2014 Kentikelenis et al., , 2014 Kentikelenis et al., , 2014 Loopstra et al., 2016 Loopstra et al., , 2016 McKee et al., 2012 McKee et al., , 2012 Reeves et al., 2014 Reeves et al., , 2014 Ruckert & Labonté, 2017; Stuckler et al., 2017) . So under the background of such drastic cuts in health expenditure, the papers will evaluate the impact of austerity policies (health expenditure cuts) on fatality rates of Covid-19 after controlling for other socio-demographic characteristics which have a significant impact on fatality rates of covid-19. The fatality rates are measured by crude Case fatality rates (CFC), which is the ratio of confirmed death to confirmed positive cases of covid-19 for each country.",30.543593505617423,12.10389057582493

Urban counties were estimated to have greater numbers exceeding their critical care bed capacities within a month, from a maximum of 55 (4.7%) urban counties under the very low critical care surge response scenario with no contact reduction, to 6 (0.5%) urban counties under the high critical care surge response scenario with 50% contact reduction. (Table 2) The 64 counties in the very low critical care surge response scenario with no contact reduction that were at risk of exceeding their bed limits were clustered in various locations across the US -a New York-New Jersey-Connecticut-northeastern Pennsylvania cluster, an eastern Massachusetts cluster, a southeastern Michigan cluster, a southeastern Louisiana cluster, a Colorado cluster, a Washington cluster, a Virginia cluster, and other dispersed counties in five other states. At the other extreme, the 7 counties in the high critical care surge response scenario with 50% contact reduction that were at risk of exceeding their bed limits were clustered in New York, Colorado, and Virginia. (Figure 1) The highest proportion of excess COVID-19 deaths that could have been averted with access to critical care were shown to occur in the Northeast US and urban counties over the month studied. As a measure of actions to flatten the epidemic curve, the difference in excess deaths between a 0% and a 50% contact reduction ranged from an estimated 12,203 to 19,594 excess deaths averted over a month. As a measure of the impact of aggressive critical care surge actions, the difference in excess deaths between the high and the very low critical care surge response scenarios ranged from an estimated 4,029 to 11,420 excess deaths averted over a month. As a measure of the impact of redeploying non-ICU beds for critical care surge response, the difference in excess deaths between the medium and the very low critical care surge response scenarios ranged from an estimated 3,050 to 6,946 excess deaths averted over a month. As a measure of the impact of putting two patients on a single ventilator, the difference in excess deaths between the high and the medium critical care surge response scenarios ranged from an estimated 979 to 4,474 excess deaths averted over a month.

Therefore, it is imperative that the UK Government, and governments around the world, quickly develop and implement policies to support the most vulnerable, in a bid to minimise the long-term social and economic harm caused by COVID-19. Government policy should recognise the disparity in impact across socio-economic groups, particularly across the labour market, and should aim to support workers equitably across the income spectrum. This would likely help increase compliance across the population to the levels required to suppress transmission and thereby reduce the strain on national health services, both in the UK and abroad.

The simulation results illustrated the establishment of new temporary hospitals that could accommodate more patients could significantly help the control of the epidemic. In fact, if the beds in hospitals were three times more than the current situation, the total infectious would decrease by 33% at the end point. After the period of rapidly rising, beds in hospitals were not an essential parameter since the daily increase of infected people was less than the people out of the system.
