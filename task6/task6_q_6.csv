These include reducing social contacts by closing schools or postponing public events, and encouraging hand washing and the use of masks. These interventions will not only have a non-intuitive impact on the epidemic dynamics, but they will also have direct and indirect social and economic costs, which mean that governments will only want to use them for a limited amount of time.

This weight may depend, inter alia, on the magnitude of the harm, its qualitative importance, the likelihood or certainty with which it will occur, and its impact on distributive fairness. 28 The graver the harm, the easier it will be to justify the intervention. The second desideratum is the effectiveness of the intervention in preventing the harm. In IDC, this effectiveness will depend on the nature of the infectious disease, the nature of Jonathan Pugh and Thomas Douglas the intervention, and the context in which the intervention is to be deployed. Consider, for instance, the attempt to limit the spread of infectious disease by imposing mass quarantine: this solution will only be effective in preventing the spread of an infectious agent if it is possible to identify people likely to be incubating the infection, and if those people comply with the conditions of quarantine. Furthermore, the infectious agent must be transmissible in its pre-symptomatic or early symptomatic stages for quarantine to be effective in preventing further transmission. 29 A third desideratum is that the interventions have low opportunity costs. The expenditure of economic resources on a public health intervention necessarily diverts funds from other potentially beneficial public projects, including projects that might themselves promote public health. 30 The opportunity cost of an intervention is the value of the alternative use to which the resources invested in the intervention would otherwise have been put. The higher the opportunity cost, the more difficult it will be to justify the intervention. In many cases, determining the opportunity cost of an intervention is difficult because it is unclear how the resources would otherwise be spent. However, even in those cases it may be possible to make a (necessarily uncertain) estimate of the expected opportunity costs.

Intuitively, recurrent surveillance expenditures of this kind are expected to be lower than the accumulated costs of failing to maintain a situation of exclusion or acceptability with respect to a given pathogen. However, the feasibility of implementing Stage I surveillance may differ considerably between developed and developing countries.

Advances in care systems, instrumentation, biotechnologies, genetics and drug research have to be supported and regulated, considering their ethical and social consequences (as in the cases of GMOs, cloning, access to drugs in developing countries, etc.). Social innovation may spread in welfare services with a greater role of citizens, users and non-profi t organisations, renewed public provision and new forms of self-organisation of communities. (279) Such a policy can be built in Europe using existing institutions, policy tools and resources, pushing economic activities towards the protection of health and welfare and putting Europe on a sustainable path of long-term environmental transition on the basis of a green industrial policy. The welfare state and public health reduce inequalities Inequality is a major concern in this context. Since the 1980s, as a result of neoliberal policies, advanced countries have experienced sharp increases in income and wealth disparities. Because of its nature as a supplier of goods and services based on individual and social needs, the welfare state has been a key factor in reducing inequalities after the Second World War. As argued in our book Explaining inequality (Franzini and Pianta, 2015) , the reduction of the policy space, the privatisation of public services and the extension of the market in areas previously protected by public action have introduced new mechanisms that generated economic and social disparities. In Europe a report from the European Commission recalled that ""[i]n all countries with available data, significant differences in health exist between socioeconomic groups, in the sense that people with lower levels of education, occupation and/or income tend to have systematically higher morbidity and mortality rate"" (2007) . And, considering the economic effects of disparities in health conditions, the EU report calculated that the number of deaths that can be attributed to health inequalities in the European Union (EU25) as a whole is estimated to be 707,000 per year and the number of life years lost due to these death is about 11.4 million. Health inequalities also affect the average life expectancy at birth of men and women, decreasing it by 1.84 years. The total costs due to health inequalities -obtained from the combination of data relating to mortality and morbidity -is close to 980 billion euros, 9.38% of EU25 GDP in 2004. In other words, the loss of health due to socio-economic inequalities represents 15% of the costs of social security systems and 20% of the costs of health care systems in the European Union as a whole (Mackenbach, 2007). 6 The relationship between inequalities and health has been analysed in several countries by considering different social and professional conditions (Wilkinson and Pickett, 2009; Costa et al., 2004) , showing that mortality rates increase in proportion to economic and social hardship, lower incomes, education and social class. Thus, reducing economic inequalities would make it possible to reduce health disparities; at the same time, greater universal and egalitarian health protection would signifi cantly reduce the costs of public health and welfare.",32.147186272362696,14.020473656611582

This article, therefore, describes an approach to measuring public tempers. Social media are a fertile ground for the dissemination of rumours (Tufekci, 2008) . Through social media, rumours have experienced a high level of diffusion and have become more influential than in the past, thereby becoming worthy of serious academic research and scholarly attention (Mintz, 2002) . Rumours can sometimes be limited and weak but, at other times, they can hit hard, initiating battles and bringing down political systems (cf. Caplow, 1947; Lotan et al. 2011) . The effect of rumours can be destructive (Fine and Heath, 2009) , and yet it arguably takes time for this destruction to unfold. A concern is that, if a rumour changes public opinion, and then the rumour is discredited, the changed public opinion can remain the same, despite being based initially on false information. Rumours stick easily in the mind and hence people will mentally and subconsciously go back to them. Put simply, 'Once we've heard an untrue claim, we can't simply unhear it' (Harford, Financial Times, 9 March 2017) .

Putnam (1995) defined social capital as ""features of social organization such as networks, norms and social trust that facilitate coordination and cooperation for mutual benefit."" He conducted research in both Italy and the United States on the relationships among social relations, civic engagement, and political and economic outcomes. He found that regions at higher levels of civic engagement, such as newspaper readership, voter turnout, and membership in various associations, had superior political and economic performance. Coleman (1988) described social capital as being imbedded in social relationships and serving as resources for people to achieve their goals. Coleman introduced various forms of social capital such as obligations, expectations, and trustworthiness that exist in social structures, information channels imbedded in social relationships, and norms and effective sanctions against deviant behavior. Bourdieu (1986) , by contrast, introduced three types of capital: human capital (i.e., education), cultural capital (i.e., language), and social capital, defined as a form of group resources that accrue to individuals as a result of their membership in social networks. He suggested that social capital is often used to obtain human capital and cultural capital, which can raise a person's social position and status in a society.",26.750032943557265,9.943909145245648

For example, a high incidence prediction could lead to a public health department using its limited resources to deploy costly measures (e.g., mosquito spraying). One consideration is whether it is more important to use a model with a high PPV or a high Sensitivity. A high PPV indicates that, when the model predicts high incidence rate, high incidence is very likely to actually occur. When disease prevention and mitigation resources are limited, it is very important to have high PPV. Based on feedback from the local public health departments in Peru, there was a desire for a dengue prediction model with high PPV [20] . To reduce morbidity and mortality, public health departments also want to be able to mitigate any real outbreaks without being caught unprepared. A high Sensitivity indicates that the model predicts a high percentage of the outbreaks that actually occur. If PPV is high and Sensitivity is low, it means that when an outbreak is predicted, the probability is high that it will occur, but only a small percentage of actual outbreaks are predicted. In an attempt to illustrate these differences, the F-score [45] was introduced.",25.81148171351562,9.881601991992925

The WHO Commission on the Social Determinants of Health notes that a comprehensive health equity surveillance system would capture the most upstream structural drivers of health inequities (the unequal distribution of power, money, goods and services) as well as more intermediate ones that encompass the daily conditions in which people live and work. Such a system could monitor health equity by stratifying morbidity and mortality data by indicators such as income, occupation, gender, region, ethnicity and immigration status [2] . Some such initiatives already exist, for example the EU Health Monitoring Programme, which could be used as a model for Canada [67] . Solid data on health inequities and the social determinants of health serve a dual purpose: not only do they allow public health professionals and provincial health care systems to understand inequities and design effective initiatives that address structural determinants, they can also be used as tools to advocate for change at a broader level, which may be outside the scope of the public health system.

Further, some research conclusions are contradictory.

A policy analysis,"With solid evidence and a comprehensive understanding of inequities, there are many ways that public health can begin to address the social determinants of health in programming. One possibility is using public health planning models that integrate the social determinants of health into the planning process. The Region of Waterloo Public Health in ON developed a planning model that does this, based on the Ontario Public Health Standards (OPHS) [69] . The model is called Evidence and Practice-based Planning Framework: with a focus on health inequities. In the first two steps of program planning (1. Define Issue, 2. Situational Assessment), planners are encouraged to consider the following: community health needs, the OPHS mandate on the social determinants of health, and the association between health status and the determinants of health. Further, they are asked to engage stakeholder perspectives [69] . Another model developed by the National Public Health Partnership in Australia makes the determinants of health even more central to the planning process [70] . This framework bases the intervention on the determinant that is causing the health problem, rather than the health problem itself.

Given the immense costs and the possibility of public panic, it is imperative that more research is done before decisions are made.

From our previous discussion, many readers may already have their own answer to this question that this is not true. However, we would like to emphasize a few points.

With Cyprus and Poland having been polio-free for over 20 and 30 years, respectively, memories of the disease have largely faded and a majority of people are simply unaware of its potential severity. Thus there is reduced public acceptance of vaccination alongside an impression that the benefits of some vaccines may, within the current epidemiological context, only marginally outweigh their potential risks [33] . This, in combination with the fact that there could be issues with trust in some public authorities in some of the countries visited means that providing vaccine-promoting information that is trusted, believed, and acted upon requires a carefully developed strategy. Solutions suggested to us included (i) the public health authorities making systematic efforts to understand vaccine hesitancy where it exists, and responding proactively to people's concerns using appropriate information that is already available from, for example, ECDC, WHO-Euro, and the Global Poliomyelitis Eradication Initiative; (ii) conducting trainings about vaccination for journalists, who might need to be better informed about the topic so that they do not inadvertently perpetuate myths and misperceptions about vaccination; and (iii) enhanced use of social media by the public health authorities.",25.41160492798156,10.533954153906933

To our understanding, global health can be considered as an application of medical and public health sciences together with other disciplines (1) in tackling those issues with global impact and (2) in the effort to seek global solutions. Thus, global health treats public health sciences and medicine as their foundations, and will selectively use theories, knowledge, techniques, therapeutics and prevention measures from public health, medicine, and other disciplines to understand and solve global health problems. There are also clear boundaries between global health, public health and medicine with regard to the target population. Medicine targets patient populations, public health targets health populations in general, while global health targets the global population.

The timeframe in which guidelines are required differentiates the planning for the development of standard or rapid advice guidelines. The methods for guideline development should follow the same basic steps as for a standard guideline with modifications as required to meet the timeline dictated by the emergency. The WHO approval and quality control processes may be accelerated for this type of guideline. For example, rapid advice guidelines may be described as evidence based, but are not necessarily supported by a standard systematic review of evidence, whereas standard guidelines are expected to be supported by standard systematic evidence reviews. Additionally, the peer-review process for rapid advice guidelines may be limited to a review of the completed draft only, immediately before final clearance. Peer review may occur just before clearance and reviewers may be limited in number to between three and six experts rather than more, and precluded in some situations based on time constraints. Standard guidelines require a more complete peer-review process. In comparison, more comprehensive peer review is required for standard guidelines, including a review of the questions, a review of the evidence tables and draft recommendations, and a record of responses to the peer review and changes made to the document. Rapid advice guidelines require a defined date and plan for updating or conversion to a standard guideline. The WHO Handbook specifies two types of guidelines in response to an emergency or urgent need, namely 'rapid advice guidelines' as discussed above and 'emergency (rapid response) guidelines' [1] . WHO develops emergency guidelines when a public health emergency necessitates a response within hours to days; the recommendations may be based on previous guidelines or even expert opinion [1] . However, if the public health emergency continues for an extended period, emergency guidelines must be reviewed, taking into account both the evidence emerging from the current emergency and a systematic review of the relevant evidence.",24.37986616423211,10.069322089311168

For example, in some HAs, there is no public health representation at the senior executive table to bring a public health voice to decision making. Medical health officers in some HAs have no line authority or control of budgets, nor do they make decisions about core program implementation and the deployment of public health staff.

They argued that OH needed to extend beyond the specifics of human and veterinary medicine and include broader ideas about health as wellbeing. They, in turn, added their own perspectives, to place a greater emphasis on research into tropical medicine and livestock health. They also introduced the public health concept of 'health systems', defined by the WHO as 'all organizations, people and actions whose primary intent is to promote, restore or maintain health. This includes efforts to influence determinants of health as well as more direct health-improving activities'. 55 This further broadened 53 For examples of the OWOH logo, see Cook et al.

It was founded in 1943 by the zoologist Rudolf Geigy, who directed the institute until 1975. 57 The original aim of the then Swiss Tropical Institute was twofold: to perform research into tropical diseases-a field that straddled human medicine, biology and agriculture from its very foundation, as explained in Chapter 5 58 -and to train scientists, administrators and others preparing to live and work in French and British colonies. 59 Geigy himself worked across multiple disciplines, including zoology, physiology and embryology, and the institute was organized along these lines. From early in its history, the STPH worked with an affiliated research institute in Cote D'Ivoire, the Centre Suisse de Recherches Scientifiques (CSRS), to enable longstanding collaborative partnerships between Swiss and Ivoirian scientists investigating tropical medicine. 60 Today it is a large and thriving organization, with divisions focused on epidemiology, parasitology, international health, diagnostics, drug development and education.",26.354488308546124,7.697081447999688

Various sociocultural reasons motivate people to use (and not use) a facemask, which has sociocultural implications for people. However, research on the sociocultural meanings of facemasks is scant, and even less is known on how the shifting sociocultural meanings of facemasks are related to the changing social environment, which, I argue, serve as critical underlying factors for people's use (and the absence of use) of a facemask. Because of the effects of globalization and well-developed international transportation, epidemic outbreaks are no longer confined to a single country. As new infectious diseases such as avian influenza and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) have continued emerging, threatening people's health worldwide, and because facemasks have been documented to have significant efficacy in the prevention of infection transmission, therefore, understanding the sociocultural meanings of the facemask has critical implications for public health policymakers and health care providers in designing a socially and culturally responsive public health and infection control policy for the community.",25.55624966984063,10.0252482608733

Qualitative research enables an in-depth exploration of people's beliefs and perceptions in varying contexts, and consideration of other (non-cognitive) determinants such as emotional and sociocultural factors. For example, qualitative research on how the public make sense of emerging infectious diseases suggests that, rather than rationally assessing the likelihood and severity of infection, people interpret its potential impact by drawing on similar past events to make the unfamiliar seem more familiar and by transforming abstract concepts into concrete symbols. One such mechanism is to blame 'the other' or other groups of people and to underestimate the risks faced by 'the self' [26] [27] [28] .

Apart from concerns raised by a professor of public health about the impact of alcohol tax reduction on drinking behaviour amongst young people, the social and public health issues surrounding alcohol taxation were given little attention. Sian Griffiths, Director of the School of Public Health of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, warned in a media interview with a local newspaper in March 2007 that a low alcohol tax might translate into a higher availability of alcoholic drinks, which in turn would potentially increase alcohol consumption, particularly among younger drinkers who are more price-sensitive [57] .",28.459346222316565,12.023864685100683

These results again confirmed our hypothesis that the Chinese online community reacted more strongly to an outbreak that happened in China than one outside China. Drawing on the social amplification of risk model [31] , public risk perception is shaped by a process of interplays between psychological, cultural, social, and institutional factors that may result in amplifying or attenuating the public attention to risk. Mass communication is among the list of factors. Public health officials have long recognised the role of the mass media in disseminating risk and emergency information before, during, and after a catastrophe [32] . The World Health Organization establishes guidelines for ""effective media communication"", through which the authorities are able to disseminate information to the public [33] . Communication during crisis was traditionally understood to be a one-way and top-down process, in which the public are assumed to be ""deficient"" in knowledge, while the scientists, public health experts, and emergency managers, are ""sufficient"" [34] . But this presumption was profoundly challenged by the emergence of social media. For instance, Leung and Nicoll argued that the 2009 H1N1 pandemic was the first pandemic in which social media ""challenged conventional public health communication"" [35] . In China, online messages were published ahead of the official statement in the 2008 Sichuan Earthquake [36] . Social media enabled people under crisis to share information and experience and to seek message credibility and confirmation via multiple media platforms and social networks [34] . Our study demonstrated that official data released by health authorities, whether in Beijing or Geneva, received strong reactions in the Chinese online community. With such knowledge, social media should be incorporated in the best practices for risk and crisis communication [37] . Social media data can also provide health authorities, researchers and the media a quantifiable measure of public attention towards a particular disease outbreak [11] .",29.042320792092674,11.935005886827735

As with curative services, government successfully reduced the cost but maintained the operation of public health services and CDC by encouraging self-sufficiency through the charging of fees for inspections and vertical programs, and there is good evidence of reduced wastage and improved productivity and efficiency in this regard (34) . However, again there were problems with over-servicing of facilities who could afford the fees and ignoring weaker ones with greater problems. In food safety, this was shown by the rising incidence of hepatitis, typhoid and paratyphoid from 1979 to 1988 (19) . Public preventive health activities (public goods without direct benefit to consumers) that were not profitable were often neglected or ignored; fees were even charged for vertical disease control programs (such as those against TB and schistosomiasis) despite national targets indicating their priority in the 7 th and 8 th five-year plans (7), an acknowledgement of the reliance on their implementation by staff whose participation could only be guaranteed with a financial incentive (or who charged fees regardless of services being notionally free). New charges for specific activities such as vaccination, control of schistosomiasis, TB, leprosy and also MCH reduced their uptake and impact. However, rather than cancel vaccination fees, the government introduced an immunization insurance scheme to counter falling coverage (apparently with good effect) (15) , and fees for routine vaccination were only officially banned in 2007; the sale of optional vaccines (including several of the new vaccines recommended by WHO) remains a significant source of income for CDCs in China. Decentralisation of social service funding resulted in differential services according to counties' and townships' ability to fund them and the level of prioritization of public health by local authorities. Vertical lines of communication and control of the health system by health authorities also weakened (19) . Administration of township health services gradually devolved from county to township governments, and the township health facilities divided into clinical and preventive sections, with separate funding, revenue and reporting streams (15) . Most EPSs reported to local government rather than to higher levels within the health hierarchy, exacerbating the politicization of data and probability of its desensitization. Local government was usually more concerned with economic than social indicators, and disinclined to report bad news like disease outbreaks.

What would be the external costs of the abolition of the alcohol tax? Can we observe any changes in crime, homicide, domestic violence, suicide, and productivity losses associated with the consumption of alcohol? More fundamentally, even if the abolition of the tax on alcohol would bring economic benefits, what would be the gains and losses in government revenue and what are the opportunity costs foregone? What would be the long-term public health implications and resultant social costs of such a policy? In terms of the provision of public goods, would the economic benefits of the abolition of the alcohol tax adequately compensate for this? How are the economic benefits distributed in Hong Kong society to justify such a sacrifice in terms of public health? Would the profits earned be concentrated in the hands of a few companies that only profess verbally to have Hong Kong's interests at heart? From a regional perspective, to what extent does the transformation of Hong Kong into a wine hub affect alcohol use in neighboring areas in Asia and Mainland China? Does the regional public health community follow the impact and prepare other countries to anticipate similar industry initiatives since Hong Kong provides an excellent industry playbook?

Indeed, most high-mortality mycoses remain ignored by public health authorities and decision-makers. The financial support for fungal disease research is incredibly lower than the funding available for other infectious diseases that cause similar mortality [19, 20] . For instance, for each human individual dying from malaria, US $1,315 are invested in research and development.

These concepts should underpin the investigation of the extent to which bat virus spillover events are recognized by a range of groups and how diagnosis and public health responses are shaped by institutional factors and health care workers' practices. From socio-epidemiological perspectives, an investigation of how behavioural and socio-demographic factors can predispose people and their domestic animals to spillover infections would be very valuable. Relevant biomedical syndromes must be considered alongside enquiry regarding the extent to which zoonotic disease risk is recognized by local people and features in their concepts of illnesses and perceptions of relevant causes of morbidity and mortality.

To obtain an estimate of the cCFR, the lesson from the SARS outbreak is that a statistical technique is required that corrects the underestimation, e.g. a technique addressing censoring [8, 11, 12] . Nevertheless, in the case of novel S-OIV, an early unbiased estimation of the cCFR has appeared particularly challenging. Initial reports from the government of Mexico suggested a virulent infection, whereas in other countries the same virus was perceived as mild [13] . In the USA and Canada there were no deaths attributed to the virus in the first 10 days following a declaration of a public health emergency by the World Health Organization. Even under similar circumstances at the early stage of the global pandemic, public health officials, policy makers and the general public want to know the virulence of an emerging infectious agent. That is, a simple method for assessing cCFR is called for, even when only a few deaths have been reported, or even when there has been no report of deaths. Except for another unbiased cCFR estimate in Mexico (0.4%, range 0.3-1.5%) [1] , this early assessment has been missing.

Health policy makers in Arab countries should identify gaps in public health research and allocate funds to carry out studies to fill these gaps. It is hoped that such a study will serve those who draw future plans regarding public health to direct research into research areas mostly needed based on the changing political and social atmosphere in the Arab world.

International publications should be directed toward making serious and common health problems in Arab countries more visible to internal and external audience in order to take an action by those in the authority.

Investing in more international and national collaborative research projects should be highly encouraged. One potential method to broaden such international cooperation is through academic scholarships, exchange visits of graduate students as well as investigators. Establishing national specialized institutions for public, environmental and occupational health at the level of the entire Arab world is helpful and will make cooperation, even among Arab countries themselves, stronger and better.

Efforts to fix the ""broken"" system have involved cutting costs and services, limiting clinicians' ability to practice, or giving patients too much or too little care, without attention to outcomes.",23.583475935856832,11.296021821042016

Such shared awareness reflects the multiple and complex drivers behind health problems. In reference to the social determinants of health identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) commission (13), social drivers for integrated approaches include lack of participation, cohesion, and welfare, as well as the presence of ignorance, poverty, poor governance, inequality, violence, mental and physical illness, or high risks for these. Environmental drivers include climate change, land degradation, reduced biodiversity, and ecosystem changes rooted in both natural phenomena and human actions. Economic drivers are mostly related to the globalization process, dominated by market deregulation and financial capital, and largely irrespective of social needs at the local level (14, 15) . In this context, the capacity of nations to support public health services and welfare has been progressively eroded and the increasingly scarce resources require enhancement of inter-sectoral synergies, establishment of adequate governance structures, and effective achievement of multiple outcomes simultaneously. Human, animal, and plant populations are affected in many different ways by this process, potentially further widening the gap in human's access to health and welfare. These examples are by no means exhaustive, and there is clearly an interplay between different drivers. For example, globalized trade agreements may lead to land acquisition by large multinational companies, thereby creating land shortages for local populations who are pushed to intensified extraction of available natural resources. Increased poverty in conjunction with close contact to previously unexploited environments puts human and animal health at risk (16) . At the same time, economic crises and financial deregulation reduce public resources for interventions, thereby reinforcing negative environmental, economic, and social drivers and exacerbating negative health outcomes (17) .",26.498388825705835,12.692754050689853

At the same time as the literature on the ethics of pandemic responses and preparedness continues to grow, the One Health approach to EIDs has received little formal ethical consideration. Even the most ethically attuned existing frameworks for biosecurity and infection prevention and control provide only general operational principles that do not guide actions in times of uncertainty. If One Health is to be meaningful − let alone successful − more attention must be paid to how these different types of knowledge are brought together and brought to public attention. Effective responses to EIDs are likely to be delayed or precluded unless all the socio-political, ethical and legal implications are articulated, publicly debated and − as far as possible − resolved in advance.

The costs of healthrelated goods and services directly affect health by reducing the demand for necessary health care or by increasing consumption of unnecessary care. Leaving people vulnerable to economic barriers therefore would fail to reduce deprivations in health. Additionally, the uncertainty of health need, the catastrophic costs of medical care, and the risk-averse nature of individuals places risk pooling (eg, through insurance) at the centre of health-care financing. 20 An expensive medical event can prevent access to health care or be a primary cause of financial ruin. From a capability point of view, ""protective security"", 14 through health insurance, is a necessary safety net. And the economic burden of health care should be justly shared by all through the redistribution of funds from the well to the ill and the rich to the poor, using progressive financing and community rating. 21 Sixth, one of the most difficult tasks in applying an ethical framework that values health intrinsically is the conceptualisation and measurement of health and inequalities in its many domains. There are many approaches to measuring health equity. As Sudhir Anand and colleagues have shown, 22 the choice depends on numerous considerations, ranging from health domains to the weights attached to those domains. 22 Another consideration is the choice of groups for stratification. 22 Even within the capability perspective, one would need to determine what set of inequality measures would be most appropriate for a given exercise, although certain types of inequality assessment-for example, a goal of complete ""health equality"" (levelling down to lowest common denominator)-have less appeal than others. And certain health equity evaluations-for example, deciding how much priority to give the ""worst-off""-will undoubtedly require public reasoning about values imbedded in the health equity concept. Although the capability view of health does not come down on an exact formula for judging inequalities in health, Sen has noted the potential use of ""partial ordering"" (eg, ordering some alternatives as opposed to ordering them all) of health states for assessing relative inequalities. In a collective exercise, incomplete theorisation may facilitate evaluation in health policy. 15, 16, 23 Incompletely theorised agreements Incomplete theorisation is useful to a theory of health and social justice because it provides a framework for understanding collective decision-making on human goods that are plural and indistinct (such as health and inequality), and allows individuals to take divergent paths to a common, though often partial, agreement. It describes how people with divergent, even opposing, views on health, equity, and health-policy issues might reach agreement in specific situations and thus generate health-policy decisions that are legitimate and stable and reflect mutual respect. 15, 16, 23 The method of reaching agreement described here is called incompletely theorised agreements, developed by Cass Sunstein, 24 and it holds promise for health-policy decision-making at several levels. 15, 16, 23 An incompletely theorised agreement is one that is not uniformly theorised at all levels, from high-level justifications to low-level particulars. It complements and extends the capability approach by providing a framework for operationalising the capability approach at three or more levels. The first level is the conceptual level, which specifies the valuable functionings that constitute human flourishing and health. The second level is the policy level, which specifies policies and laws. The third level is the intervention level, which specifies actions in particular cases and decisions about medical treatments, public-health interventions or social services. This framework constitutes three different types of incompletely theorised agreements: incompletely specified agreements, incompletely specified and generalised agreements, and incompletely theorised agreements on particular outcomes.",25.099162163919104,12.42004776984956

No intervention is without some economic or social cost. If individuals are isolated or quarantined, and there is no support system in place to provide essentials such as groceries and prescriptions, or services such as child care for ill parents of small children, there can be social disruption in addition to extended health effects. Economic protection measures may need to be considered to allow those who are ill to work from home or at least to have some assurance taking sick days will not result in job loss. A variety of consequences must also be considered when closing schools and day care centers or when discouraging public gatherings. Children are at increased risk of influenza transmission in both preschool contacts and school-age contacts. Viboud et al. (2004) found there was also an increased risk in contacts exposed to preschool index patients and school-age index patients compared with those exposed to adult index cases. However, there are substantial economic and social outcomes to school-related measures. If children are not in school or day care, some parents will be unable to work. Parents are also likely to congregate children who have been kept out of school in order to have child care and to provide a diversion for the children, thereby negating the desired social distancing.

The healthcare system, which had been reformed to suit the market economy, 5 faced multiple challenges: limited financial support from governments; high rates of catastrophic out-of-pocket spending and impoverishment through health expenses; inequalities in health and healthcare utilization; and limited financial protection even among those with insurance (a small minority of the population). 6 Due to the above challenges, the old 'three-tiered' hospital system, which involved local neighbourhood hospitals, district-wide secondary hospitals and city-wide tertiary hospitals, was forced to rely on the sales of new drugs and technologies to boost income, which resulted in expensive and inefficient care and strained patientedoctor relationships. 7 The old public health system was the responsibility of dozens of disparate institutes, centres, agencies, bureaus and departments, which resulted in overlapping and sometimes conflicting mission statements and agency mandates. 8 With an increase in life expectancy, increased burden due to chronic diseases, and the challenges of emerging infectious diseases (e.g. severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003), the Chinese Government re-examined the public health infrastructure and saw the need for a new public health system to address the many health issues associated with these changes. 5 To minimize overlapping of functions and to increase efficiency, the Chinese Government consolidated existing institutions into a new agency: the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The goal of the CDC is to provide a central public health organization with responsibility for both community and individual health needs. The development of the CDC strengthened the Government's role in public health. 5 As public health and primary care share the common goal of improving the overall health of specific populations, it was decided to integrate the two systems by strengthening public health functions in primary healthcare settings. This approach could improve local public health surveillance and reinforce disease prevention and health promotion. 9 In order to resolve the problems of the increasing burden of healthcare expenses and limited access to health services, the Chinese Government initiated its CHS programme in 1997. 4 The 'threetiered' hospital system was replaced by the current 'twotiered' CHS centre system. The new system consists of ambulatory care in CHS centres and inpatient care in referral hospitals. 7 The main roles of the CHS centres are to provide high-quality, affordable, accessible primary health care and public health services to community residents.",26.211149776974175,11.838461619366804

Successful teams are created through formulating inter-related goals, identifying measurable outcomes, systematizing routine tasks of care, defining provider tasks and roles explicitly, and providing appropriate training. 27 A document published by the State Council of China in 2006 29 mandated that the allocation rate for medical staff working in the CHS should reach the level of two to three general practitioners and nurses per 10,000 residents, and one public health specialist per 10,000 residents by 2010. In Beijing, the allocation is one general practitioner per 3000 residents, one nurse per 25,000 residents and one public health specialist per 2000 residents. 20 In fact, the above allocation rates have not yet been met, especially since the demand for much of the scope and quality of public health services has increased. In addition, the low levels of CHS providers' knowledge and skills 4 is a major problem. As a result, basic public health services are often only provided in response to patient requests or obvious needs in Beijing; services thus tend to be reactive rather than proactive. It may simply be unrealistic to expect community providers to deliver a comprehensive package of basic public health services along with the many competing demands of providing direct clinical care. 21 In view of the reasons mentioned above, Beijing Municipal Government is planning several programmes to improve the service capabilities of the CHS providers. These include partial changes in the structure, roles and functions of the teams; incentives to attract more medical graduates to work in community settings; redistribution of tertiary hospital doctors to CHS organizations; reemployment of retired doctors in the CHS; and the provision of financial support and opportunities for younger doctors to get better continuing medical education. 4 The roles and experiences of both medical staff and their patients also impact on health promotion activities. The community resident/patient is not a passive participant in the process of receiving basic public health services, and many residents look to providers for guidance and direction in the prevention of diseases. 30 Favourable interaction between providers and patients is critical to the effectiveness and efficiency of the delivery of basic public health services, because in some types of preventive services, the patient's contribution may ultimately be more significant than the provider's role (e.g. weight loss, smoking cessation, reduction of alcohol use, adherence to medical regimen). 30 People with insurance can access other services which are not free of charge in CHS organizations. In fact, people with insurance prefer to visit doctors in hospitals to CHS organizations. In order to attract more people to visit the CHS, CHS organizations are required to supply acceptable services by decreasing drug prices and increasing the proportion of medical reimbursement. 31 Beijing Municipal Government is currently devoting significant funding to publicizing basic public health services in the community by means of various media, and is encouraging residents with common diseases to see general practitioners.",25.230089679274194,10.459251492440334

First, although scholars agreed that while some issues, such as military conflicts and resulting domestic costs and war casualties, attracted intense public attention, public opinion was, in general, considered to be important only in so far it had electoral implications (Potter and Baum 2010; Price and Zaller 1993) . The public was assumed to be more easily manipulated on issues of wars and military crises abroad than on domestic issues, which affected them directly (Domke et al. 2006 ). The need for speed and secrecy in issues of war and military confrontation were often used as justification by policy makers for denying public engagement in foreign policy decision-making. The same rationale, however, cannot be used for policy making on an issue such as infectious diseases. On the contrary, on this issue policy makers consider an active, informed, and engaged public to be important, and public cooperation is actively sought. Infectious diseases are a major source of concern to people and government alike. They are potentially transferable from one person to the other and can cause death and disability, impose high health care costs, lead to loss of productivity, and thereby cause social and economic disruption (World Health Organization 2004) . Due to the transmissibility of infectious diseases and their direct impact on people, any public health intervention, support for surveillance, or policy decisions regarding funding, prevention, and control of global infectious diseases requires the active engagement of the American public. Secondly, on issues of war and military crisis, local actors, including the executive branch of the government, members of the Congress, interest groups, media, and often academia, have traditionally dominated the elite discourse. 3 Challenges arising out of the spread of infectious diseases, however, have put the focus on actors beyond the national states. Intergovernmental organizations such as the United Nations, the World Health Organization, and the World Bank have become increasingly prominent. Many organizations that transcend national boundaries, including multinational corporations, pharmaceutical companies, epistemic communities, and civic society organizations (e.g., Health Action International), have also enriched and participated in the debate on global and national health policies (Walt et al. 2004; Loewenson 2011) . To influence public opinion and enlist support for their proposed policies these organizations emphasize different dimensions of infectious diseases (e.g., human rights and economic and biomedical issues) and frame issues in ways that strategically emphasize their political positions (Nisbet and Lewenstein 2002) . On this issue, therefore, the public is exposed to frames espoused by domestic, transnational, and international organizations.",24.836252825366945,10.958760547556103

Clearly, this definition could overlap with other concepts, but, for the purposes of this paper, public health is considered a subset of population health, and PHT as a subset of eHealth technologies. 14 Population health technology focuses on technologies that improve health on a population level rather than in an individually focused, medical care context. Thus, PHTs typically emphasize preventive, behavioral, environmental, social, and systems-oriented interventions rather than medically oriented ones. Although related terms, such as ""consumer health informatics"" and ""public health informatics"" might encompass some aspects of PHT, these terms focus primarily on information technology (IT) and, in many cases, solely on software applications (Table 1) .

Recent Findings Emerging and reemerging infectious diseases account for significant losses in not only human life, but also financially. There are a number of contributing factors, most commonly surrounding human behavior, that lead to disease emergence. Zoonoses are the most common type of infection, specifically from viral pathogens. The most recent emerging diseases in the USA are Emergomyces canadensis, the Heartland virus, and the Bourbon virus. Summary In addition to the aforementioned pathogens, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Nipah virus, New Delhi metallo-ß-lactamase-1 Enterobacteriaceae, Rift Valley Fever virus, and Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever virus are reviewed. These pathogens are very concerning with a high risk for potential epidemic, ultimately causing both significant mortality and financial costs. Research should be focused on monitoring, prevention, and treatment of these diseases.",24.10983179968118,9.9885168575896

Handbook of Stem Cells Volume 2 Stem Cell-based Products in Medicine: FDA Regulatory Considerations,"The experience of the cell therapy community can also play a key role in shaping the FDA recommendations that pertain to regulation of cell therapy products. The experience of stem cell manufacturers is communicated in meetings with the FDA staff, at presentations at scientific meetings, and at presentations to the FDA's BRMAC. BRMAC meetings allow the FDA to obtain advice in a public forum on scientific issues that affect stem cell experiments. This format allows all interested parties to participate. Transcripts of these meetings are available on the CBER Web site (http://www.fda.gov/cber/). The BRMAC's advice on issues such as characterization of neuronal stem cell therapy products has been valuable as the CBER staffs develop stem cell policy. 1 Another important resource that facilitates development of recommendations for regulation of stem cells involves the FDA-National Institutes of Health (NIH) interagency interactions through formalized Memoranda of Understanding Agreements (MOUs) that allow bidirectional input on translational research. The FDA benefits from the scientific expertise of NIH program managers and intramural scientists, and the NIH benefits from the FDA scientific perspectives on important funding initiatives to expedite translation of research from bench to bedside. For example, under the MOU, the NIH can involve FDA expertise in Request for Application (RFA) design for translational research. In addition to these MOUs, there is increasing participation by the FDA in expert advisory panels that develop recommendations for NIH translational research programs. These feedback mechanisms serve the FDA-regulated community, the NIH-funded research community, and the public by focusing scientific and funding resources on developing novel technologies such as stem cell use to address challenges to public health.",23.32809901714739,8.950463098467845

Because many ordinary citizens were inattentive to international affairs and foreign news, public opinion about foreign policy issues often was activated through elite discourse (e.g., policy-making elite and opinion leaders) and by the media (Page 1996) . Extensive research has shown that the media is most able to activate opinion when these elite debates are presented as ""frames"" to which people are particularly receptive and which seem to have an impact on people's lives (Powlick and Katz 1998) . The concept of ""framing"" and ""framing effects"" has been studied widely in the social sciences (Scheufele and Tewksbury 2007; Scheufele 2006) . Studies of agenda setting and framing as developed in research on social movements, communication, and foreign policy all suggest that public opinion may be shaped by the way in which an issue is framed (Gamson and Modigliani 1987) . Framing may be seen as an attempt by leaders and other actors to insert into the policy debate-organizing themes that will affect how the public and other actors such as the media will perceive an issue. 4 Framing effects occur when the media's decision to highlight or emphasize only certain aspects of an issue causes individuals to base their views and opinions on these salient aspects (Gamson and Modigliani 1987) .",21.91606798624873,8.593308476602612

But, Figure 1 does represent the level of protection that, in principle, can be achieved. Moreover, a 90% effective medical response against an attack that hypothetically infects 8000 people, still leaves 800 people infected, which in the case of inhalation anthrax implies close to 800 deaths, a horrific outcome compared to any bioterrorism witnessed to date. This will likely be viewed as an unacceptable outcome. Thus, the tendency will be to strive for medical effectiveness well above 90%. To achieve levels of protection above 90%, it will be very important to implement policies that reduce the percentage of people who do not receive prophylaxis (assumed to be 5% of the exposed population in Figure 1 ) or that do not adhere to the full antibiotic regimen over timeboth of which are important social, as opposed to technical, challenges for a prophylaxis campaign. Finally, it is important to note that this strategy overlaps with efforts to improve public health. Consequently, some of the cost for biodefense will have benefits even if an attack never occurs. Given the low, albeit uncertain, likelihood of a biological attack, emphasizing those biodefense programs and activities that have substantial public health benefits is a prudent way to proceed, although some important biodefense programs will not meet this criterion (e.g., developing an improved smallpox vaccine). Moreover, given that infectious diseases are the leading cause of death in many developing countries, a strategy for coping with bioterrorism that does not address the legitimate public health concerns of the developing world will gain little sympathy, support, or cooperation.

Similarly, a recent qualitative study on Hong Kong SARS survivors [68] showed that stigmatization and discrimination was a pervasive and traumatic experience, a finding which led the author to conclude that anticipations of such social exclusion processes might well endanger the effectiveness of public health measures should there be another major outbreak (see also [69] ). Particularly in the early stages of an outbreak, when people are perhaps anyway more ready to interpret ambiguous respiratory symptoms as indications of ""normal"" flu than of a life-threatening disease, they might thus deliberate and delay, hoping that the symptoms will turn out harmless and go away, rather than take the risk of being prematurely identified as a carrier of a potentially lethal virus. Social risk perceptions such as these could easily cancel out motivating effects of perceived disease risk.

It is possible that the frames on Twitter are influenced by the frames set by the mainstream media. For instance, Lee and Basnyat 21 studied media framing of the 2009 H1N1 outbreak in Singapore and suggested that although traditional media predominantly used the update frame and prevention frame throughout the break, their use of frames diversified to some extent in the later stages of the crisis to include more personal frames and social frames. Our semantic network shows that traditional news media (eg, CNN, CBS, Reuters, and AP) featured prominently in the discussion about the measles outbreak. Future research could examine the intermedia agenda setting process between traditional news media and social media in covering and framing public health crises associated with EIDs to see if Twitter frames are influenced by the frames used in the traditional news media or if the public may influence the frames used by traditional news media through voicing their concerns and opinions in Twitter. The other possible explanation for the changes in the use of frames is psychological. According to the psychometric paradigm, people's response to a risk is decided by the dread, catastrophic potential, controllability, and familiarity of said risk. 22 It is possible that during the early stages of a measles outbreak, the public is unsure about the seriousness of the risk and the controllability of the outbreak and therefore prefers the update frame and the public health frame. These 2 frames provide information that can help the public assess the scale and severity of the crisis. However, as the outbreak develops, people perceive the risks associated with measles as more familiar and more controllable. As a result, they start to try to make sense of the crisis by deciding whom they should blame for the outbreak, thereby leading to the increased use of the vaccine frame, which blames parents who refuse to vaccinate their children, as well as the political frame, which blames illegal immigrants or the government for the outbreak. Through surveys, future research could establish the relationship between social media users' risk perception and the frames they apply in discussing EIDs. The high frequencies of the political frame during the maintenance stage, some of which state that illegal immigrants were responsible for the measles outbreak, also indicates the spread of fake news on Twitter. Recently, Vosoughi, Roy, and Aral 23 found that false news stories spread further, faster, deeper and more broadly on Twitter than truthful stories. Compared with truth, false news stories only took one-sixth of the time to reach 1,500 people and were 70% more likely to be retweeted. These findings have particularly important implications for health care professionals during infectious disease emergencies.

Finally, when increasingly restrictive measures were imposed on smoking in public settings, the central justification was that passive smoking was pathogenic and responsible for deaths associated with cancer and heart disease. it was almost never asserted that limits on advertising, increases in taxes and restrictions on public smoking were necessary to protect those who might begin to smoke or those who were smokers. as a result of changing social norms and public policies, the prevalence of smoking by adults in advanced democracies has declined markedly in the past 40 years. a steep social gradient has also emerged: those better educated smoke less; those with poorer education comprise an ever-greater proportion of smokers. under these social conditions, it has become increasingly possible to assert that the aim of restrictive public health policy is to pressure, even cajole, smokers to give up their behaviour. tobacco advertising must, where permissible, be banned. taxes must make the price of cigarettes increasingly prohibitive. limits on public smoking are necessary to make it more difficult for smokers to find a place where they can light up.",23.644459458803656,11.508323421493602

Five factors are fuelling the tension between the supply and demand for high quality health information. First, the need for greater accountability and transparency from governments and international agencies is increasing the demand. Civil society groups, the donor community, scientists, and the public want to benchmark progress and performance of public health and medicine. An important example of this tendency is the emphasis on monitoring, including the health-related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 1,2 and the creation of the Healthcare Commission in the UK to independently monitor the National Health Service (NHS). 3 Second, the media, civil society, and the general public are more sceptical about both statistical and scientifi c claims. 4 An example is the public dismay about the confusing messages on fat in the diet over the past two decades. 5 Evidence of government manipulation of data during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic added to the decline in trust. 6 Third, many representatives of the technical and scientifi c community and the general public are becoming increasingly sophisticated consumers of information. The scope of relevant information is expanding from simple descriptive epidemiology about health to dimensions of public health and medicine such as quality, effi ciency, and equity.

Such measures always require that we address questions of whether the health threats, their severity and transmissibility all justify depriving individuals of their liberty. these questions cannot be answered without confronting the tension between the interests of the individual and those of the collective. if SarS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) taught us anything, it was how difficult it is to make such decisions in the face of uncertainty. it might turn out in retrospect that the quarantines we impose when faced with a potential epidemic are more extensive than necessary. But in the face of an evolving threat, public health officials have no choice but to weigh personal liberty against potential grave threats (gostin et al, 2003). t o this point i have focused on infectious diseases, which compel us to address the powers of public health when there is a direct risk or a potential risk to third parties. But the scope of public health in industrial and post-industrial societies extends to chronic diseases (Knowles, 1977) . Many such conditions involve lifestyle choices; patterns of behaviour which, in the first instance, harm oneself. What is the legitimate role of the state in modifying, discouraging, burdening or even prohibiting behaviours that increase both morbidity and mortality? at stake here is the question of paternalism. is it appropriate for the State to impose restrictions on competent adults in order to protect them from harming themselves? those who are inspired by the tradition of John Stuart Mill answer with a resounding 'no'. they claim that public health officials can educate and warn, but not compel. as these ideas have gained wide influence, advocates of public health often need to assert that they intervene because the social consequences or negative externalities of certain behaviours warrant intervention; thus, self-regarding harms are transformed into other-regarding harms. in any event, the state seeks to use its authority to change individual behaviour. two examples will illustrate this point. it has long been known that wearing helmets Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; www.cdc.gov).",24.25863518079312,10.599996948401797

However, in the decade since the adoption of the IHR it has been clear that tensions continue to exist between global cooperation and national sovereignty. Although 86 WHO arguably has a global leadership role in coordinating responses to global public health emergencies, its limited powers and limited funding hamper effective responses, and reform of WHO has been part of the recommendations of recent expert review committees. 95 In terms of WHO's powers, as James Hodge has noted, 'In reality, WHO lacks comprehensive, enforceable legal powers to require member states to do much of anything beyond what their leadership agrees to undertake voluntarily'. 96 Although WHO has established a Contingency Fund for Emergencies, 97 the willingness of Member States to provide support for the Fund in the longer term remains to be seen. What is clear is that without funding to support its emergency response capacities, and in the absence of enforcement mechanisms, WHO will continue to be hampered in its emergency response, despite expectations for WHO to take a more operational approach in its responses to global public health emergencies. 98 Article 43 of the IHR requires that any additional health measures introduced by countries in response to either a specific public health risk or a public health emergency of international concern should be no more restrictive or invasive 'than reasonably available alternatives that would achieve the appropriate level of health protection' 99 and be based on scientific principles; available scientific evidence about risk; and any guidance or advice from WHO. 100 Despite these requirements, there were some cases of the use of travel restrictions during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic 101 and more recently during the outbreak of Ebola in West Africa in 2014 with the Interim Ebola Panel Report noting that: during the Ebola outbreak, more than 40 countries implemented additional measures that significantly interfered with international traffic, outside the scope of the temporary recommendations issued by the Director-General on the advice of the Emergency Committee. As a result, the countries affected faced not only severe political, economic and social consequences but also barriers to receiving necessary personnel and supplies.

Public health is divided into the staple pillars of assessment, policy development, and assurance. 3 All three of these pillars are interdependent and cyclical. Two functions address the issues of assessment: (1) monitor health and (2) diagnose and investigate. Under policy development are the functions (1) inform, educate, empower; (2) mobilize community partnerships; and (3) develop policies. The following functions define assurance: (1) link to and/or provide care, (2) ensure a competent workforce, and (3) evaluate. 3 Like traditional programs in public health, ranging from maternal and reproductive health to injury control and prevention, the public health response to disasters also fulfills the same basic tenets of assessment, policy development, and assurance. This chapter introduces the reader to how public health integrates into disaster preparedness and response systems by highlighting some specific subjects relevant to those tenets.

The recent unexpected introduction of West Nile virus and the SARS-coronavirus to North America from abroad starkly illustrated the ability of large infectious disease outbreaks rapidly to overwhelm primary and public health systems in industrialized countries, with severe economic consequences [154, 155] . In the past several decades there has been a withdrawal of financial support for public health systems. Critical infrastructure support for public health initiatives is inadequate at best, and vital technology, such as computer information systems needed to establish communication networks for disease prevention, has not been put in place [156] [157] [158] . Existing public health infrastructure could be readily overwhelmed in many parts of the world for a number of reasons besides new infectious disease threats. Population mobility due to rapidly changing conditions in the world (eg, ongoing conflict, natural disasters) can also easily overwhelm the existing public health infrastructure. Wars, earthquakes, fires, and floods rapidly cause massive environmental disruption and displacement of large numbers of people from a particular geographic location [159, 160] .

The basic premise of ecological thinking is that human health and their determinants are interrelated, and different determinants of health are leading to different patterns in the burdens of diseases. The world is constantly changing and different approaches for public health have also been adjusted to accommodate the transitional needs of the situations from the conversion of an old public health model to a new public health model, and till recently, an ecological public health model is the ultimate focus of this transitional needs for an attempt to make positive movements and actions to counter these multiple influences of our health arising from those of ecological determinants. WHO (1947) defined that BHealth is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity.^However, this definition of health has received much criticism over the years and considered to be inadequate to capture variations in health, as health is dynamic and changes from time to time and with multiple dimensions (Sharma and Atri 2010) . In fact, many literatures also revealed different dimensions for the health concept in areas such as physical health, mental health, social health, environmental health, spiritual health and emotional health (Ananth 2008) . Concepts of health are indeed defined in much broader sense, especially there are different meanings of focuses that set forth the boundaries in its field of concerns in relation to the particular health issues and/or determinants per se. This paper discusses more focuses on expanding the boundary in the concepts of health with emergence of complicated factors involved as our understandings developed through the correlations of these complex systems towards the twenty-first century in ecological public health developments, regarding the ecological determinants of health in conjunction with the harmful consequential effects of humaninduced disturbances to our environments and food systems, together with the burdens from ecosystem disruption, environmental hazards and loss of ecosystem functions.",24.52160742097594,9.259225562460463

Instead, the issue is whether institutional resources are adequate to ensure the safe and secure conduct of DURC, especially at a time when many research institutions face increasing financial stress related to the conduct of research. While those stresses are a function of several trends that apply generally to federal funding, they have clear implications for DURC: (i) decreasing levels of funding for biomedical research over the past decade, in actual dollars and as a percentage of the federal budget, and (ii) an inexorable increase in federal regulations since 1991, the year when the current cap on administrative costs on federal awards was established, that exacts a cumulative financial burden for regulatory compliance.

Standard-Times senior correspondent Steve Urbon describes such temporary quarantine powers, ""Civil rights activists in some cases have objected to people being rounded up, stripped and showered against their will. But Capt. Chmiel said local health authorities have 'certain powers to quarantine people.'"" 46 Political, economic, social, and ethical issues are always being raised by these strategic measures. Individual rights have often been trampled in the name of public good. The liberty of outwardly healthy persons from lower classes has frequently been violated by isolating or segregating persons suspected of being infected. Marginalized groups of different ethnicities and races have been stigmatized and discriminated against. Quarantine has a line of continuity from the time of plague to the influenza A pandemic in 2009. 46 During plague and cholera outbreaks, the fear of discrimination and mandatory quarantine pushed the lowest social class and minorities to flee from affected areas. This contributed to a more rapid and wider spread of the disease as this regularly occurred in towns affected by deadly disease outbreak. In this global world, the fear caused by mass media can spread the disease farther and faster, playing a larger role than in the past. Entire populations or segments of populations are at the risk of being stigmatized. In the light of new challenges posed by twenty-first century that can lead to the spread of infectious diseases, quarantine, along with other public health tools, retains importance for public health preparedness. Vigilant attention is required to avoid the intolerance and injustice while implementing these measures. Regular, transparent, and comprehensive communications should be used to gain the public trust. Valuable lessons from the past must lead to successful responses to public health emergencies. 46 ",28.117663895461487,12.425426507374379

The language of human rights is increasingly part of the landscape for health law in Australia and a See, for example, Public Health Act 1991 (NSW) s 23. internationally. [43] [44] [45] Given the potential for public health laws to impact upon the freedom of individuals, and the need for public health laws to balance the interests of individuals and society, public health laws will ideally have a transparent ethical framework, articulating the principles upon which state intervention will be premised. 46 The World Health Organization has acknowledged the importance of legal and ethical considerations to pandemic preparedness, noting that public health measures such as quarantine, compulsory vaccination and off-licence use of medicines 'need a legal framework to ensure transparent assessment and justification of the measures that are being considered, and to ensure coherence with international legislation (International Health Regulations)'. 47 Consideration of ethical issues is also essential for, as the World Health Organization has noted, ethical issues 'are part of the normative framework that is needed to assess the cultural acceptability of measures such as quarantine or selective vaccination of predefined risk groups'. 48 The exercise of state powers in terms of quarantine, isolation and detention during a public health emergency is likely to be particularly controversial in Western liberal democracies such as Australia. The extent to which the state can and should exercise its powers in this area has become increasingly relevant in public health, as is clear from debates over detention of tuberculosis patients, 49, 50 and from the use of quarantine during the SARS crisis. 51 Although comparable countries to Australia in Europe, the USA and Canada all have human rights charters or equivalents, which could provide procedural protections and safeguards for citizens in relation to quarantine and detention, Australia has yet to develop a Bill of Rights at the federal level. While Australian state and territory governments have begun enacting human rights legislation, 52 there is no comprehensive inclusion of human rights safeguards in the federal Quarantine Act, which raises issues about the mechanisms for ensuring procedural safeguards in the event of a pandemic. 53 Public health measures directed at implementing social distancing, quarantine or travel restrictions will not only infringe on individual liberties that are often taken for granted in Western societies, but are also likely to have a profound economic impact. As outlined above, estimates indicate that pandemic influenza will have a significant impact on the global economy. At local level, businesses may be closed or experience a reduction in their cash flow as public health measures are introduced or people stay home voluntarily. In such an environment, the economic cost to individuals and businesses may be significant, which in turn demands consideration of development of support systems and compensation systems for those affected. 54 In the USA, a great deal of work has been done on strengthening the public health laws, both generally and specifically for public health emergencies. The Turning Point Public Health Statute Modernization National Collaborative developed the Turning Point Model State Public Health Act. 55 In 2001, the Centre for Law and the Public's Health at Georgetown and Johns Hopkins Universities prepared a Model State Emergency Health Powers Act, setting out the powers for a state of public health emergency. The provisions of the earlier Model State Emergency Health Powers Act were adapted and included in the Turning Point Model Act. 56 Article V of the Turning Point Model Act deals with the powers of public health authorities, including the powers of quarantine and isolation. The Model Act provides that the principles to be applied in relation to quarantine and isolation include that they should be by the least restrictive means necessary to prevent the spread of disease (s 5-108[b](1)).

What is clear is that public health rights and responsibilities for infectious disease are global as well as national. If we are to assess the adequacy of our legal frameworks for pandemic preparedness, we also need to assess the adequacy of our laws in terms of their suitability for meeting our international obligations. While developed countries of the world already have sophisticated public health systems, the capacity to meet their obligations under the IHR (2005), and the financial resources to develop national vaccine stockpiles, the developing countries of the world face a very different outlook. 57 As we consider the intersections of law and public health in the context of the shared global risks of an influenza pandemic, it is important to realize that pandemic preparedness must necessarily involve improved international cooperation and the sharing of expertise to assist in capacity building for public health and the regulatory frameworks surrounding it, as well as a renewed dialogue around international obligations to help the world's poorest and least healthy people. 58 Legal analysis must be a key part of our planning for pandemic influenza. It is essential that federal and state laws are harmonized so as to ensure their smooth functioning and to eliminate crossjurisdictional differences and uncertainties. Public health laws also play a key role in setting out the rights and responsibilities of individuals, communities and governments, providing transparency and accountability to the frameworks for decision-making.

With SARS, external efforts to elicit cooperation in targeted countries had to operate without a powerful international institution. The WHO is no IMF. It does not have the Fund's demanding agenda for reform, high level of support from key states, or leverage as gatekeeper of resources. The WHO lacked the authority to require member countries to take steps to contain SARS. Member states' diseasereporting obligations extended only to a few listed illnesses. WHO provisions on international travel were inadequate, weakly balancing limits on states' latitude to impede commerce and mobility with their need for authority to take the drastic exclusionary measures that SARS seemed to require. 8 Initially unable to move Beijing to grant its teams access to affected areas, the WHO precious weeks in its mission to understand SARS' origin and spread. PRC opposition confined the WHO to dealing with Taipei indirectly, through the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, until Beijing finally acquiesced to the WHO's sending a mission to Taiwan. Amid what some saw as implausible reported patterns of infection in China, worries arose that the WHO was being fatally restricted by PRC authorities. 9 The WHO has, however, escaped the resentment, charges of disregarding national sovereignty, condemnation for pursuing an inappropriate agenda with little regard for its consequences, and accusations of serving as the agent of Western domination that dogged the post-Asian financial crisis IMF. WHO assistance has been welcome or at least tolerated in several SARS-affected places, and its advice continues to have widespread credibility. But the lack of ire at the WHO also reflects the organization's inability to impose its will on states. SARS focused attention on international public health threats that can be as dangerous as the illiberal trade policies and irresponsible monetary policies that the WTO and IMF police. It prompted modest steps to create a more institutionally robust international public health structure and accelerated a long-term project to strengthen the WHO. WHO has acquired new powers to report promptly on disease outbreaks based on unofficial information and is also gaining clearer authority to issue global health alerts (as it did for SARS) and send teams to assess member states' measures to contain international health threats. 10 Such changes do not, however, portend an international public health regime resembling the international trade and monetary regimes. As the IMF's and WTO's histories make clear, states do not easily achieve the levels of cooperation, willingly provide the resources, or lightly undertake the cessions of sovereignty necessary to create such strong institutions. Any international response to a recrudescence of SARS or new public health threats will have to rely, for the foreseeable future, on a weak WHO and ad hoc multilateral cooperation.",25.53107815493719,10.68194099792194

Decentralization would shift power away from the administrative center, typically in the urban capital, and disrupt problems which cronyism and patronage wrecked in terms of hiring, concentration of personnel, and flow of financial resources.

This conceptualization of the new public health is informed by Michel Foucault's work on power, which views the state as governing through laws, language and knowledge in its definition of normalcy for the subjects of the state, where regulation is not directly performed by the state, but where individuals are called upon to regulate themselves (Petersen and Lupton, 1996; Armstrong, 1995a) . In public health, experts assist in the process of self-governance, by offering an enlightened perspective in health-promoting advice and endorsing social institutions that promote 'healthy' lifestyles and choices. Individuals are expected to engage in self-regulation based on these directives; however, in this process, there is insufficient recognition of the potential for differences in ability to conform to directives, the social cost of participation and the consequences experienced for those who do not participate. The role of experts is essential to the new public health, because it represents the dominance and pervasiveness of scientific knowledge in the rational-legal governance of the body in Western societies. In this vein, Brown and Duncan (2002) note 'the discursive practices of the 'new' public health [represent] new forms of governance, regulations and social controly[that] serves to legitimize ideologies and social practices by making statements about how individuals should conduct their lives' (p. 364).",32.169211051637674,12.545106783629617

This is founded on an understanding of public health as an essentially moral enterprise that provides directives on the way we should live our lives both individually and collectively (Petersen and Lupton, 1996) . Furthermore, a discussion of the role of risk discourses during the SARS outbreak connects to this section by addressing the more tacit element of morality within the public health system. From the very definition of risk follows the obligation to minimize risks and purify people and places, and by extension the distinction between 'clean' versus 'dirty' or 'good' versus 'bad'. Several Canadian researchers assert that public health campaigns that target activities and conditions such as smoking and obesity reflect the underlying social values that certain behaviours are harmful to the morality of the population (Robertson, 1998; Fischer and Poland, 1998; Bercovitz, 2000) .

Within the hospitals, there were a number of situations where health workers were criticized for minor breaches in safety procedures (Naylor et al., 2003) . The emphasis on the individual's responsibility to minimize others' exposure to risk throughout the SARS outbreak disregarded the reality that abilities and inclinations to control behaviours affecting exposures to risk were not homogeneous throughout the entire population. In this case, the individual was responsible for self-surveillance and identifying one's self as a 'risk' to the rest of the population and consequently adhering to quarantine measures and other directives identified by public health officials. This was encouraged by a number of surveillance measures including voluntary quarantine measures, and involved a clear stigmatization of those who were unwilling or unable to adhere to the safety protocol. The necessity for compliance to identified protocol was consistently emphasized throughout the SARS outbreak, with the media announcing failures to comply, public health workers regularly calling the homes of those in quarantine (sometimes once or twice per day) to ensure compliance, and in some cases the assignment of court directives forcing compliance (Basrur et al., 2004) . Those who were unwilling to comply were at times openly reprimanded by public health officials. Members of one Toronto high school that was closed due to the mass quarantine of 1,500 students and staff into their homes faced harsh warnings from Ontario's commissioner of public health were they not to follow quarantine regulations, as he threatened to impose fines or lock violators in hospitals with guards at the door (Gostin et al., 2003) .",26.67490696701169,11.69490964340633

The distinction between an 'at-risk' versus 'safe' population in public health programmes can function to (further) marginalize groups associated with risk-taking behaviours (Fischer and Poland, 1998) . The call to increase the efficiency of surveillance and diagnostic systems reflects a constructed need to control populations to prevent the further spread of disease. The creation of categories of risk through the management of risks in public health strategies can be interpreted as serving as a technique for governance and consequently perpetuates a form of governance that is implemented through mechanisms of exclusion and social control (Fischer and Poland, 1998) . Such control of spaces and people through their identification as at-risk is vital to the maintenance of hegemony, as the fragility of spontaneous consent is accentuated by displays of 'deviance' within society.

This theoretical analysis of public health is supplemented by empirical research concerning the Canadian experience of SARS in 2003. The data were collected principally from the federal report published by the NACSPH (Naylor et al., 2003) but were also drawn from reports prepared by the Ontario Expert Panel on SARS and Infectious Disease Control (Walker et al., 2003) and a second provincial committee referred to as the SARS Commission (Campbell, 2004) . In addition, the analysis was supplemented with data from local and national newspaper articles focusing on the SARS outbreak. On this basis, we argue that (through the specific context of the SARS outbreak) the current composition of public health establishes an institutional backdrop in which processes of differentiation (and subsequently marginalization) can occur.

Many old and new public health measures were implemented at local, national and global levels, in an attempt to control the outbreak of the disease. Among these, surveillance mechanisms dominated, which involved new epidemiological techniques and statistical profiling strategies. In this paper, Gramsci's concept of hegemony is used to further understandings of public health governance during the outbreak of emerging infectious diseases. Specifically, the function of the discourse of 'risk' in public health governance is examined, along with public health as a 'moral agent' in the naturalization of specific public health measures. In addition, the pervasive discourse of 'security' is discussed in relation to current public health practices. These characteristics of public health are examined with consideration of their potential for propagating social exclusion and stigmatization of individuals and communities. The specific case of SARS in Toronto is used to examine the implications of public health as a mechanism for social control and reproduction rather than the promotion of equality in health throughout the population.",27.493085576253595,9.349351473257057

Just like critical environmental scholars, critical public health scholars seek to illustrate that the emergence and social patterning of specific public health problems, especially those associated directly and indirectly with the environment, lie in the unequal power relations surrounding the use of, and control of environmental resources and the uneven distribution of the associated costs (e.g. pollution) of environmental activities. The concern here is to broaden the causal basis of the emergence of specific ecosystem-mediated health problems beyond exposure to disease vectors and microbes, to incorporating people-environment power dynamics and how such dynamics result in the exposure of weaker actors to environmental health risks. Explaining health problems from the basis of exposure to microbes and pathogens alone is equivalent to blaming the victim, while relieving important social and political factors that constrain the individual from freely making the decisions to avoid risk in the first place. Similarly, the uneven distribution of the costs of ecological activities and the resulting social patterning of poor health should be examined from the context of how unequal power relations allow powerful actors to displace their environmental costs to weaker actors through such acts as dumping toxic waste in other communities. These communities also are those with limited coping capabilities and have little resources to mitigate the adverse effects of these environmental pollutants.",35.4055982064869,14.466513839471647

An example of a successful approach is the Malawi emergency human resources program, a 6-year training and salaryimprovement program financed by the UK's Department for International Development (DFID). The program aims not only to increase the number of front-line health workers (Malawi has one doctor per 62,000 people) but also to build capacity within the Ministry of Health for better health system management and planning as well as analysis of health data. 61 Trained and paid community health workers who are linked to and supported by the health system can also play a vital role in surveillance, communication, and outbreak-control activities. 62, 63 Training higher-level public health personnel is also important. Pandemic planning requires mathematical modeling of disease and mortality projections and their corresponding impacts on health service utilization, health costs, and other health system process indicators. Such modeling requires epidemiologists and biostatisticians as well as health planners, economists, and administrators. The same people can also perform a wide variety of essential public health tasks, such as monitoring the incidence of priority infectious diseases (e.g., HIV/AIDS) and estimating the impact of seasonal epidemics (e.g., malaria).

The commission's work concluded in 2006 after several years of debate of the issues, although specific recommendations on ways forward were not agreed. Public-health advocates continue to call for WHO to take an assertive stance.

Reductions in smoking and obesity continue to be priority issues. Media coverage of health-related topics is extensive, and is important to promote health consciousness in the public. The sheer volume of information may make it difficult to discern which information is most relevant, and much misinformation appearing on Internet sites can also create trends counter to public health such as refusals to vaccinate children.

Some of those technologies, such as vaccines to prevent infections and antibiotics to prevent their transmission, are used in public health. But public health differs from clinical health care in a number of significant ways. In medicine, it is the interaction between the care provider and the patient that leads to the most ethical issues. In this interaction, medical ethics seeks to protect the autonomy of the patient. In public health, however, most ethical issues arise from the interaction between an agencysuch as a city health departmentand the population it is serving. A public health agency is often protecting some people within a population from others. For example, it may need to isolate an infectious person in order to prevent transmission to others. In so doing, the autonomy of the infected person is constrained in the interest of the community.

A number of online communities have been developed by patient organizations, providers, and nonprofit organizations. Such online communities are virtual forums where patients can discuss their health concerns and exchange information. Participation in online communities heightens levels of emotional wellbeing, perceived control over disease, overall personal empowerment, and level of public awareness and medical knowledge (Wicks et al. 2010 ). The large online population creates a vast network composed of individuals reporting on their activities, their social interactions, and the events around them. These colossal data chunks stream in real time, and are often annotated with context including GPS location, relationships, and images. Extensive data analytics and data mining of social media have been suggested for many applications, such as marketing and financial prediction (Kautz 2013) . Recently, researchers have begun to leverage sensor network for public health: preventing, detecting and fighting infectious diseases. Researchers have shown, for example, that Twitter postings can be used to track and predict influenza (Krieck et al. 2011; Sadilek et al. 2012) . Such work provides evidence that social media can provide data that helps identify early warning for public health threats. Some researchers have explored augmenting the traditional notification channels about a disease outbreak with data extracted from Twitter. By manually examining a large number of tweets, they showed that self-reported symptoms are the most reliable signal in detecting if a tweet is relevant to an outbreak or not.

A more enlightened system would have the costs of collecting, processing, and administering blood borne by the general public, and the prices for blood and blood products regulated by the government. Controlling the costs of transfusion and spreading the expense over the entire population would ease the financial burden on those who are ill and least able to afford this expense. Such a paradigm has been adopted by many other countries and should be incorporated into our health care system. Most other developed countries provide free care and supplies for people with chronic diseases, reasoning that diseases select their targets at random [9] . Also, they negotiate with drug and device makers to reduce list prices. For example, the British National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) is charged with assisting health and social care professionals by providing guidance on delivery of the best possible care based on the available evidence [10] . NICE conducts technology appraisals, publishes clinical guidelines, and performs cost-effectiveness analyses. It utilizes the quality-adjusted life year to measure health benefits; if the benefit is less than a designated threshold for the cost of a new drug or procedure, then the treatment is not recommended. Once the value of a therapy is established, NICE negotiates price with the manufacturer. The costs of drugs in the United States are higher because most other countries apply price controls and we do not; we rely on a competitive marketplace, but the fact is that many pharmaceutical products do not have competitors.",24.179979665674637,9.281713946421199

Even though globally many countries are grappling with common problems, such as increased health needs and demands for healthcare, alongside the rising costs of providing it, there is not one, simple international line of convergence towards a common form of health system. The reason is that health systems are shaped significantly by their centuries-old economic and political regimes. In addi-tion, they take their form from 'national logics', that is, how a society defines and deals with issues of health and illness. Equally, cultural factors influence how populations respond to proposed changes to their health system as well as how those external to a country relate to it. Even so, without undue risk of overgeneralisation, we can point towards a worldwide drive towards the commercialisation of health systems and, where public provision exists, such as in our case example of the UK, to the rollback of state or public provision in favour of the free market principles. Thus, most health systems around the world have or are moving towards a mix of public/private provision. With this point in mind, it has been argued that health services are now as much about investor potential as access to care for patients. Tritter and colleagues maintain that Health systems are no longer important primarily because they ensure that people gain access to health services when in need and irrespective of their ability to pay, that epidemics are prevented or controlled [...] or that the social determinants of health are addressed as part of public policies. In the emerging context of the reform policies, health systems are important not only as providers of products and services for which people are willing to pay, but also as an investment opportunity within global financial markets. (Tritter et al. 2010: 36) Although they manifest in different ways across health systems, we can point to a set of three shared global influences: neoliberalism (see also the discussions on neoliberalism in Chaps. 4 and 6) as the dominant politico-economic policy framework driving system change; macroeconomic policies and structural adjustment programmes (SAPs); and international trade agreements.",27.164545551547455,9.319036208211795

As discussed in Chap. 4, neoliberalism is usually interpreted as a response to the period of structural crisis of the 1970s when, from mid-decade, countries such as the US and UK witnessed lower rates of financial accumulation and growth, rises in unemployment and rising inflation. Neoliberal economic policies encourage financial deregulation and the opening up of trade and investment by resource-rich countries in regions where social conditions afford high returns. Up to the late 1970s, the predominant approach to health improvement globally was to strengthen public health systems, especially access to primary health care. This was the position established by the WHO's influential Alma-Ata Declaration of 1978 which brought about access to healthcare as a human right. The World Bank (WB), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and other agencies rebuffed this position in the 1980s as they established monetarist policies prioritising the achievement of macroeconomic stability by putting constraints on the growth of money supply and public spending. Supranational agencies, such as the IMF, WTO and the WB, have been key players in the spread of global neoliberalism in the health field. Their influence is often indirect comprising the development of trade and investment agreements negotiated at bilateral and multilateral levels and the promotion of market-friendly structures and regulatory reforms.",26.597338158433068,9.188333426903238

So it is of great importance to evaluate optimal methods for controlling these diseases [46] . Historically, quarantine (of individuals feared exposed to a communicable disease) is one of the oldest public health control measures for the spread of communicable diseases. These measures have been successfully applied dating back to the plague epidemic of the 13th century, to the influenza epidemics of the 20th century. More recently, this measure was successfully used to combat the spread of some emerging and re-emerging human and animal diseases, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [18, 25, 29, 33, 54, 60] , foot-and-mouth disease [21] and the 2009 swine influenza pandemic [17] . The SARS outbreaks of 2003 provided an important example of a novel disease that was effectively controlled using quarantine and isolation [18, 25, 29] . Implementing these measures, however, can inflict significant socio-economic and psychological costs. Public health officials need to be able to present comprehensive, understandable assessments of the options to other government officials in a timely manner [37] . For the purpose of this study, quarantine means the removal of individuals suspected of being infected (yet exhibiting no clinical symptoms) from the general population. Thus, these individuals could be asymptomatically-infected or susceptible. On the other hand, isolation refers to the removal of infected individuals exhibiting clinical symptoms of the disease. Although isolation is probably always a desirable public health measure, quarantine is more controversial. Mass quarantine can inflict significant social, psychological, and economic costs without resulting in the detection of many infected individuals [9] . Isolation is primarily used for controlling the disease when it suddenly emerges or reemerges [5] . A successful example is the isolation of those infected with SARS during 2003-2004. However, the disadvantages of this strategy are the difficulty of detecting infected individuals and the cost of isolation.

In developed nations with a strong integrated public health system such as Canada [145, 146] , Australia [147] , Taiwan [27] and several European nations [148] [149] [150] , PHI activities include an emphasis on integrating data and supporting bi-directional communication between clinical and public health services.

According to Lederberg et al, 1 human demographics and behaviors, such as increased population density or individual behaviors (eg, sexual activities, substance abuse), can lead to the emergence of new infectious diseases. Modern medicine has benefited the human race at the price of millions acquiring nosocomial infections in hospitals. Food-borne illnesses, such as those associated with Escherichia coli, are caused by problems in food processing and handling. Economic development and land use can also lead to EIDs. 1 One example is Lyme disease, a bacterium (Borrelia burgdorferi) carried by deer whose population and contact with humans increased with reforestation. The breakdown of basic public health and sanitation can also cause deadly attacks of EIDs (eg, Ebola outbreak in West Africa, cholera outbreak in Haiti). 1 Finally, international travel and commerce spread local EIDs (eg, SARS) across national boundaries. 1 The history of the 21st century is arguably a history of the rise of social media, computer technologies that allow the collaborative creation and sharing of information. Obar and Wildman 4 define social media as services that are based on Web 2.0 technologies and largely rely on user-generated content, by which individuals and organizations create profiles and develop social networks online. According to a recent report of Pew Research Center, the percentage of U.S. adults using social media increased from 7% to 65% between 2005 and 2015. 5 Globally, an estimated 2.34 billion people were social media users in 2016. 6 Health communication researchers and practitioners have recognized the potential of social media in health education and promotion.

They need to do more to control health care costs, especially through coordination between the insurance reform and other reform initiatives. For example, after China's success in insurance expansion, a large share of hospital revenues came from user charges that the three public insurance programs reimbursed. The policymakers may want to use the large amounts of insurance reimbursement as a useful tool for the ongoing hospital reform initiative to push hospitals for improving quality of care, reducing waste and inefficiency, and controlling growth of health expenditures. One option is to tie the insurance programs' reimbursement to hospital performance in improving quality and reducing waste and inefficiency as discussed above. Another option is to reform the insurance programs' provider reimbursement systems by replacing the fee-for-service payment method with prospective methods, such as capitation payment to primary care physicians, diagnosis-groupadjusted payment to hospitals, and bundled payment.

Emergency powers exercised for public health reasons treat citizens as the enemy, and reinforce the philosophy of original public health legislation which classified diseased persons as a public health nuisance to be removed and excluded from society for the benefit of the well. 18 Hong Kong, which has had recent experience of epidemic disease, considered but rejected expanding its Emergency Regulations Ordinance to cover pandemic influenza, concluding that public health powers were sufficient and appropriate to disease control even during a pandemic. n Hong Kong has instead amended its Quarantine and Prevention of Disease Ordinance in the light of its SARS experience. 19 Emergency powers and human rights All Council of Europe member states are party to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and any person whose Convention rights have been violated by a state party can take a case to the European Court of Human Rights. In the UK, the Human Rights Act 1998 brings provisions of the Convention into UK domestic law and enables human rights actions to be brought in a domestic court. Rights with particular relevance to public health powers include Article 2 (right to life), Article 3 (an absolute right to freedom from torture and inhumane and degrading treatment), Article 5 (a qualified right to liberty) and Article 8 (a qualified right to private and family life). In Enhorn v Sweden, 20 a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive man detained by Swedish public health authorities on public health grounds successfully challenged his detention on the grounds that it breached Articles 5 and 8 of the Convention. The European Court of Human Rights held that any detention must comply with the principle of proportionality, there must be an absence of arbitrariness, detention must be a last resort measure, and any detention must have as its objective not only protection of the healthy but also care of the ill. 21 There has been little judicial challenge in British courts of the exercise of emergency powers. In relation to the English Emergency Powers Act and the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act, the courts have played a minimal role, striking down only a handful of emergency measures as ultra vires, usually well after the emergency. More recently, in a case where the British Parliament had sanctioned the indefinite detention of any person not a British citizen and certified as a 'suspected terrorist', and where the Government had derogated from both the European Convention and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) on the grounds that there was a 'public emergency', the House of Lords rejected the Government's assertion that the derogation was consistent with the European Convention. Although the majority of judges declined to question whether there was a public emergency on the grounds that the existence of such an emergency was largely a matter for the Government to determine, they concluded that imprisonment of non-citizens alone was neither proportional, given the equal threat from citizens, nor necessary, and questioned the irrationality of singling out a minority (non-citizens) for special burdens, when members of the majority could present an equal risk. 22 Lord Hoffmann was prepared to consider the notion of an emergency and he found it to be a threat to the 'organised life of the community', which would include not merely a threat to the physical safety of the nation, but also to its fundamental values: 'The real threat to the life of the nation, in the sense of a people living in accordance with its traditional laws and political values, comes not from terrorism but from laws such as these.' 23 The decision suggests a judicial role in overseeing government powers in emergencies.",25.10922393589711,12.007701513035332

In the context of pandemic influenza, it is considered that social measures authorized by law will be at least as important as medical interventions. 3 Evidence from the 1918 influenza pandemic suggests that compulsory home isolation and quarantine were not particularly effective disease control measures because of the difficulty in diagnosing mild cases. Nor were such measures likely to be feasible beyond the initial cases. 4 However, compulsory interventions such as school closures, closure of public places and restriction of mass gatherings, along with disease surveillance and hygiene improvement, have proved effective both in influenza outbreaks and in the SARS epidemic. 5 International and EU instruments require states to undertake such measures, many of which will require a legal underpinning. The requirement of compliance with the revised IHR and the globalization of disease information and exchange have prompted many states to revise their public health laws. Other states, which had no public health legislation, have now enshrined public health laws in legislative form. These initiatives were long overdue. Across Europe, as elsewhere, national public health laws tended to be old, based on flawed science, and to predate contemporary understandings and protection of human rights. 6, 7 The allocation of responsibility for public health practice and the role of the state in regulating private behaviours have very different histories across Europe. 8 Not surprisingly, states have adopted very different positions on the issue of the extent to which constraints can be placed upon individuals for the public benefit. Earlier research on European national public health laws in relation to tuberculosis 9 enabled the identification of four different 'families' of public health legislative models in Europe. These were: authoritarian (the enforcement of a high number of compulsory control measures); moderate (the enforcement of predominantly compulsory control measures without recourse to prevention powers such as compulsory vaccination or population screening); preventive (where compulsory provisions were oriented towards preventive measures, including screening, medical examination and/or vaccination, rather than compulsory treatment or detention); and the laissez faire model, where few or no compulsory measures existed.",27.380725812307293,10.889505665984704

Immigrant populations have long been targeted as carriers of disease, and in relation to diseases such as drug-resistant tuberculosis, increasing incidence in the Western world is often attributed to persons entering from states with high tuberculosis rates. 40 Much contemporary public health policy has rejected the 'fortress' approach to disease control in favour of seeing the public health mandate as imposing duties upon all members of a society or population, 18 or indeed duties of global health protection. The evidence base for border control as a public health, as distinct from a security, measure is limited, especially in a pandemic. 5 In relation to other diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis, border screening has proved to be unreliable and has shown little benefit for the health of the population. 41 Compulsory border screening and refusal of entry to affected persons are contemplated by many states in their pandemic influenza preparedness plans, p and the revised IHR 2005 contemplate that WHO might recommend refusal of entry of suspect and affected persons and refusal of entry of unaffected persons to affected areas, 42 subject to the ethical consideration of respect, to the extent possible, for the individual right to freedom of movement. 43 Article 19 of the IHR requires all signatory states to establish points of entry with surveillance and border control capacities.",26.497446865910643,10.818461607770148

In such cases, detention has been ordered to ensure the patient can be treated, while the emergence of extensive drug resistance among occasional Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates has prompted some authorities to detain patients in extreme circumstances such as prison settings due to anxieties about the ""escape"" into the community of practically untreatable strains [16] . In relation to tuberculosis, detention is both expensive and damaging due to its psychological effect on healthcare workers cast in the role of jailers; it is recommended that other means be found to induce compliance of the patient with medical directions [17, 18] .",24.08773899351558,9.64364676869164

Notably, such textual and visual data through media texts reflect the technology available for producing them, (Garrett & Bell, 1998) and provide a rich source of accessible data that can provide a great deal of information about social meanings projected through language and communication (Bell, 1995) . Obviously, the caveat that all naturally occurring data is produced for a context and purpose applies to newspaper and magazine data. Perhaps, this is even more important to bear in mind given that newspaper reporting is traditionally aligned to certain political affiliations. Newspapers can provide a rich data source for analysis of areas related to health and illness, as this is one of the most commonly reported topics of public interest. One of the popular areas of reporting is that of global public health concerns, such as the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s and more recently the outbreaks of Ebola and SARS. The reporting of such global health conditions has drawn research attention, with researchers exploring the media's representations. Joffe and Haaroff (2002) examined the correlation between the messages portrayed in popular tabloid media relating to the Ebola outbreak in Africa and British people's patterns of thinking in relation to these events. The focus of the analysis was to explore how the people interviewed perceived the crisis as a potential threat to Britain and compared with this with media representations in newspapers. The aim was to examine if media representations of Ebola influenced lay thinking about the disease. Similarly, Washer (2004) examined the way in which UK newspapers presented severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) as a danger to the UK public. This research utilised social representation theory to highlight the mechanisms used by newspapers to report on epidemics of global infectious diseases.",23.99136529927746,8.761885489005381

So-called digital epidemiology has enabled practitioners and researchers to use electronic databases and information to enhance traditional surveillance methods. 5 In 2012, HHS launched its Now Trending developer challenge to create programmes for health departments to monitor social media during an outbreak. The challenge resulted in MappyHealth, a Twitter monitoring programme now being piloted for digital health surveillance around the country, helping offi cials examine real-time events. Digital surveillance was used by public health workers during the infl uenza A H7N9 outbreak to monitor Chinese social media for events, myths, and concerns. 6 Improvements in digital surveillance have also improved public communication. Local health departments that can monitor Twitter can give immediate feedback to correct dangerous mistruths that are contagious on social media. 7 CDC's @CDCEmergency Twitter feed, fi rst established during the infl uenza A H1N1 response, now reaches more than 1·5 million people with emergency health information. During the Japan nuclear disaster response, Twitter was used to correct the dangerous myth that healthy people in the USA should take potassium iodide to prevent harm from radiation. 8 These technological advances have been developed in parallel with diplomatic information sharing advances. WHO's International Health Regulations and multilateral collaborations, such as the Global Health Security Initiative, have provided a framework for international cooperation during public health disasters. Improved capacity and the high priority placed on rapid information sharing led to China's timely reporting in 2013 of clinical and genetic information about infl uenza A H7N9 and early sharing of isolates, by contrast with the response to sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) a decade earlier, when information was slower to emerge. 9,10 Cloud computing allowed for distribution of validated epidemiological and analytical programmes to the global community, while allowing China to share genomic sequences, providing the opportunity for immediate actions to analyse the viral genome and develop vaccine candidates. 6 The Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasure Enterprise was established by HHS to coordinate federal eff orts and build new ways to respond to 21st century health threats-from discovery to deployment. The programme generated a government-wide strategic plan to build all-hazards capabilities and countermeasures throughout federal public health agencies.",27.25318989100329,8.748780275680573

It is not possible to confirm the direction of causality as the correlation could suggest a degree of normalisation whereby laws on compulsory immunisation gradually become part of a cultural norm or, conversely, the legislation could reflect the public's concern to maintain high levels of immunisation coverage and/or to reduce the incidence of particular childhood diseases. Similarly, in relation to trust, the existence of compulsory measures could imply any number of positions on a spectrum ranging from State lack of trust in parents to immunise their children in the absence of compulsion; public trust in the advice of the State (and hence support for compulsion in the belief that not all parents would have their children immunised without such pressure); or it could suggest that the public do not trust the advice of the State and thus have to be forced (by legislation) to comply with State policy.",29.225021873512162,12.792135816921196

Sweden provides an interesting example. The MMR scare was widely reported in the Swedish media and was met with a brief decline in immunisation coverage. However, once the public health authorities provided clear and open information relating to the potential risks and benefits of immunisation, high rates of coverage were quickly restored. This suggests that public trust in public health authorities was largely maintained or secured. Indeed, none of the Swedish focus group participants spoke of fears over vaccine safety. By contrast, where participants spent most of their time debating the relative risks of immunisation versus non-immunisation or where they opposed immunisation on the grounds of safety concerns, this tended to correlate with an expressed lack of trust in the advice and reassurances of the State and public health agencies.",25.393600962316555,11.066463400537218

However, lasting behaviour change is a result of decisions made at the individual level. To facilitate voluntary behaviour change a campaign must appeal to the values and cost-benefit evaluation of each audience group targeted, emphasising near-term salient benefits rather than long-term, abstract, collective benefits. Likewise, veterinary public health messages must be customised in such a way that they are interesting, relevant and captivating to their audience. Messages should be clear, easy to understand and easy to act on. Unless it is easy for people to remember how, when and what to do it is unlikely that a veterinary public health communication campaign will be successful. Social marketing techniques applied to emerging zoonosis communication campaigns have been shown to be effective in crafting health messages that 'speak' to target audiences [6] . Successful communication campaigns are based on systematic planning efforts and on objectives that are attainable, measurable, clear and time-bound. Successful campaigns develop and deliver health messages that are tailored to specific target audiences. Disseminating generic veterinary public health messages widely and increasing knowledge about certain emerging zoonoses issues and healthy behaviours have been shown to be less effective than more targeted efforts. Audience-centred health communication efforts with a consumer perspective are much more effective in motivating target audiences to change their behaviour. This requires designing and delivering messages that are adapted to the needs, perceptions, preferences and situations of the intended audiences rather than the needs and goals of the message designers or institutions. Communicators in veterinary public health practice therefore need to know as much as possible about their target audience(s) in order to stimulate voluntary behaviour change [7] .",23.053131759565193,10.808141729375116

Travel restrictions for these kinds of viruses have been challenged by public health researchers,0.20804006411419743,2.587050199508667,1.774335503578186,78f1a55d-07b0-4e83-aa43-5bd86ca53836,custom_license/Comment 664 www,"We explain our conclusion here. First, under Article 43.2, countries cannot implement additional health measures exclusively as a precaution but must rather ground their decision making in ""scientific principles"", ""scientific evidence"", and ""advice from WHO"". 1 Many of the travel restrictions being implemented during the COVID-19 outbreak are not supported by science or WHO. Travel restrictions for these kinds of viruses have been challenged by public health researchers, [4] [5] [6] and WHO has advised against travel restrictions, arguing they cause more harm than good. 7, 8 Second, under Article 43.1 any additional health measures implemented by countries ""shall not be more restrictive of international traffic and not more invasive or intrusive to persons than reasonably available alternatives"". 1 In this case, even if travel restrictions did work, there are so many other more effective measures that countries can take to protect their citizens. WHO has issued COVID-19 technical guidance on several such measures, including risk communication, surveillance, patient management, and screening at ports of entry and exit. 9 Third, and most importantly, Article 3.1 strictly requires all additional health measures to be implemented ""with full respect for the dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms of persons"", 1 which in turn must reflect the international law principles of necessity, legitimacy, and proportionality that govern limitations to and derogations from rights and freedoms. 10 Under no circumstances should public health or foreign policy decisions be based on the racism and xenophobia that are now being directed at Chinese people and those of Asian descent. 11 Many of the travel restrictions implemented by dozens of countries during the COVID-19 outbreak are therefore violations of the IHR. 12 Yet, perhaps even more troubling, is that at least two-thirds of these countries have not reported their additional health measures to WHO, 12 response to public health emergencies and prevents countries from holding each other accountable for their obligations under the IHR. Some countries argue that they would rather be safe than sorry. But evidence belies the claim that illegal travel restrictions make countries safer. [4] [5] [6] In the short term, travel restrictions prevent supplies from getting into affected areas, slow down the international public health response, stigmatise entire populations, and disproportionately harm the most vulnerable among us. In the longer term, countries selecting which international laws to follow encourages other countries to do the same, which in turn undermines the broader rules-based world order. Effective global governance is not possible when countries cannot depend on each other to comply with international agreements. 13 Of course, the IHR is far from perfect. For example, the IHR only governs countries, not corporations and other non-governmental actors. Thus, some countries are finding themselves with de-facto travel restrictions when airlines stop flying to places affected by COVID-19.",22.547610025009675,10.72656421575984

The findings of our analysis demonstrate the potential for public health agencies to acquire time-sensitive information on rapidly evolving outbreaks occurring outside of their countries through social networking sites. In our analysis, Weibo served as a platform leveraged by central/provincial governments, local news agencies and the public for the timely release and retrieval of information. The Chinese social networking sites' timeliness of reporting are significantly better compared to international mainstream media in English, official websites of the central Chinese government and WHO. Information was released by the local news agencies on the social networking site in the local language before any reports in the conventional news websites or government websites. The information was subsequently amplified by the social networking sites through re-posting of the original report. This allowed the international community greater access to more detailed and timely information compared to that released at the central government level to the international media. The central Chinese government may have allowed the provincial/municipal health authorities to release information on new cases when available to ensure transparency and timeliness of public communications. The access to such timely, crowd-sourced information on infected cases greatly facilitated the understanding of the epidemiology of an unknown disease, which is key in developing effective prevention and control measures. public health practitioners, social media surveillance could provide early warning for unusual public health events in a foreign country and serve as an additional source of epidemiological intelligence to complement conventional surveillance tools. For local public health authorities, social media surveillance could function as an effective platform for public education and social mobilization.

A governance system is needed to prioritise product development according to unmet health needs, and mechanisms that will allow diagnostics, drugs, and vaccines to be developed without an immediate financial reward, but, as conditions might warrant, left on the shelves until the next outbreak occurs, or kept in reserve until bacteria become resistant to first-line therapies.

It was concluded that only when certain conditions applied were they successful in influencing policy, namely: when there was institutional support for solving health problems; when key decision-makers were involved in the design of analyses; and when there was a statutory framework within government procedures for using a HIA. Without these conditions, various bureaucratic evaluation procedures just avoided the issues. Yet HIAs are now becoming as familiar as environmental reviews in some countries. A good example of the way in which health concerns raised by a community obtained crucial institutional support from a city's Public Health Department (PHD) can be seen in the Trinity Plaza proposal in inner city San Francisco in 2003, although it was not technically a HIA. The planning department supported the proposal for the redevelopment of the Trinity Plaza area near downtown in 2003, which involved plans to convert 360 rentcontrolled housing units into 1700 market-rate units in several high rise towers. It ignored the fact that the development was one of the latest gentrification projects that involved a major displacement of low income people who had lived in the area for decades (Corburn 2009 ). The project led to a great deal of community anger and a pressure group to oppose the proposals. The Mission Anti-Displacement Coalition (MAC) created what they called a People's Plan to retain affordable family housing, preserve local jobs and asked for community oversight over land use changes. Fortunately for the community's case the Public Health Department in the city had moved away from only dealing with its traditional biomedical and sanitation focus and started to address the social determinants of health in the city, setting up workshops to learn about community concerns and providing advice about ways of improving areas. This led the PHD to intervene in the Trinity Plaza project on the side of the community, supporting its view that the displacement of the existing residents would cause financial hardship, given higher rents in other locations, and ensure the loss of community relationships and stress to the individuals who would be evicted, leading to increased levels of ill-health from these social determinants. The gradual acceptance of the health consequences of this project eventually led to discussions between the PHD, developers, planners and community activists, which led to a revised proposal in which 12 % of the project would be allocated to below market-rent housing, with existing occupants keeping their homes at current rates. In Corburn's (2009, p. 130) succinct phrase: ""the Department of Public Health had entered the world of urban development and staked-out a new space for human health"". Although there are still problems about the continued gentrification of the Mission area, this San Francisco example provides a useful exemplar of the way in which health issues are being increasingly seen as relevant in planning reviews of new developments, irrespective of whether there is a formal HIA process in the cities.",26.193013107594222,11.040121007497836

Also churches have long had a role in trying to cater for the poor and the disabled. In recent years more active approaches have developed, such as the Communities of Shalom (CS) set up by the United Methodist Churches. Initiated by the Rev Joseph Sprague it has now created hundreds of shalom zones in impoverished areas from its beginning in 1992, training local residents to promote health information and social capital. In many American cities some churches have partnered with public health departments in local universities to create facilities and programmes to improve the health of people in poor neighbourhoods, using trained local volunteers and specialists, such as the Congregations for Public Health in Birmingham, Alabama (CPH). All these examples represent the contemporary equivalents of the settlement houses of nineteenth century cities, designed improve the educational, health and economic prospects of people in impoverished areas, although these were mainly secular, as seen in work of Hull House in Chicago and many other cities (Adams 1910) . Another policy has tried to improve to areas of high disadvantage and ill-health by seeking to reduce concentrations of poor families, such as by scattering, instead of creating, public housing clustering, and by removing families to other locations where there are better facilities and more social mixture (Rubinovitz and Rosenbaum 2000; Comey et al. 2008) .

This part of the course thus addresses issues of priority setting in a public health context, focusing especially on allocative decision making in a public health emergency situation, such as provision of ventilators following an outbreak of pandemic influenza. More broadly, it is important to examine the ethical principles which might underpin such priority setting, one especially interesting illustration of these being the 'social values' which NICE uses to inform the public health guidance issued to those working in the NHS, local authorities and the public and voluntary sector in England. 60 Teaching, researching and assessing Establishment of a course in a relatively unexplored field such as this offers particularly attractive possibilities for maximizing the potential of the relationship between teaching and research. Given the likelihood that external assessments of research achievement and attendant funding consequences will continue to shape the teaching environment, it is vital to remember the benefits of both teaching one's research and researching one's teaching.

The prime objective of public health law is to pursue the highest possible level of physical and mental health in the population, consistent with the values of social justice'. 3 This might be compared with an Australian definition, which identifies public health law as 'any area of legal regulation which affects the maintenance and improvement of the health of individuals in a community', 4 and with that of Martin, writing from a UK perspective, who has defined the field as 'that body of law which can be used as a tool in the provision, protection and promotion of the health rights of the population'. 5 The differences between these definitions reflect the nature of the legal framework in differing jurisdictions: in some instances, public health law will primarily take the form of legislative intervention, while in others (such as England and Wales), a patchwork of legislation dealing with public health sits alongside regulation through the common law, which enables individuals to bring actions in public or private law to protect their public health 'rights'. Common to each, however, is a perception of the facilitative role which may be played by law: that, as Gostin has written, it can function as an 'essential tool for creating the conditions that enable people to lead healthier and safer lives'. 3, 5 In contrast to the above, medical law concerns itself primarily with the individual, not the collective, with the physician-patient nexus being central. As Kennedy and Grubb note, it 'is essentially concerned with the relationship between health care professionals (particularly doctors and to a lesser extent hospitals or other institutions) and patients'. 6 It emphasizes internal, rather than external, causes of disease and ill health, and its orientation is towards the remedying of error, not the management and reduction of risks to health. Notwithstanding that there has been a recent emergence of courses in healthcare law, which seek to move beyond the clinical relationship to explore broader legal issues in the organization and delivery of health services, 7 public health remains, at best, a subsidiary concern as the focus remains upon care of the sick as distinct from promotion of the health of the population.",24.67232143540201,10.30498494685348

Several frameworks exist for accomplishing this within the current educational milieu. For instance, the Association of American Medical Colleges has made specific recommendations to emphasize public health principles regarding bioterrorism in medical schools. 16 The Association of Teachers of Preventive Medicine has developed an inventory of core competencies for disease prevention and health promotion that underscore critical public health concepts within medical education. 17 Building on these efforts, recent work has been completed to extend clinical prevention concepts across health professional education as part of the Healthy People 2010 planning. 18 Conversely, the same holds true for imbedding medical concepts into training programs in public health, as was recently recommended by the Institute of Medicine. 19 This is likely to be challenging, given the broad spectrum of graduate public health education and the multiple and divergent backgrounds of the student population. Nonetheless, despite its inherent complexity, this should be a high-priority challenge for the Association of Schools of Public Health and the Council on Linkages Between Academia and Public Health Practice.

Lord Atkin described the issue of whether the manufacturer owed a duty of care to the consumer as 'important. because of its bearing on public health'. 30 Similarly, the common law of nuisance is also interwoven with public health concerns, 5 and the doctrine of nuisance was employed as the legal mechanism for control of disease in public health legislation, much of which, in turn, has been largely subsumed within modern environmental law.

While the growing salience of law to public health policy requires that students of public health develop an understanding of legal processes and rules which can be applied to practical situations, the teaching of legal principle also serves a broader pedagogical purpose by exposing such students to a particular mode of analytical reasoning and fostering a deeper understanding of societal ordering.

It affects the way people live, their consequent chance of illness, and their risk of premature death. We watch in wonder as life expectancy and good health continue to increase in parts of the world and in alarm as they fail to improve in others. A girl born today can expect to live for more than 80 years if she is born in some countries -but less than 45 years if she is born in others. Within countries there are dramatic differences in health that are closely linked with degrees of social disadvantage. Differences of this magnitude, within and between countries, simply should never happen. These inequities in health, avoidable health inequalities arise because of the circumstances in which people grow, live, work, and age, and the systems put in place to deal with illness. The conditions in which people live and die are, in turn, shaped by political, social, and economic forces. Social and economic policies have a determining impact on whether a child can grow and develop to its full potential and live a flourishing life, or whether its life will be blighted. Increasingly the nature of the health problems rich and poor countries have to solve are converging. The development of a society, rich or poor, can be judged by the quality of its population's health, how fairly health is distributed across the social spectrum, and the degree of protection provided from disadvantage as a result of ill-health."" preventing disease, the next step is to identify suitable and feasible methods of achieving it, or a strategy with tactical objectives. This determines the method of operation, course of action, and resources needed to carry it out.

Toronto had 251 probable cases with 43 deaths. 2 The province of Ontario was ill-prepared to deal with an infectious disease threat on such a scale. [3] [4] [5] In Canada, the provision of health care, including public health, is a provincial responsibility. However, the financial and operational responsibility for public health had increasingly been shifted to municipalities such that, at the time of the SARS outbreak, funding was shared equally between the two levels of government. This funding shift created a decentralised public-health system, with the province's 37 public-health units operating quite independently of each other. 3 Ontario is the only Canadian province that does not have a regionalised health-care system so that each Ontario hospital functions semi-autonomously as a private not-forprofit organisation.

Today, the core business of public health falls into disease prevention and control, public health emergency response, epidemic reporting and management of health-related information, surveillance of and intervention against health hazards, laboratory testing and evaluation, health education and health promotion, technical management, and applied research guidance. Undergraduate education in public health, which takes place in medical schools, covers areas including epidemiology, biostatistics, environmental health, occupational health and safety, food hygiene, school health, health toxicology and radiation protection. In recent years, medical sociology, maternal and child health, health management and policies, health economics, health inspections and their roles within healthcare services have been gradually added to the curriculum of most schools. There has also been an increase in masters courses in public health. Currently, most graduates in public health work in centres for disease prevention and control at various levels, and some work in health inspection institutions which have functions of inspecting and managing goods and services related to health. From discussions at the workshop, 10 significant problems facing public health education in China were identified: Goals for public health education and training at the national level have not been clearly defined; Public health education is not seen as independent of the traditional medical education system, and the unique characteristics of public health education are not recognized and respected; In schools of public health, there is a lack of expertise in health economics, health management, health policy, and health-related law and regulations; It is difficult to attract high-quality students to public health as compared with clinical medicine; The importance of public health education as part of the public health system has not been well recognized by the Government; Curriculum development has not kept up with the modern developments in public health; Teaching has not kept up with the new technology and teaching contents; Structure of teaching faculty has not kept up with the requirements of education reform; Teaching materials have not kept up with the rapid growth of scientific evidence and with the change in health needs; and Links across universities (e.g. with social science faculties) are poor.",28.37795820468706,13.863038960316924

Keeping the public healthy requires not only a well-educated public health workforce but also much better educated citizens. The Institute of Medicine has recommended that all university undergraduates should have access to education in public health, and that public health education should be introduced in high schools. The report 22 sets out basic competencies and curricula. This trend to a broader liberal education is being followed in Hong Kong, where the university curriculum is being extended to 4 years along the lines of the US and mainland Chinese model. Not only has a new BSc now been introduced at university level, 23 but public health has been added into the curriculum for high school students as part of liberal studies for all students, and a further module on health and social care management is also being taught in years 4-6 in middle school. 24 In the USA, there is a growing demand for public health undergraduate courses, and the Association of Schools of Public Health is in the process of devising undergraduate public health competencies. The Asia-Pacific Academic Consortium of Public Health is working to improve public health through the delivery of education, research and public health programmes by member institutions, and actively supports increasing undergraduate public health opportunities, stressing that public health education is more urgent for its region than the rest of the world and that a better system needs to be built, based on developments and experiments already occurring in other universities and other countries and regions. 25 ",32.73810122455757,13.25768622076472

Coercive social distancing is only justified if it results in net benefits to society as a whole. Some of these benefits should be returned to the victims of coercive measures.

This is reflected in increasing demand, rising costs, and a return towards curative and hospital care, making re-exploration of the Alma-Ata principles both timely and relevant. 3 A better alignment of a population-based public health approach with personal health services is needed urgently, along with better integration of personal health care and public health. To quote van Weel et al., primary care needs to be organized on the principle of care for individuals in the context of the population, and the future of primary care, and health care in general, will depend on how effectively a community-oriented approach and its contribution to equity and social cohesion is achieved. 2 The recognition that health systems play a key role in public health has been endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in the report 'Primary Health Care -Now More Than Ever', published on the 30 th anniversary of the international conference of Alma-Ata. Arguing the need to revisit Alma-Ata, the report identifies four broad policy directions of improving health for all: tackling health inequalities through universal coverage; putting people at the centre of care; integrating health into broader public policy; and providing inclusive leadership for health. 4 This approach requires public health strategies as well as clinical skills in meeting the needs of populations, particularly the poor and vulnerable, and is congruent with the influential report from the Commission on Social Determinants of Health which stresses the relevance of an ecological approach to health, essential to achieving the millennium development goals. 5 The implicit need for stronger public health was again re-inforced by the 2009 WHO World Health Assembly resolution which calls for primary healthcare services to provide health promotion and disease prevention as well as curative care and palliative care, and for integration and co-ordinated practice to take account of the needs of populations and to promote active participation by all people. 6 The corollary to these global health policy developments is an increasing interest in appropriate educational strategies, and a growing recognition that public health education must change if it is to meet the needs of modern societies, the health threats they face and the challenge of developing equitable health systems.",29.927559177304843,12.142686804214058

This study explored the perceptions, knowledge and attitudes of patients, health workers and traditional healers about use of traditional medicine and ART. Methods: Data was collected through interviews with 14 participants: six patients on ART and TM; two doctors; 2 professional nurses and 4 traditional healers. Two focus group discussions, one in each research site were held with community health workers who work with HIV positive patients. Data was analysed using a thematic content analysis approach. Findings: When patients become sick they use traditional medicine first, then when all else fail they come to the health facility. Most patients start using traditional medicine before they are diagnosed with HIV. When they get sick the first point of entry seem to be the traditional healers. Most patients start using traditional medicine before they are diagnosed with HIV. Some people prefer using traditional medicine because they want privacy and to remain anonymous. Conclusion: This study has revealed that patients have a history of using traditional medicine for chronic conditions prior to their diagnosis with HIV, and continue using traditional medicine in conjunction with their ART. This indicates that traditional medicine is an integral part of the ""treatment modality"" for patients and is used in combination with conventional medicine. Learning Objectives: 1.

Background: Korea is a fast-aging country experiencing changes in social and family values. While research on social support among older adults increases, understanding the context in which they perceive and expect social support is relatively limited. This qualitative study aims to illustrate how older adults in Seoul recognize received and desired social support in what context.

INTRODUCTION: DISCOVERING ISSUES AND CHALLENGES IN LOW-AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES,"Where are the pharmacists when the nations are crippled by these threats? Do the pharmaceutical policies fail to curb these problems? The lack of adequate, resilient public health surveillance systems, infrastructure to effectively deploy resources, and a health workforce to provide accessible, quality care where needed leaves us vulnerable to regional and global spread. Despite the progress that has been made in the last two decades, more needs to be done to create enabling regulatory environments. Understanding the social and cultural contexts that may contribute to these problems, plus effective solutions, is also crucial. Health communication often receives less attention and fewer resources than medical, scientific, or policy areas. There is an urgent need for society to value and invest more in evidence-informed public health strategies. The multifactorial nature of broader global health issues poses an enormous challenge to all stakeholders (WHO, 2016b). Effective public health action depends on understanding the scale and nature of threats to health (WHO, 1986) . According to the Ottawa patient charter, the public health community has a duty to make the invisible visible. They must measure and assess the burden of diseases, health status, and risk factors including the protection factors. The public health community must make the best use of data to promote health. Public health interventions should be evaluated, using rigorous research methods, and the results disseminated. The public health community must ensure that evidence is used to give voice to those who would otherwise be unheard. Research findings must be disseminated effectively to the different stakeholders in the health sectors, including public, policy makers, practitioners, and (social) media. Findings at times are complex and this information should be delivered in ways that are comprehensible and in a timely manner (Lomazzi, 2016) .",30.444788730678752,12.75414209444148

This highlights the practical obstacles to making standardized costs estimations of PHSS. The above mentioned WHO report 14 suggests including both the costs of surveillance and response as the ultimate purpose of surveillance information is to inform public health decision-making and to guide response and control activities. A conceptual framework of public health surveillance and action comprising six surveillance core activities such as detection, confirmation or analyses and two public health actions (acute and planned responses) and four support activities such as communication and training has recently been developed. 33 This framework aims at assessing the performances of PHSS and could also be useful for conducting standardized cost analysis for PHSS.",24.90599957314402,11.524734228079959

Their efforts enhance the quality of individual's lives by helping people to live as free as possible from disease, pain, and suffering (Jandovitz & Brygider, 2005) . With respect to their relationship with the public, pharmacists are often portrayed as an underused resource for health-and medicines-related advice and information. Furthermore, the practice of pharmacy involves both pharmacist and public and can be conceptualized as a social process (Harding & Taylor, 2009, p. 395) . Don't we need something about the efforts to locate new pharmacy roles, e.g., in relation to immunizations, patient advisor, educator and advocator for wellness, screening and prevention activities, birth control promotions, and other population health initiatives? Pharmacists have an obligation to educate the public in LMICs, for example, teaching poor rural women about birth control and safe sex especially if their partner has HIV, etc. The other one is to encourage immunizations. In certain places, some cult leader and religious groups discourage their followers not to be immunized and then we end up with local epidemics of preventable conditions such as polio. Hence, understanding the concepts and principles behind social pharmacy disciplines is important and useful.

The reasons for this are varied and complex, but they include limited access to resources that can help people to take action during an emergency, culture and language barriers, lower perceived personal risk, distrust of authorities, lack of preparation and protective action, and frequent reliance on informal sources of information. 1, 2 Central to these factors, we argue, is the phenomenon of communi-cation inequalities, which we define as differences among individuals and social groups in accessing and using health information and the resultant impact on knowledge and behaviors. [2] [3] [4] While a solid body of work in social epidemiology has documented a connection between social determinants such as socioeconomic position, race, and ethnicity and health outcomes, the mechanisms linking the 2 have been less clear. Viswanath and colleagues developed an explanatory framework of how inequalities in public health emergency preparedness outcomes attributable to social determinants could potentially be explained by inequalities on various dimensions of public health emergency preparedness. 5 The framework is summarized by the Structural Influence Model (SIM) of preparedness communication depicted in Figure 1 . 5 The model is a heuristic framework developed to link social determinants with preparedness outcomes through public health emergency preparedness communications. The framework was originally developed in the context of health communication 5 and subsequently adopted to public health emergency preparedness communication to the public. 6 Communication to the public is critically important in public health emergency preparedness. It is one of 15 public health emergency preparedness capabilities developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): ''Public Information and Warning.'' 7 During a crisis, federal, state, and local public health agencies are typically engaged in a variety of public information efforts to inform the population, encourage the adoption of preventive behaviors, and limit the adverse impacts of specific events. Yet, individuals and groups may not be able to access and use some of the resources offered to them, including information on health and specific threats, because of existing social inequalities, including socioeconomic position, race, ethnicity, and physical and mental health disabilities, among others. 8 Emergencies, including disasters, also can lead to longterm disparities, even controlling for predisaster socioeconomic status, as a study of Hurricane Katrina showed. 9 These disparities are also found among nations. For ex-ample, a United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) study showed that the adverse consequences of disasters, such as mortality, are greater among countries with low income, low life expectancy, and less education. 10 In contrast, advanced countries with higher income and education and more stable governance suffer fewer losses in disasters. 9 Poorer households tend to have poorer coping strategies and suffer consequences over the longer term. 11 In an analysis, Kim showed that poor people are more likely than nonpoor people to be exposed to disasters and that the poor are much more likely to be concentrated in disasterprone areas, highlighting the importance of public health emergency preparedness communications. 6 During an emergency, a number of psychosocial as well as social factors influence action, even when information about a probable hazard is available and promptly communicated to the public. For example, Mexican Americans often have delayed responses to natural emergencies because of the time they spend in trying to communicate with their extended families. 12 Hearing impairment may leave elderly people more vulnerable to information processing and cause difficulty in understanding evacuation orders, 13 and individuals with low literacy may be challenged in interpreting written messages and are likely to benefit from preparedness resources that are easy to read and visually appropriate. 14 Given the importance of communicating to the public in public health emergency preparedness, it is important to examine the extent to which this issue has received attention from the scientific community. The goal of this project was to conduct a systematic review of the scientific literature to describe current research in public communication in public health emergency preparedness, with a particular focus on communication inequalities and their association with communication and preparedness outcomes. This review examines the relationship among sociodemographics, behavioral characteristics, and communication outcomes in public health emergency preparedness.",29.902836527189255,13.608976584689044

Significant medical school debt can drive new physicians away from the ID specialty and public health. Targeted loan repayment opportunities would allow more physicians to pursue these critical career paths. In July 2018, in a move supported by IDSA, the US House of Representative's Energy and Commerce Committee passed legislation that would authorize the CDC to provide loan repayment for those who serve in the Epidemic Intelligence Services (EIS). More than 85% of EIS officers continue serving in public health roles, and this proposal would significantly help make this career path more financially feasible for physicians. Such loan forgiveness opportunities could also be broadened to support ID physicians who work in public health at the federal, state, or local level and face similar challenges around compensation and medical student debt. Establish financial compensation for ID physicians who work in public service (eg, local, state, and federal public health agencies) or who do ID work that provides broader public health benefits (infection control and antimicrobial stewardship). Physicians who perform infection control and antimicrobial stewardship work should be compensated for these activities. As part of hospital accreditation, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) mandates that every participating facility have an active infection control program [37] . States could attach an accreditation process to such mandates that would formally document ID clinicians who oversee hospital infection control and antimicrobial stewardship committees, with loan forgiveness or other financial incentives attached to this accreditation. Ensure that ID physician compensation reflects public health value added. As a cognitive specialty, many of the clinical services ID physicians provide are billed under Evaluation and Management codes, which have not been reevaluated in more than 20 years. The CMS should update these codes to reflect the increasingly complex care provided in inpatient and outpatient settings. Public and private payers, healthcare systems, and hospitals should also provide appropriate compensation and protected time for nonclinical services that are crucial to public health, including infection prevention and control, antimicrobial stewardship, and bioemergency preparedness and response. Fully fund local, state, federal, and global public health agencies and build a competent workforce. Without proper workforce funding, including funding of ID physician positions, health departments will not be able to hire and retain the expert workforce necessary to detect, prevent, and respond to public health threats.",24.76010161870994,11.462476001004351

Other challenging issues include the problematic ethical and legal frameworks for implementing restrictions for public health purposes [52, 53] , as well as considerable logistical and economic implications. If longplanned events were to be cancelled, who would be liable for the huge personal, corporate and national costs that such cancellations might incur? In considering policy recommendations within a pandemic context, the most practical approach for all but the more severe pandemics may be a strategy of encouraging voluntary restrictions. This would involve giving the public the best available information and advising rather than legislating that organizations and individuals avoid non-essential events where there is at least some evidence of transmission risk. For such a strategy to have a chance of succeeding, it would be most important to have in place a carefully and sensitively prepared communication strategy, since recommendations to avoid public gatherings are likely to run against powerful social pressures to do otherwise [54] .

If we use an analogy and consider that the fullygovernment-funded public hospitals in the premarketization era were like a nice cat, during the market-oriented economic reforms when the Government cut funding to hospitals as part of its market approaches, the cat was put outside and told to feed itself. The cat had to find ways to survive in the market and managed to do this successfully. Now, the cat has grown up and become a tiger. When the Government calls it back and says, 'I have the money. I can support you', the tiger says 'No, I don't want to come back because the food you give me is not good enough'. This is a huge challenge, especially to improve the management of public hospitals. However, it is also an opportunity, as new technology has created new ways to solve problems that could not be solved previously. One example is the national public health information system; a direct reporting system for infectious diseases and public health emergencies in China. After SARS, the Chinese Government developed this population-based public health information system. Now at the township level, it is possible to report directly to the Central Government and the Government can respond quickly. The second example of achievements through the use of information technology is in Dongcheng District in Beijing, where an integrated community health network has been established. There is integration between the 126 healthcare centres, 82 general practitioner workstations, community healthcare centres and the hospitals. The network provides lifetime monitoring of people's health statuses with a comprehensive health record which links to management as well as performance evaluation of the doctors, who are paid according to their workload and the quality of their performance. Online consultation is also available. The individual health records can also link to family health records.

After 30 years of economic reforms, China has achieved an economic miracle. The annual growth in gross domestic product (GDP) is 9.8%, 1 but China's healthcare system has not improved as much as the economy. Instead, it has deteriorated in many aspects in both rural and urban areas. In terms of quality, efficiency and equity of healthcare, China's healthcare system is far behind the current level of economic development and people's demands. The improvement in life expectancy slowed down, especially compared with other countries such as Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia and Sri Lanka. Medical costs (but not health outcomes) escalated rapidly, and relationships between doctors and patients deteriorated. The healthcare sector has been one of the areas in China's social system receiving the most complaints. The reasons for the above problems in China's healthcare system are mainly due to government failure and market failure. The failure of the Government to insure people's basic healthcare needs led to breakdown of the public health service system; the lack of government regulations exacerbated market failure; and some hospitals and doctors induced too many unnecessary healthcare services, which not only increased the costs for the patients but may also have damaged their health. The Government reduced the budget in line with market principles, and people were paying for more and more medical costs out of their own pocket. Total health expenditure has increased nearly 90 times over the last three decades, much faster than the growth in GDP. It now accounts for 5% of the GDP, and most is out-of-pocket payments. By 2000, around 60% of health costs were paid for out-of-pocket. 3 In addition, even the more affluent people who were able to pay for care were unable to access satisfactory healthcare services due to the number of patients.

A 2010 case involving a tobacco dispute between Indonesia and the United States is illustrative. To comply with domestic legislation to prevent adolescent smoking, the United States banned imports of flavored cigarettes. Indonesia argued that the domestic legislation, by exempting 'menthol' from the list of flavors, discriminated against its clove cigarettes in favor of US-manufactured menthol cigarettes, which are the favored choice of American teens. This constituted a violation of WTO rules on national treatment (there should be no discrimination against 'like' imported goods). Indonesia further argued that there were 'less-trade-restrictive' ways (another WTO requirement) to meet the public health goal of reducing adolescent smoking than a ban on clove cigarette imports. The WTO dispute panel ruled with Indonesia on the first argument (nondiscrimination) but with the United States on the second (agreeing that a ban was a necessary public health policy). Provided there is no obvious discrimination, public health regulations appear to have growing latitude within (at least some) WTO (McGrady, 2012) . There is also greater public health attention being given to proposed trade and investment treaties, with efforts to ensure that before such treaties are finalized, public health concerns are given due consideration, and that 'policy space' for future public health regulation is assured, e.g., regarding trade or investment in food, alcohol, or other health-damaging commodities. The potential for a healthier governance of trade and investment treaties, however, remains constrained by the secrecy in which the treaties are negotiated, the privileging of business interests over public interests in informing government positions during negotiations, and the stilldominant assumption that liberalization is an inherently positive development for all countries involved. As argued, this is not a universally held or observed assumption.",28.03851856917005,11.446735389485474

Organizations and professionals in the public health sector may not always succeed in preventing pandemics: as we have seen, they are well aware of this fact, and that is why emergency plans are developed in the first place. But this implies that, in principle, all organizations that provide basic services for society have to professionalize themselves in this specific area. One could describe this as a 'colonization' of non-health organizations through public health imperatives. This is, of course, not a completely new development if one considers, for instance, company doctors or health and safety officers. Furthermore, many large organizations have undergone a professionalization in areas that do not traditionally belong to their core activities, such as when they maintain legal, public relations or research departments, or when they offer childcare or psychological counselling to their employees. To some extent, this is a likely consequence of the 'functional differentiation of modern societies' (Luhmann 1997) : even if organizations are typically specialized in providing only one or two services, they have to take further social functions into account. What is new here is the kind of task, that is, preparing for pandemics in order to prevent the worst-case scenario-a complete breakdown of the system that would result from the absence of employees due to illness. In a society of organizations, the autopoiesis of society as whole cannot be separated from the autopoiesis of its organizations. Preserving society in a public health emergency depends on keeping organizations functional. ",25.943896938520094,9.906684822544552

Under the Health Protection and Promotion Act (HPPA), the enabling legislation for Ontario's health units, contributing member municipalities are obligated to pay what the board of health deems necessary to defray the costs of delivering mandatory public health programs. (These were known as the Mandatory Health Program and Service Guidelines until 2008, when they were updated as the Ontario Public Health Standards.) But the provincial contribution to public health spending, which is based on what the minister considers appropriate, has varied considerably in recent years (Pasut 2007). Before 1997, the province funded 75% of the mandatory program budgets for most boards of health and municipalities funded the remaining 25%. In 1996, the Social Services Sub-Panel of the Ontario Who Does What? panel concluded that the province has the primary interest in public health and that public health services should be delivered by provincially appointed and funded boards of health (Crombie and Hopcroft 1996). However, this recommendation was never implemented. Instead, public health and many social services were downloaded to municipalities in 1997, with the province assuming more responsibility for education (see Graham and Phillips 1998). This total download of public health lasted until 1999, when the province moved to a 50/50 funding formula (Campbell 2004). The 50/50 formula stayed in place until 2004. In 2005, the province began to phase in a return to its previous mandatory program contribution level of 75%. This increase in provincial funding was in response to the fallout from two public health emergencies – the Escherichia coli outbreak in Walkerton in 2000 and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 – and was intended to increase the capacity of the public health system. The province's original plan was to reach the 75/25 funding split within three years, but it has since capped its annual increases. By 2011, for example, only 17 health units (out of 36) had reached the 75/25 funding split for mandatory programs (MLHU 2012).",31.864810431218725,12.03834944296708

However, a public approach is needed to overcome common psychological barriers. Two of the most common problems are the breakdown of social support structures and the stigmatization of patients. As people are trying to avoid transmission of the virus, social support structures are breaking apart; places like churches, schools, and workplaces have been shut down, which eliminates the benefits of social support and may cause feelings of isolation and vulnerability. Furthermore, there is a high chance of the disease itself being stigmatized, as it is new and incurable.7 Most stigmatization targets are patients or specific groups of people (i.e., People with specific religion in south Korea or Asians in COVID-19 and SARS outbreaks, and West Africans in Ebola outbreaks). The targeted people are often removed from their social support system, which can lead to isolation and mental health problems. More importantly, stigmatization can drive potential patients to avoid accessing the healthcare system, and instead, continuing to spread infection over worries of being shunned by others.

But before explaining why, we need to define ‘public health emergency preparedness’, in particular its impressive–sounding correlate, ‘global public health security’, and its less readily comprehensible subset, ‘public health emergency legal preparedness’. In the World Health Report 2007, Dr Margaret Chan, Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), described ‘global public health security’ as ‘the reduced vulnerability of populations to acute threats to health’.2 Later in the same report, more detailed definitions were provided:
Public health security is … the activities required, both proactive and reactive, to minimize vulnerability to acute public health events that endanger the collective health of national populations. Global public health security widens this definition to include acute public health events that endanger the collective health of populations living across geographical regions and international boundaries … .[G]lobal health security, or lack of it, may also have an impact on economic or political stability, trade, tourism, access to goods and services and, if they occur repeatedly, on demographic stability.3
The other term that requires some explanation is ‘public health emergency legal preparedness’. Stated shortly, this is all about having the right laws in place and then using them in the right way in a time of public health emergency.4 In other words, it is about both legal preparedness for, and response to, public health emergencies – it is both proactive and reactive. More generally, it can be said to be an essential part of both public and global public health security, and a subset of public health emergency preparedness.",23.570489237684818,10.996871769917592

On the one hand, this flexibility is a consequence of the evolution of the notions of health, well-being, and illness, which are recognized as multifactorial phenomena. On the other hand, it is the result of developments in informational and biomedical technologies (50). As such, the flexibility of public health may allow it to embrace new research tools, such as genomics.

We might expect poorer households within communities to be those most likely to have these more traditional practices. Studies have also shown that the bulk of reported exposures occurred from one family member to another, or from a close friend or neighbor (International Ebola Response Team et al., 2016). Therefore, people living in larger households might be expected to be more likely to be exposed to the virus, which is also likely associated with lower SES. Other individual behaviors may have also influenced exposure to the illness. For example, people in Monrovia with higher trust in government were more likely use public health services during and immediately after the peak of the outbreak and were more likely to comply with public health directives (Blair, Morse, & Tsai, 2017; Morse, Grépin, Blair, & Tsai, 2016).

Gostin et al. [9] argued that it becomes essential to develop a set of legal and ethical recommendations, especially when scientific evidence is not enough and public health action is urgently required as in the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). During the MERS outbreak in Korea, difficult choices between public health needs and the protection of individual rights, which include privacy, liberty, and freedom of movement, had to be made. Gostin et al. [9] proposed four ethical values: the precautionary principle, the least restrictive option, fairness, and transparency in decision making. It is unclear that these values were fully considered in the public health actions that were taken during the MERS outbreak in Korea. The Korean government strictly restricted the movement of 16 752 individuals who satisfied the operational definition of “close contacts with a MERS patient” within designated hospitals or their homes for the maximum incubation period regardless of whether they displayed MERS symptoms [1]. According to the WHO, there is no evidence that MERS can be transmitted before symptom development or in early symptomatic stages. Therefore the WHO does not recommend quarantine nor isolation of asymptomatic contacts during this period [10]. The urgent social demand for controlling the MERS outbreak overwhelmed the issue of legitimacy of the public health interventions taken by the government. Economic issues have also been raised regarding this restriction of movement. In this situation, the people who undertake the costs incurred by movement restriction are not the same people who benefit. In principle, if those who benefited were to compensate those who were made worse off, the outcome could have been considered an improvement (known as a “Kaldor–Hicks improvement”) [11].

The proposed network scheme will provide more cost-efficient laboratory services and ensure a regular flow of laboratory work to maintain the competency of technical staff to produce quality output. Because of the increased likelihood of epidemic diseases caused by novel pathogens, diagnostic laboratories serving as the primary entry point of investigation should be able to take a more generic approach in pathogen detection, isolation and identification.

Rothstein & Talbott (2007) found that to make quarantine to be the most effective measure for limiting the spread of infection, compliance with quarantine regulations should be encouraged, that is, providing job security and income replacement. Wang et al. (2012) found that In the case of short reaction time, intra-population, such as patient isolation, are more effective than inter-population such as travel restrictions. Jefferson (2008) pandemic influenza (H1N1) and found those were effective to some extent. Rashid (2015) researched the public health policy of the 2009 pandemic influenza and concluded that the school closure, whether positive or passive, seemed to be moderately effective and acceptable in reducing the spread of influenza and delaying the peak of the epidemic, but it is related to high expenses of secondary school. Voluntary isolation and quarantine at home are also effective and acceptable measures, but it takes the risk of intra-household transmission from index cases to contacts. Workplace-related interventions, such as work closure and work at home, are also moderately effective and acceptable, but it may have negatively impact on economy. Internal mobility restriction is only effective when extremely high restrictions (50% of travel) are imposed and mass gatherings which happened within 10 days before the epidemic peak is likely to increase the risk of transmission of influenzas. Rothstein (2015) compared the effectiveness of public health policies to intervene with infectious diseases, among which quarantine is one of the most aggressive and controversial measures that public health officials can take when trying to control an outbreak. Serious legal and ethical concerns have been raised because of restrictions on the movement of potentially large numbers of people (Fidler et al., 2007) . During the SARS epidemic in 2003, quarantine was widely used in several Asian countries and Canada, and it played a role in ending the epidemic. Similarly, during the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, social distancing measures, including quarantine, had become a major containment strategy. The paradox of quarantine and other social distancing measures is that they may effectively resist the outbreak of disease, but the scope of application is too wide, leading to various social hazards, including economic disruption, physical isolation and even violence. Quarantine is the first public health tool to control infectious diseases and remains a legitimate and valuable public health strategy because it has a significant impact on civil liberties, economic activity and social cohesion, so officials must be extra careful about the possibility of abusing quarantine authority (Rothstein, 2015) .",21.633806251615816,10.0841841658907

The effectiveness of such measures from both group is variable and some is still under debate. Regarding, for example, extensive travel restrictions, a recent systematic review has shown that this intervention may contribute to delaying but not preventing the transmission and diffusion of a viral outbreak. As such, it is not recommended for implementation, if not within a broader package of public health measures aimed at rapidly containing the outbreak 8 . A similar conclusion can be reached for border entry screening, considered as ineffective or poorly effective per se, and therefore needs to be combined and provided together with other strategies 9 .

Therefore, it is imperative that the UK Government, and governments around the world, quickly develop and implement policies to support the most vulnerable, in a bid to minimise the long-term social and economic harm caused by COVID-19. Government policy should recognise the disparity in impact across socio-economic groups, particularly across the labour market, and should aim to support workers equitably across the income spectrum. This would likely help increase compliance across the population to the levels required to suppress transmission and thereby reduce the strain on national health services, both in the UK and abroad.

We implement one of the first nationally representative surveys about this unprecedented public health crisis and use it to evaluate the Italian government' public health efforts and citizen responses. Findings: (1) Public health messaging is being heard. Except for slightly lower compliance among young adults, all subgroups we studied understand how to keep themselves and others safe from the SARS-Cov-2 virus. Remarkably, even those who do not trust the government , or think the government has been untruthful about the crisis believe the messaging and claim to be acting in accordance. (2) The quarantine is beginning to have serious negative effects on the population's mental health. Policy Recommendations: Communications should move from explaining to citizens that they should stay at home to what they can do there. We need interventions that make staying following public health protocols more desirable, such as virtual social interactions, online social reading activities, classes, exercise routines, etc. -all designed to reduce the boredom of long term social isolation and to increase the attractiveness of following public health recommendations. Interventions like these will grow in importance as the crisis wears on around the world, and staying inside wears on people. 1 Roma Capitale (Municipality of Rome) convened our ""COVID-19 International Behavioral Science Working Group"" to (i) strengthen its public health policies and guidance, (ii) suggest new policies and guidance based on rigorous behavioral science, and (iii) develop empirical evidence about behavioral change.

The Chinese government responded to this epidemic with multiple public health policies including locking down the city of Wuhan, establishing multiple temporary hospitals, and prohibiting public gathering events.

A novel coronavirus was identified as the causative agent and was subsequently termed SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO). Epidemic disease quickly spread across 31 provinces and regions. As of 23:00 CET on March 5, a total of 98,067 new confirmed cases have been reported globally, with deaths of 3,281. A total of 17,637 cases have been confirmed in 78 countries outside China. [1] The new coronavirus outbreak has surpassed the severity of SARS in 2003. [2, 3] The outbreak of virus coincided with China's Spring Festival travel peak, and to curb the spread of the disease, the Chinese government launched unprecedented public health intervention measures, such as shutting down Wuhan transportation, extending the legal holiday, mass isolation, strict enforcement of quarantine of all contacts, and canceling all public gatherings and health public to abide by hygienic practices. To reduce the flow of people, the health monitoring of returning residents has been conducted at the nationwide level. As of 16:00 clock on February 28, Dr. Wan'nian Liang, chief of the National Health Commission's institutional reform department and head of the Chinese expert panel, said: The virus outbreak in Wuhan is curbed basic. The number of new confirmed cases per day declined from a high peak of 3,900 cases on 13 February to 323 cases on 27 February. The number of newly cured cases has exceeded the number of newly confirmed cases for eight consecutive days since February 20. The proportion of severe cases declined from 31.6% to 22.4% from February 11 to February 27. The death rate has fallen from a peak of 9.0% on January 16th to 4.4% now. [4] As the WHO leader Bruce Aylward said at a COVID-19 news conference on February 24, ""China's made comprehensive non-pharmaceutical interventions, which have effectively prevented the transmission of the virus, providing important lessons for the global response to new virus"" [5] . This is an unprecedented effort, and it surpasses previous efforts to combat SARS."" However, there is no doubt that no other countries can follow China's current example. [6] In the global spread background, from the perspective of social epidemiology, this paper aims to summarize these detailed intervention measures taken by the Chinese government and explain how the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei Province was effectively controlled by these public health interventions measures. We also improve the public health system in the future by summarizing these lessons from this outbreak.",13.806171855429476,6.050094260161005
