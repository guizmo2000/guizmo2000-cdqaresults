The hospital in SC appeared to have more patient-centered care, while the hospital from GN appeared to be more profit-oriented. It is suggested that these differences in mentality were due to differences in resource allocation systems, and security of funding. Following the financial decentralization, performance-based payment systems have been prevalent in Chinese public hospitals, which may have encouraged gaming within the health system to raise additional funds by charging from patients [32] . This approach is not encouraged in the TB clinics, however it is entrenched within practice as operational costs are not fully met by the government. Loss of income due to free TB treatment policy may be a universal concern [11] . Hospital providers may thus comprise the standardised TB treatment through unnecessary prescription of drugs, tests and admissions for general TB patients. These distorted incentives constrain the patient-orientated care provision and can negatively impact on the care of patients. While government funding has largely improved for public health facilities such as CDC, there is an urgent need to increase funding to subsidize the newly integrated public-health services in the hospital. The resource allocation mechanisms in TB control seemed to favor the CDC, and so hospitals may suffer from a ""reallocation"" of the TB control budget from the CDC. Integration requires transfer of funds for care from the CDC to the hospital. An appropriate budgeting mechanism needs to be explored to ensure equitable allocation of resources and successful integration as in the case of SC. Different practices of hospitalizing TB patients in SC and GN could also reflect the conflicts between the clinical and public health perspectives of TB care delivery. Clinicians in the hospital should be educated to improve the public health awareness, and specifically implement an outpatient-based systematic public health TB approach. Both sites presented the challenges of retaining qualified TB personnel. To ensure that TB services are sustainable and maintain a high quality of care, fair pay should be provided to attract and stabilize a motivated and skilled workforce.",36.50702280224044,17.411972622545935

Nevertheless, the feasibility of health systems to implement response measures or interventions described in plans and trained in exercises depends on the available resource capacity.

As a result, new surveillance systems for earlier detection have been implemented, often labeled ''syndromic surveillance'' [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . These systems use increased reporting of critical symptoms or clinical diagnoses as early indicators of infectious disease outbreaks. This not only allows monitoring of clinical syndromes before laboratory diagnoses have been made, but also allows detection of outbreaks of diseases for which no diagnostics were requested or available (including emerging pathogens). Geographic analysis methods -such as space-time scan statistics -may further increase the sensitivity of syndromic surveillance for detection of local outbreaks or of regional differences in regular seasonal epidemic diseases [2, 6] . In the SARS outbreak in Hongkong in 2003, it is believed that a near real-time space-time analysis would have detected the highly unusual clustering of severe acute respiratory syndrome cases much sooner [7] .

In addition, back-up systems (e.g. electricity, water, and communication) were not fully considered when many hospitals were being built.

This framework was quickly tested by an outbreak of RVF in the Eastern Africa Region during 2006-2007. Previously, despite the endemicity of RVF and the relative predictability of epidemics, the 1996-1997 RVF outbreak in Kenya caught public health authorities unprepared. Delays in detection and response combined with the lack of local capacity for diagnostic testing (specimens were tested late in the outbreak's course at the National Institute of Communicable Diseases in South Africa) likely contributed to the large 1996/7 outbreak resulting in 27,500 human infections and 170 deaths in Garissa in North Eastern Kenya. The outbreak was associated with large, but mostly undocumented socio-economic impacts resulting from animal deaths [8, 9] . In contrast, the 2006/07 RVF outbreak in Kenya that was more geographically widespread was characterized by a more timely diagnosis and better coordinated response and resulted in 700 suspected human cases and 90 deaths. This enhanced response could in part be credited to the efforts to build capacity for coordinated outbreak response and communication pathways within the Ministry of Health (MoH) and Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Fisheries (MALF), through increased human capacity, the presence of a multisectoral coordination structure arising from the HPAI preparedness effort and enhanced diagnostic capacity in local government, and improved research infrastructure including a BSL-3 laboratory at KEMRI supported by CDC Kenya [10] [11] [12] .

At the end of 2014, health-care capacity was exceeded in many parts of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone [14] , but new health-care facilities were subsequently built; hence the line-list of cases is likely to be more complete towards the end of the outbreak.

However, the emphasis of reforms should be on enabling effective research and surveillance to be conducted, where common benefits are possible. In this regard, the concerns of Australian policy-makers and experts on this issue are not unique. A recent WHO review points to the need to engage with affected communities to establish the conditions and protections under which it is acceptable for surveillance to take place and develop institutional mechanisms that ensure ethical issues are systematically addressed before data collection, use and dissemination [45] . Given that these technologies are already available and have the potential to enhance the capacity of Australian and other health authorities to investigate and prevent outbreaks of infectious disease, with their attendant social and economic costs, the development of clear ethical and legal guidance is urgently needed.

Investments in the public health system enable large-scale surveys on medical issues to collect data and biological materials from large populations. The results of these surveys with the corresponding biomedical data or samples often turn into international open resources for TBI research. The Janus Serum Bank is an example of a useful biobank [3] . In this biobank, which includes 170,000 clinical samples, blood samples reserved for cancer research were collected through Norwegian health screening studies. Researchers in the field of biology, medical science, bioinformatics and health care systems will benefit from those types of biomedical databases and biobanks.

Participants, however, agreed that during a pandemic, collaboration is critical, because diseases respect no boundary. Participants pointed out that no country, developed or undeveloped, has eliminated poverty and the underlying causes of ill-health, such as lower literacy among the poor and less knowledge about disease prevention. The prevalence of poverty affects not only individuals, but institutions and systems. Because of the interdependence of nations, participants thought that it is in the best interest of resource rich countries to help build the capacity of poorer countries to conduct surveillance and disease control. Participants in the African meeting stressed that the ability of a developing country to conduct thorough and accurate surveillance depends in large part on the assistance of developed countries in building and maintaining basic public health infrastructure well before a pandemic occurs. Moreover, by its very nature, surveillance is an ongoing process, not one that can be initiated in the face of an emergency response and then terminated when things return to normal. In emergencies, international scientists may temporarily fill some personnel gaps. Participants observed, however, that some international scientists providing technical assistance during an emergency seem more interested in research than in helping to control the disease outbreak. In some cases, they even diverted resources, such as healthcare workers, that could have been used for disease control. Lack of wellequipped laboratories in many African countries has resulted in the transfer of human biological specimens to distant laboratories, sometimes delaying diagnosis and intervention. Some surveillance resources are provided by donor nations for specific purposes such as measles eradication. Strict accounting rules may prevent the shift of those resources to other purposes, even in the face of a major global threat. The Asian meeting participants also expressed concern about specimen sharing. During outbreaks of SARS and H5N1 influenza, for example, China shared its specimens with countries around the world for research and vaccine development. 33 During the outbreak of H1N1 in 2009, WHO noted that 150 countries shared specimens. 34 The Asian participants noted that collaboration and communication about disease transmission requires a transparency that can be at odds with the cultural value of 'protecting honor' and 'avoiding being shamed' that is common in Asia and elsewhere. Reporting an outbreak to other countries can be perceived as admitting inadequate disease control and asking for help from another country may be viewed as a sign of weakness. This is complicated by often pre-existing disputes between neighboring countries. Moreover, while helping others is also an important Asian cultural value, offering help when a country has not asked for it may be regarded as meddling with the internal affairs of that country. Moreover, two Asian countries who conducted a joint outbreak investigation exercise observed that multilateral coordination can be time-consuming in ways that hinder a speedy and effective response. Participants at the Latin American meeting believed that it is important to clarify and disseminate guidelines for pandemic preparation and response, including those produced by WHO. Dissemination of pertinent information and guidelines between countries was considered as an obligation countries have to one another. Some noted that although wide disparity exists among Latin American countries, there is a great deal of solidarity, which facilitates cross-border collaboration, such as seen in the collaboration between Haiti and the Dominican Republic during the Haiti earthquake and resulting Cholera epidemic in 2010. Participants at the Eastern Mediterranean meeting noted that countries are sometimes reluctant to collaborate because of the political and resource differences and other disparities between countries in the region. However, they agreed that plans for responding to an influenza pandemic should be shared among countries so that countries will be familiar with neighboring countries' plans. Participants believed that country or even regional plans are too broad and more specific sub-regional plans should be developed and implemented.",36.04448832661263,15.277493997977407

Measurable progress has been made within a focused, but limited, scope. For progress to continue, however, CDC and the global health community must go beyond our initial efforts and work more broadly to confront challenges and embrace opportunities that arise. The GDD program has given us the following important lessons that can inform our next steps: 1) Create multiregional connectivity. Strong networks can harness a variety of strengths, share resources, and connect across disciplines toward common goals. A major success of the GDD program has been to create regional platforms where subject matter experts can engage with one another and programs can break free of their silos. Moving from siloed to shared approaches also enhances collaboration on science and research, thereby strengthening the foundation for public health action. Global networks have been created by GDD, and more recently with GHSA, in recognition that shared risk means shared responsibility, and the best way to achieve success is by working together to ensure our collective health, safety, and security. 2) Adopt consistent goals and measures. From the beginning, the GDD program has applied a consistent set of goals and metrics to track progress over time and across programs. The world's global health security efforts are also seeing the benefits of instituting consistent targets, as well as frameworks for measuring success against those targets. Over the past few years, the WHO Joint External Evaluations have become a valuable tool to track progress on global health security initiatives, both past-to-present and country-to-country [29] . Evaluation is a key part of recognizing accomplishments and is critical to finding gaps we must still address. Only once we know where we stand can we take action to implement successful programs and point them in the right direction to reduce our identified vulnerabilities. 3) Deploy the power of science and data. Cutting-edge scientific research has always been at the core of the GDD program's mission. Scientific data are the tool we use to detect, respond, and to halt or prevent outbreaks and to inform policy changes that protect public health globally. Scientific research helps partners make evidence-based decisions and implement effective local solutions that eliminate outbreaks at their source. Additionally, taking an active role in teaching others how to capture, analyze, and effectively use public health data creates a workforce capable of rapidly recognizing and responding to threats. Future scientific progress will require not only improved connection across scientific disciplines, but also sustained and dedicated commitment to a unified scientific strategy. 4) Build trusted partnerships. The GDD program's success has relied on strong partnerships. The program's longstanding presence in regions across the globe has proven that in-country engagement leads to trust. This trust becomes particularly valuable in outbreak response, as global partners rely on CDC data and expertise as a resource that saves lives. Strong partnerships at all levels are critical to global health security, and the process of creating GDD RCs has formed and strengthened partnerships at all levelsgovernment-to-government relationships, collaboration with other organizations and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and local and personal connectionsthat can be leveraged to address critical public health priorities. 5) Build for flexibility. Cross-cutting public health programs give us the ability to respond to any crisis, regardless of cause. Strong core systems and connected resources can pivot when needed to address emerging or reemerging threats.

Voluntary Data Sharing to Inform Disease Surveillance Systems in Food Animals,"The US swine industry continues to reach important production levels together with expanding their breeding and growing herds. Infectious diseases are one of the most important limiting factors as they deteriorate performance and increases production costs. Furthermore, foreign animal diseases are of concern for the industry as they could potentially affect the industry's export market. Therefore, the US swine industry continues to work closely with researchers to seek answers and implement procedures to mitigate the burden of endemic diseases, while building capacity to respond against emerging and foreign animal diseases. A program like MSHMP, which its foundation is trust and voluntary participation, has had an important impact on the surveillance of pathogens for the national industry. An academic institution-led program has motivated producer and veterinarian collaboration for the greater good of the industry. Reasons why producers and veterinarians have been willing to share their data are difficult t to assess. Initially, there was an intention to standardize data collection and sharing, to improve situational awareness and facilitate the decision-making process considering the epidemiological situation of the disease in near real time and in the entire region, rather than on their own farms and systems only. However, motivation declines with time, and it is important to demonstrate the added value of the effort. In that regards, even though shared data are private and managed only by the MSHMP team, producers and veterinarians still obtain a benefit because important outputs, that help inform their decisions, are routinely shared with them. PRRSv has been used as a way to bring the industry together and build the methodology to create a program that has the potential to be adaptable to other diseases. MSHMP has demonstrated over the years that voluntary organization of swine producers and practitioners toward a common goal resulted in a powerful initiative that outweighed initial concerns about own data protection. Most importantly, such voluntary collaboration has also led to collaborative research involving a number of higher education institutions in the US that helped to elucidate some of the most important epidemiological features of endemic swine diseases in the US, and ultimately, provided a substantial support to the mitigation of disease impact in the country. The evolution of analytical capabilities for big data analysis is expected to result in novel and innovative tools that will allow for the routine analysis of big datasets, such as that collected in the MSHMP. The promotion of social initiatives, intended to promote data sharing and self-organization of producers, along with the application of those novel analytical techniques, may help to reshape in the near future the landscape of coordinated activities to promote the prevention and control of food animal diseases worldwide.",32.447348275966384,15.362108655487923

The research team had to negotiate and re-negotiate ways of working, integrate differing points of view and assign roles in ways to leverage expertise but not reinforce bias. Additionally, the researchers had to establish and meet internal standards while also achieving the outward facing objective of finishing the analysis and writing of this article. Finally, as with any transdisciplinary work, language was consistently a problem. The inherent challenge of interdisciplinary work is in how we talk about collaboration and the terminology we use to describe both theory and practice. For the research team, creating clear definitions supported the development of a common language. Differing approaches can be a significant barrier when active collaboration is not structurally supported, valued, and continuously monitored for health and effectiveness. Our efforts reinforce the need for training for those skill sets that fall beyond technical sector-specific training. When grappling with the question of which skills were most important in our collaborative process, we determined that the shared objective of collaboration was the foundation for our ability to integrate the differing expertise that each team member brought to the process. Simply, we took continual action to achieve our combined goal including reading new literature, considering new frameworks, learning new things, and asking many questions. The subsequent challenge is, of course, that there are very few formal opportunities to gain access to training around these competencies and mindsets in One Health teams. Most often, as in our case, it is an ad hoc process that rests on the motivations, shared values, and time available within a team to develop in this way.

In most countries, health care systems operate at or above maximally designed capacity. Many hospitals just do not have sufficient pre-existing resources to respond to surge capacity in an outbreak [25] . Unlike with natural disasters, where the greatest need for resources often occurs early in the time course, pandemic resource requirements will build over months.

Health care professionals, as a social institution, allowed them to exercise social control with respect to facemask use in the community, which motivated the participants to use a facemask during the SARS outbreak. Second, the participants used facemasks as a form of symbolic support for health care providers. Because facemasks were perceived as a tool for infection prevention, using a facemask did not simply prevent the participants from becoming infected, but by so doing, it also implied a show of support for health care providers in an attempt to reduce their workload and the burden on the health care system. Using a facemask was akin to a symbolic declaration that they were committed to reducing the burden on the health care system by preventing themselves from becoming infected. Such symbolic support for health care providers through facemask use extended further to the social implication of displaying civic responsibility. These sociocultural processes hence contributed to the symbolic construction of the facemask during the SARS outbreak.",38.51054004861502,15.578453179317274

WHO member states have repeatedly affirmed their commitment to developing their primary care systems with a view to training up community-based health professionals who are able to provide care across the spectrum of prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery. As the 'front door' of the health system, primary care professionals should be involved in planning and action for health emergency risk management. WONCA (the global professional body for family medicine) has actively championed the ways in which primary care can be supported to deliver care during population emergencies. National primary care bodies can coordinate with public health leads to cascade information to practitioners, communicate with the public, and collate health intelligence from the frontline primary care. 8 The Ebola crisis taught us a valuable lesson about what happens when an outbreak takes health workers away from core functions to focus on crisis response; the number of people who died from reduced access to usual care probably exceeded the number killed by the virus. 9 Strong health systems built on comprehensive primary care are able to integrate both functions, disseminating the emergency response resources and information required to community-level staff who have the breadth of training required to manage new suspected cases alongside routine family medicine. Decent access to primary health care is essential in health emergencies, and its infrastructure crucial for containment, 10 just as good access to high-quality primary care is at the foundation of any strong health system. 11",34.998944911927964,15.411788362016127

The burden of morbidity and mortality from emergencies and disasters can be severe, resulting in public health systems investing substantial time and resources toward preparedness [1] . The public health system is the lead in responding to outbreaks and in minimizing the impact of diverse emergencies on health [2, 3] . Public health sector activities in infectious disease emergencies include leading other emergency management organizations during outbreaks, conducting surveillance and investigation, implementing control measures, developing guidance for health-care practitioners, and communicating risks [3] . In addition, public health is the lead sector in preparing for the population health effects of non-infectious events incited by natural or anthropogenic hazards. Emergency preparedness levels have been a concern globally in past emergencies; for example, Canada's response to the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak raised a number of issues: lack of surge capacity in the clinical and public health systems, difficulties with timely access to laboratory testing and results, and weak links between public health and the health care system were clear gaps in preparedness [3] . Recognizing complex and system-level challenges that affect emergency preparedness efforts globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) has called for all countries to create resilient integrated systems that can be responsive and proactive to any future threat, although this remains a knowledge gap [4, 5] . While risks vary for different communities, disaster and emergency preparedness is recognized as essential for all nation-states [4, 6] . Local and regional public health agencies aim to mitigate risks and protect population health; however, they face challenges to ensure readiness for potential emergencies ranging widely in likelihood and impact.

Although China has risen to become one of the largest economic powers in the world over recent decades, its health care investment is out of pace with its rapid economic growth [25] . Compared with other countries in the world, China ranks among the poorest in terms of public financing for health care [25] . Consequently, the lack of funding in public health has resulted in limitations in technical capacity and insufficient human resources in disease control and prevention to meet the challenge of potential emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases outbreaks [23] . Whilst China's comprehensive county-to-national level network CDC surveillance and reporting system has been reported as being one of the best in the world [7] , greater effort is required to improve the infectious disease surveillance infrastructure. In urban areas infectious disease surveillance infrastructure has received, and continues to receive, financial support from local governments. However, maintenance and update of disease surveillance in county-level rural areas has relatively been neglected, leading to a regional imbalance between urban and rural areas [7] . Furthermore, despite the relative supremacy of urban disease surveillance infrastructure over its rural counterpart, it still has some limitations. In urban areas, for instance, most public health resources are concentrated in tertiary hospitals and central public health departments, while disease surveillance infrastructure in community-level health service centers needs to be strengthened. Better pathogen-based surveillance infrastructure for disease detection in urban areas and a more rapid response to infectious disease outbreaks is needed to ensure the risks of transmission are minimized in areas of high population density [16] . It is imperative, therefore, that initiatives and actions to maintain and update rural disease surveillance infrastructure be taken, whilst concomitantly reinforcing and optimizing urban disease surveillance infrastructure.",42.98563017376966,18.907554257661573

In Mati, financial support for dengue control was coming to an end, which prompted the municipal health authorities to incorporate dengue control within their health system, utilizing local infrastructure and safeguarding regular allocation of funds for vector-borne disease control in local budgeting. Yet, many municipalities with dengue prevalence may lack such resources and, thus, sufficient national funds should be allotted to the control of this neglected disease. The engagement of barangay leaders and existing community structures helped mobilize local resources and voluntary services for vector control. Barangay authorities and the community in Simbalan were actively involved in the planning, implementation and evaluation of malaria control actions, indicative of local programme ownership. Moreover, their vision statement to become independent from external resources for malaria control is particularly relevant in the context of malaria elimination because continued commitment to surveillance and outbreak response will be needed [33] . Nevertheless, the challenge remains for its leaders to maintain the commitment to malaria prevention when in future the memory of the past malaria burden may fade away. Several supporting factors were apparent in Simbalan: provision of training and guidance by health agencies; local government leadership; and a spirit of community volunteerism, or bayanihan, a common tradition in Philippine towns [34] .

The global polio eradication mandate allows the GPEI to mobilize resources to respond to outbreaks anywhere in the world, including support for response to diseases other than polio. For example, when the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak occurred, the global polio laboratory network played a key role in the early response activities and laboratory characterization of the virus. More recently, the GPEI played a critical role in outbreak response to the Ebola virus in Africa and helped contain the Ebola virus importation into Nigeria [60] . With respect to polio, the GPEI demonstrated that it can overcome the challenge of improving access in areas not controlled by the central government and in numerous war-torn areas, including Cameroon, Iraq, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Ukraine. In many outbreak situations, the GPEI coordinated the provision of other human services in addition to polio immunization. Providing these services often enabled polio vaccination to occur [61] , although offering these services represents a use of GPEI resources that some may perceive as not directly supporting polio eradication. The current global capacity for providing necessary health services in response to health system disruptions represents a resource that could disappear once the GPEI gets disbanded. Our review suggests the need to maintain this type of capacity, which other efforts to eradicate vaccine-preventable diseases will likely need.",40.87055742060935,16.671893796926025

Training and certification of vast number of health care providers to use POC diagnostics, and ensuring an effective supply chain for tests and drugs across the country present an enormous challenge to health systems that are already suffering from a critical shortage of human resources. Quality assurance systems, that include providing proficiency testing, sites visits, and corrective action, are essential to ensure that accurate results are being used to guide treatment decisions, and to ensure that control strategies are based on accurate surveillance data. Studies have shown that deployment of POC diagnostics can be an opportunity to improve health outcomes and strengthen health systems [29] [30] [31] . Overcoming challenges will in turn motivate health care workers and increase capacity and efficiency to test and treat appropriately. RDT introduction and implementation must be culturally sensitive and accompanied by an inter-connected system to monitor the necessary processes.

Investigations of the initial phase of this epidemic, as well as previous outbreaks, have highlighted the potential role of within-hospital transmission before or shortly after Ebola is identified as the causative agent [37, 38] . Here we found that hospitalisation, defined broadly as anything from visiting a clinic to admission to an ETU, reduced transmission risk, showing that prompt hospitalisation may be an effective intervention as long as appropriate control measures are applied. However, hospitalisation did not eliminate transmission risk, indicating that improvements in infection control are needed in many health care settings. It should be noted that the meaning of date of hospitalisation may be different among cases, depending on how many and which types of facilities they visited in the course of their disease, and furthermore that there is potential for misclassification in the recording or interpretation of information on hospitalisation. In particular, while the health care facility of first admission was commonly reported, patient transfers to other facilities may not have always been recorded. Thus, there may be ambiguity about the type of health care facility a case was in at a particular time. Such missing information reduces our ability to resolve differences between types of facilities in their effectiveness at implementing case isolation, which could lead to underestimation of differences between facility types in isolation effectiveness. However, our results are broadly consistent with analyses of the outbreak in Conakry [29] . Half of reported non-funeral exposures where the matched contact was eventually hospitalised occurred after the reported date of hospitalisation. These results underscore the importance of further improving infection control in all health care facilities, but particularly in non-ETUs. However, in contexts where hospital bed capacity is insufficient or infection control in health care settings is imperfect, greater consideration might be given to measures to reduce within-family exposure-for example, via education and/or providing a home protection kit with hand disinfectant, protective equipment, and clear guidance for those caring for sick family members.",37.95444663715186,16.24155559463439

Although primarily in coastal locations, the zoos are situated in a variety of geographic and climatic zones, and in both urban and rural settings. This source of surveillance information does not stand alone, but complements other sources of data. The program also allows clear identification of geographic areas where general surveillance is of lower intensity, which is valuable for planning and assessment of risk. As described, the scope of the project resulted in the collection of only a small proportion of the total caseload of the zoo wildlife hospitals into the eWHIS database (1-8%). The majority of cases presenting to zoo wildlife hospitals involve orphaned animals and cases involving dog, cat or vehicular trauma.

Moving health care provision from a central, hospital-based model to a networked, distributed model will save money, improve outcomes, facilitate access, improve security, and increase patient and provider satisfaction.

The law laid out five meaningful uses of an electronic record: quality, engagement of patients and families, improved care coordination, improved population health and public health, and privacy protection. Making health care digital and interoperable rapidly made distance irrelevant to practice. The act is currently in its second iteration of requirements and in 2015 is challenged to demonstrate improved outcomes [33] . The US Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010 offers hope for near universal coverage and the emphasis on patient rights, access, affordability, and a coherent funding plan has seen millions of new insurance beneficiaries [34] . If the HITECH initiative made the EMR a prime tool for telemedicine, the ACA created a surge in demand for health care that exceeds capacity. The American Association of Medical Colleges predicts that by 2025, the US will have a shortfall of 25,000 to 50,000 physicians [29] . A shortfall of surgeons is also predicted by the Lancet 2030 article [35] . Task shifting can help to reduce this shortage of physicians by utilizing simulation and augmented reality technologies under Cybercare. The situation in nursing is even more dire. Instead of relying on nurses, a patient's family members, with proper training, could provide the necessary care. That implies no change in the established, long-revered practice pattern (called incident care) whereby a patient recognizes a problem, seeks a medical encounter, gets examined, and treated. Unfortunately we cannot staff medicine in the same way for what now is needed: the long-term management of chronic disease in an aging population.

VFR travelers typically take longer trips, stay in local homes or accommodations, eat locally prepared meals, and take fewer pretravel precautions.

During the epidemic, education authorities need to develop online portals and web-based applications to deliver lectures or other teaching activities [34] . As young people are more receptive towards smartphone applications [35] , health authorities could consider providing online or smartphone-based psychoeducation and psychological interventions (e.g., cognitive behavior therapy, CBT) to reduce risk of virus transmission by face-to-face therapy. Online platforms could also provide a support network for those people spending most of their time at home during the epidemic. We found that the general public with no formal education had a greater likelihood of depression during the epidemic. Local agencies need to provide information in a diagrammatic or audio format in simple languages to support those with no educational background during the epidemic.",34.4268980560411,16.276928741554233

This modeling effort identified several geographic areas of predicted risk for rabies detection. Further, variables were identified by our modeling approach that influenced the distribution of rabies detection throughout the State, specifically the relevance of human infrastructure. A major limitation of our modeling approach was the way most of the data informing the model were collected. Rabies testing in Alaska is largely performed by the public health system with a focus, and consequent bias, towards human exposures. Vast areas in Alaska such as wilderness areas remain largely unstudied for wildlife diseases including rabies. Because of this, knowledge of rabies distribution and ecology Alaska is rather poor and biased through a human-focused detection system. The current pragmatic focus on possible human exposure could skew our model towards ignoring the true role of areas further away from human infrastructure as a variable responsible for majorly influencing the predicted presence of wildlife rabies. However, if one considers our models as an approach to determine possible risk for humans to encounter the rabies virus, this possible bias will still be very reflective of a threat to human health. On the other hand, this bias is likely leading to an underestimation of rabies cases in Alaska. It is still limiting our ability to identify additional variables influencing rabies distribution in remote areas that are relatively unaffected by human activity. Arguably, one wants to know and use as many predictors as possible to test and describe rabies outbreaks, instead of just a parsimonious one.",34.87135543495628,12.72224680458083

In contrast, the information and infrastructure supporting evidence-based veterinary medical practice in all of the above elements are less developed due to less public funding being made available to the veterinary side as compared to human health care (9) . The EBP resources include websites that provide processed information on best available research evidence which are critically appraised, integrated, concisely summarized, and regularly updated as new research evidence becomes available. Distilling and disseminating evidence, a process of knowledge translation, which evaluates relevance and applicability in various scenarios, is made accessible to health providers and those making policy decisions. These EBP resources are either freely accessible or via subscription. Access to such resources addresses several barriers identified by health care decision makers regarding access to evidence-based information, including limitations of time and lack of knowledge regarding resources that synthesize, summarize, and assess evidence for quality.

All 5 behaviors were prioritized by the USAID Zika response across 20 countries, and included interventions such as regional mass media campaigns, household and school-based SBC activities, household visits by vector control technicians, community fairs, and health care provider counseling. Several key products were developed and made available to implementing partners to facilitate the incorporation of the findings of the process, including a list of priority behaviors and detailed guidance on how to correctly perform each behavior for maximum effectiveness (through a Behavior Matrix [Supplement 1], Technical Specifications Content Guide [Supplement 2], and a job aid). These products were useful for SBC programs to reconfigure and refine their messages as they continued to implement their SBC interventions. Many partners reported that the guidance provided a basis to focus their limited remaining resources and to attain the needed specificity for each behavior to be effectively implemented. The iterative, collaborative process of defining behaviors across all stakeholders was critical to ensuring a more harmonized and feasible response. This process strives to incorporate evidence where it is available and was refined as the work developed, allowing it to be responsive to new evidence and contextualized based on input and expertise from those on the ground.

However, earlier detection of the first case provides greater time in which to prepare and deliver an effective reactive intervention. The later the first detection occurs, the more critical it becomes to deliver the intervention rapidly. When the first detection is the fifth actual case (""FD = 5"") a delay of 4 weeks before burial practices are changed reduces the likelihood of control from 89% to 78%, but when the first detection is the twenty-fifth actual case (""FD = 25"") a delay of 4 weeks before burial practices are changed reduces this from 45% to 23%. Starting with a baseline case ascertainment of 80% and a small health care system (0.1% of population are HCWs, 1:15 and 1:50 ratio of bed and contact-tracing capacities to HCWs, as above), this figure shows the effect of doubling both the health care capacity and the health care workforce at different times after the first detected case. This increase in capacity represents the transition from a small health care system to a medium health care system, as defined in Fig 5. This clearly shows the importance of early detection; the time delay in delivering the additional capacity is less important over this timescale of 0-8 weeks, because the existing health care system is capable of accommodating patients in the early stage of the outbreak. As expected, reducing the force of infection from both dead bodies and from infectious individuals in the community has a dramatic effect on disease transmission and substantially increases the likelihood of control (Fig 9) .

Training and certification of vast number of health care providers to use POC diagnostics, and ensuring an effective supply chain for tests and drugs across the country present an enormous challenge to health systems that are already suffering from a critical shortage of human resources. Quality assurance systems, that include providing proficiency testing, sites visits, and corrective action, are essential to ensure that accurate results are being used to guide treatment decisions, and to ensure that control strategies are based on accurate surveillance data. Studies have shown that deployment of POC diagnostics can be an opportunity to improve health outcomes and strengthen health systems [29] [30] [31] . Overcoming challenges will in turn motivate health care workers and increase capacity and efficiency to test and treat appropriately. RDT introduction and implementation must be culturally sensitive and accompanied by an inter-connected system to monitor the necessary processes.

Prior to the 2014-2016 EVD outbreak, federal guidance stated that all lab testing on patients suspected to have certain highly infectious pathogens (such as EVD) could only be performed in a biosafety level (BSL)-4 laboratory, while most hospitals only have BSL-2 laboratory facilities. Although the CDC provided guidance during the EVD epidemic that was intended to permit appropriate clinical testing outside of BSL-4 labs, these changes were not accepted by many. Many laboratory leaders were concerned about staff safety and impact on use of equipment for routine laboratory studies after processing a sample that could contain EVD [18] . Therefore, clinical and laboratory leaders must jointly decide on the basic menu of laboratory tests to support and to ensure adequate clinical care of the patient with the resources available. Some hospitals have elected to rely on bedside point-of-care testing devices to support much of this need, as the devices eliminate the need to utilize the large, automated laboratory machines. Because malaria is commonly in the differential diagnosis for many PUIs for EVD or other viral hemorrhagic fever, it is important that the hospital have a mechanism for testing for malaria as part of the basic clinical evaluation. To limit the potential spread of biological contamination outside of the patient's room, special procedures must be developed to properly clean and package blood and other biological samples before they leave the room for transport to the hospital lab. Testing for the pathogen of concern is likely to be coordinated through the state public health laboratory. While commercial assays are available for some of these pathogens, public health laboratories will assist in confirmation of the diagnosis or excluding the diagnosis.

But noncompliance has been rife. 20 In short, it is not enough to detect early warnings of outbreaks, especially because the level of false positive signals is high. Many developing countries lack the infrastructure to conduct followup verification and response efforts, and the WHO currently lacks the resources to assist them. Without an effective verification and response system, the media attention resulting from an early warning can cause unnecessary economic havoc as other countries impose excessive restrictions to international trade and travel, or can lead to a diversion of scarce resources from basic health and nutrition programs to infectious disease control that may not make sense for the local population.

While the term ""capability"" is most commonly used as a synonym for ""capacity,"" another seam in the literature (Barbera and Macintyre 2002; Binns, Sheppeard, and Staff 2010; Felland et al. 2008; Hanfling 2006; Hick et al. , 2008a has attempted to define a separate identity for the ""capability"" concept. This revolves around its designation to denote the availability and adequacy of specialized resources and skills needed to meet the needs of a specific injury group, such as burn victims. While it is useful to explicitly recognize that the treatment of disaster-induced injury profiles will likely require specialized equipment and skills, the value added by defining an additional concept in this way is unclear and, in its current form, may undermine attempts to develop standardized and comparable metrics. Kelen and McCarthy (2006, 1089) proposed an alternative approach, advocating the concept of ""surge response capability"" as a means to capture ""the extent to which surge capacity (. . . resource availability and maximized management . . .) can accommodate the surge (. . . demand for resources . . .)."" This, then, presents surge capability as a measure that enables the proportion of surge cases that the available resources can accommodate to be quantified. This might usefully inform mathematical modeling to estimate the existing capacity and to reveal potential shortfalls. This potential remains untested, since there has been little engagement with (or application of) this proposed definition.

This conceptualization was articulated clearly by Hick and colleagues , who defined surge capacity as ""the ability to manage a sudden, unexpected increase in patient volume that would otherwise severely challenge or exceed the present capacity"" (Hick et al. 2004, 1) of either an individual facility or the wider health care system ). This latter point demonstrates another common variation in published definitions, related to the site(s) at which ""surge capacity"" is deemed applicable. There is also variation in the unit of analysis employed by different studies. While some authors limit the concept to the individual facility 5 or single department (usually the emergency department or ICU), 6 the importance of embedding facilities within the wider health system's context is increasingly stressed. 7 Two broad applications are apparent, consistent with the priorities and objectives of the agencies involved. The first entails the concept's increasing occurrence in international guidelines and best practices. An early example of this is the United Kingdom's Department of Health's published guidelines on pandemic management (DoH 2009). Its approach is consistent with that advocated by Kelen and colleagues, which we discuss in some detail later. In its publication Hospital Emergency Response Checklist: An All-Hazards Tool for Hospital Administrators and Emergency Managers, the World Health Organization (WHO) took the lead in promoting ""surge capacity"" as a component of international good practice (2011b). This report advocates surge capacity as one of nine ""key components"" of health systems' disaster readiness (the remaining eight are command and control, communication, safety and security, triage, continuity of essential services, human resources, logistics and supply management, and postdisaster recovery). ""Surge capacity"" is broken down into thirteen key sites of action, centered on calculating baseline resources, estimating surge requirements, and identifying gaps to be addressed. It follows the academic literature's emphasis on the ""four S's"" of surge capacity (staff, stuff, structure, and systems) and, while concentrating on the facility level, notes the need to attend to the potential to mobilize extrinsic resources in line with the wider health systems approach. The WHO draws explicitly on the 2009 pandemic guidance (DoH 2009) issued by the United Kingdom's Department of Health. The second, and more common, use of the term (without the ""health systems'"" prefix) is in its application to the ability of humanitarian and aid agencies to scale up their own operational capacity in response to sudden-onset needs (Emmens and Houghton 2008; Houghton and Emmens 2007) .",39.67230312747093,15.793292389838061

By employing liquid handling robotics, reaction master mixes and extracts can be automatically dispensed into plates, greatly reducing staff input and time. Throughput can be further dramatically increased by the use of 384well plates instead of standard 96-well plates: a 4-fold increase in capacity per run. In this way it is possible to run thousands of real-time assays in a week: for example, running a single 384-well realtime machine at five plates per day, 5 days per week, with samples in duplicate and controls, gives you the capacity to test around 4500 samples.

Current hospital reliance on ""just-in-time"" and stockless material management systems to reduce storage and inventory costs 14 leave institutions with vulnerably low reserves of key consumables and durable medical equipment. 15 Critical care equipment is no exception (Lewis Rubinson, MD, PhD; unpublished data; December 2007), so the quantity of additional critically ill patients a hospital can care for without resupply is impressively small.

[1] [2] [3] A robust response to a large-scale infectious disease outbreak is predicated, in part, on coordination between public health and health care delivery systems. 1, 4, 5 Hospital pandemic preparedness plans typically include protocols for handling a surge of infectious patients. 6 Hospitals need to respond rapidly if they are among the first impacted by a highly contagious outbreak. 7 Most U.S. hospitals use negative-pressure airborne infection isolation rooms (AIIRs) to house patients with suspected or confirmed airborne transmissible infections. The pressure difference between an AIIR and the hospital corridor is recommended to be −2.5 Pa in the United States. 8, 9 It is also recommended to have an air exchange rate (AER) of 12 air changes per hour (ACH), of which 2 ACHs must be outside air in an AIIR. 2, 8 In approximately one-half of urban hospitals, only 2%-4% of rooms are equipped with negative pressure. 10 The number of patients needing health care services may rapidly exceed such a small AIIR capacity during an airborne transmissible pandemic or bioterror event. 11 There are no regulations stipulating surge capacity requirements for U.S. hospitals. Guidance for intensive care unit capacity has been published, ranging from a 20%-300% increase in bed numbers, depending on the type of incident. 5, 6, [11] [12] [13] [14] One option to meet capacity needs would be to implement a temporary negativepressure isolation ward that could house a large number of patients. To date, there are few studies detailing the effectiveness of temporary isolation wards to be used during a surge. Rosenbaum et al demonstrated during a hospital disaster preparedness drill that multiple high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA)-filtered negative air machines placed in a physical therapy gymnasium produced the recommended pressure and AER for negative-pressure isolation. 15 In another demonstration, a 3-unit temporary patient shelter was constructed out of plastic sheeting and ventilated using negativeair machines. 16 Containment was estimated using fluorescent tracer particles, and very high levels of containment were achieved (>99%) with AERs of 15 ACHs.",39.24586857655596,17.26497909878326

Singapore's response to SARS in 2003 illustrates the importance of being able to increase surge capacity swiftly to deal with an infectious disease outbreak. In the Asia Pacific region, this problem continues to hamper many countries' ability to combat infectious diseases (Putthasri et al. 2009 ). For many public health organizations in Asia, it is a matter of fact that they are unable to deal with pandemics because the resources to do so are simply absent (Balkhy 2008; Hanvoravongchai et al. 2010; Lai 2012b; Oshitani et al. 2008) . Meanwhile, there are evidences which suggest that surge capacity alone is not the full answer. For example, during the SARS outbreak, abundant resources contribute an important but not all-encompassing element in the fight against these pandemics. As it turned out, when different stakeholders brought to the task-at-hand their unique skill sets and resources, they actually complicated the fight due to their lack of synergy. In fact, abundant resources without synergy might even undermine collaborative efforts. Therefore, it is essential that the ability to link up various stakeholders must be complemented by some type of synergy between them. Such ability can be enhanced through close collaboration. This brings us to the third implication for disaster management: collaborative governance at regional level.",32.63286396426199,12.411675780979628

EMCC planning and implementation, though, cannot occur in isolation from the rest of the preparedness and response efforts of the hospital. Individual hospitals, too, are cautioned against preparing in isolation, and are encouraged to coordinate with other local health-care entities because resource and planning obligations can be met more efficiently when shared among all local healthcare institutions (health-care coalition; 19 for this article, health-care coalition refers to an organization that coordinates local health-care entities; for communities without formal coalition organizations, the reader should consider the term coalition to refer to the loosely organized local health-care system entities together with the local public health organization). Critical care providers should therefore work with both hospital and coalition partners to ensure that critical care services are considered for and integrated into planning for health-care system surge capacity. This coordination of preparedness activities will allow for uniform implementation of altered critical care processes by all hospitals, when warranted during a disaster. 4 Hospitals cannot be expected to prepare for endless quantities of critically ill patients. Critical care surge capacity benchmarks must be defined. Guidance to date has remained elusive, though. Loosely To ensure the availability of essential critical care interventions, the Working Group recommends that hospitals give priority to interventions that fulfill the following criteria: (1) interventions that have been shown or are deemed by critical care expert best professional judgment to improve survival, and without which death is likely; (2) interventions that do not require extraordinarily expensive equipment; and (3) interventions that can be implemented without consuming extensive staff or hospital resources. Hospitals should plan to be able to deliver the following during EMCC: basic mode(s) of mechanical ventilation, hemodynamic support, antibiotic or other disease-specific countermeasure therapy, and a small set of prophylactic interventions that are recognized to reduce the serious adverse consequences of critical illness. Hospitals should plan to be able to administer IV fluid resuscitation and vasopressors to large numbers of hemodynamically unstable victims, and stockpile sufficient equipment to do this without relying on external resources for at least the first 48 h of the hospital medical response. Hospitals should plan to provide at least two widely accepted prophylactic interventions that are used every day in critical care: (1) maintaining the head of a mechanically ventilated patient's bed at a 45°angle to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia, and (2) derived benchmarks for mass casualty surge capacity have been previously promulgated (eg, triage, treat, and initially stabilize 500 victims with an infectious disease per 1 million people), 20,21 but they lack enough detail to translate into critical care surge capacity goals. Scientifically rigorous derivation of the benchmarks is desirable. The Task Force spoke with a number of modeling experts to see if accurate surge capacity goals could be developed across the range of plausible mass critical care events (eg, earthquakes, epidemics, chemical exposures). Owing to the limited historical data for such events and the numerous imprecise assumptions within the models, the Task Force was informed that the uncertainties currently limit even sophisticated models from confidently predicting critical care capacity goals.",39.35095732206959,18.799738692027333

In recognition of these informational shortcomings, the tiers suggested by the Task Force are based on criteria that are more likely to be known and rapidly assessed in the middle of a response: (1) expert staff assessment of current risk for harm to critically ill patients at hospitals, (2) hospital response actions, and (3) external response actions (health-care coalition 19 through federal response actions [ Table 3 ]). The tiers were designed to be consistent with a wellaccepted framework for disaster medical response. 19 The real-time data problem is not the only reason the Task Force does not define response tiers by ratios of patients to resources (eg, ICU beds). Simple counts of critical care patients and resource availability may not accurately reflect whether hospitals are functioning in a normal manner or are dangerously overwhelmed. Not reflected in the numbers is the clinical acuity of patients as well as the need for resource-intensive procedures (eg, renal replacement therapy) and specialized care (pediatrics and burn care), all variables that can significantly influence critical care resource requirements. Five patients with multiorgan system failure and hemodynamic instability may have greater critical care resource requirements than 15 patients with respiratory failure and no other organ dysfunction. Similarly, capability provided by critical care resources cannot be completely defined by simple counts of staff, treatment space, or medical equipment.

Over the years, the rapid proliferation of smart technological apps has resulted in several bundles of such apps trending towards new ways of delivering mobile health care services. In the past, apps and online social networks were disjointed ways to support mobile heath care [37] . Recently, a number of mobile health care apps have supported the forming of online social networks [38] . Some of these apps are based on the co-work of participants, while others are peer-led (i.e., led by people who have more experience or professional knowledge). In contrast, some apps for online social networking, such as Facebook and Line, have been applied to support mobile health care. People share health care related information and discuss with each other in such online social networks. In addition, rich multimedia, virtual reality, and augmented reality are also incorporated into a mobile health care app to provide vivid experiences of distant health care delivery [39] . In the past, it was pads or smart glasses that were usually adopted to support such functions [ 40 , 41 ] . However, advances in smart phone technologies and the several advantages of a smart phone (e.g., light weight, unobtrusiveness, etc.) have made it a more suitable alternative in recent years. Users with visual impairments usually rely on voice-based instructions. However, this is not possible in some situations such as meetings, crowded places, and noisy environments. To overcome this challenge, Porzi et al. [42] combined the use of a smart watch and a smart phone to develop a gesture recognition system for visual impaired users. When the smart watch detects a gesture made by the user, it will then transmit a signal to the smart phone to activate certain devices such as the screen or a camera. Where the camera is used to capture an image, the image could then be compared with several predefined images, representing certain risk, a specific location, or a facility. After that, the result is transmitted to the user via smart phone vibrations.",38.31431422304639,14.258515570412426

Preparedness through risk mitigation strategies for the public, patient and providers are warranted and should be informed by available evidence and our collective, global experience. The gaps in evidence that we face also need to be addressed during this pandemic to guide international consensus and inform preparedness measures for future outbreaks. Limiting ambulatory care services to time-sensitive or urgent conditions, particularly in high-volume specialties such as ophthalmology, have also been recommended to reduce the potential for transmission in the community and physician offices.

We should probably focus on average daily maintained beds because the health effects of disasters tend to be felt most acutely in days to weeks and are not averaged over a year and because a real patient needs an actual staffed bed, not just a licensed one. Surge capacity calculated according to average daily maintained beds may give cause for concern since more than half the time hospital occupancy was higher than 85% (a rate associated with delayed inpatient bed availability); about a quarter of the time, the occupancy rate was higher than 90% (a rate associated with bed crises); and about three quarters of the time, bed availability decreased below the federal standard of 500 unoccupied beds available per million residents in the event of a mass casualty incident. 1, 6 Yet these results raise a question: if you can't always get what you want (occupancy rates meeting the regulatory standard), can you still get what you need (sufficient surge capacity to respond effectively to a catastrophe)? To answer this, consider the elements that constitute surge capacity in a disaster. The capacity of a hospital to meet a surge in demand is not only about its bed count but also about the personnel, treatment spaces, operating rooms, sophisticated equipment, and supplies that are needed before and after the patient gets into a bed. Most of these elements cannot be stockpiled and hauled out of storage when needed. Therefore, a simple count of available beds, however calculated, may give a false sense of alarm (or security) about the true surge capacity within a health care system.",37.83032869892057,16.296631537465824

Emergency physicians would then confront difficult challenges in expanding capacity and in triaging patients. Recent experiences with SARS, anthrax, and Hantavirus suggest we will have enough physicians who remain to treat patients, even if they are at significant risk.

This identified lack of a surge capacity plan is similar to previously published literature. 6, 7 In addition, almost a quarter of U.S. hospitals do not have plans to care for patients at an off-site/ non-health care facility, such as a community center, sports arena, or hotel; this is a necessary component of surge capacity planning as evidenced by the nation's response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. 14 A large proportion of health care facilities report that they do not have enough health care providers to accommodate an influx of any number of patients, and of those that can handle a surge, they can only manage #50 patients.

It is critical, however, that hospitals of all sizes continue to develop plans for obtaining extra staff to respond during an infectious disease emergency, because this will affect a hospital's ability to care for patients.

Examples of such clinical care activities include infection control measures, medication management procedures, the design of the physical environment, and information management. These critical clinical care functions often are assumed to be present and functioning at an optimal level to support the investigator's study; however, investigators and/or institutional review boards (IRBs) may lack formal processes to assess the capacity of the clinical environment to support the study under review.

Failure to do so may lead to situations that are ethically compromising and undermine public trust, such as when access to critical care resources is denied based on crisis standards by one institution without referral to a nearby institution capable of providing critical care. Regions should institute an Incident Management System (IMS) at the facility, local, regional or state, and national level to exercise command and control over scarce resources. 16 Furthermore, decision-makers should communicate with community emergency services and local hospitals to ensure a coordinated approach to patient transfers, standards of care, and resource allocation. 16 , 17 2. We suggest critical care only be rationed when resources have, or will shortly be, overwhelmed despite all eff orts at augmentation and a regional-level authority that holds the legal authority and adequate situational awareness has declared an emergency and activated its mass critical care plan. A basic tenet of ethically conducted triage is that the degree of rationing through triage is proportionate to the anticipated or realized shortfall in resources. 18 Th erefore, the rationing of critical care should be held as a last resort and only implemented when all eff orts have been made to optimize the use of resources. Th e task force considers all eff orts at augmentation to include all attempts to acquire scarce critical resources or to transfer patients to other health-care facilities that are able to provide care (state, national, and even international partner institutions). 19 In rapidly evolving disasters, critical care may need to be rationed before the appropriate authority has declared an emergency or activated its mass critical care plan, but this should only be done in exceptional circumstances. Similarly, in some jurisdictions, the relevant authority will be responsible for declaring an emergency and activating a mass critical care plan but may not have statutory powers. Nevertheless, a decision to ration critical care should not be made unilaterally at an institutional level because individual institutions do not possess the situational awareness in isolation to operationally or ethically justify such a decision. Similarly, the decision to cease triage should occur in a graduated and coordinated manner by altering the prioritization criteria and exclusion thresholds as resources become available. 19 3.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak raised the specter of entire hospitals becoming disabled because of quarantine and therefore unavailable to respond to the needs of the general public. SARS also introduced North American and other countries' governments and health care leaders to the modern concept of a massive population of acutely ill patients requiring high-level care during a short period, with the potential to overwhelm hospital ED and inpatient resources. More recently, concern about management options for possible human cases associated with H5N1 (avian) influenza is prompting a further reevaluation of our system capacities and infection control procedures. 2 The threat of an epidemic outbreak of an acute infectious disease or of a large population exposure to a biological or chemical agent also challenges current systems in terms of ""surge capacity,"" the ability to rapidly increase capacity to provide effective, if limited, care to a significantly increased volume of acute care patients. The need to protect health care providers from possible infection, exposure, or contamination and to limit the potential for disease-causing agents to spread to other patients requires additional capacity. In addition, in case of mass casualty or epidemic in the community, effective containment systems in which suspected cases can be isolated are required even as patients are receiving lifesaving care. Currently, EDs in Canada, the United States, and elsewhere are challenged by large numbers of acutely ill patients and reduced numbers of inpatient beds, leading to ED crowding. Crowding is identified as a root cause of ambulance diversions, and even the relatively small increase in patient volume associated with the traditional influenza season increases the amount of time EDs are unable to accept patients. 3 Little attention to date has been paid to the potential response for mass casualty caused by organisms capable of human-to-human spread through airborne contact. Although the likelihood of such an epidemic is unknown, recent analyses related to possible human-to-human spread of the H5N1 influenza virus suggest catastrophic effects on individuals and the health care system. The Government Accounting Office has found that many hospitals lack the capacity to respond to largescale infectious disease outbreaks and lack adequate equipment and isolation facilities. 4 EDs and hospitals generally have limited isolation capability, and much of this is concentrated in tertiary care facilities and major teaching hospitals. There exists no feasible contingency plan through which a large-scale escalation of ED and hospital isolation potential could be provided on short notice, and the construction of permanent, large-capacity isolation facilities is cost-prohibitive.",36.77679307894703,17.026609053938376

Other emerging disease threats, including severe acute respiratory syndrome and H5N1, have caused focal outbreaks in which some support could be provided from central level.

For example, attention can be paid to how this equipment is deployed. The sheer number and entanglement of lines found around the bedside of a critically ill patient has the potential to elevate both the number of hospital-acquired infections and medical error. One promising approach to exploring solutions for the ICU's physical environment is through the science of human factor engineering. An ergonomically based redesign of patient care areas in the ICU, together with changes to its care delivery systems, could improve both the work environment and patient outcomes [14] . For such a redesign process to be successful, health care providers, architects, engineers, manufacturers, funders, regulators, accrediting bodies, researchers, and members of the public must work together to design convenient, safe, and functional patient care areas. A number of ICUs have done so already; we have much to learn from them. One suggestion is to work with those professional societies who represent the critical care workforce to design and disseminate solutions. Taking a leadership position in publicizing the sometimes harsh working environment of an ICU, together with a call for support of interdisciplinary research to study not only how to design new ICUs, but how to ""retrofit"" older ICUs to enhance their design in a way that is more conducive to the physical and emotional health of our critical care workforce, is something on which our critical care societies should easily agree.",42.08866687362203,19.70975931595448

ICIs in developing countries may present unique opportunities for students to develop a greater appreciation for cultural differences, resource management, and community health needs. Our findings suggest that ICIs in developing countries may be beneficial to PT students both because the skills and experiences gained in these internships can contribute positively to their personal and professional development and because students develop more interest in and gain a better appreciation of health issues affecting developing communities. Similarly, research has demonstrated that international health experiences help students in other health disciplines to acquire knowledge and skills relevant to appreciating patients' cultural differences, the multi-factorial influences on health, problem-solving skills, and evidence-based medicine. 17, [19] [20] [21] Research also suggests that international education opportunities foster an appreciation for the impact of globalization on health care delivery and help strengthen the commitment to practice in under-served areas. 18, 21 Our findings suggest that whether students worked alongside or were supervised by members of other health professions, ICIs incorporating IPE were positive learning experiences. Research has demonstrated that IPE has led to improved communication among health professionals, which facilitates goal setting and clarifies patient objectives, ultimately improving patient care. 29 Collaboration between professionals can also increase cultural knowledge and provide solutions in situations where cultural differences affect health care delivery. 30, 31 ICIs allow student exposure to global health issues in settings where inter-professional relationships can enhance the successful delivery of health care.

A person's score would derive from an aggregation of measurements including those of respiratory function, blood pressure, cardiac condition, neurological responses, organ failure, and age. Depending on the score, a patient would be placed in a category designated by color. Red category patients are the highest priority. These include sick individuals who are more likely to recover if they receive intensive care, though unlikely to recover without such care. Yellow signifies intermediate priority, for very sick patients who may or may not benefit from critical care. They could receive such care if resources are available, though not at the expense of the needs of people in the red category. People in the two remaining color categories would not receive critical care at all. Green covers persons well enough to be treated without intensive intervention. Blue signifies patients who are so ill they should not receive critical care, only palliative measures. 39 How effective this protocol would be in the event of a disease outbreak, whether of deliberate or natural origin, is uncertain. But the study underscores the need to reconfigure traditional understandings of ethics. The authors acknowledge that under normal circumstances, all patients should have a claim to the health care they need. But when faced with bioterrorism or other large-scale disaster, individual rights and needs may be restricted in the interest of the larger community. Certain terrorist acts may generate unique ethical challenges. For example, a terrorist who unintentionally survives a suicide bombing may be critically wounded, as are the people he targeted. Although some of his victims may be less severely injured than the terrorist, would treating them first be morally acceptable? If so, does this mean by extension that in a mass casualty event, some should receive priority treatment apart from severity of injury, but rather based on their age or perceived value to society? Existing ethical codes of healthcare organizations provide little guidance about such questions.

Although guided by a market Health Care in China approach, the central government has responded to growing public criticism for affordable access to health care services with greater financial risk protection from outof-pocket spending on health services. Funding for health care in China derives from several newly enacted governmental sources. 12 They include subsidies to rural and urban residents not covered by the Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI) program through the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) or the Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance Program (URBMI), respectively. With a goal of increasing funding to cover at least 75% and 50% for hospital admissions and outpatient services, more than 96% of the population is covered together by NCMS, URBMI, and UEBMI. There has been a parallel increase in governmental health service coverage for hospital payments. Primary health care providers receive governmental funds to deliver a package of basic health services. Health care providers and government-appointed hospital officials, motivated by profits and behavior similar to other for-profit organizations, have been incentivized to prescribe excessive and high-tech diagnostic tests and to prescribe pharmaceuticals to earn profits for later distribution.

Low-resource settings, including those among marginalized populations and rural environments in high-income countries, often face considerable human resource shortages within health care, as well as broader infrastructural inadequacies and barriers to prevention and treatment programs. These barriers may include inadequate local health system infrastructures; poor public infrastructure such as roads, schools, and telecommunications; cultural and linguistic barriers; low literacy rates; lack of health insurance; costs of medicines and therapies; advanced presentation of disease; lack of provider access to continuing education; and underutilization of available resources. Medical students should be aware of the realities of health care delivery in resource-poor settings and standards of clinical appropriateness in different environments. Further, students who travel abroad to participate in elective programs in low-resource settings should receive appropriate specialized orientation and training.

These closures prevent contact among children and reduce cases. However, closing schools has down sides, even if the only goal of the measure is to save lives during an epidemic. Closing schools can inadvertently cause childcare shortages that strain the health-care system. A study by Lempel and colleagues 1 estimated that child-care obligations associated with school closures could reduce key medical personnel by 6-19% . Under standing these trade-offs is important for planning the public health response to COVID-19, because if the survival of patients who are infected is sufficiently sensitive to declines in the health-care labour force, then school closures might increase deaths.

The combination of shrinking budget allocations for social services and the entry of private actors into health care resulted in a contraction of service provision (Armada et al. 2001; Oppong 2001) . While ideally private competition would create more effective, competitively priced service delivery, such a theory was based upon a notion that all markets are equally attractive. This simply did not prove to be the case. For example, in some rural areas sparse population and the low income levels meant that economies of scale for health care delivery could never be realized, and that people would not be able to pay for medical care (World Bank 2004) . These two factors alone would be enough to dissuade private health care providers from operating in the area. It would be difficult to get a single private enterprise to provide services, let alone allow for competition. 3 With the lack of private entrants in the high cost, high risk areas, provision falls to the public sector. However, with constrained fiscal and human resources, and in some cases the loss of more profitable markets to the private sector, the public sector proved not capable of providing adequate levels or types of health services (Oppong 2001; Smith-Nonini 2000; World Bank 2004) .

In other cases, decentralization actually increased cost of service delivery (World Bank 2004) . In El Salvador, for instance, despite overall increases in public funding of health care, the funds which were allocated to the rural sectors decreased in part because the government, following a model of increased competition, contracted with NGOs to provide health care (Smith-Nonini 2000) . In African, Latin American and Asian nations, decreases in public spending and resultant low levels of salaries for health care professionals created a 'brain drain' with medical staff either concentrating in urban areas or relocating to other countries which offered higher wages (Oppong 2001; World Bank 2004) .

Pre-marketing and Post-marketing Duties","Up to the time of the thalidomide disaster in 1960-1961 there had been no systematic means of collecting information on adverse effects produced by medicines which had already come into use. Individual practitioners observing unexpected and unwanted effects might report them in a journal letter, and an occasional study might be performed and published of an unwelcome phenomenon, but that was all. Within companies one might find a ""complaints register"" in which reports of apparent problems of all types were collected, but again unsystematically. From 1964 onwards however a series of countries established national adverse reaction monitoring centres and invited practitioners to report suspected adverse reactions for evaluation. As a rule such a centre would also communicate the reports in outline, without identifying names, to the companies concerned and seek their comments. In the United States the FDA considered it appropriate for physicians to hand their reports to the company's travelling representative and the firms themselves were obliged to pass these reports to the FDA; physicians however also had a right to report to the FDA directly if they so wished, though only a minority did so. The World Health Organization established an International Centre (in Geneva, later in Uppsala, Sweden) where the reports from the national centres could be collated and examined; as of 2004, 55 countries were contributing to the system. The European Union has its own centre (EUDRAVigilance), processing reports from national agencies. More recently, following successful experience in Sweden with direct reporting of adverse reactions by patients, agencies have begun to establish contacts with the public in both directions, both receiving reports and making Drug Analysis Prints publicly available. (Yellowcard 2005) The legal framework for pharmacovigilance of medicinal products for human use in the Community is given in Council Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93 and Council Directive 2001/83/EC and is based primarily on ICH guidelines. Both the marketing authorisation holder (MAH) and the competent authorities are obliged to maintain pharmacovigilance systems and all relevant information should be shared between them, as well as with other EU and EEA member states. The marketing authorisation holder must ensure that it has an appropriate system of pharmacovigilance in place in order to assure responsibility and liability for its products on the market and to ensure that appropriate action can be taken, when necessary. The marketing authorisation holder should have permanently and continuously at its disposal in the European Economic Area (EEA), a ""qualified person"" responsible for pharmacovigilance who if not medically qualified should report to, or have access to a medically qualified person. National regulations in some Member States require in addition a nominated individual in that country who has specific legal obligations in respect of pharmacovigilance at a national level. The qualified person is responsible for the establishment and maintenance of a system which ensures that information about all suspected adverse reactions which are reported to the personnel of the marketing authorisation holder, including medical representatives, is collected and collated in order to be accessible at least at one point within the Community for the preparation for competent authorities of the Member States, where the medicinal product is authorised, of the adverse drug reaction (ADR) reports, Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs) and company sponsored post-authorisation study reports. Ongoing pharmacovigilance evaluation ensures provision of information requested by the authorities in the countries where the product is marketed, including figures on sales and prescriptions if required. The marketing authorisation holder is responsible for reporting suspected adverse reactions to the authorities of the Member States and the European Agency. For medicinal products authorised through centralised or national procedures, including through mutual recognition, suspected adverse reactions received from health-care professionals should be reported. Spontaneously reported suspected adverse reactions, suspected adverse reactions from post-authorisation studies and those reported in the world-wide literature are included. A reaction is suspected if either the reporting health-care professional or the marketing authorisation holder believes there is a possible causal relationship",30.420329432312244,14.456925427137074

According to a 2001 survey, respirator use as a percentage of private sector establishments was less in health care (3.2%) than in manufacturing (12.8%), mining (11.7%), construction (9.6%), or agriculture (9.4%). 6, 7 Although HCP face a variety of potential respiratory hazards (eg, ethylene oxide and formaldehyde), respiratory protection in health care did not receive much attention until the late 1980s. 8 A change did not occur until the number of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) cases in the United States was observed to be steadily increasing, including outbreaks of multidrug-resistant TB. 9 After the deaths of 8 HCP who acquired TB in the workplace, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) began recommending the use of respiratory protection among all HCP who cared for patients with known or suspected TB infection. 10 Surgical masks had been commonly used for respiratory protection in TB isolation rooms until this time 11 ; this policy change was the first major guidance document specifically recommending the use of respirators for HCP exposed to an infectious aerosol. In 1997, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) published a proposed rule for occupational exposure to TB, which included respiratory protection. This proposed rule, which was later rescinded, demonstrated an expansion of the use of respirators into new types of workplaces, which were not always familiar with all of the requirements for the proper use of respirators, including fit testing. In 1998 and 2006, OSHA published updates to its respiratory protection standard (29 CFR Part 1910.134) , consolidating a number of substance-specific regulations.

Most of these patients (82%) survived, largely because they received high-quality, supportive critical care. 7 Planning and delivering care to these patients was labor and resource intensive and took place in a few specialized centers. The cost to establish an Ebola treatment center in the United States has been estimated to be $1,200,000, whereas the cost to care for a single patient in this setting may be as high as $30,000 per day. 69, 70 Secondary transmission of EBOV to health care workers in a community hospital in Texas served as a stark reminder of the risks associated with caring for patients with EVD and the need for adequate resources, planning, and training to mitigate risk. 71 Although EVD is the most recent example of a highly infectious disease necessitating ICU care, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV serve as other important examples. The 2003 to 2004 SARS-CoV epidemic resulted in more than 8000 infections and 700 deaths worldwide.

Health-care funders facing these facts might focus spending on primary and preventive care. The present global recession and heightened disparities are drawing attention to decades-old questions. How eff ective is critical care? How cost eff ective is critical care? How can we ration a service perceived to rescue lives at imminent risk of death? 92 Despite these realities, US clinicians perceive little or no resource restraints on their ability to deliver intensive care. 93 Data for structure, casemix, care processes, and outcomes of critical care in least developed countries (as by the UN defi nition based on low income, human resource weakness, and economic vulnerability) are restricted to descriptive studies suggesting few beds in intensive care, infrastructure, personnel, and equipment. Patients are thus admitted to ICUs with very high illness severity, and, not surprisingly, narrative reviews suggest that clinical outcomes are poor. 94 Maximising use of this scarce resource (table 2) implies attention to regionalisation and integration, based on prevailing local realities. 39 Some have argued that fi nancial inequities and cultural expectations make the notion of considering intensive care in developing countries misguided, and a universally applicable critical care ethic impossible. 95 Mitigating arguments emphasise philosophical principles of universal justice and harm to national economies 96 of untreated critical illness. Extrapolating from diseasespecifi c data from the WHO's Global Health Observatory, infection and perinatal complications are much more common causes of admission to an ICU in the developing world than complications of chronic cardiac, vascular, and pulmonary disease, which predominate in the developed world. Before, little attention was focused on translation of intensive care techniques to low-resource settings, but more workers have now argued that safe emergency medical care is a worthwhile component of public health; 97 others have published practical proposals to extend evidence-based sepsis care to low-resource settings. 98 Any improvements to the delivery of critical care will need adequate numbers of trained health-care workers, 99 feasible care guidelines and protocols that can be scaled across low-resource settings, and reversal of the so-called brain drain to developed world health-care systems. 100",34.96583781877968,16.761362469036726

First, additional financial resources are needed to support regional health systems, each with different initial resources and current challenges.

Third, although Spanish residents do seem largely to have responded responsibly so far, it will be important to draw on evidence from behavioural sciences to ensure that this conduct continues over what could be many months. Fourth, although coordination between the national and regional governments has generally been good, work will be needed to ensure this continues over the next few months, with an understanding that politicians must not be allowed to exploit the situation for political gain.

Specifically, CDC makes recommendations for ambulatory care settings that include dental offices. Challenges may exist when adapting Transmission-Based Precautions to dental offices rather than to inpatient facilities. For example, dental office staff members may not be able to identify patients with infections immediately, patients frequently remain in common waiting areas for prolonged periods and treatment rooms may be turned around quickly with limited cleaning. 8 Transmission-Based Precautions were mentioned in CDC's 2003 infection control guidelines for dental health care settings, 1 but not to any great extent. The same is true for dental infection control textbooks and journal articles; the main focus generally is on Standard Precautions. This may be because patients usually do not seek routine dental outpatient care when they are acutely ill with diseases that require Transmission-Based Precautions. 1 Nonetheless, a general understanding of precautions for diseases transmitted via all routes is important, because some dental health care personnel (DHCP) are hospital based or work part time in hospital settings, patients infected with these diseases might seek urgent treatment at outpatient dental offices, and DHCP might become infected with these diseases. 1 Also, recently, several diseases requiring precautions beyond Standard Precautions (for example, MRSA or 2009 H1N1 influenza) have received extensive media coverage, and some dental professionals have inquired why there were not specific infection control recommendations to cover these conditions in ambulatory care dental settings.",33.04418599456163,16.495123594476425

Those in opposition maintain that using taxpayer-funded services to support individuals who enter and remain in the United States illegally undermines the legal system. However, some scholars and legislators have argued that it is both unethical and impractical to deny access to health care services for illegal immigrants living in the United States. 16 They view health care as a basic human right and an obligation of a just society to provide health care for everyone. Leading medical professional societies such as the American Medical Association (AMA), American College of Physicians (ACP), the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), and the American Nurses Association (ANA) reaffirm the position that all individuals living in the United States, regardless of their immigration status, should have access to quality health care, including the opportunity to purchase insurance. These leaders maintain that providing this population with access to health insurance is an evidence-based way to reduce health care costs. [17] [18] [19] Another argument, from a cost perspective, is that many UIs will benefit from preventive care and early treatment of chronic diseases before they advance to lifethreatening and costly complications. 20, 21 Proponents of this strategy advocate for improving health literacy and vaccination rates, and offering health screenings to the UI population to try to prevent long-term adverse health outcomes and control cost. Moreover, UIs may harbor infections such as tuberculosis (TB), which, when undetected, can easily be transmitted to the general public, thus posing a public health risk. 22 In contrast, some have argued that treating UIs creates more expenditures for the United States while saving their countries of origin the costs of providing health care. 23 Furthermore, they argue that sharing inadequate health care resources with UIs will reduce the availability of those scarce resources for US citizens. In the last 2 decades, several states have attempted to advance legislation designed to deny UIs access to publicly funded health services. One such initiative was California's Proposition 187. This law, later deemed unconstitutional, required health care professionals to verify immigration status and report UIs to authorities. 24 In addition, some believe that continued unabated treatment of UIs is an incentive for persistent violation of the immigration laws and threatens national security in the post-9/11 era. 25 Proponents of this argument suggest that denying health care to UIs will discourage others from attempting to immigrate without proper documentation. 24 ",37.63526181222848,15.208222819811583

NICE conducts technology appraisals, publishes clinical guidelines, and performs cost-effectiveness analyses. It utilizes the quality-adjusted life year to measure health benefits; if the benefit is less than a designated threshold for the cost of a new drug or procedure, then the treatment is not recommended.

How important is it to find every single case? How outbreak prone is the disease? Cases of infectious disease can be identified at medical facilities (hospitals and outpatient clinics) or in the community. The location of individuals enrolled into surveillance can vary based on clinical presentation of disease and access to health care. More severe cases of disease can often be identified at hospitals. Hospitalized cases are those that are severe enough to be admitted to the hospital for treatment and have the resources to seek care. Hospitalized cases can be enrolled prospectively or retrospectively when a case report form is filled out based on their medical chart. Identifying cases in hospitals can be easier than identifying cases in the community, but the cases may only represent a small proportion of cases and miss cases that do not seek health care. An example of hospital-based surveillance is severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) surveillance for influenza. For diseases like Ebola, where fear in the community might prevent cases from going to seek health care, hospital surveillance would be insufficient alone. Individuals with milder cases of disease may also seek medical care, such as at outpatient clinics, so surveillance may be conducted at medical facilities outside of hospitals, such as with influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance.",29.969450227962337,10.489307579786818

With the exception of a few programs led by groups of committed and trained educators, SBME is frequently delivered in an ad hoc and unsystematic manner, separate from the broader curriculum. Box 4 suggests an approach to SBME based on general principles of curriculum development. 63 Far from wanting to blame educators, their intention is rather to highlight how difficult it can be for an educational intervention to present most of the features of effective SBME. In an attempt to be pragmatic about the implementation of SBME, educators must often select one of 2 features on which to focus their time and energy. The real benefits of SBME as currently applied may therefore be less than the ones presented in the literature. SUMMARY SBME has come a long way since the introduction of the first simulator more than 30 years ago. The authors have many reasons to be optimistic about SBME: the role of SBME is expanding (identification of gaps in clinical training and practice; undergraduate, postgraduate, and continuing education; formative and high-stakes assessment), the quality of evidence to support its use is increasing, and the strategies to implement SBME effectively and efficiently are better understood. There seems to be a consensus in the literature that SBME has an important role to play in the improvement of the safety of the care delivered in health care institutions; patient outcomes can be affected by our educational choices. These conclusions likely apply to the critical care environment in which patient outcomes critically depend on timely, complex, and highly coordinated care.

The recommended test to confirm the diagnosis of pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus is real-time RTPCR for influenza A, B, H1, and H3. Isolation of pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus using culture is diagnostic, but culture is usually too slow to help guide clinical management. 5, 6 A negative viral culture does not exclude infection by H1N1 influenza A. Clinicians may consider using rapid influenza antigen tests as part of their evaluation of patients suspected of having pandemic H1N1 influenza A, but results should be interpreted with caution. 7, 8 A large number of RTPCR tests have been reported, and they use various chemical and multiplexing formats. 9 -16 However, in the current scenario, the only realtime RTPCR validated by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is the one approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) for confirmation of pandemic novel swineorigin H1N1 infection. This CDC real-time RTPCR is based on a panel of oligonucleotide primers and duallabeled hydrolysis probes that use the Superscript TM III Platinum one-step quantitative kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) with four sets of primers and probes for universal influenza A, swine influenza A, swine H1(new H1N1), and housekeeping gene (RNase P) for testing the quality of the RNA template (http://www.who.int/csr/resources/ publications/swine flu/CDC real-time RTPCR protocol). One of the limitations of the existing WHO-approved CDC real-time RTPCR is that the test system is very expensive, considering the large number of primer and probe sets that must be used. In addition, the requirement of expensive real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) instruments also restricts the system's application to a few referral laboratories that have good financial resources. Overall, the real-time RTPCR test system is expensive and time consuming-it requires 3 to 4 hours. Therefore, real-time RTPCR is not the method of choice in basic clinical settings in developing countries for clinical diagnosis of novel S-OIV. It is critical to develop simple and economical molecular tests that can be used in field conditions, especially at peripheral health care settings, as a routine test that does not require sophisticated instruments.",34.811535344540374,16.999596745875234

As more specimens entered the network laboratories, influenza viruses were ruled out as the causative agent.

But as more information became available, airports were asked to screen passengers for history of contact with SARS and for persons with current illness that fit the SARS case definition. Finally, when these recommendations did not completely stop international spread, passengers themselves were asked to avoid travel to areas where contact tracing was unable to link all cases to known chains of transmission (12) .

Therefore, while there is acknowledged need for ICT in the coordination and monitoring of treatment, surveillance, response, education, and communication in health care, in reality there are significant barriers in the application of ICT that slow progress. These barriers are in no way restricted to the developing world. The United States and other more technologically advanced nations have their own sets of challenges. Cost, misalignment of incentives, resistance, an unskilled workforce, concerns about impact on productivity, lack of standards and interoperability, and other issues contribute to a poor level of healthcare ICT adoption in the industrialized world. 16 The digital divide has resulted in large segments of low income and/or other underserved groups being excluded from online health resources. 16 Economic hardships and difficult tradeoff decisions in the US healthcare industry have further inhibited healthcare information technology growth. 17 In developing nations, the problem of ICT uptake is even further compounded. A lack of local expertise and decades of well-meaning but non-sustainable ICT projects in the developing world have left a legacy of skepticism in their wake. Systems built for Westernized health care delivery often do not match the local context, resulting in a misalignment between need and technology.

The Contingency Fund for Emergencies finances surge outbreak response for up to 3 months. The fund has a capitalisation target of $100 million of flexible voluntary contributions, which needs to be replenished with about $25-50 million annually, depending on the extent of the outbreak in any given year. However, as of April 30, 2017, only $37·65 million had been contributed, with an additional $4 million in pledges. 13 The WHO Health Emergencies and Health Systems Preparedness Programmes face an annual shortfall of $225 million in funding their epidemic and pandemic prevention and control activities. 14 Previous health emergencies have shown that it can take time to organise global collective action and provide financing to the national and local level. In such situations, a global mechanism should offer a rapid injection of liquidity to affected countries. The World Bank's Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility (PEF) is a proposed global insurance mechanism for pandemic emergencies. 15 It aims to provide surge funding for response efforts to help respond to rare, high-burden disease outbreaks, preventing them from becoming more deadly and costly pandemics. The PEF currently proposes a coverage of $500 million for the insurance window; increasing the current coverage will require additional donor commitments.

The health-care system is less a true national system than a decentralised collection of provincial and territorial insurance plans covering a narrow basket of services, which are free at the point of care. Administration and service delivery are highly decentralised, although coverage is portable across the country.

These features of the late stage transition model present considerable challenges for policy, especially as both health care and health experience in China reflect very clear social and also spatial inequalities. Thus, health policy must be designed to target those most at risk: this includes not only the poor in general, but, specifically, the elderly, women (particularly rural women) and the vast population living in rural and remote areas that are poorly served by primary and public health care facilities.

Currently, these data inform the strategic directions of health ministries and support excellent health services research in most provinces.

Successful models exist, such as the Alberta Bone and Joint Health Institute in Calgary, which reduced wait times for consultation for hip and knee replacement from 145 days to 21 days through inno vations including interprofessional teams and centralised referral. 75 However, physicians have competing responsi bilities, and there is no systemic support for their involve ment in system change. If a government or regional health authority wants physicians to participate in such an initiative, it must often rely on exhortation or simply pay its doctors more to gain their involvement. Poor federalprovincial-territorial collaboration also hinders the ability to scale up such successful responses to wait times across provincial borders, hence the characterisation of Canada by at least one former Minister of Health as a ""country of perpetual pilot projects"". 76, 77 Canada's reasonable performance on composite quality metrics such as amenable mortality suggests that these wait times for elective care do not necessarily translate to worse health outcomes. 78 However, for the Canadian public, long wait times for elective care are a lightning rod issue and threaten to undermine support for Medicare. Some groups have turned to the courts as a means of challenging the public-private payment divide.

[79] [80] [81] [82] Little more than a decade ago, the Quebec government responded to the Supreme Court of Canada's Chaoulli decision by allowing private insurance for a few types of surgical procedures, but this outcome did not create a viable private market for a health insurance duplicative of Medicare. 83 A more ambitious lawsuit impugning prov incial Medicare laws was launched in British Columbia in 2016. 84 Unlike the Quebec trial, which sought only to overturn limits on private duplicative insurance, the plaintiffs in the Cambie Surgeries Corporation case in British Columbia seek to also overturn restrictions on user fees and on physician dual practice. 85 In the past decade, Canadian courts have made important judgments on several other major questions of health-care delivery, including the legalisation of safe injection sites, reinstatement of insurance coverage for refugee claimants, and legalisation of medical assistance in dying. [86] [87] [88] These decisions have generally increased access to care for vulnerable people. However, should the court in the Cambie Surgeries Corporation case establish a legal right for Canadians of means who wish to jump the public queue, this case could fundamentally reshape Medicare laws across the country and could threaten equitable access to care.

Even following the United Nations High Level Meeting on Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases in 2011, there was little if any funding movement [8] .",48.2768536876328,21.04599408753122

There are a variety of inotropes and vassopressors that are interchangeable again increasing availability. However, oxygen remains a critical consumable resource which has a limited supply and distribution network. Most hospitals rely on large storage tanks of liquid oxygen. If this source runs low, oxygen must be trucked in from a supplier. The number of suppliers of medical grade oxygen in North America is limited as are the number of tanker trucks available to transport oxygen. Portable oxygen supplies for use during an infrastructure failure or in 12S off-site critical care facilities are very limited, inefficient and not included in the strategic national stockpile. 44 Staff Like many areas of health care, critical care units face shortages of various team members 56 required for critical care delivery. 44, 50, [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] Data from Ontario show that 49% of critical care units had nursing vacancies and 20% had physician vacancies. 50 ICUs facing staffing shortages are routinely forced to cancel surgeries and divert ED admissions to other hospitals. 50 The need to resort to such actions even in non-surge periods bespeaks the limited surge capacity in the critical care system.",42.15264400587967,19.13898918093514

The WHO recommends primary care systems to be universally accessible to individuals and families by means of acceptable and affordable ways (Europe). The predictable results of a well-established primary health care system are increased disease prevention, earlier diagnosis of diseases, and use of an appropriate regimen at an affordable price, while at the same time amelioration of the heavy workload in overcrowded big public hospitals. Experience from Hong Kong suggests public education to make people, especially elders, aware of the demand for primary care which should be affordable and qualitycertified (Griffiths and Lee, 2012; Liu et al., 2013a) . Primary care emphasizes stable and close communication between the elderly and their family doctors. Imbalance of the distribution of primary care between rural and urban areas should be changed. In 2008, the Chinese government launched the fourth health-care reform plan with one aim that proposes to establish a three-tier medical network at country, town, and village levels with emphasis on infrastructure and human-resource development (Chen, 2009 ).

As with staffing, some hospitals face shortages of critical care spaces, 46,71-73 although occupancy varies across the United States. In Ontario in 2006, there were 1,789 critical care beds, 1,057 of which were capable of accommodating mechanical ventilation. 74 The occupancy rate for these beds approaches 90%. 50 Demands on critical care resources are expected to increase in both the United States and Canada as the populations age. 75 On a day-to-day basis, additional capacity can be created in the critical care system by expanding critical care to areas of the hospital such as the postanesthesia care unit. However, this expansion is still limited by the issues of stuff and staff discussed earlier. Therefore, even though the bed spaces may be available to use for critical care, if the hospital rents its ventilators and has no more on site, the ability to expand critical care remains limited unless specific advanced planning and preparation are undertaken.

Long working hours and close contact with patients increases the risk of infection, which imposes enormous stress on nurses who provide direct care for SARS patients [21] . The study findings add insight for nurse administrators and educators to further develop strategies to increase nurses' intention and volunteering to care for patients with other new and potentially fatal contagious diseases, such as SARS or avian influenza. First, providing sufficient and adequate personal protective equipment, periodically announcing and routinely practicing infection control measures and protocols, and providing up-to-date continuing education for nurses may help to reinforce nurses' self-efficacy in caring for such patients. Second, enhancing positive attitude is much more important than merely increasing nurses' knowledge regarding the disease. Reinforcement of nurses' positive attitudes could be easily achieved by verbal expression of approval and support from nursing administrators, or substantial rewards such as special compensation payments could be used to encourage and acknowledge nurses for their efforts. Third, improving nurses' access to resources provided by hospitals is a key point to increase nurses' intention. Nurse administrators need to ensure that staff nurses obtain sufficient resources and psychologic support, and have the capability and capacity to respond properly to care for SARS patients or any future public emergencies of this kind. Fourth, it is crucial for nursing administrators to serve as nurse advocates to reflect the frontline nurses' voices and concerns in the battle to contain diseases such as SARS, and build up direct communication channels between the hospital administration and staff nurses.",36.17356413790863,18.881263366999708

The value of reciprocity does not only rely on individuals or paperwork: It also needs to be brought about by the support and protection by health institutions of their health care providers (Singer et al., 2003) . Health care providers are expected to deliver services in an atmosphere of utmost integrity that will only occur when providers have courage, feel safe, and are supported to do the right thing in difficult situations (Kerfoot, 1999) . As such, government and health institutes are expected to provide the following forms of help to nurses: (a) offering adequate personal protective material and equipment at all relevant sites; (b) fostering a reciprocal supportive relationship between health team members; (c) offering an accessible counseling ""hotline"" and anti-SARS program to provide timely mutual support and training during quarantine; and (d) providing plausible tangible reimbursement for staff who take extraordinary responsibilities during epidemics and disasters.",38.875772595771195,18.4819371284334

For instance, if the ethical justification for prioritizing population x for treatment in an influenza pandemic plan stems from an unarticulated, if not tacit, value like 'fairness', then prioritizing that same population in the context of a non-influenza pandemic might actually run counter to this ethical justification (i.e., where the ethical reasoning underlying the value of 'fairness' might require the prioritization of population y in the context of a non-influenza pandemic). That is, without a robust understanding of the ethical reasoning that interprets and applies ethical values to particular guidance in pandemic plans, it is possible that the dictates of the guidance will be transferred and applied (e.g., prioritize population x) rather than the underlying ethical reasoning and justification (e.g., prioritize those who will benefit the most from treatment [a possible interpretation of 'fairness']).

This scepticism stems from several recent analyses of pandemic plans, which have demonstrated that, while ethical considerations and guidance have been incorporated into many pandemic plans, underlying ethical reasoning and justifications remain largely absent. Pandemic planning requires numerous assumptions to be made regarding, among other things, the severity of the pandemic, the supply and availability of health care resources, and the availability of information regarding who is at risk and who can benefit (Prehn and Vawter 2008) . Variations in these underlying assumptions can have profound implications for ethical reasoning and justification, which may ultimately affect the nature and scope of ethics guidance included in a plan. As such, it is not surprising that considerable variety exists among plans in the attention paid to guidance for ethical decision-making (Prehn and Vawter 2008; McDougall 2010) . Indeed, many pandemic plans do not contain any ethical guidance at all (Prehn and Vawter 2008) . Of course, this is problematic not only for ethics preparedness for infectious disease pandemics beyond influenza, but for influenza pandemics as well. And while numerous ethics guidance documents and a substantial scholarly literature exist that can be drawn upon in the event of a pandemic (e.g., University of Toronto Joint Centre for Bioethics 2005; Kinlaw and Levine 2007; National Ethics Advisory Committee 2007; World Health Organization 2007 , 2008b Jennings and Arras 2008) , this should not be seen as a replacement for the integration of robust ethics guidance within pandemic plans themselves, as many of the decisions governments and health practitioners will make in preparing for and responding to pandemics will ostensibly be derived from their own jurisdiction's pandemic plan and the ethical guidance therein.",36.380915185835924,14.627487517753679

Maintaining this excess capacity has resource implications. Instead of the current focus on expanding the hospital-based infrastructure, more critical is the need to reconfigure the MENA health system to better integrate the provision of preventative and promotional services with treatment and support services. With the growing population, MENA health systems require a stronger emphasis on services and functions aimed at reducing the population's level of exposure to existing risks of emerging challenges, rather than the more expensive option of treating them when affected.

In many countries the public health sector is often the first to advocate for dog rabies control, as it is usually responsible for the financial burden, in terms of health care and biologics costs. This sector has to assume responsibility for human rabies deaths following exposures to rabid animals when control strategies in the animal reservoir are not effectively implemented and when PEP is not administered correctly. In addition, the government and the Ministry of Health should supply necessary care and biologics to prevent the occurrence of rabies. Provision of vaccines and RIG needed to prevent rabies deaths is estimated theoretically to be around 200 PEP/100,000 inhabitants (based on figures from a range of poorly resourced countries) [78] , although this is likely to vary depending on the setting. While rabies vaccine costs remain in the range of other public health program expenses supported by national health services in several countries, in the absence of international funding these resources are usually beyond the capacity of most impoverished countries. These life-saving products are absolutely necessary and for obvious ethical reasons the considerable sums required to acquire them cannot be diverted from their emergency use. However, improvements in the long-term cost effectiveness of human rabies prevention will only be achieved by focusing on control of rabies in its animal reservoir. Yet, funds initially required to acquire human biologics cannot be diverted to another sector to help increase its capacity to establish effective animal rabies control programs [52, 54, 79, 80] . Any country willing to embark in rabies control initiatives must realize that additional investment will be required in all sectors, and that savings, particularly through reduced demand for PEP, will only occur after several years of implementation. Therefore, it is essential in this initial investment phase that resources can be mobilized among all sectors for human rabies prevention and canine rabies elimination.",31.52452042814098,16.062195741043496

The existing healthcare systems are unable to control and monitor such diseases efficiently accompanying with minimal cost. So, an intelligent and efficient system is required to provide ubiquitous healthcare support services in real time using IT infrastructure. A major challenge in any nationwide healthcare systems is the acquisition of health-related information from the patient in real time and requirement of huge storage capacity and high computational power to store and process the data respectively. Recent advances in sensing and distributed technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing makes it possible to design a smart healthcare system that enables remote continuous monitoring of patients in an unobtrusive and seamless manner. Using such technologies, it not only reduces consumed manpower of health workers but also reduce the cost of medical healthcare services. Cloud computing along with wireless body area network (WBAN) can be efficiently employed for the prevention and monitoring of the patient. WBAN consists of a group of small and lightweight body sensors attached to the patient's body to collect vital parameters of the body that can be used for long-term monitoring of chronic diseases efficiently (Sareen et al. 2016a, b; Andreu-Perez et al. 2015) . These sensors produce a vast amount of data that needs to be stored and processed in real time.

However, gain-of-function studies, as well as loss-of-function studies, are common in molecular microbiology and are essential to understanding molecular pathogenesis of infectious diseases. Changes to the genome of an organism, whether naturally occurring or directed through experimental manipulations in the laboratory, can result in altered phenotypes, as biological functions are lost or gained. Investigators routinely conduct loss-and gain-of-function experiments to understand the complex nature of host-pathogen interactions that underlie transmission, infection, and pathogenesis"" (NSABB, 2016: 5) . Employing the more general term also had the effect of engaging a wider swath of the virology community who now became concerned that proposals to limit research would expand beyond the narrow focus on highly pathogenic avian influenza. 17 The pause applied only to certain experiments within a broader grant or contract, and an appeals process allowed that ""an exception from the funding pause may be granted by the head of the federal funding department or agency if that official determines in writing that the research is urgently necessary to protect public health or national security"" (White House, 2014b: 5). NIH initially identified 18 experiments as likely to be subject to the pause; the number eventually rose to 21, of which 10 received exemptions. 18 The Gryphon Scientific draft and final reports, along with substantial additional material, are available at http://www.gryphonscientific.com/gain-of-function/ (Selgelid, 2015) and the NSABB's draft recommendations (NSABB, 2015b), were released in December 2015 and discussed at an NSABB meeting in January 2016. 19 The second Academies symposium was held in March (NASEM, 2016b) and the final NSABB recommendations were produced in May 2016 and provided to the interagency process (NSABB, 2016) . The NSABB recommended a process that put substantial emphasis on reviews and decisions early in the life cycle of research, and, like the broader U.S. policy for DURC, allowed for monitoring and adjustments to any risk mitigation plans if unexpected results emerged. One of the NSABB's findings was ""There are life sciences research studies, including possibly some GOF research of concern, that should not be conducted because the potential risks associated with the study are not justified by the potential benefits"" (NSABB, 2016: 2) . By this point, the deliberative process had stretched toward two years. Once the interagency process began, there were no further public discussions by the government. On January 17, 2017, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy released its Recommended Policy Guidance for Departmental Development of Review Mechanisms for Potential Pandemic Pathogen Care and Oversight. ""The Guidance recommends consistent and appropriate Federal agency review and reporting processes for the oversight of Federally funded research that is anticipated to create, transfer, or use enhanced potential pandemic pathogens (PPP)"" (White House, 2017: 1). Federal agencies that adopted a review mechanism consistent with the recommendations in the Guidance would fulfill the necessary conditions to end the funding pause.

By applying phylogenetic reconstruction and divergence dating to Lassa virus genomes obtained by collaborators using an in-field metagenomics approach, the increased incidence of human cases could be attributed to independent spillovers from multimammate rats, rather than human-to-human transmission.

Additional information and potentially frequent updates will be posted on that site. State and local health illnesses are almost always caused by known respiratory pathogens, emergency physicians should recognize the risk of novel pathogens and be familiar with current recommendations for evaluating patients who may be infected with emerging pathogens from specific geographic areas. This report of a new coronavirus (now referred to as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, or MERS-CoV) identified in patients in the United Kingdom after travel to the Arabian Peninsula illustrates some important points about identifying infections with novel pathogens and implementing infection control procedures when specific transmission risk may be unknown. The 3 confirmed cases demonstrate that the virus has the capability of human-to-human transmission and coinfection with another pathogen (influenza A). 1 Subsequent clusters of disease confirm that the novel coronavirus can spread from person to person, including from patients to health care workers. Although MERS-CoV has a different genetic sequence than the virus that caused SARS, the implications for emergency medicine are similar. 2 Health care providers, hospital administrators, and global health organizations learned many important lessons during the 2003 SARS outbreak. The subsequent improvement in infection control measures is especially important for the ED in the event of infectious outbreaks with new pathogens. Transmission in the health care setting to a large number of health care workers and other patients was a notable feature of the SARS coronavirus. The greatest risk of transmission was to individuals who had close contact with infected subjects and who were not properly trained in the use of protective equipment. 3 Exposure of health care providers to procedures that aerosolized droplets such as nebulizers, suctioning, and intubation was another source of virus transmission. 4 N95 respirators may offer protection to individuals involved in highrisk procedures. 5 CDC recommendations for respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette evolved during the SARS outbreak. These concepts have since been incorporated into CDC planning documents for SARS and pandemic influenza. Although basic precautions such as hand washing are intended for health care workers associated with direct patient contact, respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette applies to everyone in the hospital setting: providers, patients, and visitors. 6 This concept was developed in response to observations that visitors and patients without diagnoses were contributing to hospital transmission. 3 Recommendations included posted signs in different languages about containment of respiratory secretions, convenient hand sanitizers and tissue receptacles, and sitting at least 3 feet apart if coughing. Screening patients with respiratory symptoms for recent travel, placing a mask, and isolation from others in the waiting room/ ED are important for early detection and prevention. 7 For pathogens that emerge in specified geographic areas, risk assessment is based on where the organism is currently circulating, ie, within the local community, limited geographic areas, or not actively circulating anywhere in the world. 8 If",36.0059633611924,16.08395128307246

Disasters/MIs often result in mass causalities at the incident site, with many victims requiring pre-hospital assessment and care. However, a large number of patients, often described as self-presenters, arrive at the emergency department (ED) without pre-hospital assessment [12] . When a MI occurs, ED departments may be required to quickly increase their operational capacity to receive, prioritize and treat the rapid flow of patients. This ability to increase the capacity of the ED to manage the sudden influx of patients is a hospital's surge capacity [13, 14] .

This dependence on vector control is due to the frequent lack of access to safe or effective treatment. However, even when treatment exists and is available, it can be costly and complex, especially in later stages of disease progression. Communities impacted by EReNTDs often lack the necessary health care delivery infrastructure to support integrated prevention and treatment approaches that include screening, diagnosis, treatment, and case management, the absence of which can translate into a significant global burden of disease (8, 56) . Hence, encouraging and funding health care institutions, clinics, and community health facilities to engage in surveillance, prevention, and treatment programs may help to reduce the risk and aid in decreasing the incidence of EReNTDs (34, 48) . Specifically, ensuring that clinics in areas of endemicity are adequately stocked with medications that are low-cost and accessible may encourage infected individuals to seek care (60) . Misdiagnosis of infectious diseases may be prevented if programs are initiated to ensure that rural providers (including traditional healers and those who practice ethnomedicine) are capable of identifying early symptoms of infection and have proper training to either treat or refer cases (286, 287) . This can be enhanced if efforts are made to increase accessibility of basic literature and education that aid in making an accurate EReNTD diagnosis (288) . Providing periodic forums for feedback from community health workers may prioritize more cost-efficient primary prevention strategies over strategies related to the clinical management of symptoms (289, 290) .

Ten essential reforms before the next pandemic. The report of the Harvard-LSHTM Independent Panel on the Global Response to Ebola Executive summary,"In March, 2014, a second phase began in which intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations began to respond, starting with Médecins Sans Frontières, which already had teams on the ground. That month, both Guinea and Liberia confi rmed Ebola outbreaks to WHO. By March 24, Ebola was confi rmed in Conakry, home to more than one in seven Guineans. Two months later Ebola had spread to three capital cities with international airports. Without any approved drugs, vaccines or rapid diagnostic tests, health workers struggled to diagnose patients and provide eff ective care. Without suffi cient protective gear, and initially without widespread understanding of the virus, hundreds of health workers themselves became ill and died. Despite Médecins Sans Frontières' warnings about the unprecedented scope of the outbreak, 12 national authorities in Guinea downplayed it for fear of creating panic and disrupting economic activity. 12, 13 Internal documents 14 suggest similar concerns might have infl uenced WHO, which publicly characterised the outbreak in March as ""relatively small still"". 15 WHO's Global Alert and Response Network sent an expert team to support national eff orts, as did others such as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, those teams withdrew from Guinea and Liberia in May when reported cases decreased, even as viral transmission continued. 16 In late May, Sierra Leone became the third country to declare an Ebola outbreak to WHO. For the fi rst time in the known history of Ebola, the virus had spawned sustained outbreaks in three countries. This should have raised substantial alarm, as coordination was weak between the national governments of Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone, the borders extremely porous, and human movement and trade highly fl uid. In late June, Médecins Sans Frontières labelled the situation as ""out of control"" and publicly called for more international attention and resources. 17 This second phase witnessed three interrelated failures. First, in a failure of political leadership, some national authorities did not call for greater international assistance despite the humanitarian crisis, and in some cases downplayed the outbreak. Second, WHO's in-country technical capacity was weak, shown by its decision to withdraw its international team too soon and its poor responses in Guinea and Sierra Leone to requests for technical guidance from ministries of health and health-care providers. 18, 19 Third, WHO did not mobilise global assistance in countering the epidemic despite ample evidence the outbreak had overwhelmed national and non-governmental capacities-failures in both technical judgment and political leadership.",32.16950756859042,14.09141607774238

These included outdated and vulnerable technologies; a public health workforce lacking training and reinforcements; lack of real-time surveillance and epidemiological systems; and ineffective and fragmented communications networks. 1 While considerable headway has been made since the IOM report was published, there is still evidence of a need for further improvements. A recent report by Trust for America's Health, for example, found that there are persistent gaps in the ability of state and local public health agencies to respond to events ranging from bioterrorist threats to natural disasters and disease outbreaks. 2 The question is-how can we reduce these gaps? Nationwide and globally, rapid changes in health information systems, cloud computing technologies, communications, and global connections are catalyzing a re-examination of disease surveillance as an enterprise that needs coordinated and integrated system elements. Sustainable surveillance, which we define as ongoing data collection, analysis, and application, coupled with a capability to respond to novel demands, is needed to ensure that public health agencies can perform reliably regardless of shifts in public health funding and priorities.

Thus, health care is important and therefore, special, due to its role in influencing health and it must be socially guaranteed. It must be socially guaranteed in a manner that is consistent with improving health overall and reducing health inequalities that are attributable to health care-not in terms of equality in health care delivery (equal amounts or types), irrespective of health consequences. procedural and substantive principles. Substantively, Sen's notion of ""basic capabilities"" provides guidance since this formulation generally implies that societal efforts be made to bring each individual's health functioning as close as possible to (or above) a certain level of minimal normal functioning (in so far as an individual's circumstances permit). ""Basic capabilities"" include the ability to avoid escapable morbidity and premature and preventable mortality. Premature mortality implies placing special emphasis on efforts to avert deaths from preventable causes that do not allow individuals to live a life of normal length (eg, a child dying of AIDS). On the question of how much priority should be given to society's worst-off individuals, this view promotes the use of ""public reasoning"" to forge a compromise between strict maximisation and prioritisation. Fourth, this ""process aspect"" of freedom in the capability approach has implications for how healthrelated policy is made. It emphasises an individual's ability to participate in broad public-policy decisionmaking (eg, in prioritising between environmental and health care programmes) and in health policy decisionmaking (eg, in prioritising domains of health and health care for resource allocation). A democratic process can help define a comprehensive package of health benefits to which all should have equal access, and it can help prioritise different types of health care in efforts to maintain and improve health with the fewest possible resources. Such a process is not merely instrumental, however, since its justification lies in the concept that individuals should have the capability to participate in decision-making that affects them, such as about the goods and services that society will guarantee to them.",40.76265561346631,17.918905334845654

These experts include the World Health Organization, which cites the emergence of the H5N1 virus as a clear warning that we need to enhance preparedness for an influenza pandemic. 1 In light of these warnings, federal, provincial, territorial and local governments across Canada have been engaged in pandemic preparedness activities -activities that have also been driven by the country's recent experience with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreaks in 2003. Canada was one of the first jurisdictions to release a modern, comprehensive strategy to deal with an influenza pandemic. The A key priority of pandemic preparedness at both the federal and provincial levels is planning for the surge capacity that will be required across the health care system to assess and treat individuals who are ill with influenza. In Ontario, it is estimated that approximately 2.3 million people will be ill enough with influenza to require an outpatient visit during an influenza pandemic 2 (these numbers are replicable for all provinces and territories). Guidelines on strategies to curtail or eliminate non-critical services across the health care system and for a competency-based approach to health human resources planning have been developed in Ontario to mitigate this surge in demand; however, these strategies alone will be insufficient. The anticipated surge would still overwhelm current resources and the ability of the health care system to maintain life-saving services would be severely compromised. 3 As a result, the 2006 version of the OHPIP includes a strategy for a community-based approach to influenza assessment and treatment as a means to further mitigate the impacts of the predicted surge and to help ensure that critical health services continue during an influenza pandemic.

Real time information further demonstrated that contact tracing at some sites did not fully identify chains of transmission, and that transmission was occurring outside confined settings such as the health care environment, possibly placing the general population at risk. In late March, an outbreak of 329 almost simultaneous probable cases among residents of a housing estate in Hong Kong suggested possible transmission by exposure to some factor in the environment, thus creating further opportunities for exposure in the general population (www.sars-expertcom.gov.hk/english/reports/reports.html). Additional evidence-based guidance was therefore made for the sites where contact tracing could not link all cases, understanding that if the disease were spreading in the wider community it would greatly increase the risk to travellers and the likelihood that cases would be exported to other countries. This guidance was aimed at international travellers, and recommended that they postpone all but essential travel to designated sites in order to minimize their risk of becoming infected (www.who.int/csr/don/2003 07 01/en/).

Those in opposition maintain that using taxpayer-funded services to support individuals who enter and remain in the United States illegally undermines the legal system. However, some scholars and legislators have argued that it is both unethical and impractical to deny access to health care services for illegal immigrants living in the United States. 16 They view health care as a basic human right and an obligation of a just society to provide health care for everyone. Leading medical professional societies such as the American Medical Association (AMA), American College of Physicians (ACP), the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), and the American Nurses Association (ANA) reaffirm the position that all individuals living in the United States, regardless of their immigration status, should have access to quality health care, including the opportunity to purchase insurance. These leaders maintain that providing this population with access to health insurance is an evidence-based way to reduce health care costs. [17] [18] [19] Another argument, from a cost perspective, is that many UIs will benefit from preventive care and early treatment of chronic diseases before they advance to lifethreatening and costly complications. 20, 21 Proponents of this strategy advocate for improving health literacy and vaccination rates, and offering health screenings to the UI population to try to prevent long-term adverse health outcomes and control cost. Moreover, UIs may harbor infections such as tuberculosis (TB), which, when undetected, can easily be transmitted to the general public, thus posing a public health risk. 22 In contrast, some have argued that treating UIs creates more expenditures for the United States while saving their countries of origin the costs of providing health care. 23 Furthermore, they argue that sharing inadequate health care resources with UIs will reduce the availability of those scarce resources for US citizens. In the last 2 decades, several states have attempted to advance legislation designed to deny UIs access to publicly funded health services. One such initiative was California's Proposition 187. This law, later deemed unconstitutional, required health care professionals to verify immigration status and report UIs to authorities. 24 In addition, some believe that continued unabated treatment of UIs is an incentive for persistent violation of the immigration laws and threatens national security in the post-9/11 era. 25 Proponents of this argument suggest that denying health care to UIs will discourage others from attempting to immigrate without proper documentation. 24 ",38.83994446294796,15.629861747563403

The capacity of hospitals to deal with the challenge from emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases due to climate change is of great importance to population health. This study aimed to explore the capacity of hospitals in China to deal with such challenges. Methods: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was utilized to gauge information regarding capacity of hospitals to deal with infectious diseases in the context of climate change among 611 clinical professionals whose roles pertained to infectious disease diagnosis, treatment and management in Anhui Province of China. Descriptive analysis and logistic regression analysis were performed on the data. Results: More than 90% of participants believed climate change would have an adverse influence on population health and infectious disease control in China. Most indicated that their hospitals were well prepared for emerging infectious diseases at present, and they considered that logistical support in hospitals (e.g. administrative and maintenance services) should be strengthened for future capacity building. The majority of participants suggested that effective prevention and control measures, more interdisciplinary collaborations, more funding in rural areas for health care, and improved access to facilities enabling online reporting of infectious diseases, were extremely important strategies in building capacity to curb the population health impact of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases due to climate change in China. Conclusions: Clinical professionals recognized that climate change will likely increase the transmission of infectious diseases. Although rural health care and hospitals' logistical support need to be improved, most professionals believed their hospitals to be capable of dealing with emerging diseases. They thought that interdisciplinary and cross-regional collaborations, together with necessary resource support (e.g. improved facilities for rural health care) would be important control strategies.",33.622271110687,14.707751476293474

In California alone there was a 59% increase in the number of visits of critically ill patients to the ED from 1990 to 1999 [2] . Inpatient telemetry and ICU beds continue to be fully occupied for a significant amount of the time in many hospitals and is a primary cause of overcrowding in the ED [3, 4] . As hospital census approaches 100%, the ED unavoidably becomes a surrogate ICU. Unfortunately, resources are often limited, and critical care delivery in the ED setting is fraught with inadequate space and medical equipment and lack of staffing. Increasingly stringent nurse-patient ratios are being mandated and enforced on the inpatient ward, consequently worsening the overcrowding problem, with ED nurses often far extended over their patient care capacity. ED physicians are often overextended as well, and adequate critical care is often difficult to provide and sometimes overlooked in a busy ED.

If care for case-patients is limited to negative-pressure rooms or isolation beds, then bed availability is likely to be problematic, even with a small numbers of cases. However, if beds dedicated to wider use are made available, then shortfalls are unlikely when limited cases occur. Most resource gaps are linked to critical care and include lack of trained personnel and respirators. For example, by scenario 3, 92% of provinces will have insuffi cient negative-pressure rooms to respond effectively to case-patients, and a severe shortage of critical care nurses will occur. However, if isolation beds are used, the proportion of provinces with insuffi cient resources falls to ≈75%, and if single occupancy rooms are also used, bed capacity across the country is suffi cient. As the number of case-patients and contacts increases through scenarios 2 and 3, the number of provinces with gaps in resources grows.

First, our survey focused on the narrow clinical response and ignored the capacity of management, administrative systems, fi nancial systems, and communications, capacities that are likely to be needed to effi ciently mobilize resources (24) . Second, we assumed that the relationship between resource need and case-patients is linear, and we estimated gaps on the basis of assumptions that care for case-patients as the pandemic unfolds will draw upon similarly characterized resources as in earlier phases. This assumed relationship is unlikely to occur, and care for case-patients is likely to be different from our study assumptions. However, few strategic plans explicitly acknowledge this change in resource use and thus do not plan for it (9) . Third, our scenarios, although based on tabletop exercises conducted across the country, are limited in terms of anticipated case-patients and their contacts. Even though we extended our scenario to a modest pandemic, an alternative real-life scenario under which large numbers of cases occur is likely to test the health system profoundly. Fourth, we assumed that resource sharing between provinces would be limited on the basis of an analysis of formal strategic arrangements. Fifth, some data points were missing. Although the missing data were few, and corrections were possible, some of these data were from Bangkok. In Bangkok, any determination of the city's overall resources is a challenge because of the many private autonomous healthcare facilities and their lack of systematic integration into the public health system. This factor means that our interpretation of Bangkok's capacity to respond should be considered with caution. Bangkok has 65 private hospitals with >50 beds (14,000 beds in total), and these institutions were excluded from our survey. The challenge of coordinating the city's resources in the event of a pandemic is substantial. Without an understanding of what and where those resources are, their management will be much more challenging. This lack of knowledge would have profound implications for Thailand because Bangkok is a city of 10 million persons, the economic powerhouse of the country, and a hub for transportation and communications with the rest of Thailand. The missing information also has important implications for the global control of a pandemic because of Bangkok's role as a major international transport hub.

Increased frailty is highly important and known to correspond to worsening patient outcome and increased mortality in critical care (Flaaten et al, 2017; Muscadere et al, 2017) . This NICE admission guidance also encompasses end-of-life care decision-making and advanced care planning for those at greatest risk (NICE, 2020) . Consequences of admission have to be considered, and data already shows us that Coronavirus disproportionately affects those who are frail and, or with chronic health conditions (Yang et al, 2020) . It is also highly likely that, despite this guidance, there will be limited critical care resources, as seen across the world in the face of this pandemic. Not everyone will be able to access the level of care they might need. The greater emphasis over the past decade on making timely and appropriate treatment escalation decisions that align with a person's wishes has, to some extent, paved the way for these conversations necessary in the current climate. Clinicians have to become confident in these conversations and about the implications of critical care for individuals. The long-term sequelae associated with ICU admission (post-intensive care syndrome [PICS]) includes physical weakness and/or psychosocial and cognitive morbidity, particularly when ventilated for a length of time (Desai et al, 2011; Kress et al, 2014) . These PICSrelated consequences can result in significant and persistent burden (Bagshaw et al, 2015; Iwashyna et al, 2010; Wade et al, 2015) , and a much lower quality of life, even years later (Cuthbertson et al, 2010) . However, in a pandemic scenario, it is rarely feasible to have meaningful conversations about a person's opinions and wishes about ICU admission because people are admitted acutely unwell. For patients with coronavirus in the UK there is rapid escalation to intubation, and sadly therefore little time for those discussions.. By necessity, many family conversations are also taking place via telephone, with little opportunity for reading important non-verbal cues (Hall et al, 1995) , thereby diminishing the quality of that end-of-life communication.",36.06053549917608,15.448111176542684

During an epidemic of a disease, the goal may be to minimize death and disability; during a disease pandemic, the goal may shift to preserving basic functioning of society by devoting available resources to maintenance of critical infrastructure, such as law enforcement, emergency medical services and utilities. 109, 110 Major unsettling events-particularly ones with national or global implications-can adversely affect entire industries, and health care is not immune to such systemic shocks. Optometrists are relatively unique in the health care sector as service providers while also being a link in the chain of commerce. In the case of a pandemic flu, fear of contagion, logistical and transportation challenges, understaffing of utility companies, suppliers, and couriers, and a host of other problems can impede the ability to give or receive goods and services. As other companies experience employee absenteeism, a ""domino effect"" could arise causing a shortage of manufacturing and warehouse personnel as well as a shortage of drivers and couriers fearing contracting illness during one of many delivery stops.",33.929520023237934,12.738462799618585

In a care team, a group of health care workers work together to care for a defined group of patients, usually in a fixed geographical area. This system makes use of a pyramid supervisory structure with less skilled or experienced staff being supervised and assisted by a small number of more skilled or experienced health care workers. This allows resources to be used more efficiently and allows less skilled health care workers working in expanded roles to function safely and effectively. A 50 % increase in the critical care human resources capacity could be obtained by supplementing experienced ICU staff with non-ICU staff in care-teams. This structure is also consistent with the IMS organizational structure.

Information provided by the focus group participants highlights a number of educational/reference materials that are needed for the current novel H1N1 event and future pandemics and describes the best format for these items. Whenever possible, reference materials need to be translated into multiple languages so that all health care clientele can access this information. Pandemic planning educational and reference materials identified by the focus group participants need to be generated and made available as soon as possible, given the potential resurgence of novel H1N1 or concomitant outbreaks of seasonal influenza and novel H1N1 in fall/winter 2009. The novel H1N1 pandemic illustrates the need for IPs to find new ways of controlling surge and preventing secondary health care-associated transmission during an infectious disease outbreak. Historically, IPs have been concerned primarily about hospitals and acute care settings. The novel H1N1 pandemic demonstrates the need to implement infection prevention strategies in all health care settings, including ambulatory care centers, physician offices, home health, and long-term care. Infection prevention emergency management guidance for these nonacute care settings has been lacking. It is essential that infection prevention recommendations be developed for these settings to help control disease spread and ultimately prevent and control surge in hospitals. One essential component of these recommendations is the identified need for a stronger focus on occupational health. Staff surge capacity is necessary to maintain functionality of health care facilities during pandemics, and healthy staff contributes strongly to sustaining this capacity. Occupational health issues that need to be addressed include having policies and procedures for screening/ triaging staff, furloughing employees, and better sick leave practices to prevent ill health care providers from coming to work sick during pandemics.",38.70883821999561,18.353197096232932

In most acute care hospitals, making the ""bottom line"" is a challenge in itself, let alone providing services and capacity for an event that may never happen, developing resources that are costly with limited or no pre-event funding, and planning for expenditure of resources that may not be reimbursed. The end result is opposing forces and policies in which preparedness efforts are attempting to increase surge capacity while cost containment measures are shifting care away from acute care centers (ACCs).",41.42407749995153,18.236663397318086

In 2004, the creation of the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) was an important investment and commitment to public health at the federal level. Following SARS, avian influenza virus (H5N1) provoked tremendous concern in 2006 given its high human mortality rate and disproportionate impacts for health care workers (PHAC 2015) . By 2006, pandemic planning was in full swing and a revised Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan for the Health Care Sector (CPIP) was published. CPIP was created as a guidance document to inform and support the health care sector in the management of pandemics (PHAC 2015) . It outlines the roles, responsibilities and strategies to be used by the federal government to mitigate, prepare for, and respond to large-scale outbreaks of influenza. In 2009, a psychosocial annex was developed to supplement the plan (PHAC 2009). Acknowledgement of occupational risks to health care workers and risks to socially vulnerable groups in society was an important advancement in pandemic planning at that time.

As one participant noted, ''all the information that came out was basically for schools or acute care.'' Other participants stated that it was difficult to know how to manage novel H1N1 patients in this setting without guidance: One specific occupational health issue that focus group participants felt needs to be addressed is how to manage or prevent ill health care providers coming to work sick. As one participant stated, ''As much as you tell [health care workers] not to come to work sick, they still come.. We cannot allow employees to work sick, even with seasonal flu.'' Money may be one potential reason that employees may work when sick. As one participant explained it, ''Sometimes people will say, ÔI can't afford not to work.Õ '' Another focus group participant agreed and added, ''It's hard to keep people off work when they are sick.''

Another participant agreed and added, ''Of course the hospitals don't want to hear that you're not going to let the staff work.'' One focus group member stated that her human resource department was hesitant to furlough employees due to novel H1N1 because it would cost the hospital money. She was told by human resources, ' compensation] would not cover occupational exposures to [novel H1N1] because it's also out in the community.'' There was also some confusion about and hesitancy to enforce the CDC-recommended 7-day furlough period for staff infected with novel H1N1.

Companies were hesitant to allow employees to return to work without some reassurance from the medical community that the employee was no longer contagious.

[1] [2] [3] In July 2009, the H1N1 pandemic influenza virus was viewed by the World Health Organization to be of moderate virulence, with similarities to seasonal influenza. Investigation of swine-origin H1N1 influenza viruses, however, found them to be more virulent and pathogenic than seasonal influenza, indicating that the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic could become more virulent and pathogenic. 4 It is estimated an influenza pandemic of mild to moderate virulence with a modest attack rate of 15% would tax the Canadian health care system and result in 18,000 deaths, 64,000 hospitalizations, and 2.1 million patients seeking outpatient care. 2 An attack rate of 35% would overwhelm Canadian hospitals. 2 Ontario acute care hospitals currently operate at over 90% capacity, and it is projected that an influenza pandemic will overburden bed, intensive care unit, and ventilator capacity. 3 A survey of Canadian nurses found a perceived shortage of medical equipment and supplies such as ventilators and bedding and a lack of support for health care workers in a large scale respiratory outbreak. 5 American hospitals also operate near capacity and lack the surge capacity necessary to manage an influenza pandemic. 6 Infection control professionals in the United States reported that acute care hospitals were not prepared for large scale infectious outbreaks and that there will be shortages of health care workers and medical equipment and supplies. 7 The suboptimal level of infection prevention and control resources in Canadian, American, and international acute care hospitals will be rate limiting in the face of a significant outbreak or pandemic of a severe respiratory illness.

In this section, we propose a way forward, taking into account what China has already embarked on, what is feasible in view of existing institutional constraints, and supplemented by international experience. We take as a starting point that the government will continue to fund basic health care, mainly through SHI, with some direct funding to primary health-care facilities and that it is highly unlikely that the government will reverse course to directly pay hospitals from government budgets; and that the for-profi t private hospital market share will continue to grow as a result of government policies and increased demand from a population with rising income. Therefore, the question is how to introduce systemic changes that would make the best use of these conditions, bearing in mind ongoing reform eff orts described in table 1. Figure 1 shows the systemic framework followed in our proposal. We fi rst discuss what the government might do to improve the organisation of health-care delivery and then how fi nancing and provider payment incentives could be used to further enhance improvements of delivery. Figure 1 provides a schematic representation of the various policy levers that could aff ect health-care delivery decisions, either independently or in combination with one another. The organisational features of the health sector-such as ownership, governance, market competition, level of integration, and norms of practice-all aff ect health-care delivery practices. Additionally, how health care is fi nanced and how providers are paid substantially aff ects treatment decisions because they create diff erent incentives for providers.

In this Review, we discuss how China's health-care system would perform if hospital privatisation combined with hospital-centred fragmented delivery were to prevail-population health outcomes would suff er; health-care expenditures would escalate, with patients bearing increasing costs; and a two-tiered system would emerge in which access and quality of care are decided by ability to pay.

This funding supported the establishment and enhancement of influenza surveillance and laboratory detection across the Region, and technical support, assistance and guidance to member states were provided by the WHO Regional Office. This programme was extended for another five-year period in 2011, with a primary focus on strengthening capacity in three areas-(1) to enhance epidemiological and virological surveillance of influenza, (2) to estimate the disease burden associated with influenza, and (3) to support policies to introduce and increase the use of seasonal influenza vaccines. The programme's objectives stemmed from the rationale that those countries with strong influenza surveillance and vaccine programmes would be better prepared to respond to an influenza pandemic. Building on the success of the first five-year period of improving influenza surveillance in WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region during 2006-2011, the second five-year period between 2011 and 2016 saw further improvements in all three areas of enhancing influenza surveillance, estimating disease burden and use of influenza surveillance data to develop informed policies and strategies for control of influenza. The funding support to seven priorities countries via the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework (PIP) in 2014 greatly supplemented the ongoing works of the Regional Office and spurred the momentum that already generated through the support of US CDC to strengthen influenza surveillance programme in the Region. This paper highlights the capacity achieved in the countries of WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region in the areas of influenza surveillance system between 2011 to 2018 in each of these three areas-influenza surveillance and laboratory detection; influenza disease burden estimation; and use of seasonal influenza vaccines for influenza control.

In the United States, state and federal stockpiles of medical supplies exist can be rapidly distributed, 3 but a pandemic scenario is likely to complicate resource allocation on local and sub-national levels because of competing areas of similar need, limiting the allocation and deployment of these resources. This bottleneck could be ameliorated through technology by decreasing our reliance on human estimation thresholds of when to galvanize action. During emergencies, decisionmakers may be inundated with data and information leading to improvident action, or worse, inaction. Tools and technology that automate the presentation of data to decisionmakers could help by triggering alerts and pushing messages indicating aberrancy to both decision-makers and front-line staff. Theoretically, this technological dashboard with decision support tools would improve outbreak response by leading to the earlier mobilization of resources.

Results also show that the number of acute care beds from more than 45 designated hospitals plus two newly built ones in Wuhan has been consecutively increasing up to 23 532 (as of Feb 24) under the government-directed re-allocation (Fig. 1D) . This supply thus enabled the severe and critical patients to be treated timely and effectively 6 . More importantly, there have been over 10 temporary hospitals (named Fangcang hospitals) reconstructed from gymnasium and exhibition centers, which provide more than 26 000 makeshift beds for mild patients (Fig. 1D) . These combinations guaranteed nearly 100% percent of COVID-19 patients to be treated in hospitals even if the number of remaining confirmed cases has ten-fold increased up to 38 000 on 18 Feb (Fig. 1D) . In contrast, a lot of patients had to stay at home in the early stage of the outbreak in Wuhan due to the shortage of beds such that many transmissions in households occurred 6 . Accordingly, the effective implementation of comprehensive control measures and infection-treatment practices is critical for combatting any new pathogens, not only interrupting the transmissions but also saving the patients. Timely supplied medical resources, including re-allocation of acute care beds, rapid construction of new hospitals and generous aid of health workers by other less-severe areas, apparently help the epicenter of the outbreak Hubei (Wuhan) to accomplish a unique and also encouraging outcome for life-saving such that the mortality and recovery rates of nearly 50 000 COVID-19 patients exponentially decays and grows, respectively. Other crucial factors contributing to this success may include the improved and optimized diagnosis and treatment strategies 8 , which are critical for saving severe and critical patients 5, 6, 9 . This speculation appears to be supported by the exponential growth of the COVID-19 recovery rate outside Hubei (Fig. 1B) where medical resources are relatively sufficient 10 .

In addition to the benefits above regarding healthcare resource management and provision of emotional support, we expect psychiatry to be essential in helping to prevent and manage the higher levels of depression and worse outcomes that have been observed in patients requiring infectious isolation in hospital settings. 3 Similar to other acutely medically ill patients, those with presentations concerning for COVID-19 are likely to be vulnerable to delirium, agitation, and decompensations of psychosis or mood disorders, necessitating psychiatric evaluation. Psychiatrists will also be needed to assist with capacity evaluations for these patients should they wish to leave against medical advice (AMA). Finally, as our medical colleagues face exhaustion, anxiety, and burnout from the increasing volume of patients and uncertainty regarding healthcare resources, the need for C-L psychiatrists to provide moral support through our liaison role will be critical. This is not the first pandemic we have seen; our mentors tell us the stories of working on the wards during the early cases of HIV/AIDS in the 1980s and the Hong Kong influenza in 1968. It is not surprising that we face similar challenges today, with fear of infection transmission among health care professionals ranging from reasonable concern to panic. During this modern pandemic, some mental health care can and should transition to remote channels. In medical hospitals without psychiatrists on-site, telehealth is clearly preferable over the option of having no psychiatric support. However, where resources allow, we encourage our fellow C-L psychiatrists to stand firm in our role as physicians providing critical in-person care to patients and colleagues who need our care now more than ever. With close attention to following the evolving precautions dictated by infectious disease authorities and hospital leadership, let us model to psychiatry trainees the importance of C-L psychiatry presence in the acute care hospital amidst these challenging times.",34.282642068658525,16.70321647303103

In the last decade, substantial investments have been made in surveillance systems for early detection of natural infectious disease clusters and of intentional acts of bioterrorism. Previous studies demonstrate that surveillance is useful in detecting specified communicable diseases. Such systems include the sentinel provider system (USA) [12] , sentinel physician networks (European countries) [13] , influenza surveillance system (Japan) [14] , Australian sentinel practice research network (Australia) [15] , epidemiological surveillance networks (France) [16] , electronic point-of-sale (EPOS) pharmacy (England) [17] , infectious diseases surveillance system (Japan) [18] , ambulatory-care-based syndromic surveillance system (USA) [19] , real-time syndrome surveillance (Canada) [20] , and infectious disease prevention and control system (Germany) [21] . A categorization of computerized ENID surveillance systems by the timeliness of their response is shown in Fig. 1 . Most of these systems set the types of diseases under surveillance, and report the number of diseases covered, the geographical area covered, and the population covered. However, the time delay allowed is from 24 h to a week, except that [18, 20] , and the proposed EDICTS are on-line. There is generally one-way communication, i.e. from medical institutions to CDC, and only EDICTS is real-time and with automatic reporting, while [20] , for example, is done manually and by telephone. The implementation of an ""All-In-One"" Taiwanese NHI-IC card came into effect on 1st July 2003 in metropolitan and local community hospitals. The infrastructure was fully operational on a national scale and the first phase of implementation went into effect at the beginning of 2004. TBNHI constructed IDC to manage and maintain the NHICS database and a full-time bidirectional service network (the TBNHI intranet) for connecting all PoPs to IDC [22] . Moreover, the Taiwanese experience with SARS in 2003 proved that the health IC cards can play an important role in delivering solutions to healthcare providers and patients. The NHI-IC card carries a visually and electronically readable identifier to speed access to patient information. This leads to reductions in paper work, administrative costs and entry errors. The standard operations of using IC cards at the time of registration, at the doctor's side, and in the information infrastructure serve as a sound basis for better, faster delivery in the ENID reporting system. Moreover, the current practice of a surveillance system needs a real-time mechanism for quick spreading epidemic diseases. EDICTS is thus an appropriate mechanism that utilizes the NHICS infrastructure, in accordance with CDC policy, to deliver real-time response to ENID.",33.93500443440822,14.495031033453857

Existing literature does not adequately describe the needs of nurses while working during disaster situations, nor is it clear why nurses do or do not respond.

The West African Ebola virus outbreak in particular has triggered substantial reflection and discussion among the global public health and security communities [1] . The failure to control the disease, which had a high fatality rate in resource-poor regions, has led to calls for more spending on and improving healthcare infrastructure to prevent the recurrence of such an event in West Africa or elsewhere [1] . It is clear that most of the proposed changes aim to prevent another outbreak of this scale by improving the capacity of all nations, but especially of resourcepoor nations, to deal with the logistical and medical requirements. A more simple way to phrase this is that the changes aim to increase capacity to respond to an outbreak. There are also calls to improve detection to enable a faster response to an outbreak; if an infection is detected earlier, a quick response should minimise the potential for a pandemic. But these discussions fail to address the other aspect of what partnerships such as the Global Health Security Agenda aim to do: preventing outbreaks in the first place. I suspect that the focus on ""detect and respond"" instead of the ""prevent, detect, respond"" triad owes to the fact that improving the ""detect and respond"" capacity is mostly a technical challenge. Admittedly, these technical challenges are substantial and societal issues might also need to be addressed, but, as a healthcare community, we know how to achieve this: invest more money and time to build more laboratories, provide more resources and train more people. I absolutely welcome this.

The triage choices in pandemic planning for the distribution of vaccines and antivirals are open, coordinated, and institutionally adopted. Perhaps this is one reason why they have drawn so much attention. … No doubt there are other explanations, too, for the apparent assumption that devoting resources to pandemic planning is just. … Nonetheless, there are serious questions of justice to be asked about the allocation of extensive resources to pandemic threats.98
And, as they go on to point out, questions concerning the ‘justice of’ and ‘justice within’ pandemic planning are not unrelated. Put shortly, if basic health care infrastructure is in a state of neglect or unavailable, if health professionals are in short supply or are not trusted by the population, and if there is inequality in access to primary care, then global surveillance, surge capacity and, more generally, preventing and coping with a pandemic will be all the more difficult. ‘Pandemic myopia’, in other words, is a seriously flawed approach to pandemic planning99—which is surely something that human rights advocates (whether they see themselves as ‘risk strategists’ or not) need to be arguing as strongly and clearly as possible.",37.29386896182281,14.900356147698698

Epidemiologists have been modeling likely scenarios, but the models are notoriously inaccurate early on in a pandemic phase [11]. Using an attack rate ranging from 10 to 30% of the population with a hospital admission rate close to 1% and a case-fatality rate close to 0.14%, as in seasonal flu (an hypothesis supported by preliminary data [1]), the pandemic may have a major impact on health services and ICM in particular. Some models have predicted critical care demand at the peak surge of the pandemic to be well in excess of 100% of available facilities, even in the most developed countries [11]. This is of considerable concern to practicing Intensivists. Increasing intensive care support by a factor of two without additional skilled and trained specialists and without the usual range or technical facilities and support services may well force us to ventilate more patients than normal, but this would not be ‘quality critical care.’ If this increased surge was to occur, then the numbers of patients presenting would be well in excess of the available capacity to provide them with quality care. This will necessitate triage. The ethics of triage have been discussed several times [12–15], but the concerns as to whether the ethical or legal framework will ultimately support clinicians faced with these tribulations remain. Practicing for a greater good, rather than what is best for an individual patient, may be the pragmatic answer to the problem, but clinicians are rightly concerned that this may lead to future complaint and legal or professional censure.

Convergence analysis does not focus on the difference between specific areas, but looks at the time trend of variation reduction in HCEs, or other health indicators. Triggered by the seminal articles by Barro and Sala-i-Martin and Mankiw et al, a huge amount of convergence literature emerged in various contexts, mainly to study patterns of economic growth across different regional economies.7-9 Health economists have also adopted convergence analysis to measure health variation within and between regions.

He estimates the risks for the short and medium term very low. “From a security perspective, many people are concerned that it is now possible to directly construct harmful pathogens from DNA sequence information. This seems to me a real but remote possibility, and is likely best addressed by improvements in our capacity to respond to emerging infectious diseases, natural or otherwise, and to our public health systems.

Unfortunately, data on health care capacity is rel atively scarce and we have to rely on data from 2017,2018 or even older. Data availability is even worse for critical care beds, on which we rely on multicountry data from 2010. Remuzzi & Remuzzi report ICU capacity of 5200 beds for Italy as a whole, which is lower than the 7550 critical care beds reported by Rhodes et al. [1, 5] . It is likely that other EU countries have downsized their critical bed capacity too. In terms of curative beds per 100 000 population as reported by Eurostat, for most countries (all except Ireland, Bulgaria, Poland and Romania), we observed a downward trend in the past 10 years. Moreover, hospital capacity strain was recently found to be associated with increased mortality and decreased health outcomes [10] . Note that if we would assume the same extent of downsizing in Italy and other EU countries, our relative comparisons would not change. Note that we compare these countries by their base capacity, while clearly many countries have expanded their base capacity to differing degrees (eg, additional beds, mobilizing volunteers or retired Physicians x critical care beds (Physicians + nurses) x critical care beds health care workers). We therefore will track at which relative pressure individual countries can no langer handle the volume of critical patients and which pressure on their base capacity they experience at the peak. Note also that we do not account for health care workers' incapacitation from COVID-19 or other causes as the epidemic unfolds. Our analysis shows that many European countries are soon to be confronted with a health care pressure that will exceed current healthcare capacity. Based on the intensity-approach and the composite measures, we believe that the healthcare pressure in Spain is already at very high levels. For The Netherlands and France the pressure on healthcare systems will soon reach Italy's levels. Where this is not yet done, policymakers should urgently expand their health care capacities to avoid pressure as experienced in Italy. Our analysis informs policy makers on how far their country is removed from an overloaded healthcare system. As such, this information can be useful to plan ahead in order to relieve pressure on their national healthcare system. Moreover, the evolving healthcare pressure, especially the pressure experienced by each country at the peak, will be useful to plan future outbreaks and a timely expansion of health care capacity.",33.592185152103966,14.359791080540083

As of March 26, 2020, the United States had the highest number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV2, of any country in the world. 2 Multiple areas in the US are seeing dramatic increases in cases of COVID-19 and concerns are mounting that local medical system response capacities will be quickly exceeded. Hospital critical care is perhaps the most important medical system choke point in terms of preventing deaths in a disaster scenario such as with the current COVID-19 pandemic. 3, 4 A spectrum of critical care, from intensive care units to other serviceable hospital critical care structures, can be drafted in the event of mass disasters, potentially doubling hospital capacity in a crisis care surge situation. 5, 6, 7, 8 However, whether the nation's potential hospital surge capacity is exactly double, or perhaps more or less than that, in the context of rapidly growing cases of COVID-19 in the US, remains unclear.

Our objectives in doing this was to highlight US counties that are at risk of exceeding their critical care surge capacity limits within one month, indicate the typical time it would take these counties to exceed their critical care surge capacity limits, and estimate the excess mortality that would potentially result from exceeding critical care surge capacity limits in these counties. These objectives speak to the capabilities of the US medical system under disaster conditions and the usefulness of social distancing and other prevention strategies for slowing the presentation rate of severe COVID-19 cases to a point where the US critical care system can adapt in minimizing preventable mortality. 11, 12 ",28.914696994116053,12.183484170776158

A major concern that then arises is whether the critical care surge capacity in these counties is sufficient to care for the projected numbers of COVID-19 cases that will continue to mount. As a matching concern, the relocation or travel of urban residents with undetected COVID-19 infection to non-urban areas that appear to be relatively unaffected may overwhelm the relatively limited critical care capacity in otherwise isolated non-urban regions. A potential example of this in the current dataset is the Colorado cluster that includes major winter vacation resorts that may have had visitors in from major cities in the US and internationally soon before public notification of the current COVID-19 crisis.",27.122225564463033,11.994857361525378

Furthermore, countries with residual circulating virus would have to be completely isolated to avoid reintroduction. Still, prolonged intensive control could be a means to gain time until the development and large-scale availability of a vaccine. However, the amount of time this will take is unpredictable. An alternative approach is to develop herd immunity through natural infection while keeping the number of cases within the limits of the health care system.

That is, in successive parts of the country (say provinces or municipal health services catchment areas) all stringent interventions are released, such that the epidemic can rage locally, while maintaining strict control in the remaining parts that wait for their turn. At the same time, Covid-19-related IC admissions should be distributed over the whole country such that the national health care system is not overburdened. After the lift of control in their area, its inhabitants can resume their normal daily activities as before Covid-19. Importantly, individuals most vulnerable to the virus need to be shielded until their area has achieved herd immunity. A further requirement is that their care providers (professionals or possibly family members) are absolutely free of the virus or immune. Obviously, this strategy will require a lot of ambulance transport of severe cases, but this should be feasible in small countries with good infrastructure, such as the Netherlands. Larger countries can consider implementing the strategy in specific geographic regions. Box 1 provides a summary of the strategy, including minimum conditions and a calculation of the IC capacity threshold in terms of the number of prevalent Covid-19 cases in the population.",28.09828745548745,11.553436348127196
