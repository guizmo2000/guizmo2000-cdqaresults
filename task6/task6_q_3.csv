The model tracks the number of susceptible (S), infected (I) and recovered (R) individuals in each population each day of the simulation. The simulations begin with a single initial infection in Mexico on January 5th 2009 [31] . Infection spreads through mass-action within each population according to the following epidemiological parameters. Population-specific host population size is equal to human population size (Text S1). Basic epidemiological parameters are based on empirical estimates from H1N1: the duration of infection was chosen as 3 days [31] and the basic reproductive number (R 0 ) or average number of secondary infections arising from a primary infector during their infectious period in a completely susceptible population was chosen as 1.3 [31] . This results in a transmission rate b~0:433. Although estimates of R 0 for pandemic H1N1 vary across studies, the exact R 0 value is unlikely to affect the comparative simulations we perform as this is expected to equally impact the overall expansion rate and not the relative migration dynamics across populations. Force of infection l j within population j scales with infected frequency across populations following l j~P n i~1 r ij bI i S j =N j , where the coupling coefficient r ij represents the rate of contacts from population i to population j relative to within-population contacts and r jj~1 . Other pairwise coupling coefficients are taken to be proportional to pairwise migration estimates, so that r ij~c m ij , where m ij is the air travel based or phylogenetically estimated rate of migration from population i to population j per year and parameter c is fitted to the data. Parameter c is the only free parameter in this model and we set this to the value that maximizes correspondence between simulations and observations (see below). This ensures that we can use phylogeographic migration rates as per capita migration rates in the simulation model, despite their different scales.

Reflecting on this controversial issue, Calain and Poncin charged that the aim of the quarantine was to control the movement not of people who had been exposed to Ebola but of people whom the authorities did not trust to report their symptoms [14] . The use of quarantine in this case was perceived by communities as an arbitrary enforcement [14] . The importance of the third criterionproviding those in quarantine with basic needs (e.g. food, water, medical supplies), lost income and means of communication with their relatives living outside the quarantine zonewas demonstrated by the role of support services in the high voluntary compliance with quarantine measures during the 2003 SARS epidemics in Taiwan, China [24] and Canada [44] .

However, this trend appears to be a by-product of strong MHC differentiation between only a few populations. This claim can be strongly supported by the comparisons of pairwise G' ST between two markers ( Figure 6 ). Most outliers with significantly higher MHC-G' ST values were associated with BJ. BJ was highly differentiated at MHC from all the other six populations, and obtained extremely high MHC-G' ST with the four populations from group 1 (as suggested by STRUCTURE). This might be associated with the unusually high frequency of HT03 (60.0%) and low frequency of HT02 (14.3%) in BJ compared to those in other six populations ( Table 2) . Given the similar habitat and management across captive populations, the partially higher differentiation at MHC might arise from restricted gene flow translated into different adaptations to local pathogen communities (e.g., reference [18] ), rather than fluctuating selection under spatial/temporal heterogeneity in pathogen communities. This is consistent with the demographic history of BJ: as the first captive population, it was established in 1986, and has been almost completely isolated for a long time with restricted in-migrants.

Values of p c ¼ 50% and h ¼ 30% were assumed for baseline intervention scenarios (Table 1 ; Figures  2 and 3 ). Our estimated changes in IAR were also sensitive to the delay in the provision of anti-virals to households and to the delay in the isolation of symptomatic individuals ( Figure  4B ), although less so than to p c and h. In deciding whether to implement any or all of the policies described here, local public health officials may wish to consider available epidemiological data (to assess R 0 and h) and also estimate the levels of compliance that could be achieved for the different options in their populations. As compliance may be higher for policies that provide immediate benefits to the individual, we suggest that compliance will be low for Q, higher for QI and QA, and higher still for QIA. It is likely that the provision of anti-viral prophylaxis and treatment would increase compliance substantially. Our baseline assumption of 50% compliance is intended to be conservative. Intuitively, it seems likely that household-based interventions would work with high levels of compliance. Here, we have shown that even moderate levels of compliance would allow household-based public health interventions to be effective. Also, the marginal benefits of the use of anti-virals or isolation (policies QI, QA, and QIA versus Q) may not be justified if the average times for the provision of these services exceed 3 to 4 d, given that the quarantine period is set at 7 d.",16.956679101527655,8.647079931208811

This overlap in pathways and the consequence of using overlapping machinery for release can result in phenotypic similarities between microvesicles and retroviruses and potentially interfere with anti-HIV strategies.

With a heightened increase in concern for an influenza pandemic we sought to better understand the 1918 Influenza pandemic, the most devastating epidemic of the previous century. Methodology/Principal Findings. We use data from several communities in Maryland, USA as well as two ships that experienced well-documented outbreaks of influenza in 1918. Using a likelihood-based method and a nonparametric method, we estimate the serial interval and reproductive number throughout the course of each outbreak. This analysis shows the basic reproductive number to be slightly lower in the Maryland communities (between 1.34 and 3.21) than for the enclosed populations on the ships (R 0 = 4.97, SE = 3.31). Additionally the effective reproductive number declined to sub epidemic levels more quickly on the ships (within around 10 days) than in the communities (within 30-40 days). The mean serial interval for the ships was consistent (3.33, SE = 5.96 and 3.81, SE = 3.69), while the serial intervals in the communities varied substantially (between 2.83, SE = 0.53 and 8.28, SE = 951.95).

Garske et al. estimates indicate that the value was consistently smaller in the communities than in the ships. It is not clear exactly how to interpret this result. Further, we consistently see a large initial value for the reproductive number. In the ships, this value is higher and rapidly drops off, perhaps due to the close quarters and extremely rapid transmission that could take place in these very vulnerable populations. In the communities, the reproductive number tended to drop off later, typically around day thirty. This could be due to a larger initial susceptible population and more complicated dynamics for the disease to spread, leaving large pockets of susceptible individuals unexposed for a longer period of time than in the ships.

Standard isolation precautions are designed to reduce the risk of acquiring occupational infections from both known and unknown sources in healthcare settings. Awareness of and compliance with these recommendations are crucial for the prevention of infections among healthcare workers (HCW), including dental healthcare professionals. The recrudescence of diseases such as HIV, tuberculosis, hepatitis B and C, and other maladies that were on the decline have made it essential that strict sterilization be maintained. The results of this study showed that the implementation of different infection control measures was good to excellent, except for hepatitis B vaccination and wearing eye protection. Saudi Arabia was one of the HBV-endemic countries with an overall prevalence of 8.3%. The infection was mostly spread through horizontal transmission in early life. Over the years, there has been an enormous decrease in HBV incidence in Saudi Arabia, and the prevalence rate in 2009 was found to be 1.31% which places Saudi Arabia among the countries with the lowest prevalence rate of HBV worldwide [12] , [13] , [14] , [15] , [16] , [17] . Unfortunately, previous studies reported that HCW in Saudi Arabia showed low compliance with hepatitis B vaccination, and it became mandatory to structure educational programs to raise the awareness and enhance health-care workers' compliance with HBV vaccination [26] , [37] , [38] . It is noteworthy that HBV vaccination compliance was also below expectations among HCW in Brazil, Serbia, Libya, Ethiopia, China and India [10], [11], [25] , [26] , [27] , [28] , [35] , [36] , [42] . In previous studies investigating dental students' and interns' knowledge of, attitude toward and compliance with HBV vaccination among private and governmental dental schools in Saudi Arabia, their attitude was positive regarding infection control protocols, but they unfortunately lacked compliance with HBV vaccination; greater emphasis on the importance of immunization and vaccine coverage was needed. In our study population the compliance was greater than that of these other studies [33] , [37] , [45] , [46] , [47], [48] , [49] , [50] but still in need of improvement. The results of this study demonstrate a need to further emphasize eye protection. The importance of protective eyewear was found to be in the interest of both dentist and patient due to the hazards associated with aerosols and floating debris. The use of eye protections with side shields, and regular monitoring of its structural integrity, reduces the risk of conjunctivitis, eye damage or even complete loss of vision [8]. The use of protective eyewear by dental students, interns and dentists in Saudi Arabia was found to be low in previous studies [33] , [37] , [45] , [46] , [47] , [48] , [49] , [50] .

The second moments vary much more, however. In general they tend to be much larger for the ships when using the Garske et al. method compared to the MLE method. For the communities, we observe that they are consistently around 10 for the Garske et al. method and vary much more for the MLE method. Also of interest in these results are the large error estimates, particularly for Cumberland, but also to a smaller extent for Frederick. This is perhaps indicative of the model not fitting the data as well, for instance the logistic model may not be the best fit in this scenario, or that the lack of census data on cases might be more problematic here.",15.486022354510968,7.806113547555249

The potential use of this compound as an antiinfluenza drug should take into consideration the possibility that even within the same subtype, different strains may present significantly divergent sensitivities to chloroquine as a consequence of their different pH requirements. Moreover, sensitivity to chloroquine may vary in different cell populations susceptible to influenza A virus infection, depending on different capabilities of endosome acidification. Mutations affecting the electrostatic potential of the the HA2 protein subunit of various isolates of the same virus could also be relevant. All these factors should be carefully evaluated when hypothesising a potential clinical utilisation of chloroquine against influenza A viruses. ",21.25396860615537,14.30465193730239

Disease diffusion can vary significantly from place to place and from time to time for a number of reasons, including heterogeneity of the hosts and pathogens, physical and social environments, and interactions across space and time. Moreover, uncertainties linked to population movement and records of infected individuals can increase the difficulty of understanding the spatiotemporal spread of an infectious disease. A number of key studies have shown that infectious disease spread depends significantly upon the spatial features of a population [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] whereas major benefits of spatial disease modeling include the assessment of disease intervention and control strategies (e.g., border control and quarantine). Accordingly, several models have been proposed to quantify the spatial disease features at both population and individual scales [1, [6] [7] [8] . Among the best-known models are the gravity, the spatial micro-simulation, and the network models [1, 6, 9] . Most of these models focus primarily on interactions between the susceptible and infected populations across geographical locations, without considering the continuous local population dynamics of disease evolution. This is especially the case for the gravity model, where the geographical distribution and interaction patterns of populations are discretized into separated locations. Stochastic ''Susceptible-Infected-Recovered'' models (SIR, [10] [11] [12] [13] ) have been widely implemented to represent disease evolution of populations over time. Spatial metapopulation approaches extend SIR models to explicitly account for the local or global population movements between different geographical locations, in terms of patches or networks with deterministic or stochastic characteristics [14] [15] [16] .",16.9763042057736,10.981303709130898

Most people who get influenza (flu) recover quickly, although it can cause serious illness and death, most often in the elderly. Sometimes a new type of flu virus appears that is much more likely to kill. This happened, for example, in 1918, when a worldwide flu pandemic killed between 20 million and 100 million people. Recently, there have been concerns about a flu virus that affects birds, and often kills them. At present the virus does not pass easily from birds to humans, and it does not seem to pass from one human to another. However, the fear is that this virus might change and that human-tohuman infection could then be possible. Should all this happen, the changed virus would be a major threat to human health. With current technology, it would take several months to produce enough vaccine for even a small proportion of the world's population. By that time, it would probably be too late; the virus would already have spread to most parts of the world. It is therefore important for health authorities to consider all the methods that might control the spread of the virus. With the increase in international travel that has taken place, the virus could spread more quickly than in previous worldwide pandemics. Restrictions on international travel might, therefore, be considered necessary, particularly travel by air.",24.478992100570018,10.797323326870496

Household quarantine was very effective, especially for the peak number of cases and total number of cases, with large differences between compliance levels. Household quarantine resulted in a decrease in the peak number of cases from more than 300 to around 158 for a 100% compliance level, a decrease of about 48.7%. The delay in the outbreak peak was about 3 to 17 days. The total number of cases decreased to a range of 3635-5403, that is, 63.7%-94.7% of the baseline value. When coupling control measures, household quarantine together with school closure was the most effective strategy. The resulting space-time distribution of infection in different classes of activity bundles (AB) suggests that the epidemic outbreak is strengthened amongst children and then spread to adults. By sensitivity analysis, this study demonstrated that earlier implementation of control measures leads to greater efficacy. Also, for infectious diseases with larger basic reproduction number, the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical measures was shown to be limited. Conclusions: Simulated results showed that household quarantine was the most effective control measure, while school closure and household quarantine implemented together achieved the greatest benefit. Agent-based models should be applied in the future to evaluate the efficacy of control measures for a range of disease outbreaks in a range of settings given sufficient information about the given case and knowledge about the transmission processes at a fine scale.",15.592883499248792,7.036960955584435

The set of people such individuals may encounter during this infectious period defines their effective neighbourhood of contacts-the totality of people they could potentially infect [16] . In other words, the speed and extent to which infection can transmit may be determined by how quickly contacts are made and how the number of people encountered may accumulate during the infectious period. The number of different people encountered by an individual may asymptote as the number of days considered increases [7] . This saturating relationship may reduce the final variation between individuals' effective neighbourhood size, such that variation in the number of secondary infections arising may not be as great as estimated by information from a single day, particularly for infections with long (multiple day) infectious periods.

New analyses of the diversity and composition of the human microbiome are making it increasingly clear that human health depends on a delicate equilibrium between the microbial inhabitants and the human host [18, 19] . Severe effects on health could be caused not only by the introduction of true pathogens in the traditional sense into these human-asso-ciated microbial communities (e.g., Vibrio cholerae, the etiologic agent of cholera) but potentially also by slight shifts in the proportions of different populations within the community that give an otherwise harmless species or strain an undesirable advantage over others, a similar situation to what is observed in bacterial vaginosis [20] . Probiotic dietary supplements of live microorganisms deliver beneficial bacteria that promote an healthy state of the targeted microbiota. In a completely hypothetical possibility, the opposite would also be plausible, where the healthy microbiota (skin, gut, or upper respiratory tract, among others) may be disturbed by introducing large amounts of ''contrabiotics,'' i.e., living nonpathogenic bacteria that would shift the microbiota away from a healthy state.

Indeed, during the 2014 Ebola response, engaging CHWs in response procedures improved the efficacy of response activities (7) .",14.52728171965148,8.553807589781613

Most participants selected 'lecture' and 'practical training' as preferred teaching methods. Most health professionals and medical students suggested that disaster medicine should be a 'required course for public health professional' and asked for a 'national unified textbook' as standardized teaching material. Most community residents believed 'need to learn disaster medicine' and 'need of disaster medicine course for children', and selected 'willing to participate in disaster simulation drill regularly' and 'community volunteer team for disaster relief should be set up, and willing to participate volunteer team' (Table 4,  Table 5 ). These results indicate that the training needs of disaster medicine is very high in Chinese society and disaster medicine trainings should be executed as indispensable courses for health professionals, medical students, and community residents. Meanwhile, the three groups of participants selected some different key and interested contents for disaster medicine training (Figure 3 and Figure 4 ). This reflects that distinct perception of disaster determines the different needs of disaster medicine training in different populations. Similar differences in several items of the training needs were also presented among the subgroups of study participants. Training programs such as disaster simulation and disaster exercise have proven to be effective and can rapidly deliver core elements of disaster medicine and improve the knowledge level and ability of disaster response [10, 28, 29] . Therefore, future continuing disaster medicine education should focus on developing practice-oriented and core elements-highlighted training courses. Except the high-level interests in 'basic principles of disaster relief', there were some differences of interested contents among different populations, indicating future training program design should consider both core elements and interests, and customize to different needs. As medical teachers were more knowledgeable in disaster medicine than other populations surveyed ( Figure 1B) , they should play a leading role in disaster medicine training. Based on these data, we suggest a diagram flow of disaster medicine training as the Shanghai model in Figure S2 .",16.506875386496585,8.02618565234648

For isolated areas, a focused control or elimination program is likely to stand a better chance of success than those highly connected to high-transmission or outbreak regions. For example, reaching a required childhood vaccination coverage target in one district is substantially more likely to result in disease control and elimination success if that district is not strongly connected to neighbouring districts where the target has not been met. The identification of 'bridge' routes between highly connected regions could also be of value in targeting limited resources for surveillance 28 . Moreover, progressive elimination of malaria from a region needs to ensure that parasites are not reintroduced into areas that have been successfully cleared, necessitating a planned strategy for phasing that should be informed by connectivity and mobility patterns 26 .

Prodromal surveillance tools could be very timely and vital in the realm of emergency communication, advice, behavior change, hygiene and sanitation, and provide an integrated grassroots-based participatory approach. This could lead to more effective prevention, thus curbing the spread and containing the outbreak at the different levels of the disease, and at different places in time and space [3, 6] . (3)Outbreak detection systems urgently require reliable, effective, and cost-effective tools and interventions which allow for constant access to diagnostic tools and personal protective equipment in healthcare centers across the region [7] . (4)Information system-based sentinel surveillance. (5)Biosurveillance systems are used in practice to augment classical outbreak investigations. The major advantages of syndromic systems include sensitivity, timeliness, and flexibility, and being able to provide data for situational awareness. However, biosurveillance precincts lack in specificity, rely on chief complaint data, and lack formal training for users. Linking syndromic data to triage notes and medical chart data would substantially increase the value of biosurveillance in outbreak investigations and thus reduce the health burden [8, 9] . (6)Laboratory-guided detection of disease outbreak surveillance systems relies on detection and monitoring of biothreats enabled by laboratory methods of diagnosis and identifies trends in biosurveillance research. It is based on three approaches, namely: (1) laboratory-initiated infectious disease notifications, (2) SS based on health indicators, and (3) genotyping-based surveillance of biothreats. The insufficient and delayed support for biosurveillance alerts for public health users and the inadequate integration of surveillance signals into action plans remain the major barriers, and require coordination between syndromic and laboratorybased surveillance for efficient public health outbreak monitoring and response [10] . (7)Health indicator surveillance provides authorities with vital health indicators such birth rates, motility rates, and life expectancy. However, trustful and reliable information and communication, health education on preventable fatalities and cautious behavior are also required in order to prevent fear, panic and community resistance to stem out the spread of the disease outbreak. (8)Digital or electronic bio-epidemiology surveillance systems, including social media networking and web-based systems, provide valuable channels for timely collection of public health data; give information on the early detection of, and response to, disease outbreaks; and enhance situational awareness to communities. The creation of blogs and user-generated content has turned social networking into a conversation space in which everyone can participate. However in West Africa, the low level of literacy and high inequality indices compromised the usefulness of such tools to trace and map the Ebola outbreak, as compared to their usefulness and effectiveness in a community with high literacy, for example during the SARS and H9N7 influenza outbreak in Hong Kong and mainland China. Social media (e.g., Twitter, Facebook) and web-based communication provide epidemiological knowledge dissemination, and creates virtual communities based on shared values about critical outbreak perceptions, seriousness of the crisis, and population evidence-based guidance.

A major drawback of normalising against total RNA is that it doesn't account for the inherent variation in the reverse transcription or PCR reactions [42] . There is also a major problem for normalising against genomic DNA, because the extraction rates of RNA and DNA may vary between different samples, with yields of DNA often being low. The presence of variable haplotypes in certain tumour cells [1] and multiple copies of particular loci in replicating bacteria compared to non replicating bacteria [43] are some of the additional problems of normalising against genomic DNA. Use of multiple reference genes rather than one has also been suggested as a robust method for providing accurate normalisation [44] . However, it may not always be feasible to use multiple reference genes due to limitations of the sample availability, cost and even when using multiple reference genes, accuracy remains dependent on the variability of the chosen reference genes [1] . Although these methods are not mutually exclusive, normalising qRT-PCR data using a single internal reference gene continues to be the most widely used method .To conclude, in this study for influenza A infected host cells the most suitable housekeeping gene appears to be 18S rRNA.",14.958038801859823,10.186372171063077

Knowledge about the epidemiology, the diagnostic approach and methods of control are of fundamental importance to tackle the disease. The ETEC causing neonatal colibacillosis mostly carry the fimbriae F4 (k88), F5 (k99), F6 (987P) or F41, while the ETEC of post-weaning diarrhoea carry the fimbriae F4 (k88) and F18. These fimbriae adhere to specific receptors on porcine intestinal brush border epithelial cells (enterocytes), starting the process of enteric infection. After this colonization, the bacteria produce one or more enterotoxins inducing diarrhoea, such as the heat stable toxin a (STa), the heat stable toxin b (STb), and the heat labile toxin (LT). A role in the pathogenesis of the disease was demonstrated for these toxins. The diagnosis of enteric colibacillosis is based on the isolation and quantification of the pathogenic E.coli coupled with the demonstration by PCR of the genes encoding for virulence factors (fimbriae and toxins). The diagnostic approach to enteric colibacillosis must consider the differential diagnosis and the potential different causes that can be involved in the outbreak. Among the different methods of control of colibacillosis, the use of antimicrobials is widely practiced and antibiotics are used in two main ways: as prophylactic or metaphylactic treatment to prevent disease and for therapeutic purposes to treat diseased pigs. An accurate diagnosis of enteric colibacillosis needs an appropriate sampling for the isolation and quantification of the ETEC responsible for the outbreak by using semi-quantitative bacteriology. Definitive diagnosis is based on the presence of characteristic lesions and results of bacteriology along with confirmation of appropriate virulence factors to identify the isolated E.coli. It is important to confirm the diagnosis and to perform antimicrobial sensitivity tests because antimicrobial sensitivity varies greatly among E. coli isolates. Growing concern on the increase of antimicrobial resistance force a more rational use of antibiotics and this can be achieved through a correct understanding of the issues related to antibiotic therapy and to the use of antibiotics by both practitioners and farmers.",15.592770026797632,8.779730354086661

In the particular case of an ecohealth approach that includes livestock within an integrated agriculture system, the goal of improving livelihoods through increased food security will be achieved through healthier livestock and humans, leading to improvements in productivity, increased incomes, and a greater degree of control over economic decision making at the household and community level.

For estimating the transmissibility of different health regions, we used data for laboratory confirmed cases of H1N1 infection, which may introduce some bias due to differential rates of testing across age groups, over time, and possibly between different health regions. It is difficult to assess the magnitude and direction of such biases, but we understand that they influence estimates and comparative analysis of R 0 within and between health regions. While our results demonstrate the variability in diseases transmissibility in different population settings, identification of factors responsible for such variation remains an important objective for future work, and in the context of the 2009 pandemic, understanding the role of these factors merit further population-specific research. For example, we used estimates of generation times from two previous study, which appear to be higher than the early estimate of 1.9 days for generation times based on the La Gloria data from initial outbreaks in Mexico [9] . These estimates may have been slightly inflated by the inclusion of a small number of imported cases. Nevertheless, for a given generation time, estimates of R 0 for remote and isolated communities will remain higher than those for more urban regions. However, the generation time is a key parameter in our study, and we note that it may vary between different populations with distinct demographic variables, which will in turn affect estimates of the reproduction number. Furthermore, R 0 can be calculated as the product of the frequency of effective contact (leading to transmission) and the average infectious period. It is possible that in remote communities, due to the limited access to health services and medical care, an average infectious individual may experience a longer contagious period than an average infectious person in urban centres, hence contributing to a greater reproduction number without having to make more frequent contact per unit time.",24.876077691429977,14.135856928328616

For the second wave in Manitoba, our estimates indicate a reduction in R e with ranges that are considered to be of moderate transmissibility and comparable to those of the 1957 (H2N2) (range: 1.5-1.7) and 1968 (H3N2) pandemics (range: 1.6-2.2), yet significantly higher than the transmissibility of seasonal influenza (range: 1.1-1.4) [12, 30] . The higher estimates of R 0 in the first wave of the 2009 pandemic are linked to outbreaks in remote and isolated communities, and populations of relatively small size; although estimates of the urban centre of the Winnipeg health region are close to the upper bound of previous estimates [12] . Compared to estimates in the province of Ontario (range: 1.25-1.38) [27] , and national Canadian estimates (range: 1.12-1.54) [19] , the results of this study show that projecting the transmissibility using data for large-scale epidemics may not faithfully characterize the transmission pattern of early spread in rural areas and isolated communities. The results of this study have several important implications for future planning to meet the threat of novel influenza viruses. Of greatest concern to public health are the geographic spread, severity, time course of an outbreak, and determining the most effective utilization of available social, preventive, and therapeutic resources to mitigate the impacts of an emerging disease. Understanding the relationship between differential severity and differential transmissibility of a disease in distinct populations can inform possible scenarios for allocation and optimal distribution of health resources prior to and during the spread of an infection to reduce vulnerability of the populations and alleviate disease outcomes. Disease management is also concerned with the transmissibility that is closely related to the final size of an epidemic in the long-term disease dynamics. The parameter R 0 has a clear biological significance: it determines how fast the infection will spread through a population that has been previously unexposed to the disease, its meaning is independent of the model used to estimate its value, and it is dimensionless and thus directly comparable across populations and geographic regions. Our investigation in this study provides compelling evidence for the existence of strong links between transmissibility and differential severity of the disease, in particular in communities with limited access to healthcare. In small communities with strong social ties (e.g., Indigenous populations), frequent interactions between individuals are considerably higher than those in large urban centres, which can result in repeated exposure to infection and may account for a higher between-household transmission rate comparable to the rates of secondary household transmission observed at more southern latitudes. Given factors such as multigenerational households, high between-household social interactions, environmental characteristics, limited access to healthcare, and differential prevalence of predisposing health conditions and other types of health disparities, disease control strategies for remote and isolated communities may be significantly different from those applied to urban centres. Early real-time estimates of transmissibility will therefore be crucial for identifying the type and intensity of intervention measures that are effective in disease containment. In the absence of such information during the early stages of the 2009 pandemic, the existing recommendations for the use of antiviral drugs were modified to include the treatment of moderate to severe cases and individuals with pre-existing conditions or those at risk of developing poor outcomes, but to exclude treatment of mild cases or contacts [31] . For future planning, a less conservative strategy may be beneficial for remote and isolated communities that are more likely to suffer from increased rates of disease transmission. A less conservative strategy might include a broader coverage of antiviral drugs with possible extension to prophylaxis of close contacts in these ""high-risk"" populations. Although not as cost-effective as vaccination, antiviral use for treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis is far more economical than hospitalization or intensive care. Furthermore, without a virus-specific vaccine (which, for example, could have been the case in the fall wave of the H1N1 pandemic had the herald wave not struck in the spring of 2009), antiviral medication may be the only pharmaceutical option and therefore availability and strategic use of drugs is crucial for mitigating disease in these vulnerable communities. With unique population characteristics that place some remote and isolated communities at increased risk for adverse health consequences [1] , it is imperative for public health officials to identify transmission characteristics of early spread for the implementation of effective, feasible, and more economical health responses [32, 33] .",18.076940731761326,10.5363785831085

The AI geodesics produced far fewer such entries than the LE geodesics (by an order of magnitude), and the AI entries were usually smaller. Of the negative entries, the largest was -0.16, but less than 1% of the negative entries had magnitudes greater than 0.01. As with the synthetic graphs, we simply set these negative entries to 0 when using the Louvain method. Figure 8 shows how the number of graph communities varied over time and how different thresholding levels affected those results. With no thresholding, we found that Fig. 6 Communities in interpolated synthetic graphs. When no threshold is applied (top), the Louvain method produces varying numbers of communities during the merger of the two original communities, and even the data snapshot of the merged communities shows not one but four communities; we also see some differences between the two geodesic interpolations. With a threshold (bottom), though, the piece-wise constant nature of the interpolation shows forth the results were too connected (i.e., not enough communities) for all three interpolation methods: after leaving a supplied data point, the number of interpolated communities would immediately drop, remain relatively constant, and shoot up upon reaching the next data point. Thresholding produced better results. Generally speaking, the AI geodesic produced too many communities while the linear interpolation produced too few, and neither produced a steady deformation from one data point to the next. The LE geodesic showed an intermediate behaviour in this regard, and a threshold of 0.02 produced best performance. The number of communities produced by the interpolation did not vary smoothly, but there was a general progression from data point to data point. Changing the threshold value had a small effect on the AI geodesic, but it did nothing to improve the linear interpolation, and using a threshold value of 0.5 actually produced an odd spike in the number of communities halfway between data points. We will return to this phenomenon later. In looking at Fig. 8 , though, we see that there are many communities relative to the size of the graph -most of these are communities of one or two nodes that are not connected to the rest of the graph. If we only consider communities of a certain size, we can get a more accurate picture of the true community dynamics. In Fig. 9 , we look only at communities that contain at least five nodes and consider how the results are affected by different threshold values. When using a threshold value, the results are somewhat similar to those in Fig. 8. In Fig. 8 , there were too few communities because the graph was more connected, and we observe the effects of that increased connectivity here, too: there are fewer communities overall, but the communities that are present tend to be larger, and there are more large communities. The geodesic interpolations, on the other hand, were less connected. Therefore, they had had many small communities and relatively few larger ones; the best results came from the LE geodesic with a small threshold.",18.631041079573556,10.971745942467901

Moreover, if existing methods are extended through time, it will be beneficial to do so in a way that provides new insight or analytical tools as well.

Thus, the epidemiological consequences of viral introduction and spread should depend on the structure of the poultry trade network at the national scale. To understand and quantify this structure, and to identify subnational poultry trade communities, we used a Walktrap algorithm to estimate a maximal-modularity subdivision of the poultry trade network in China (Fig. 3) . This procedure identified five live poultry trade communities (LPTCs), that correspond spatially to the south (LPTC-1), east (LPTC-2), northeast (LPTC-3), midnorth (LPTC-4), and west (LPTC-5) of China (Fig.  3) .

However, frequency of human contact with dromedaries may also be animal-age-dependent (Wernery et al., 2015a) .

This might occur if there were population differences in linkage disequilibrium (LD) pattern or allele frequencies of SLC10A1. Indeed, the allele and genotype frequencies of the SLC10A1 polymorphisms vary with ethnicity. For instance, in the 1068 control subjects of the Sample Set 1 (Southern Chinese), we found that the frequencies of the 267Ser allele and Ser/Ser genotype were 0.10 and 0.0077, while in non-Asian population of the 1000 Genomes Project, the frequency of the 267Ser allele was extremely low, being 0 and 0.0016 in European and African populations, respectively.

Here, we describe a proposed intervention that would overcome these challenges by capitalizing upon Therapeutic Interfering Particles (TIPs) that are engineered to replicate conditionally in the presence of the pathogen and spread between individuals -analogous to 'transmissible immunization' that occurs with live-attenuated vaccines (but without the potential for reversion to virulence). Building on analyses of HIV field data from sub-Saharan Africa, we construct a multiscale model, beginning at the single-cell level, to predict the effect of TIPs on individual patient viral loads and ultimately population-level disease prevalence. Our results show that a TIP, engineered with properties based on a recent HIV genetherapy trial, could stably lower HIV/AIDS prevalence by ,30-fold within 50 years and could complement current therapies. In contrast, optimistic antiretroviral therapy or vaccination campaigns alone could only lower HIV/AIDS prevalence by ,2fold over 50 years. The TIP's efficacy arises from its exploitation of the same risk factors as the pathogen, allowing it to autonomously penetrate superspreader populations, maintain efficacy despite behavioral disinhibition, and limit viral resistance. While demonstrated here for HIV, the TIP concept could apply broadly to many viral infectious diseases and would represent a new paradigm for disease control, away from pathogen eradication but toward robust disease suppression.",18.217510970307895,9.915133475418616

However, some authors have cautioned that increasing the risk perception of the population through such strategies risks societal estrangement and may frighten health care workers, first responders, and those who would have contact with the public in the event of a pandemic [26] . When consensus is reached regarding the optimal level of risk perception required for specific populations to elicit appropriate protective responses, the results of this study may be useful to guide which population groups these artificially inflating or deflating risk communication messages should be targeted.",16.54248035507001,10.043192060736907

While most studies on infectious disease ecology focus on the dynamics of a single host species and single pathogen, we acknowledge that more research is needed to address the complexities of multi host-pathogen dynamics [148] . Community ecology, with its emphasis on the composition of and interconnections between ecological communities, allows one to understand infectious disease dynamics in multi-pathogen, multi-host disease systems that occur across diverse scales (e.g., from within a single host, to between species, to between regions) [148] . Other topics of importance deserving further study in bat species of Western Asia include: effects of extreme weather (e.g., heat waves) on bat survival, including changes in the distribution of bat species (and associated pathogens) and changes in prey abundance or food resources that could alter reproductive patterns and disease transmission [149, 150] . For example, increased prevalence of Marburg virus (MARV) in Rousettus aegyptiacus colonies corresponded with defined periods of synchronized parturition (which resulted in an influx of immunologically-naive, juvenile bats), as well as an increased incidence of spillover into human populations [77] . If such virus-host associations exist in regional bat species, climatic changes may affect reproductive phenology in bats, and therefore the timing of peak viral spillover into human populations. A systems-wide, hypothesis-driven approach will allow for better identification of emerging disease risk factors, and more effective policy recommendations for reducing the disease transmission and spread [146, 148] .",12.35888160601031,8.526932858101228

Antigen or nucleic acid amplified tests (NAATs) are needed to replace microscopy to identify communities in which transmission is still occurring. However, most antigen detection tests using enzyme immunoassays or lateral flow tests have not been shown to be sufficiently sensitive and current NAATs are too expensive and technical demanding for community based screening.

These methods typically rely on matrices in which the columns and rows represent the characteristics of the subpopulations and individual cells are estimates of probabilities of contact or contact rates between each subpopulation as shown in Table 2 . 12, 13 Another method to account for heterogeneous mixing patterns is the use of social networks, 13 for example, areas where public transportation is common in contrast to areas where most individuals use their own transportation.

It should be highlighted that the majority of species introductions do not move beyond the establishment phase. Furthermore, the duration of the establishment period is variable for different species and even for different populations of the same species. In this sense, a species may arrive to a new environment and be present for a long period of time without expanding its initial distribution, and then it may suddenly increase in abundance and rapidly expand to new areas. Such latent invasions may be explained by changes in resource availability linked to disturbance, as well as to genetic adaptations. The establishment phase is a critical period for conservation biologists and managers, given that it is during this phase that measures to eradicate or control abundance and spread are most likely to be successful.

Once the disease has been brought under control it is all forgotten. There is therefore need for continuity in community involvement to achieve effective control of zoonoses and infectious diseases. Raising awareness in the communities in high risk regions about disease prevention, epidemiology, and control could assist in reducing the disease burden. Involving the community in disease prevention and control strategies not only disseminates the important information regarding the disease but also a sense of ownership and responsibility. Often poor communities are treated as entities, where researchers, governments, NGOs and support organizations come and implement their ideologies without thorough engagement of communities. When these organizations leave upon completion of their projects, people go back to their usual habits and practices that put them at risk of disease. Due to poverty, poor communities are lured into projects and campaigns through handouts and other complements that are associated with their participation in the projects. This behaviour serves the interests of organizations conducting the projects to accomplish data collection or spend donor funding, but may have short-lived benefits for the communities. So how do we ensure that communities understand the risks of ID that are associated with their livelihood and lifestyle? Getting the communities involved from the beginning and helping these communities understand the diseases that surround them and the risks that their habits and livelihoods pose with regard to disease is one step towards disease prevention. Building up a knowledge base and setting up infrastructure to combat infectious disease prevention and control improves community awareness. When communities are aware of the dangers and ways of preventing them, and are included as part of the solution, it is more likely that they will be willing to participate.

In fact, epidemics often spread across a heterogeneous landscape of human cities, towns, or rural communities, and this spread depends partly on the links between those locations. This leads us to move from the deterministic SIR model described above to stochastic models, which account for the random nature of individual infection dynamics and demography -for instance, individuals may or may not become infected with a given average probability, so that by chance, particularly in small populations, no new infections may occur, and the chain of transmission may be broken. During the troughs between epidemic outbreaks in smaller communities, incidence may fall to such low numbers that local extinction is likely. Based on this observation, Bartlett [ 9 , 40 ] used analyses of epidemiological data and stochastic models to develop the notion of critical community size (CCS), or population size below which stochastic extinction is expected, which was further developed by Black [ 41 ] in studies of measles persistence in insular populations. Bartlett demonstrated the existence of a CCS of around 300,000-500,000 for measles in England and Wales. For measles to persist in locations with a population size smaller than this CCS, immigration of infected immigrants from elsewhere in the metapopulation is necessary. The result is that the spread of measles across England and Wales in the pre-vaccine era resembled traveling waves spreading out from London [ 6 ] , with a substantial epidemic lag in locations further away. The duration of the lag was also shaped by the size of the local populations. The duration of fade-outs following local extinction contains information on the degree to which a particular location is connected to the metapopulation as a whole [ 42 ] . Generally, this points to larger places being more connected. More detailed parametric analyses tend to confi rm this (e.g., the gravity model [ 43 ] ).",17.004202104747094,9.184599856534529

The genes encoding HLA and killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) are highly polymorphic. This diversity has functional implications and is likely to be driven by microbial selection acting on HLA and KIR gene loci. Different ethnic groups vary in their HLA and KIR allele profiles, which in turn can act as highly informative correlates of ethnicity in anthropological studies. The analysis of HLA and KIR gene profiles in ethnic Thais, has revealed that this major ethnic group is highly representative of the overall gene pool within the large populations of mainland SE Asia. Thus, this geographic region is most suitable for largescale population-based genetic epidemiological studies of emerging infectious diseases such as HIV-1 and dengue, which are of increasing public health concern. HLA and KIR association studies with HIV-1 have been performed in numerous ethnic groups. A variety of effects have been observed particularly with HLA-B57, -B27 and -A11 molecules. There is evidence that the diversity of HIV-1 clades and recombinants infecting different populations is being driven by immune responses controlled by polymorphic HLA molecules. Such an effect may well be responsible for the prevalence of HIV-1 clade E or the CRF01_A/E recombinant in the ethnic Thai, Cambodian Khmer and Vietnamese Kinh populations, while HIV-1 clades B and C and recombinants thereof have seeded predominantly into the more northern Sino-Tibetan-Burman populations of this region. By contrast, all four of the major dengue virus serotypes are known to circulate in mainland SE Asian populations. There is evidence in ethnic Thais that the outcome of exposure to dengue virus in previously exposed and immunologically primed individuals, associates with HLA-A2, -B5 and -B15 molecules, depending on the dengue serotype responsible for secondary infections. Taken together, these studies are of relevance to the design, testing, and implementation of new vaccine control programmes in populations at risk of exposure to HIV-1 and dengue.",19.245074290292397,12.858168870598005

Methods: Key features of the infection control audit were identified by the infection control team and developed into a standardized format for review of clinical areas. The audit incorporates a review of the physical layout, protocols and policies, knowledge of basic infection control principles, and workplace practice review. Results: Over the last 13 years, the infection control unit has completed 17 audits involving 1525 employees. Four-hundred-one staff members have filled out questionnaires that assessed their understanding of standard precautions. A total of 257 recommendations have been made, and 95% of these have been implemented. The majority of recommendations address separation of clean and dirty supplies, hand hygiene compliance, hand hygiene signage, proper use of barriers, and environmental cleaning.

Within-host barriers to infection vary widely and depend on the specific combinations of pathogen, host species and Figure 3 | Bottlenecks to spillover. Different barriers permit or constrain the flow of pathogens from one species to another. The figure is illustrative, owing to the lack of sufficient data for more than one or two barriers for any given system. The width of the gaps in barriers represents the ease with which a pathogen can flow through the barriers and will vary depending on context. The question marks represent points at which the barriers are especi ally poorly understood and highlight gaps in our knowledge of some patho gens that are of global concern (for example, the lack of information on disease dynamics in reservoir hosts of Ebola virus). Many rabies virus reservoirs, such as domestic dogs, are widely distributed. The prevalence of rabies virus is generally low and the incidence of spillover closely tracks the prevalence of infection in the reservoir host. Rabies virus is almost always fatal to spillover hosts 25 . Interventions are usually aimed at reducing the preva lence in reservoir hosts through vaccination 37 . Leptospira interrogans survives in water and soil after being shed in the urine of a wide range of rodents and other reservoir hosts 29 . Key bottlenecks to the zoonotic spillover of this patho gen are exposure and within-host barriers. For example, during floods in Brazil, many humans that are exposed do not become infected, probably because the initial within-host barrier, the skin, is not penetrated 41 . However, once L. interrogans penetrates the skin (for example, through skin wounds), 1-10 leptospires may be sufficient to cause systemic infection 110 . Therefore, wearing protective clothing and boots is an effective control measure 41 . Important bottlenecks to Escherichia coli O157 spillover include heterogeneous shedding from cattle 43, 44 (although it is still unknown whether super-shedding is a characteristic of particular individuals or is a transient phase that occurs in most cattle 42 ). In some contexts, exposure is an important bottleneck; for example, when the pathogen is eliminated from food through cooking. Widespread dispersal leads to uncertainties about the source of many outbreaks 46, 47 , and weak within-human barriers enable low doses of E. coli to cause infection 49, 50 . Humans are frequently exposed to Toxoplasma gondii carried by domestic cats and intermediate hosts, but the parasite rarely causes disease because most humans have strong within-host immunological barriers. Cats are widely and densely distributed, but the prevalence of T. gondii is low and cats shed oocysts only once in their lifetime 111 . However, sporulated oocysts survive in the environment for long periods of time 112 . Limiting exposure to oocysts may prevent spillover; however, this is challenging when it is unclear whether cats or the environment are the major sources of infection in humans 111, 113 . Ebola virus has not been isolated from bats and the definitive reservoir bat species is unknown 114 ; therefore, characteristics of infection in bats are unknown 114, 115 . The pathogen is released through excretion or slaughter, then survives for up to a week, depending on the environmental conditions 116 . The most tractable bottlenecks for intervention may be the zoonotic exposure of humans through interaction with bats, bushmeat or the carcasses of other species 97, 117, 118 , because once exposed, the within-host barriers to Ebola virus may be extremely low 119 . pathogen 60, 61 . Even when pathogens can replicate within cells, several barriers can prevent their transmission to other cells 62, 63 and thus the establishment of an infection. For example, avian influenza virus must pass through a series of within-host barriers to infect a human, including mucins in respiratory tract excretions, specific receptor molecules that constrain virus entry into cells and have different distributions in the respiratory tracts of different host species, suboptimal viral polymerase that restricts the ability of the virus to replicate in cells of the human respiratory tract, viral neuraminidase that is inefficient in its role in the release of influenza viruses from infected cells, and innate immune responses that are initiated early and that block infection in both infected and neighbouring cells 63, 64 .",15.273029485764207,11.252481873629227

Research methods that group multiple barriers or integrate data over space and time may not capture these dynamics. For example, ecological niche models are often used to study zoonotic risk by assessing the distribution of reservoir hosts or vectors 85 , but this approach overlooks variation in downstream barriers that might drive risk. Alternatively, niche models that are based on the documented occurrence of spillover may capture the accumulated distribution of all conditions that enabled barriers to be breached over time (FIG. 1) , but they cannot isolate the precise barriers that affect spillover risk (for example, see REF. 86 ). Therefore, niche models tend to overestimate the spatial range of spillover risk and do not readily enable extrapolation to novel conditions 87 . Examples of this include Hendra virus and Marburg virus, which can be excreted in discrete temporal and spatial pulses from their bat reservoir hosts 20, 88, 89 . However, for spillover, shedding must align with environmental and bat population conditions that generate levels of pathogen pressure that are sufficient to produce an infectious dose (FIG. 2) , and with exposure behaviours and susceptibility of the recipient hosts.

Avoiding introduction in the first place seems particularly important. Understanding the vectors for transmitting invasive species (above) allows the chance to control their spread through influencing human behavior. Some methods seem more feasible than others. For instance, rules on ballast water release from large ships have been legislated in a number of countries (e.g., United States: Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990) and invasion models predict that mid-ocean exchange of water should reduce the load of propagules by a factor of 10 3 -10 4 (MacIsaac et al., 2002) .

Again, this may relate to overestimation of compliance in the questionnaire. The actual difference in compliance between the 2 institutions may be due to the local culture of each hospital, including the strengthening of prevention practices. 22 At site 1, we noted significantly reduced compliance, and, in this same location, the inaccessibility of the required respiratory hygiene material (masks and tissues) was noted on the questionnaire as an obstacle to mask wearing. This is consistent with clear evidence in the literature between the accessibility of the equipment and the observance of a practice. 29 Surprisingly, we also found a difference in actual knowledge between our 2 sites. This may be due to a disparity in the quality of training or an unknown difference between populations.

Briefly, several functionally different populations of endocrine cells in the islet produce and secrete hormones directly into the capillaries that course through the islet. The alpha, beta, delta, gamma (PP), and epsilon cells produce glucagon, insulin and amylin (islet amyloid polypeptide), somatostatin, pancreatic polypeptide, and ghrelin, respectively. Insulin secretion from the islets of Langerhans promotes glucose absorption, lowering blood glucose levels, whereas glucagon has an opposite effect, resulting in elevation of blood glucose levels. Amylin functions to regulate gastric emptying, thus affecting the availability of gastric contents for digestion in the small intestine and affecting the glycemic response. Ghrelin, secreted by epsilon cells of the islet and in the mucosa of the gastric fundus, plays a significant role in the control of appetite, thereby affecting availability of dietary carbohydrate. In the pancreas, pancreatic polypeptide functions to regulate the secretions of pancreatic cells in both endocrine and exocrine compartments. Somatostatin, produced by delta cells and other locations in the digestive system, regulates the release of a variety of hormones, both within the islets and in other organs. Blood flow through the islet and exocrine portions of the pancreas is arranged to sequentially distribute hormones to different environmental niches to coordinate appropriate hormonal control of digestion and metabolism.

This concept stimulated an enormous amount of research in the second half of the twentieth century. Despite its impact, problems with Mayr's original definition, with its overemphasis on reproductive isolation and its focus on sexually reproducing outcrossing populations over short time spans, led to the development of at least 18 alternative concepts by the end of the century. Although some of these have limited operational utility, three newer biological species concepts are of particular relevance to conservation geneticists: Wiley's evolutionary species concept, Templeton's cohesion species concept, and Mallet's genetic cluster species concept.

In the United States, prevalence ranges from approximately 8% in European Americans to 12% in African Americans and 7% in Hispanic Americans [17] . Within admixed populations, such as Hispanic Americans, even greater variation can be seen when populations are further substratified, with Mexican American populations around 6%, whereas Puerto Rican populations are closer to 19% [17] . Genetic studies have shown that at least some of this variation is caused by differences in genetic variants, with 35-80% of the variation in asthma heritability explained by genetic factors [18, 19] . For example, variants in ADAM33 have been seen in European, African American, and some Hispanic populations, but not in other European American, Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Korean populations, all of which found different variants in ADAM33 associated with asthma [20] (Fig. 23.1) .",15.015943678576484,8.474189453647094

Failure of barrier techniques may involve inherent weaknesses in the items used, inappropriate selection of items, inappropriate use of items, inadequate training of personnel, or the inherent inability of barrier precautions to prevent pathogen transmission completely in all cases. It is important that barrier items do not create a false sense of security. Barrier items are useful but by no means 100% effective at preventing transmission of pathogens. It is critical that veterinary personnel use all adjunctive infection control techniques (ie, hand hygiene) and not rely solely on barriers. The reported variability in the benefits of barrier precautions should not dissuade hospitals from implementing these protocols.",15.58674464234549,9.094962594539854

Intervention measures that have short-term epidemiological benefits but long-term evolutionary repercussions have led to the recent resurgence of many diseases and the heightened virulence of pathogen populations. This has led to the suggestion that understanding the natural dynamics of a disease from an evolutionary, ecological, and behavioral perspective might provide pointers to preventive and curative methods that are more sustainable. There are plenty of accounts concerning behavior and customs in humans that affect the transmission of infectious diseases. Agricultural practices such as the clearing of land and irrigation have brought increased contact between human populations and animal reservoirs of diseases such as schistosomiasis and malaria. Urbanization has brought about increased transmission of lyme disease, cholera, dengue, and leishmaniasis. Changes in sexual behavior have had a large influence on the spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human papillomavirus (HPV), chlamydia, gonorrhea, and other sexually transmitted diseases. With the current threat of these numerous emerging diseases, it has become extremely important to understand the dynamics of infectious processes in the context of crowded living conditions that characterize many animal groups and humans.

(2007) and Le Menach et al. (2006) reported spatially-explicit mathematical models of HPAI transmission in farmed poultry, calibrated using data from the HPAI H7N7 epidemic mentioned above. In the study by Le Menach et al. (2006) the contact structure was categorised into short, medium and long-range contacts, each characterising different contact modes (e.g. aerosol dispersion, transmission by personnel, transmission by long-distance truck transportation), with separate contact rates calculated for each category, both before and after the implementation of a control programme. The time between detection of the disease on a farm and depopulation of the affected farm was found to be the most important determinant of the magnitude of the epidemic. Colizza et al. (2007) presented a stochastic spatial simulation model of global influenza pandemics. The structure was a standard susceptible-latent-infectious-recovered compartmental model, with the infectious group subdivided into symptomatics allowed and not allowed to travel, and asymptomatics. The contact structure was based on the global air transportation network and transmission intensity was allowed to vary temporally, to incorporate known influenza seasonality. An intervention was incorporated by adding an additional compartment; infectious, symptomatic and receiving antiviral (AV) therapy. Different results were obtained depending on the season and geographical origin of the pandemic and different levels of AV use. Peterson et al. (2003) used a spatial simulation model to predict the spread of WNV in North America via mosquitoes and wild migratory birds. The geographical distributions of these populations were included as model parameters, the former derived from ecological niche models and the latter from existing demographic data. The results confirmed that wild migratory birds were important vehicles for the observed long-distance dispersal of WNV in North America. Smith et al. (2002) used a spatial simulation model to study spread of raccoon rabies in Connecticut, where the local rate of transmission between adjacent townships was varied according to human population density and whether townships were separated by a river. The model was calibrated with existing surveillance data. The results suggested that rivers provided a natural barrier that greatly impeded the local spread of rabies (in agreement with Lucey et al., 2002) , and that long-distance dispersal was a relatively common occurrence. The model was subsequently applied to different geographical areas, including New York state (Real et al., 2005b) and Ohio . Smith et al. (2005) investigated the impact of forested areas on the spread of the Connecticut raccoon rabies epidemic and found that forestation significantly slowed the spread. Thulke et al. (1999) presented a spatially-explicit simulation model of fox rabies. A grid was used to define the neighbourhood relationships between small fox communities. A temporal dimension, modelled in two-month timesteps, was constructed to represent the seasonal dynamics of fox populations. The epidemiology of rabies was represented by allocating various states (susceptible, infected, extinct and immune due to vaccination) to the fox communities. Their aim was to answer specific, practical questions about the control of rabies in Europe, including: 'How long after cessation of vaccine distribution is a new rabies epidemic likely to be detected by surveillance?'; 'When is the best time to stop long-term, large-scale vaccination?' and 'In what size area should emergency vaccine be distributed in the case of a post-vaccination epidemic? ' Smith and Harris (1991) reported a stochastic spatial simulation model of rabies epidemics in urban areas of England, incorporating observed spatial heterogeneity in fox populations. They tested a range of scenarios, including varying levels, timing and geographical range of fox control interventions, and found that the successful interventions depended on the density of the fox population.",17.369250283563204,9.915816051834248

UVGI has been shown to be able to control many types of pathogens, although some microbes show various levels of resistance. The control of contagion using UV irradiation was tested in a tuberculosis (TB) ward of a hospital. Contaminated air was removed from the TB ward through a split ventilation duct and channeled into two animal holding pens that contained guinea pigs. One pen received air that had been treated with UV irradiation; the other received untreated air. The guinea pigs in the untreated-air compartment developed TB, but none of the animals in the UV-treated compartment became infected. The American Hospital Association (1974) indicated that, properly utilized, UV radiation can kill nearly all infectious agents, although the effect is highly dependent on the UV intensity and exposure time.

A Framework for Understanding Emerging Diseases Processes in Their Hot Spots,"Parasite community ecology is a subset of community ecology focusing on the distribution of parasites between host populations. Large datasets of parasites (mostly macroparasites) in multi-hosts systems have been collected in the course of these studies (see Poulin 2007b) . Several indices have been used to compare parasite communities between host populations (Poulin 2003 (Poulin , 2010 . The Jaccard index (Jaccard 1912 ) uses presence-absence data of parasites in different host populations to give an indicator of the similarity of this community. Other indices, more sophisticated, use prevalence data to compare parasite community (Boyle et al. 1990; Poulin 2007b) . In the context of host populations from the same ecosystem, the geographic distance between the host populations is controlled (geographic distances usually looked at in parasite community ecology are of the order of hundreds or thousands of kilometres). If the phylogenetic distance between host populations can be controlled, the similarities measured can estimate the EI between these host populations. These indices can therefore be used to build EI network as the value of the index between two parasite communities shared by two host populations (their similarity). Analytical tools to control for phylogentic distances between hosts are already used and new ones are under development that incorporate sophisticated statistical analyses (Adams 2008; Hadfield and Nakagawa 2010) .",18.200180230961294,12.027070775080837

However, some lack of knowledge was noted in the topics of precautions relating to contact isolation, airborne isolation, and when a negativepressure room should be used. These findings might highlight a defect in curricula in nursing schools and continuous education programs in the participating hospitals. It is consistent with previous studies who revealed poor student nurses' knowledge regarding infection control practices. 17, 21 Several factors contributed to the nurses' lack of knowledge in some topics; one of these was dissatisfaction with the content of the infection control educational courses during their studies. 23 Other factors included a shortage of well-designed infection control programs that targeted health care workers during their clinical practices. 24 Although nurses in this study showed acceptable knowledge about isolation precaution, their compliance was poor. The results show that few nurses reported that they followed standard isolation precautions (52.7%). In addition, few nurses were observed following standard isolation precautions (20.2%) and transmissionbased isolation precautions (11.9%). These findings confirmed that nurses in Jordan were not strictly complying with activities that protect them from the transmission of infectious diseases. Our finding is consistent with the Al-Rawajfah et al 17 study that revealed nurses in Jordan have low compliance to infection control practices. The researchers revealed that the lack of resources is a major barrier for compliance with infection prevention guidelines among Jordanian nurses.

As an example, Chinese-derived populations of rhesus macaques have been shown to be more resistant to simian immunodeficiency virus than Indian-derived populations. Hematology and clinical chemistry differences also have been demonstrated in these two populations. In rhesus macaques, such dependence on genetic background is understood and used to guide research. Although cynomolgus monkeys are the most commonly used in the development of biopharmaceuticals such as mAbs and recombinant proteins, there is relatively little information on their genome in public domain databases. Nevertheless, cynomolgus monkeys originate from three different populations (e.g., Indochina, insular Asia and the Philippines, and Mauritius) with own genetic features. Animals from Mauritius and the Philippines exhibit potentially lower genetic diversity, even for genes involved in immune response [11] . Differences in the gene sequences of some target proteins have been encountered within cynomolgus monkeys sourced from different geographic origins (e.g., China, the Philippines, Mauritius), raising concerns that certain genetic variants might result in a loss or gain of pharmacologic responses in the cynomolgus monkey colony used for toxicology studies. Phenotypic differences in cynomolgus monkeys of diverse geographic origin, in particular for immune system functions, are well established, as illustrated by the diverse major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genetics of cynomolgus monkey from different geographic origin [12, 13] . Collectively, these observations suggest that a prospective assessment of target gene variation may be warranted for cynomolgus monkey PART 7 NHP-SPECIFIC ASPECTS OF STANDARD TOXICOLOGY STUDIES (and other NHP species) pharmacology and toxicology studies.

In examining the causal factors related to the SARS outbreak, community-level determinants have been shown to be crucial in the emergence of the disease in human populations. Some key factors that have been identified with SARS are densely populated communities and close, repeated contact with wild animals, especially palm civets (Paguna larvata) and raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procuyoinboides) (Breiman et al., 2003; Poon, Guan, Nicholls, Yuen, & Peiris, 2004; Webster, 2004) . On a national level, China's deficiencies in health infrastructure allowed the emergence and continued spread of the disease without appropriate response measures (Liu, 2004) . In contrast, Singapore rapidly introduced strict infection control measures resulting in low numbers of secondary cases (World Health Organization, 2003) . This illustrates how national infrastructures and health policies can influence disease spread at the community level. At the global level, intercontinental travel facilitated disease spread (World Health Organization, 2003) , whereas the existence of global health infrastructures and global communication networks allowed enhanced information exchange and rapid implementation of appropriate control and prevention measures worldwide (Fidler, 2004; Heymann, 2004) .

Use of effective chemoprophylaxis requires that the infectious agent be susceptible to the antimicrobial drug used. As a primary prevention strategy, it may be used before or after exposure to prevent infection. Examples of chemoprophylaxis in the postexposure setting include erythromycin after exposure to pertussis; rifampin after N. meningitidis; amantadine, rimantadine, zanamir, or oseltamivir after influenza A virus; and zidovudine after HIV exposure. Use of antiretroviral drugs by HIV-infected pregnant women has been shown to substantially reduce the risk of perinatal HIV infection. 128 Prophylaxis against surgical wound infections with broad-spectrum coverage before surgery and prophylaxis of neonates against ophthalmia neonatorum are examples of chemoprophylaxis used in the hospital setting. In such situations, chemoprophylaxis is origin, socioeconomic status, and geographic location. For example, persons born outside the United States are at increased risk for infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and for being chronic carriers of infections such as hepatitis B. Screening programs targeted to these populations, with subsequent interventions such as isoniazid prophylaxis for persons with M. tuberculosis infection or immunization of susceptible household contacts of HBV carriers, can serve as important community-based strategies to prevent infectious disease occurrence. [115] [116] [117] Another example of defining risk at the community level is assessing behavior that increases the risk for specific diseases, such as injection drug use as a risk behavior for acquiring HIV or HCV infection. Education and drug treatment programs targeted to this population can serve as an important disease prevention and control strategy. Finally, assessing the population of species-specific mosquitoes and viability of local breeding sites can provide a risk assessment of the likelihood of vector-borne disease transmission (e.g., West Nile virus infection). 118, 119 In developing control programs, the feasibility of a strategy also needs to be assessed. Feasibility is dependent on the sociodemographic factors of the population involved. For example, high immunization rates can clearly prevent the occurrence of infectious diseases. In the United States, immunizations should be readily available; however, in the late 1980s, numerous large outbreaks of measles occurred in U.S. inner-city populations because of low immunization rates. 120 A variety of sociodemographic factors contributed to these low rates, such as inadequate access to medical care and other barriers to immunization. Until such barriers are removed and control strategies are developed to specifically target at-risk populations, adequate control of vaccinepreventable diseases in the United States cannot be accomplished. 121 Cost and availability of resources also need to be considered when developing control strategies. Adequate water treatment facilities and distribution systems in developing countries would do much to eliminate the spread of cholera. However, in many countries, resources to build and develop such facilities are not available. Consequently, control strategies need to be focused on simpler, less expensive methods, such as boiling water or improving water storage in the home.",15.03332357179657,9.196958760420852

Bacteriophage capsids (heads) contain the dsDNA viral genome. They are icosahedrally ordered, but details vary among the different viruses. For example, HK97 or T7 phages have a strictly icosahedral head with a T ¼ 7 net and a single major capsid protein occupying both the sixfold and fivefold coordinated positions. Others, like T4, have elongated, prolate icosahedral heads; two different proteins form the hexameric and pentameric capsomers, and several minor proteins are located at specific positions on the head surface [42] (Fig. 11 .5a). One of the 12 vertices in the head is different from the other 11. Instead of a regular penton, it contains the portal structure or connector. This specialized structure is critical during assembly, since it contains the machinery needed to select the viral genome and pump it into the head (see Chap. 12).

We stated above that information flow or disease transmission in networks might be influenced by network structure, and communities are an important part of this structure. Figure 3 shows a network of the Trinidadian guppy, Poecilia reticulata, that was found to subdivide into five communities (Croft et al. 2006 ). One of the first predictions that one could make is that information flow or disease transmission might predominantly occur within communities before it spreads between them. Given that communities are based on the interconnectedness of individuals, this seems a plausible assumption. In this context, one could study for instance how the absence or presence of community structures in networks influences transmission processes in the network. Other aspects of interest are the individuals inter-connecting communities (Lusseau and Newman 2004) . If there was a disease outbreak in a human population, presumably the first individuals one would want to vaccinate would be the ones inter-connecting communities so that the spread of the disease could be contained within the community where it first arose. Clearly, the individuals that inter-connect communities occupy a key position in this context. One could further investigate why these particular individuals inter-connect communities and what makes them different from others in the network (Lusseau and Newman 2004) . This would raise questions such as whether they occupy these interconnecting positions only temporarily or over long time periods (potentially all their lives), and this could be linked up with the study of behavioural syndromes (Sih et Fig. 2 Social networks of Trinidadian guppies with males in black and females in white (Croft et al. 2006 ). The original network (a) in which all interactions are displayed was filtered so that (b) only those interactions are shown that occurred twice or more or (c) thrice or more. The latter (c) was a good indicator of cooperative interactions between pairs of individuals during predator inspection behaviour al. 2004).

The rapid and well-documented spread of the mid-Atlantic raccoon rabies variant along the eastern seaboard of the USA over the last 30 years has provided extensive surveillance data that permit the development and assessment of such models (Real et al., 2005b) . A model that reflects the initial 4-5 year epizootic period of raccoon rabies, followed by smaller epizootics of decreasing size and periodicity, was developed (Childs et al., 2000) followed by a stochastic spatial model of rabies spread in the state of Connecticut that identified rivers as key barriers to local dispersion and demonstrated the role of long-distance animal translocation in the emergence of new foci of disease . This spatial model was also used to predict westward expansion of raccoon rabies across Ohio, following an outbreak that breached an oral vaccination zone intended to contain this epizootic, and to assist in the design of supplementary control activities . More recently, other models explored how to most effectively use natural barriers such as waterways during wildlife oral vaccination campaigns to prevent rabies spread (Russell et al., 2006) . Coalescent-based estimates using raccoon RABV genetic data were in good agreement with the known spatial and demographic dynamics of disease spread with time and showed the importance of the initial wave of infection in determining spatial genetic structuring of the epizootic (Biek et al., 2007) . In studies of Arctic fox strain rabies, the ecogeographic patterns observed in southern Ontario (Tinline and MacInnes, 2004) were explained by a model that unified the spatial population dynamics and molecular evolution of the RABV (Real et al., 2005a) .

For example, workload issues are thought to affect HCW willingness to comply with recommendations for PPE use. Workers who feel stressed and overloaded at work are much less likely to be attendant to safety needs and precautions. 23 Helfgott et al found that knowledge of how to prevent occupational exposure did not appear to correlate with compliance with UP. 41 The most common reasons why HCWs in this study did not comply were time constraints, interference with performing specific tasks, and lack of risk-based information to assist HCWs in identifying infectious patients. It was also noteworthy that this study also found that level of compliance was inversely proportional to level of experience of the HCW. Osborne determined that mean compliance rates among Australian operating room nurses were 55.6% with always double gloving during surgical procedures and 92% with always wearing adequate eye protection. 52 The variable that had the most influence on compliance was the perception of barriers to compliance, specifically, that adhering to UP interfered with duties. Nickell et al found in their study of 2001 HCWs during the SARS outbreak in Toronto that the most commonly cited difficulty with complying with precautionary measures, especially masks, was that wearing one for any extended period of time was very uncomfortable. 53 Dejoy et al, in their 2000 study, demonstrated the importance of easy access to the correct PPE when needed as an influence on compliance. 14 Presumably, the greater perceived availability of PPE may lead to stronger beliefs in their effectiveness for prevention among HCWs. It is interesting that the case-control study conducted by Lau et al during the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong also found that perceiving that adequate PPE was unavailable was associated with an increased risk of acquiring disease. 40 The perception that the use of PPE may lead to decreased quality in the therapeutic relationship between patients and HCWs has been shown to be a significant factor that influences HCW compliance. 5, 54, 55 Interference with the practitioner-patient relationship and decreased dexterity were the most frequently cited reasons for noncompliance in one study. 54 Nickell et al found that, during the Toronto SARS outbreak, HCWs found that wearing of masks made communication difficult and led to a sense of social isolation. 53 Others have found that the wearing of PPE places barriers between 2 people, negatively altering interpersonal dynamics and complicating the performance of tasks and treatment. 14 Respirators cover the face and mouth, hampering communication, especially for the elderly population and those with hearing loss. Use of respirators may lead to increased isolation and fear among patients. 56 Prieto and Clark also cited concerns among nurses that isolation of patients could lead to depression from lack of social contacts. 45 CONCLUSION SARS was a disease largely spread by respiratory droplets.

One of these is exactly what we would now call isolation. The Old Testament evidences how individuals affected by diseases were separated from others, and people with leprosy, as Leviticus informs, had to live isolated all their lives. In the New Testament, too, leprosy continues to be considered a reason for social discrimination, and is represented as curable only through the phenomenon of a divine intervention. The isolation, temporary or otherwise, of sick people has thus always been extensively used as one of the approaches to limit the spread of disease. 3 Another strategy was the establishment of a time limit to the manifestation of diseases. In the V century B.C. Hippocratic teaching had established that an acute illness only manifested itself within forty days. The case of plague was representative with respect to this; since a disease manifesting itself after 40 days could not be acute, but chronic, it could not be plague. In the ancient past the term pestis (plague) was used in a broad way to indicate every epidemic characterised by high mortality, and magical practices were implemented to fight different diseases since the idea of preventive instruments (such as quarantine) was still not present. 4 With regard to the real plague (the disease caused by Yersinia pestis), one may remember the first great pandemic wave of the Greek -Roman period, and the recurrent epidemics throughout Europe in the VI and VII centuries A.D. Against acute, fatal diseases such as bubonic plague attempts were made by healthy communities to prevent entry of goods and people from infected communities. In the VII century A.D. armed guards were stationed between plague-stricken Provence and the diocese of Cahors. 5 Particularly virulent was the impact of the disease on the whole of Europe in the middle of the XIV century, when the plague spread from southern Europe to Germany and Russia, causing the death of more than 30% of the European population. 6 Medieval laws, Renaissance health achievements and XVI -XVIII centuries overview",21.943681251299836,12.098977498166123

In fact, the amount of protein variation undetected by electrophoresis may be reasonably small and at the protein level, a typical sexually-reproducing organism may be heterozygous at 20 or more percent of the gene loci. Although the evidence is limited, it seems that at the level of the DNA nucleotide sequence every individual is heterozygous at every locus-if introns as well as exons are taken into account (Ayala, 1983 ). In the present example, we characterized experimentally for the first time the polymorphism for 17 enzymes in three populations of Fasciola hepatica (F. hepatica). The parasite F. hepatica is the causal agent of fasciolosis infection, an important cause of lost productivity in livestock worldwide. Effective control of fasciolosis is difficult, especially in milking cows, which can only be treated during dry periods, a control strategy that has not been evaluated yet. Recently, our group has studied the effect of the type of flukicide treatment on the prevalence and intensity of infection in dairy cattle from Galicia, an area where fasciolosis is endemic and which is also the main milk-producing region in Spain (Mezo et al., 2008) . In the present preliminary study, we found that 8 loci out of 17 studied presented polymorphisms expressing up to 3 different isoforms of the enzyme. The polymorphic enzymes were: Aconitate Hydratase or Aconitase (ACO), Adenilate Kynase (AK), Glutamate Oxaloacetate Transaminase (GOT), Hexokinase (HK), Isocitrate Dehydrogenase (IDH), Phosphogluconate Dehydrogenase (PGD),: Phosphoglucomutase 1 (PGM1), and Phosphoglucomutase 2 (PGM2). Considering that: (1) heterozygous organisms are common, (2) each protein has one or even two locus, and (3) each locus may present one out of two or more alleles; we can construct large databases with the information obtained by electrophoresis for individuals in different populations. This situation determines the necessity of the use of computational techniques. Actually, the necessity of the use of computational techniques for phenotypic analysis in adults and eggs of F. hepatica has been recently proposed by Valero et al.

[8] [9] [10] Similarly, the mean generation time of pandemic influenza was estimated to be around 2 to 4 days.

Epidemic models parameterized with these estimates were built and used to assess the potential effectiveness of different pandemic mitigation strategies. [15] Predicting the speed of global spread and the effectiveness of travel restrictions-Mathematical models have been used to study the global spread of infectious agents as early as the 1980s. Longini et al pioneered this method in which each population was represented as an SIR system and epidemic dynamics of different populations were linked together by international travel. [16] Recent modeling studies of global spread of infectious agents used essentially the same model structure but with more populations simulated in order to increase the realism of the models. [17] [18] [19] These modeling studies concluded that for plausible ranges of R 0 and T g for pandemic influenza, the novel virus would spread around the world within a few months of emergence in the origin population. Furthermore, travel restrictions would have almost no effect in slowing international spread of pandemic influenza because only a small number of imported cases would be sufficient to spark an epidemic in seeded populations. Because the number of infections would grow exponentially in the origin population and non-symptomatic infected individuals could transmit the disease, the only way to stop international seeding would be to completely prohibit travel from and to the origin population, which is infeasible.",19.504501213143612,11.12503420345845

Different infectious diseases have different pathways of zoological transmission, which may have considerable implications for those who handle or cultivate livestock. Various social, economic, and environmental determinants, such as access to healthy foods and housing, may have differential impacts among different infectious diseases for rates of infection and illness among different population groups, which may render different populations at 'high risk' depending on the disease (Jones et al. 2008; Littman 2014) . Legally, there may be significant differences in the obligations to intervene depending on the infectious disease in question, which will likely vary across jurisdictions. Indeed, while some infectious diseases (e.g., TB, sexually transmitted infections) likely have existing explicit legal provisions, others will not. Infectious diseases might also differ in terms of psychological impacts and geographical distribution. All of these areas for potential diversity and the corresponding implications for policy and practice across many domains introduce ethical differences in preparedness, not just in terms of the unique ethical questions that arise with each disease, but also in terms of the deployment of particular public health measures, like isolation and contact tracing. An ethical element therefore exists in mapping variations across infectious diseases' numerous characteristics (e.g., biological, epidemiological, clinical, legal, etc.) to the possible actions to be taken in curbing spread and treating those who are infected. For example, using public health measures like isolation and quarantine in the context of one infectious disease with a particular profile of transmissibility and pathogenicity may be considered ethically justifiable, yet not ethically justified for an infectious disease with a similar profile but with a much lower rate of mortality and morbidity.",18.152324359328862,9.837738158552806

In light of this, parasites are a surprisingly recent addition to trophic web analyses (Sukhdeo 2012) , and the majority of such studies have focused on a few wellresolved aquatic and marine food webs (Dunne et al. 2013) . In terrestrial ecosystems dominated by large mammals, ungulates occupy a central position as important consumers of primary production and as prey base for a broad range of medium-to large-sized predators (Drent and Olff 1999) . As such, both bottom-up and top-down mechanisms may play a role in regulating ungulate populations (Sinclair et al. 2003; Fritz et al. 2011; Hopcraft et al. 2012 ). Dynamics and ecosystem-level impacts of ungulate infectious diseases, then, should vary with the host species' roles in the food web. Where ungulate populations exert intense pressure on their food, infectious diseases that reduce animal numbers may release vegetation from curbs on recruitment imposed by ungulate consumption.

Disease control is based on the quarantine of sick and infected animals, testing and segregation of infected flocks or herds, restriction of animal movements, and immunization of exposed animals whenever vaccines are safe and available. Hygienic management on the farm or at the slaughterhouse must also be emphasized. The control of vectors and vehicles is essential to prevent the spread of infectious agents to noninfected animals or humans and to disease-free areas. The destruction of infected material or products is essential to control the spread of infection, especially from the food chain. The thorough disinfection of contaminated areas will reduce or stop the spread of zoonoses.

Because WNV is transmitted by mosquito vectors, including a species that recently established populations on the Galapagos, patterns of contemporary gene flow in the vector could provide a basis for assessing the risk of disease invasion. Genetic results for the mosquito clearly show that inadvertent introductions from the mainland to some islands via aircraft are common and ongoing. Furthermore, these introductions are often followed by further admixture among different island populations (Bataille et al. 2009 ). Consequently, human transportation networks appear to have all but removed the natural impediments to vector movement associated with impermeable oceanic barriers.

Molecular studies supported the latter scenario in that resistant lowland and susceptible highland populations are genetically distinct (Eggert et al. 2008) . Interestingly, two related species that don't show the same genetic segregation with altitude have so far failed to evolve resistance and remain rare at low elevation. Pearce et al. (2009) suggest that the evolution and geographic extent of drug resistance in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum to commonly used drugs arose independently in at least five different areas in Africa. Furthermore, the current spatial distribution of different resistance alleles falls into geographical clusters with little overlap (Fig 4) . One intriguing possibility is that dispersal barriers or other changes in environmental conditions are preventing alleles from increasing their current distribution (Anderson 2009 ). However, before researchers can focus on understanding the basis for these genetic boundaries, alternative explanations need to be ruled out. Because the current distribution map is essentially a snapshot it is possible that these alleles, which all appeared within the last few decades, are continuing to spread and simply haven't had enough time yet to spatially admix (Pearce et al. 2009 ). The latter scenario best explains a very similar pattern of spatial clustering found in a cougar virus, where it is thought to be the result of a recent population bottleneck followed by spatial expansion that is still ongoing (Biek et al. 2006 ).",14.684362448324439,9.02131639815806

As such, from the very beginning of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, many countries, including China, had adopted control strategies such as quarantining travelers from foreign countries, closing the schools, among others. These control strategies gain great benefits to cut down many of social contacts among population in communities and thus prevent the epidemic outbreak. In effect, this strategy, i.e., quarantining close contacts of the infected persons, was proved to be effective against SARS infections in 2003 [8, 9] . Obviously, it would cost more when we take the strategies earlier or more stringent.

At the same time there is often an increase in populations and a migration from rural areas, where people are in close contact with animals, to urban areas. This has resulted in an outstripping of community services such as potable water and sewerage disposal, thus creating an ideal environment for maintenance and propagation of enteric diseases such as Salmonellosis, E. coli's, Campylobacter (Thorns, 2000) and water borne pathogens such as Giardia and Cryptosporidium (Macpherson et al., 2000) . Compounding this further is the poor immune status of these populations due to HIV/AIDS, malnutrition and environmental pollution. This has resulted in previously benign diseases such as toxoplasmosis and ringworm becoming lifethreatening conditions (Gummow, 2003) . In addition, these populations are often poorly educated about hygiene and health matters resulting in ideal opportunities for the spread and maintenance of diseases and the emergence of resistant strains of pathogens, such as tuberculosis, due to non-compliance to treatment. The socio-economic fabric of the society is therefore probably one of the biggest drivers of high impact emerging diseases that are in many ways more devastating than the more high profile wildlife-associated diseases (Fig. 2) .

Despite the 'screen all' policy, comments in the decolonisation section stated that 'eradication of carriage is difficult and may often fail'.

In veterinary medicine, zoonoses present a risk to practitioners, yet little is known about how these risks are understood and how this translates into health protective behaviour. This study aimed to explore risk perceptions within the British veterinary profession and identify motivators and barriers to compliance with IPCs. A cross-sectional study was conducted using veterinary practices registered with the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons. Here we demonstrate that compliance with IPCs is influenced by more than just knowledge and experience, and understanding of risk is complex and multifactorial. Out of 252 respondents, the majority were not concerned about the risk of zoonoses (57.5%); however, a considerable proportion (34.9%) was. Overall, 44.0% of respondents reported contracting a confirmed or suspected zoonoses, most frequently dermatophytosis (58.6%). In veterinary professionals who had previous experience of managing zoonotic cases, time or financial constraints and a concern for adverse animal reactions were not perceived as barriers to use of personal protective equipment (PPE). For those working in large animal practice, the most significant motivator for using PPE was concerns over liability. When assessing responses to a range of different ""infection control attitudes"", veterinary nurses tended to have a more positive perspective, compared with veterinary surgeons. Our results demonstrate that IPCs are not always adhered to, and factors influencing motivators and barriers to compliance are not simply based on knowledge and experience. Educating veterinary professionals may help improve compliance to a certain extent, however increased knowledge does not necessarily equate to an increase in risk-mitigating behaviour. This highlights that the construction of risk is complex and circumstance-specific and to get a real grasp on compliance with IPCs, this construction needs to be explored in more depth.",20.056141588230286,11.796716036994034

A key factor that determines whether a pathogen can persist and spread in a new population is its basic reproductive rate, which is the number of secondary infections produced in a susceptible population by a typical infectious individual. To become established in a new host population, a pathogen must have a basic reproductive rate that exceeds one. The basic reproductive rate for a pathogen is affected by a range of biologic, social and environmental factors, so may vary by place and population. Also critical in determining how easily an infection can be controlled is the proportion of transmission that occurs before onset of symptoms or during asymptomatic infection. 32 Multiple factors restrict the introduction and spread or persistence of infection in a region (Box 106-4). Nutrition determines susceptibility to and severity of many infections. A substantial proportion of disease burden in LMIC can be attributed to childhood and maternal weight and micronutrient deficiences. 33 Before measles vaccine was introduced, the epidemiology of measles exhibited marked periodicity in large populations, with peaks typically occurring every 2-3 years. 34 In small island communities (or other isolated populations), outbreaks typically occur only after periodic introductions from outside. It has been suggested that measles, as it has been known in the 20th century, could not have established itself much before 3000 bce because before that time human populations had not achieved sufficient size to sustain the virus.",18.590767502058064,11.69203682516414

Intervention measures that have short-term epidemiological benefits but long-term evolutionary repercussions have led to the recent resurgence of many diseases and the heightened virulence of pathogen populations. This has led to the suggestion that understanding the natural dynamics of a disease from an evolutionary, ecological, and behavioral perspective might provide pointers to preventive and curative methods that are more sustainable. There are plenty of accounts concerning behavior and customs in humans that affect the transmission of infectious diseases. Agricultural practices such as the clearing of land and irrigation have brought increased contact between human populations and animal reservoirs of diseases such as schistosomiasis and malaria (Steinmann et al., 2006) . Urbanization has brought about increased transmission of lyme disease, cholera, dengue, and leishmaniasis (Kendall et al., 1991; Desjeux, 2001; Bradley and Altizer, 2007; Chowdhury et al., 2011) . Changes in sexual behavior have had a large influence on the spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human papillomavirus (HPV), chlamydia, gonorrhea, and other sexually transmitted diseases (Bunnell et al., 2006; Satterwhite et al., 2007) . With the current threat of these numerous emerging diseases, it has become extremely important to understand the dynamics of infectious processes in the context of crowded living conditions that characterize many animal groups and humans. An understanding of the behavioral processes that define the structure of a social group will help identify the transmission pathways used by pathogens to spread and suggest possible ways to manage the social structure as a counteractive measure to both prevent and control the spread of a likely epidemic.

Artois et al. (2011) recently wrote a review of methods for controlling disease in wildlife and the risks associated with these methods. The primary goals of control are to limit the number of susceptibles or to treat/eliminate infected individuals to limit infectious period. Lethal control and vaccination are the primary methods available to limit the number of susceptibles. Lethal control, or culling, has frequently been shown to be very difficult to maintain in large populations of wildlife with high reproductive or immigration rates and is increasingly considered socially unacceptable (Caughley and Sinclair 1994) . Further, culling is generally not a viable option when dealing with outbreaks in rare or endangered species, and the act of culling itself actually increases the human-wildlife contact interface and potential transmission of zoonoses. Vaccination is increasingly being considered as a control option and is predicted to be the most efficient method to control hosts with relatively low reproductive rates. However, the production of a vaccine that is efficacious, stable in the environment, and easily deliverable (frequently orally) makes vaccination a difficult control method (Artois et al. 2011 ). In addition, most effective wildlife vaccines (e.g. for rabies) are modified live vaccines that have the potential to harm nontarget species. Another possible control method is fencing or other physical barriers to prevent direct contact. This is being recommended to farmers in Michigan and Minnesota as a method to prevent bTB transmission from WTD sharing feed or entering cattle lots (Palmer et al. 2004 ). Low-tech bamboo skirts are also being used to keep bats out of date palm sap harvest areas to prevent the transmission of Nipah virus (Nahar et al. 2010 ). However, fences and barriers can sometimes interrupt nontarget species as well as the local ecosystem, e.g., in southern Africa where fences prevent the migration of large herbivores, such as elephants (Loarie et al. 2009 ). Innovative methods of wildlife disease management will continue to be needed, especially as diseases emerge in difficult to manage species such as WNS in bats.",17.247431722782935,11.084398222591489

Isolation of APMV-6 from shorebirds has been reported in Germany with a prevalence of 2.4 % [21] . Because ducks are highly migratory, crossing Eurasia in different directions twice a year during the long migrations [18, 19] , they present a possible mechanism for the global movement of these viruses. For teal, the most important route is the Black Sea/Mediterranean Flyway, which suggests probable circulation of the virus in populations associated with it.

In the first attempt to classify the underlying drivers of disease emergence, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) identified six factors including: human demographics and behavior; technology and industry; economic development and land use; international travel and commerce; microbial adaptation and change; and breakdown of public health measures (Lederberg et al. 1992) . In 2003, seven additional drivers were added to the IOM report including: human susceptibility to infection; climate and weather; changing ecosystems; poverty and social inequity; war and famine; lack of political will; and intent to harm (Smolinski et al. 2003 ). IOM's classification of the ''factors in emergence'' largely paved the way for current research investigating the underlying drivers of infectious disease emergence. It is important to note that these drivers are not mutually exclusive, and that factors may act in concert and will vary at different stages of the emergence process. For example, anthropogenic land use change has resulted in cross-species transmission of disease or initial emergence, from animal hosts to humans both directly by increasing human contact with animal populations, and in other cases indirectly by changing vector populations (Daszak et al. 2000; Patz et al. 2004) . Climate and weather can augment these affects and modulate outbreak size; particularly with vector or waterborne diseases, and global trade and travel has facilitated the spread of those diseases (Hufnagel et al. 2004 ). These EID drivers function on a different scales, vary geographically (Keesing et al. 2010) , and can be attributed to a combination of environmental, ecological, political, and social forces. Despite ongoing research investigating the role of EID drivers, additional studies and modeling approaches are needed to more fully understand the complex mechanisms of emergence (Bogich et al. 2012 ).",15.997429172382633,9.14492005314932

In specific, one or more members of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family serve as cellular receptors for the A59 and JHM strains of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (MHV-A59 and MHV-JHM) and expression of CEA on the surface of some resistant cells renders them susceptible to MHV ((Z), T.G., S.P., unpublished observations).",14.473236488445743,10.39812971204564

A series of international health agreements between the newly industrialized countries, elaborated during the 19 th century, culminated in the adoption of the International Health Regulations in 1969 (International health organizations, 1969). These regulations are designed to maximize security against the international spread of infectious diseases while ensuring minimum impact on trade and travel. Administered by WHO, these are the only international regulations that require reporting of infectious diseases. Three diseases-cholera, plague and yellow fever-are targeted by the Regulations for reporting by countries. They also provide norms and standards for air and sea ports designed to prevent the spread from public conveyances of rodents or insects that may be carrying infectious diseases, and describe best practices to be used to control the spread of these diseases once they have occurred.",15.537333043711232,8.831774341368572

Rigorous analysis of the model reveals that it undergoes the phenomenon of backward bifurcation when the associated reproduction number (R q ) is less than unity. The presence of this phenomenon, which does not arise if the quarantine is 100% effective, implies that the effective control of the spread of the disease, using an imperfect quarantine, depends on the initial sizes of the sub-populations of the model (when R q < 1).

The diversity of Sia forms results from modifications that can be added singly or in combinations (Figure 1 ), leading to complex barriers that pathogens must navigate to reach their target cells or tissues. The influence of Sia variation on viral adaptation is seen in the diverse viral families that use Sia as a receptor or coreceptor, often showing specificity for some modified forms over others. This is also shown in the number of viruses that carry Sia-modifying enzymes such as sialidases or esterases, which allow them to control their binding and release with high specificity (Table 1) . Sia interactions and modifications also extend to bacterial and eukaryotic pathogens, as well as commensal colonizers (Box 2). While Sias have been known as pathogen receptors for many decades, much remains to be learned about the many modifications and how they are synthesized and distributed in different organisms and tissues. The recent development of new tools (Box 1) that allow for in situ analysis or removal of modified Sias has expanded our ability to study more complex forms and to answer questions about the roles of these modifications in shaping viral evolution, tissue tropism, and host range. These tools will also allow us to address how Sias with different modifications, including 4-O-Ac, 9-O-Ac, and Neu5Gc (and combinations), shape organismal development and cell-cell communication (see Outstanding Questions).

Upon re-examination, a reaction was also seen by IFT, which--when assessed by itself--would have appeared too weak to be considered as specific. Several explanations can be offered for the discrepancies obtained with the different techniques. The selected polyclonal antiserum may be crucial. It has been demonstrated that, e.g., FIP ascitic fluids may lack antibodies against one or two of the three viral proteins [8] . Since a cross reaction may exist at the level of only one of them--as found in this study--the antigenic relationship may thus escape detection. Cross-reactivities may vary with different serological variants of the viruses compared (e.g., M H V and HCV); the existence of antigenic differences between FIP viruses should also be taken into account [12, 13] . Due to its low sensitivity, the fluorescent antibody technique is not ideal for the examination of viral cross reactivities and contradictory results have indeed been obtained [1, 13, 15, 20] .

Even if hand washing takes place around the time of patient contact, the hands of caregivers may become contaminated by touching environmental surfaces. This can lead to spread to other patients and, often, to the caregiver. Affected caregivers are major components of many published outbreaks and contribute to inter-patient spread. 46 The development of antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests has contributed to the tracking and control of outbreaks. 59 A targeted infection control program has been shown to decrease the amount of hospitalacquired RSV in a pediatric hospital and to be cost effective. 6~ The measures undertaken in that particular program included education of staff, cohorting of infective patients and the nursing staff caring for them, maintenance of a high index of suspicion for new cases, contact precautions, and regular surveillance. This study included NICU patients, although the program was used in other pediatric populations as well. A strict infection control policy proved effective at decreasing spread during a NICU RSV outbreak. 47 In this study, cases of RSV were separated from other infants, and a separate team of nurses and physicians was assigned to that nursery. A policy of strict wearing of gowns, masks, and gloves during the handling of infected infants was observed. The nursery was cleaned and fumigated. Eight cases were found prior to the institution of these infection-control policies, but no new cases of RSV developed once they were in place. While these measures exceed those generally used to combat transmission of RSV in a NICU, they may be justified during an outbreak.",14.673502339221528,7.643926791999858

A western blot survey of lions throughout Africa (Fig. 6) indicates FIV antibody seroprevalence can range from 0% (in Namibia and Kalahari) to >94% in the Serengeti in Tanzania and Kruger Park in South Africa. This east-west discordance in FIV seroprevalence may be a consequence of geographic barriers such as the Kalahari Desert. However, it is not clear whether these geographic differences in FIV prevalence (most were sampled only once) reflect an ongoing spread or a stable restriction of FIV spread in the low incidence regions. Phylogenetic analysis of FIV RT-pol sequences in lions reveal the persistence of at least six principal viral clades or subtypes (A-F) represented in different populations of lions in Africa. Some are unique to certain populations (e.g. Subtype E in Botswana, Subtype C in the Serengeti and subtype F in Kenya) while others are present in multiple populations (Fig. 7) . The genetic distances among these lion FIV subtypes are as great as the distance observed between FIV isolates from different cat species (Figs. 5, 7) . This level of separation would suggest that the clades evolved in isolation. The common monophyletic node uniting all lion FIV strains suggests that FIV infected a common ancestor early in lion population history. The virus subtypes then evolved in isolation with specific lion populations as observed with subtypes C, D, and E. In the case of subtype A and B, it is likely that these evolved in formerly geographically isolated lion populations that recently came together allowing the transmission of the virus subtypes currently observed. Because there is little known of disease associations with FIV infection in lions it is difficult to know whether there are now (or ever were) virulence distinctions among the clades.",23.483290889421944,12.06657474487617

Rare but serious adverse events associated with vaccines or drugs are often nearly impossible to detect on account of the selected enrollment and limited follow-up of subjects in prelicensure studies and their detection requires conducting postmarketing monitoring (also called pharmacovigilance) after the introduction in the general population. The FDA also requires more diversity in the population studied because the incidence of AEFI might vary in different populations [48] . Safety of these products can only be inferred by the relative absence of AESI when the population exposed to the new pharmaceutical product of interest is sufficiently large, diverse and monitored adequately.

Methods A qualitative study was conducted among Chinese residents in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands to identify the origins of SARS risk perceptions and their impact on precautionary actions and adverse consequences from the perspective of vulnerable communities living in unaffected regions. Analysis was informed by protection motivation theory. Results Results revealed that information from affected Asia influenced risk perceptions and protective behavior among the Chinese in Europe when more relevant local information was absent. When high risk perceptions were combined with low efficacy regarding precautionary measures, avoidancebased precautionary action appeared to dominate responses to SARS.

Type I error is the likelihood of a false-positive finding. Although a p-value or a type I error rate of 5% is generally considered acceptable, one may be more likely to find an association by chance alone if multiple comparisons of different genetic loci to the development of disease are performed. Although adjustment for multiple comparisons is ideal, it is not entirely clear what the best strategy is, and current studies of ALI/ARDS may still too small to accommodate statistical correction for multiple comparisons.

To advance from myelin vacuolation to demyelination may depend on whether the primary target is the myelin sheath or the OL. The actual mechanism of myelin vacuolation likewise may vary between different myelin disorders though there may be some shared mechanisms. It is seen in many myelin disorders including those of genetic, toxic and inflammatory origin thus it clearly lacks specificity. Additionally, in some instances it may not be cell autonomous as disorders of astrocytes may result in ionic imbalance in the neuropil resulting in fluid accumulation within the myelin sheath (Baslow, 2003) .

In recent years, new approaches that incorporate more realistic contact structures have been developed to allow for nonrandom interactions among populations [4, 22, 48, 54] .

[4] used several real and simulated datasets of human contact networks to analyze their impact on disease spread. They concluded that homogeneous-mixing models are appropriate for host populations that are nearly homogeneous. However, network models are more appropriate to better capture and predict disease spread through heterogeneous host populations. Furthermore, Fukś et al. [22] used an agent-based model of Southern and Central Ontario to investigate the spatial correlations of disease spread. They concluded that spatial correlations were difficult to destroy if neighborhood sizes were inhomogeneous. Finally, Stroud et al.

For example, influenza pandemics circumnavigate the globe in months and cannot be halted before population immunity is substantial—due to a combination of high transmissibility (Ro >2), airborne spread, nonspecific symptoms, and short incubation periods. Meanwhile, a pandemic threat like the recent 2014 Ebola caused substantial outbreaks in urban, mobile, poor West African populations but was halted at a point when only a small subset of the population was immune and did not cause widespread epidemics in other countries. Some, like the severe cholera pandemics of 19th century Europe, were fueled by lack of sanitary conditions but would be unthinkable there nowadays, although the pathogen continues to cause epidemics in lower-income settings. Thus, measures of transmissibility and clinical severity are important but not sufficient to understand the global pandemic potential of an emerging pathogen.

The importance of sympatry is reflected in similarities between viral and host species richness maps (Fig. 1). Locations where host species diversity is highest generally have more viruses. However, bats in Europe and India have greater viral richness than predicted by the host species richness map (Fig. 1a,c), and this does not appear to be due to sampling bias (Fig. S7). The community context may provide additional insight. There are two host–virus communities connecting Europe to East Asia where species richness is high (Fig. 3c,f), and these communities may provide a bridge. Higher viral richness than expected from host species richness in India may also reflect connections with areas of high species richness in S.E. Asia (Fig. 3c). For the viral richness maps, we assumed that the virus exists throughout the distribution of its host(s) analogous to the fundamental niche concept (Hutchinson 1957; Harris & Dunn 2010) and representing the broadest possible distribution.

Control of rabies in bats has proven challenging. Bat rabies has been reported in every state except Hawaii and 1,806 rabid bats were documented in the United States during 2009 (19). Of all animals, bats in particular pose a serious risk for rabies and should be excluded from structures to prevent contact with humans (148, 152). However, widespread reductions in bat populations to control rabies is neither feasible nor desirable. Instead, some novel methods have been explored to control infection in bat populations. Vampire bats can efficiently digest only coagulated blood and they die if the consumed blood is not coagulated. Application of anticoagulant-containing ointment on the fur of captured vampire bats (with their subsequent release) leads to consumption of the coagulant by several roost mates via mutual grooming. Similarly, anticoagulation of livestock is another useful approach to control vampire bat populations where rabies is a threat (reviewed in Kuzmin and Rupprecht (7)). As another approach, it has been suggested that oral vaccination of wildlife may limit the spread of rabies by bats (153). Finally, we know that some species of moths are able to disrupt bat echolocation using ultrasonic clicks of their own (154, 155). The use of similar, artificially produced, sounds to ward off bats from human and livestock habitats should be explored.",15.563031682199187,10.956334832399172

For SARS, civets and bats have been identified as likely reservoirs of the virus (Shi & Hu, 2008). For MERS, bats and camels have been identified as zoonotic reservoirs (Mohd, Al-Tawfiq, & Memish, 2016). Therefore, for EVD and other EIDs, exposure is likely related to ecological factors, such as vegetation, elevation, temperature that bring communities into contact with the zoonotic reservoirs and vectors of the viruses. For EVD, exposure would likely be higher in populations and communities located poorer parts of Africa. We illustrate this pathway, as well as additional pathways we discuss below in a conceptual model to help conceptualize how various SES determinants may lead to EVD exposure in Fig. 1. Increased exposure may also be due to higher rates of international travel among some relatively higher income countries, or some communities (Bogoch et al., 2014).

Our experiments demonstrate that all complement activation pathways are required for control of severe WNV disease. The virologic experiments suggest that complement limits viral spread and facilitates clearance of WNV within the CNS. As many complement proteins are constitutively expressed within the CNS (33) and up-regulated after infection with other neurotropic viruses (34–36), complement activation in the CNS could be critical for destruction of viral particles or virus-infected neuronal cells.

The price of this is to force companies and other institutions to stop operations, which is at huge cost. Another is social distancing, including closure of public places in the city, community containment, isolation of the infected, and quarantine of the suspected, which affects the operation of some urban institutions, and the cost is less than the traffic control.

Specifically, for the 240 Amazon region, the lack of any control will make the city of Manaus a very sensitive 241 cluster for public health, due to predominantly poor and indigenous-dominated cities in 242 the region, which are connected to Manaus and will be rapidly infected. Reaching 243 isolated regions means reaching indigenous or traditional communities, whose 244 individuals are classically more susceptible to new pathogens than western-influenced 245 or mixed urban populations. Therefore, a way to prevent such spreading, if still there is 246 time, would be to deal with airports as entrances that need severe infection barriers. The eventual lesson to take is that inflexible, severe, and easy to repeat 250 controlling protocols must be applied to all the cities with airports. Likewise, the follow-251 up monitoring of suspicious individuals and their living network should be reinforced as 252 a national strategy to prevent a large territory to be taken over by a pandemic in a short 253 period of time. In other words, internationally accepted procedures must be taken and 254 even be reviewed to adjust to complex national flight networks of any country. Such 255 procedures must be considered as a priority for national remote airports too, in order to 256 keep poorer and worse equipped cities away from a rapid spread of a pandemic 257 disease. 258 It is clear at this point that a fast spread of the SARS-CoV-2 is a reality in Brazil, 259 and across most of the country. We proposed this model in order to emphasize the 260 fragility of Brazilian surveillance in the airport network, in an attempt to cause some 261 policy change in time to preserve at least the most remote regions, which are also the 262 most vulnerable, with a weaker health service. Moreover, most of the Eastern part of the 263 country must stay in social isolation in order to prevent a health public collapse by mid-264 April, as the Ministry of Health predicted. In addition, we also could consider the 265 generalized poverty of Brazil as a further problem our model did not deal with. The 266 chances to produce home-to-home isolation, even legally imposed, is impossible for 267 these poor communities. Nonetheless, considering the few main entrances of most of 268 the Brazilian shanty towns and communities, a similar to airport entrance severe control 269 must be considered to protect a larger but closely connected set of people, eventually 270 following the protocols used for control of Ebola during the last epidemic in Africa (Lau 271 et al. 2017 ). 272 All rights reserved.

The EMEWS (extreme model exploration with Swift) framework 100 was developed to directly address this issue and to provide a broadly applicable cyberinfrastructure to lower the barriers for utilization of advanced, large-scale model exploration on HPC resources. The EMEWS paradigm allows for the direct exploitation of cutting edge statistical and machine learning algorithms that make up the vibrant ecosystem of free and open source libraries that are continually added to and updated as research frontiers are expanded, all while controlling simulation workflows that can be run anywhere from desktops to campus clusters and to the largest HPC resources.",9.635012234672256,7.587390464443487

We use this to analyse different scenarios relevant to the COVID-19 situation in the UK. We present a stochastic model that captures the inherently probabilistic nature of contagion between population members. The computational nature of our model means that spatial constraints (e.g., communities and regions), the susceptibility of different age groups and other factors such as medical pre-histories can be incorporated with ease. We analyse different possible scenarios of the COVID-19 situation in the UK. Our model is robust to small changes in the parameters and is flexible in being able to deal with different scenarios.",10.01702822430138,7.559506831706777

For the example in Figure 1 , the model simulates a population of 10 million individuals, living in 10 thousand clusters (towns, wards or villages) that are grouped in 10 about equally sized superclusters (e.g. provinces). The clusters vary in size such that the 95% extremes (i.e. 2.5% and 97.5% percentiles) reflect populations of about 100 to 4000 inhabitants, with the largest 0.2% exceeding 10 thousand. Heterogeneity is introduced by varying individual contact rates (i.e. the combination of contact frequency and transmission probability) according to a distribution such that both 95% extremes represent a 10-fold relative difference. Furthermore, there is some degree of assortative mixing by allowing mean contact rates to vary more than randomly among clusters. As a consequence, the average contact rate is 4 times higher for the 97.5% vs. 2.5% percentile of all clusters. We describe Covid-19 transmission as a standard .

It was based on confirmed cases, and by excluding suspected cases or mild cases may have under-estimated the rate of spread of the disease. We did not estimate the values of the parameters defining the transition rate from exposed to infectious, or infected to recovered, but fixed them at previously published values. This was a necessary decision because the clinical features of the disease are not yet fully understood, and may affect estimates. However, our intuition after fitting these models is that the maximum likelihood estimate of the force of infection naturally adjusts to fit the value of the recovery rate, and produces a broadly similar value of the basic reproduction number as a result. Furthermore, to adjust for the still-arbitrary nature of these estimates of key parameters, we used some methods that do not depend on any assumptions about these aspects of the disease process. Another limitation of this study is the uncertainty introduced by the use of multiple modeling methods, which we combined with a weighted average. However, we believe that by presenting varying methods with different assumptions along with a weighted average, we enable researchers and policy-makers to make judgements about the dangers of the epidemic without relying on any particular set of assumptions about a disease that is not yet well understood.",8.996926030610352,5.581361947837493
