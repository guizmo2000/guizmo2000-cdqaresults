Forty-five percent of the patients were undergoing dialysis because of diabetes mellitus end-stage renal disease (DM-ESRD) ( Table 1 ). The average value of the Charlson comorbidity index was 4.52 ± 1.86. The Hct were decreased at M1, then recovered at M3 (Fig. 1 , Table 2 ). The level of kt/v at M1 was lower than the levels before and after the MERS isolation period, but a significant difference was found only between the level of M1 and M3. The indoxyl sulfate (IS) level was not decreased at M0-M1. The levels of IS at M3 were significantly higher than those at M0 and M1 (Fig. 1) . The levels of IS at M0 closely correlated with those at M1 and M3 ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). Two HD patients died during quarantine. The first death was ascribed to aspiration pneumonia in an 88-year-old female patient with hypertensive ESRD. The second death was caused by mechanical ileus and pneumonia in a 91-year-old female with hypertensive ESRD. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Effect of isolation on the level of ccf-gDNA. Segregation affected the levels of circulating cf-DNA. The ccf-gDNA (LPL) was significantly elevated at M0, irrespective of whether the subject was a patient or staff member (Fig. 2) . The levels of ccf-gDNA decreased over time, but the decrease was delayed in HD patients. At M1, ccf-gDNA levels were significantly higher in HD patients than in the medical staff. The ccf-gDNA level initially abruptly decreased in medical staff but slowly reduced in HD patients. The delta value of ccf-gDNA between M0 and M1 and between M1 and M3 was not different between HD patients and medical staff. These results indicated that stress was sufficient to increase ccf-gDNA levels both in HD patients and medical staff. However, the correction of increased ccf-gDNA levels was delayed in HD patients.",23.26769650398979,13.418146236208589

Living alone and working with protective equipment can cause high levels of mental and physical stress in not only patients but also healthcare workers during quarantine 12, 13 . The result that the level of ccf-gDNA was higher in the HD patients under SRI reflected their severe stress. Levels of circulating cf-DNA steadily decreased in both patients and staff after isolation, but the decrease was delayed in the HD patients. Circulating cf-DNA in plasma www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ indicates inflammation or cell death following cellular stress and tissue damage 3 . ccf-mtDNA containing CpG DNA repeats is known to attract neutrophils and activate immune cells [14] [15] [16] [17] . Phagocytes quickly ingest the contents from apoptotic cells, therefore circulating cf-DNA is present in the circulation before phagocytes arrive 18 . When the engulfment of apoptotic bodies is reduced, or cell death is amplified, circulating cf-DNA can be substantially elevated 19 . Cellular apoptosis is common in HD patients due to chronic inflammation and immune dysfunction 20, 21 . We suspected that more cells had undergone apoptotic and necrotic cell death or immune cells could not process circulating cf-DNA in HD patients. Also, chronic inflammation related to uremia, malnutrition, www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ and calcification might have caused the late recovery of circulating cf-DNA. However, this study did not find a difference in the levels of circulating cf-DNA between HD patients and medical staff. Stress circumstances might be related to higher levels of ccf-mtDNA because chronic stress could alter the mitochondrial structure and lead to mitochondrial damage 22, 23 . Healthcare workers, including nurses and medical doctors, are recognized as experiencing high levels of occupational stress 24 . Constantly elevated levels of circulating cf-DNA, especially ccf-mtDNA, are thought to reflect continuous occupational stress in our medical staff. We conducted a survey www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ using Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) targeting the HD patients and medical staff at 12 months after the quarantine ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ) 25 . The results identified the IES-R score at post-MERS was higher in medical staff than in HD patients. And post-MERS IES-R scores correlated positively with levels of ccf-mtDNA at M1. Healthcare workers responded with higher levels of psychological stress during the 2003 SARS outbreak 26 . They more easily recognize someone who will need to be hospitalized or die from infectious diseases. Thus, they might have worried more about becoming infected by MERS-CoV whenever they contacted patients. The higher IES-R scores in medical staff reflected the greater psychological impact and physical work stress. However, circulating cf-DNA was still not higher in HD patients than in medical staff at M3. If chronic inflammation was the only reason for the delay in processing circulating cf-DNA, it would be elevated in HD patients at M3. Therefore, insufficient care could be the main factor that caused the delayed recovery of circulating cf-DNA.",23.591590491590374,9.869037816604093

Considerable stress in itself could also have affected these clinical parameters. The levels of ccf-mtDNA as a stress marker were negatively correlated with those of Hb and Hct and positively associated with those of ferritin, an acute reactive protein. We had no sooner tried to correct anemia than MERS quarantine terminated. Significant increases in Hct at M3 reflected the effort.

Beyond increases in resources that are equipped to address the needs of senior animals, innovation in adoption programs may further optimize the potential for adoption of these senior animals. One study showed that, although older animals are less likely to be adopted, proactive programs at animal shelters that promote human-animal interaction and behavioral training can decrease the amount of time it takes for an animal to be adopted [19] . ""Temporary adoption programs"" that allow for the potential adopter to assess their suitability for meeting the animal's need in their home prior to adoption have been shown to significantly reduce return rates [19] .

The percentage of pharmacists working at medical institutions is 22.1% and 24.1% in Japan and the US, respectively, but about 11.7% in Korea [14] . In addition, because pharmacy technicians do not operate within the legal framework, job separation and job descriptions of pharmacists are not standardized. It is necessary to reduce the labor-intense preparation work by legalizing the pharmacy assistant personnel system and by upgrading pharmacy automation. Furthermore, there is no financial reimbursement for the professionals who perform and maintain ASP in the healthcare setting in Korea [15] . It might be hard to see a direct correlation between the reimbursements of ASP activities and the proper use of antibiotics. Although the MOHW has reimbursed medical institutions for infection prevention and management measures according to their grades since 2017, this reimbursement policy is limited regarding such measures such as strengthening facilities and human resources standards to prevent infection, improving infectious disease management, expanding the medical surveillance system, and supporting infectious disease management for small and medium medical institutions [4] . Based on this reimbursement policy, Grade 1 sites are allowed one person in charge of IPC per 150 beds, and about $1.7/patient/day is reimbursed. This budget is, in fact, mainly used for hiring nurses dedicated to IPC. Physicians did not seem to clearly distinguish responses to IPC from ASP, and they did not focus solely on responses about ASP for the purposes of this study. It can be seen that the awareness of the medical staff about infection management is reflected in the priority given to infection management and prevention but not to antimicrobial medication management. When answering the questions on current experience with ASP, doctors were more interested in the environment, facilities, and treatment materials to prevent infection than antibiotics.",16.62566313652124,8.646851334251703

During the SARS epidemic, the quick end of the outbreak was partially attributed to efficient quarantine and isolation methods, in addition to public awareness and information distribution to affected areas [41] . This included where to seek medical attention and protective measures individuals could take to protect themselves from infection, such as face masks. In the case of MERS, there is a belief that lack of knowledge among medical staff and affected communities could be a risk factor for disease containment [34] . With a combination of hospital and community outbreaks, many have suggested that stronger implementation of proper decontamination procedures could reduce outbreak severity and length [8, 42] . It has been suggested that overcrowding, and slow isolation of patients in addition to these factors may have played a role in healthcare-associated outbreaks of MERS [29] .",23.27136119056945,8.787569429449457

It also does not include the contribution of medical staff and public health experts for Ebola containment efforts, which accounts for a significant share in China's humanitarian assistance. Equally important, it does not do justice to the shifting modalities of China's health aid to Africa. For a long time, the Chinese medical teams (CMTs) posted in Africa on a rotation basis have been the main instruments of China's health-related development assistance in the region. While the CMTs play an instrumental role in providing routine medical services to local residents-indeed, a CMT treated the first case of Ebola in Conakry (Guinea's capital)-they are not adaptable and flexible enough to respond to large-scale disease outbreaks. This may explain why in addition to mobilizing CMTs already on the ground, China also dispatched emergency medical teams whose members were recruited directly from domestic health institutions. In addition, while Beijing continued to rely on more traditional humanitarian assistance instruments such as in-kind contributions and food aid, it also diversified the modalities Global Challenges 2017, 1, 1600001 www.global-challenges.com www.advancedsciencenews.com of aid to building labs and treatment centers and health personnel training. This points to ""a much more comprehensive, demand-driven response"" to affected countries' needs. [44] In doing so Beijing might still prefer bilateral aid, but a significant volume of its humanitarian aid has been channeled through multilateral international institutions, suggesting that Beijing is becoming more flexible in backing coordinated international response mechanisms.

As an illustration, if we consider a patient in an intensive care unit -the equipment monitors while the medical staff watches over the situation. The monitor refers to the screen on which the patient's data is continuously collected and displayed. PHS is a much more involved activity that will always incorporate some degree of data monitoring. Problem formulation and knowledge production are two essential components of PHS that do not exist to the same extent in monitoring. Monitoring can often be largely automated but it is doubtful that, even in the future, surveillance could ever become fully automated due to the complex nature of data interpretation and feedback actions.

(1) The SARS in-out flow model needed information about permanent residence, onset location and medical location, so that the pathways could be studied for the spatial location transformation of infected individuals, which was a relatively high requirement for data. (2) There were actually 983 cases of SARS among medical staff, which accounted for 18.5% of the total number of cases. The SARS cases among medical staff always occurred within a small range of locations, such as hospitals and clinics in the same provinces or cities, that belonged to the provincial flow. SARS in-out flow was only focused on interprovincial flow, and not provincial flow. Therefore, the effect of nosocomial transmission was neglected. (3) The division of the three groups was a new mixed proposed for this study, which depended on the distinguishing features of key spatial location changes of individuals as well as their attendance at common social functions. In addition, the location information in the dataset was used to the greatest extent. The dataset had no detailed epidemiological information, for example, the movement of SARS patients, which gave some uncertainty to the results. The SARS in-out flow model only reflected the real interprovincial flow of SARS cases. In fact SARS in-out flow is influenced by many socioeconomic factors.

A list of trauma centres was obtained from the NHS England website. All critical care units (other than obstetric high dependency units and coronary care units, unless part of a cardiothoracic critical care unit) within each hospital were surveyed. Each respondent was asked about the visiting hours, whether children were allowed to visit and how many visitors to a bed space. Results Fifty-three units with between four and 75 beds and covering the whole of England were surveyed: there was a 100% response rate. Visiting hours varied between hospitals and between units within the same hospital. Nine units (17%) had open visiting hours, although most gave advice on times to avoid such as nursing handover. The majority of units (44.83%) operated restricted visiting with a median (range) of 6 (2 to 9) hours. All units allowed a maximum of two visitors to the bedspace. Children were allowed in nine units without restriction, the remaining units advised that it may not be appropriate for children to visit and it was at the discretion of the parents and medical staff . Conclusion The majority of adult critical care units in England, including our own, have restricted visiting policies. Visiting policies are a source of debate amongst staff in intensive care with concerns about open visiting including increased workload and interruptions to normal routine [1] . This is consistent with the views of staff at our own unit who, in appreciative enquiry, have expressed mixed opinions about extending visiting times.

Twenty-three (52%) of these calls were in the accident and emergency department, and four (9%) in the ICU. Survey results demonstrated two cases where no anaesthetic assistant arrived at the emergency call put out to them. In cases where timely assistance was available, the assistant did not have the adequate clinical and anaesthetic skills required by the attending physician. In 6% of cases where skilled assistance was required (n = 2), it was felt that the assistant did not stay for the clinically required length of time. Emergency drugs required were found to not be available in 11% of cases (n = 5) and in 17% of cases (n = 6) the necessary emergency equipment was not available. Data were collected on equipment from 17 resuscitation trolleys. The inadequacies identifi ed were the oxygen cylinders were fi lled less than 75% full in 41% cases (n = 7) and end-tidal capnography was identifi ed to be absent. Conclusion Emergency calls require standards to be met involving the competency of responding team members and adequate resources. This leads us to question whether guidelines should exist regarding the clinical competency and timeliness of the assistant available to the physician at emergency calls. Reference Introduction There is widespread concern regarding excess mortality for patients admitted to hospital out of hours. We introduced an electronic track and trigger system (Patientrack) with automated alerts in a large university teaching hospital between 2010 and 2012. The system computes the patient's early warning score and alerts medical staff via a pager. It is operational 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and could be an eff ective tool to reduce variations in mortality throughout the working week. Based on analysis of responses, a focused three-pronged intervention was formulated and implemented hospital wide. The arms of the intervention were: identifi cation of the name and role of each staff member using highly visible labels; role allocation according to policy written through a multidisciplinary working group; and a time out during the response allowing a structured synopsis of the patient's current status to be communicated to the team. The intervention was preceded by extensive staff education, and 175 staff (50%) completed the survey 6 months later to assess its success.",14.787458394798449,7.0089847298378585

For example, WHO recommends droplet precautions (surgical mask) unless an aerosolizing procedure is being performed, whereas the U.S. CDC endorses airborne precautions (N95 respirators or equivalent) for all circumstances. Even though there is no good evidence that the virus is transmitted by airborne routes (in the absence of aerosolizing procedures), some would argue that, to avoid transmission, it is better to be more conservative. However, this approach is not without downsides as, if the virus becomes more widespread, it could result in shortages of N95 respirators. Such shortages occurred during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic leading to concerns that respirators might be unavailable for patients with clear indications, such as those with tuberculosis. There is also a substantial cost both for purchasing and stockpiling and for training and fit testing for each new brand of N95 respirator if this approach is used.",17.65572136946699,10.001764766453338

For example, in one HA, infant and child health was bundled with reproductive health, while HL and healthy communities were clustered with mental health promotion and preventing the harms of substance use. Others clustered programs into age-related groupings.

Installing the outlet of the ventilation system over the patients' respiratory systems was found to greatly increase the pathogen concentrations around the airborne pathogen source. Yang et al.

Countries are more likely to invest in surveillance for diseases they can control [46] , and the implementation of an effective response to reporting of endemic disease not only reduces the burden of disease in impoverished communities, but also is likely to foster a culture of reporting at grassroots levels. An approach that focuses on diseases that matter to local communities, and on strengthening systems of effective disease control at the local level, provides an opportunity to engage and empower the very people that are relied upon to detect and prevent emerging zoonoses and thus to enhance the sustainability of the surveillance systems. Community-directed schemes for the treatment of onchocerciasis in Africa illustrate the potential of this kind of approach.

Taking into consideration that the median age, APACHE II score and length of stay for constipated and nonconstipated patients were similar, the relationship to feeding and respiratory support were assessed. Introduction It was noted on our unit that dislodgement of nasogastric tubes occurred commonly. This can lead to an increased risk of aspiration, interruptions in nutritional support, skin breakdown and radiographic exposure [1] . It is recommended that the position of nasogastric tubes should be confi rmed by aspiration and pH testing, with radiographic confi rmation used only when this is not possible [2] . Methods We performed a retrospective review of chest X-ray (CXR) requests for the 3-month period June to August 2012 using the trust radiology information system. The proportion of CXR requests for confi rmation of position and patient demographics were measured with an estimation of the fi nancial cost performed. Results There were 541 patients admitted to the critical care area in the study period. In total, 207 out of 2,340 (8.8%) CXRs performed were for confi rmation of position. Repeated X-rays were required in some patients (see Table 1 ); these patients were older and tended to have a longer length of stay. A mobile CXR costs £25 in our trust, if one CXR is accepted per patient with a nasogastric tube; there was an excess of 160 images with a cost of £4,000 in the 3-month period. Conclusion An excess of CXRs were performed for confi rmation of nasogastric tube in our patient population. The recommended methods for position confi rmation were reinforced amongst medical staff . The high number of repeated imaging for some patients indicates that dislodgement of tubes was also a problem. We propose that nasogastric tubes should be bridled after fi rst dislodgement or at tracheostomy insertion to minimise dislodgement in the future.",11.560346636300299,6.246103369786098

For example, early documents discussed the shortage of key public health personnel, in particular, the need for Medical Officers of Health and those health professionals with expertise in infectious diseases [23, 27, 41] . In contrast with ON, BC documents were less focused on the discussion of shortages and improving PHHR supply with the exception of one specific recommendation of enhancing Aboriginal PH staff [35] .

Training opportunities in critical care in resource-limited settings are scarce, frequently requiring travel to high-income regions, which increases the risk of emigration of health care providers from low to high-resource countries, commonly referred to as ""brain drain"" (86, 87). Recognizing the impact of this phenomenon on workforce shortages, the WHO unanimously adopted the WHO Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Medical Personnel in 2010 (88): this Code aims to promote ethical recruitment of health personnel to strengthen health systems and member states are discouraged from active recruitment of health workers from those countries faced with critical shortages of personnel. Unfortunately, the Code of Practice has not slowed the emigration of physicians from sub-Saharan Africa to the US (89). Solutions include posing limitations on active ""poaching"" by high-income countries, founding and recognition of national critical care societies (90), development of domestic training programs for healthcare staff linked to a commitment of service (73, 91) , utilization of physician extenders or task-shifting (92) , and building capacity through education initiatives.",16.170147353791393,7.732653255297858

The ability to provide advanced oxygenation with one of three modes of support was available in a minority of hospitals. Furthermore, this expertise was unevenly distributed across provinces, and was focused at university-affiliated teaching hospitals.

We did not determine capacity for other techniques such as prone ventilation, which may be less dependent upon specific technology, more dependent upon generation of a local experience base, and have a greater evidence base for efficacy than either early highfrequency ventilation or use of inhaled nitric oxide [32] .

The cross-sectional design of our study prevent us from answering questions about causality, since it is plausible, for instance, that people who are already distressed for reasons not measured in this study are more likely to worry about A/ H1N1 influenza pandemic. Work satisfaction was also associated with psychological distress (Table 6 ) but it was not correlated to the degree of worry about the pandemic ( Table 5 ), indicating that the association of work dissatisfaction with psychological distress could be attributed to the chronic stress and burnout that are common in hospital settings and leading contributors to work dissatisfaction [29] rather than the HCW's concerns about the pandemic. Consistent with the results of previous studies in SARS-affected hospitals [17, 30, 31] , nurses and medical staff presented high rates of psychological distress. Although by definition, both medical staff and nurses have greater contact with patients, medical staff expressed the lower degree of worry (Table 1) , possibly because they mostly regarded themselves as sufficiently informed (Table 2) .

However, considering the possibility of indirect transmission via virus shedding into the environment [19, 20] , some researchers have suggested that people who share space and time with a patient should also be included in the quarantine group despite the lack of direct contact. During the early phase of the MERS outbreak in South Korea, quarantine was mainly confined to people who had come into close contact (within 2 m) with an infected person, but this has limited effects in protecting against MERS outbreaks in some hospitals [11, 12, 16] . During an outbreak, most hospitals try to isolate all people who have shared space and time with MERS patients based on this belief. However, this strategy does not include the possibility of indirect transmission via medical employees' body or hands, which may mean that some infected people are excluded from the initial isolation process because there was no discernible contact with patients or spatial or time overlap. In contrast to the community setting, more frequent contact may occur between HCPs, patients and others in the hospital setting.

In this context malaria is of particular interest when considering the African continent. In tropical Africa, malaria is an important infectious disease and is still thought to be the main cause of febrile episodes in children. However, the threshold of clinical manifestation of malaria is strongly influenced by the endemicity of Plasmodium falciparum infection in an area: in very low transmission areas, any microscopically detectable parasitemia would indicate malaria, whereas in regions of high transmission, a certain parasitemia needs to be reached to lead to malaria at least from 5 years of age on. Recent, mainly unpublished observations show that there is a considerable drop in malaria incidence [15] and in P. falciparum prevalence rate [16] in some African countries. Despite this reduction, the old habit of treating every child with fever with antimalarials continues. As fever due to many infectious diseases wanes after a few days without treatment, the belief that medical staff are successfully treating malaria cases lingers on.",15.91574089974446,7.918855119125038

This experiment has been widely used to observe the dispersion phenomenon of airborne bacteria [29, 30] . However, at sites different to controlled laboratories, it is difficult to derive reproducible results due to the interference from high-concentration airborne particles already present in indoor and outside air. Although the SF6 gas used in the tracer-gas experiment is seldom detected in normal environments, and therefore not subject to interference, it exhibits an aerodynamic dispersion behavior different from that of particles, as it contains gas molecules smaller than particles. In previous studies on SARS [17, 27] , airflow indoors and outdoors was analyzed using passive contaminant to identify the dispersion of SARS virus based on the assumption that the droplets exhaled from the infected patient are evaporated very quickly and get smaller enough to flow like airflow. For the same reason, SF6 gas is widely used for the dispersion of pollution substances such as gas and airborne particles, or for airflow examinations, as it can be used to simulate airflow [31, 32] . Besides, we tried to conduct the tracer experiment in the same condition with the initial outbreak period at the hospital. However, the patients, medical staff and their movements could not be simulated because the hospital was evacuated and they were isolated in other facilities. Moreover, the hospital was still under risk of contamination.

Community pharmacists' lack of participation in continuing education programs reduced their score in terms of Zika virus infection preparedness.

The reason community pharmacists consider themselves not prepared for the management of Zika virus infection, may be due to the same reasons discussed, that they are busy dispensing medications on the counter. Attending mandatory continuing education may resolve this problem. Government agencies have spent a significant amount and resources to educate medical staff and to make information about the Zika virus infection epidemic publicly available [36] . However, the resources have mainly targeted primary care staff in government services.

For schistosomiasis, the intensity of transmission decreases with decreasing prevalence of infection. Microscopy is no longer sufficiently sensitive to detect residual infection in communities when the number of eggs per gram of stool falls below 40. Antigen or nucleic acid amplified tests (NAATs) are needed to replace microscopy to identify communities in which transmission is still occurring. However, most antigen detection tests using enzyme immunoassays or lateral flow tests have not been shown to be sufficiently sensitive and current NAATs are too expensive and technical demanding for community based screening.

While most studies on infectious disease ecology focus on the dynamics of a single host species and single pathogen, we acknowledge that more research is needed to address the complexities of multi host-pathogen dynamics [148] . Community ecology, with its emphasis on the composition of and interconnections between ecological communities, allows one to understand infectious disease dynamics in multi-pathogen, multi-host disease systems that occur across diverse scales (e.g., from within a single host, to between species, to between regions) [148] . Other topics of importance deserving further study in bat species of Western Asia include: effects of extreme weather (e.g., heat waves) on bat survival, including changes in the distribution of bat species (and associated pathogens) and changes in prey abundance or food resources that could alter reproductive patterns and disease transmission [149, 150] . For example, increased prevalence of Marburg virus (MARV) in Rousettus aegyptiacus colonies corresponded with defined periods of synchronized parturition (which resulted in an influx of immunologically-naive, juvenile bats), as well as an increased incidence of spillover into human populations [77] . If such virus-host associations exist in regional bat species, climatic changes may affect reproductive phenology in bats, and therefore the timing of peak viral spillover into human populations. A systems-wide, hypothesis-driven approach will allow for better identification of emerging disease risk factors, and more effective policy recommendations for reducing the disease transmission and spread [146, 148] .",8.332656620225512,3.7769166783972787

Successful teams are created through formulating inter-related goals, identifying measurable outcomes, systematizing routine tasks of care, defining provider tasks and roles explicitly, and providing appropriate training. 27 A document published by the State Council of China in 2006 29 mandated that the allocation rate for medical staff working in the CHS should reach the level of two to three general practitioners and nurses per 10,000 residents, and one public health specialist per 10,000 residents by 2010. In Beijing, the allocation is one general practitioner per 3000 residents, one nurse per 25,000 residents and one public health specialist per 2000 residents. 20 In fact, the above allocation rates have not yet been met, especially since the demand for much of the scope and quality of public health services has increased. In addition, the low levels of CHS providers' knowledge and skills 4 is a major problem. As a result, basic public health services are often only provided in response to patient requests or obvious needs in Beijing; services thus tend to be reactive rather than proactive. It may simply be unrealistic to expect community providers to deliver a comprehensive package of basic public health services along with the many competing demands of providing direct clinical care. 21 In view of the reasons mentioned above, Beijing Municipal Government is planning several programmes to improve the service capabilities of the CHS providers. These include partial changes in the structure, roles and functions of the teams; incentives to attract more medical graduates to work in community settings; redistribution of tertiary hospital doctors to CHS organizations; reemployment of retired doctors in the CHS; and the provision of financial support and opportunities for younger doctors to get better continuing medical education. 4 The roles and experiences of both medical staff and their patients also impact on health promotion activities. The community resident/patient is not a passive participant in the process of receiving basic public health services, and many residents look to providers for guidance and direction in the prevention of diseases. 30 Favourable interaction between providers and patients is critical to the effectiveness and efficiency of the delivery of basic public health services, because in some types of preventive services, the patient's contribution may ultimately be more significant than the provider's role (e.g. weight loss, smoking cessation, reduction of alcohol use, adherence to medical regimen). 30 People with insurance can access other services which are not free of charge in CHS organizations. In fact, people with insurance prefer to visit doctors in hospitals to CHS organizations. In order to attract more people to visit the CHS, CHS organizations are required to supply acceptable services by decreasing drug prices and increasing the proportion of medical reimbursement. 31 Beijing Municipal Government is currently devoting significant funding to publicizing basic public health services in the community by means of various media, and is encouraging residents with common diseases to see general practitioners.",14.91306892609926,5.991922544456682

Thereby, the lack of standardization of esignatures impedes exchange and sharing of medical data [40] . There are at least three distinct motivations underlying our study. Firstly, a law pertaining to esignature was enacted and was formally promulgated in 2002. Secondly, the Department of Health (DOH) of Taiwan adapted Public Key as an infrastructure and set up the Healthcare Certification Authority (HCA) in 2003. A total of 8000 IC cards were issued to medical institutes and more than 30,000 IC cards were issued to medical staff. Thirdly, the astonishing rapid spread of the intra-hospital transmission of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic killed 84 people in Taiwan and speeds up the exchange of EMR between hospitals to track the potential contagion. However, the adoption of e-signature was not satisfactory at the time this research was conducted and the reasons hospitals delayed e-signature adoption were not investigated. Adopting e-signature is not only a simple activity to purchase the required hardware and software, but rather a social interaction process among users, organizations, and the environment. While implementing IS, organizational managers are suggested to focus on critical success factors for promptly responding to important events [15, 25] .

Current hospital reliance on ""just-in-time"" and stockless material management systems to reduce storage and inventory costs 14 leave institutions with vulnerably low reserves of key consumables and durable medical equipment. 15 Critical care equipment is no exception (Lewis Rubinson, MD, PhD; unpublished data; December 2007), so the quantity of additional critically ill patients a hospital can care for without resupply is impressively small.

For events when hospitals are further overwhelmed, the staff may assess the risk as much higher. An example of a higher-risk situation is when the staff member believes that were a patient to become inadvertently disconnected from a mechanical ventilator, their current caregivers may be spread too thin to reliably uncover and respond to the disconnection in time to prevent severe harm to the patient. While these are subjective assessments, senior critical care staff (eg, medical director or nursing director of an ICU) should be able to assess the approximate risk to their patients.

However, accurate, real-time assessment of both critical care needs and available resources remains outside the capability of most US jurisdictions that contain more than a few hospitals. In recognition of these informational shortcomings, the tiers suggested by the Task Force are based on criteria that are more likely to be known and rapidly assessed in the middle of a response: (1) expert staff assessment of current risk for harm to critically ill patients at hospitals, (2) hospital response actions, and (3) external response actions (health-care coalition 19 through federal response actions [ Table 3 ]). The tiers were designed to be consistent with a wellaccepted framework for disaster medical response. 19 The real-time data problem is not the only reason the Task Force does not define response tiers by ratios of patients to resources (eg, ICU beds). Simple counts of critical care patients and resource availability may not accurately reflect whether hospitals are functioning in a normal manner or are dangerously overwhelmed. Not reflected in the numbers is the clinical acuity of patients as well as the need for resource-intensive procedures (eg, renal replacement therapy) and specialized care (pediatrics and burn care), all variables that can significantly influence critical care resource requirements. Five patients with multiorgan system failure and hemodynamic instability may have greater critical care resource requirements than 15 patients with respiratory failure and no other organ dysfunction. Similarly, capability provided by critical care resources cannot be completely defined by simple counts of staff, treatment space, or medical equipment.

At 8:28 AM, the first patients arrived at Tokyo's St. Luke's Emergency Department. At 9:00 AM, the emergency department received initial notification that the Tokyo Fire Department had identified the chemical (incorrectly) as acetonitrile. At 9:40 AM, a medical doctor with experience from the previous sarin attack in Matsumoto, Japan, called to advise medical staff to suspect sarin, and the hospital began treating patients with the appropriate MARK 1 sarin antidote kits at that time. It was not until 11:00 AM that the hospital was notified that police analysis had identified the chemical as sarin and the ED staff received that information while watching the television news. 9 Because scene reports may be delayed or inaccurate and laboratory confirmation takes time, ED staff must be knowledgeable about the presenting signs and symptoms of the various types of agents and infectious diseases. Information from patients about the event and their signs and symptoms will be the primary sources of data that ED personnel receive to determine what agent the patients may have been exposed to. Staff must have the ability to start decontamination or isolation procedures as soon as they are suspicious that an exposure occurred, and this clinical suspicion needs to be based in appropriate training. Training needs to include not only basic classes reviewing agent characteristics but also the application of that knowledge into practical considerations, such as how and when to implement ED response procedures. This can be accomplished through interactive classes, role playing, and regular drilling. It is crucial that the ED charge nurses have regular practice with the decision-making steps that they will need to perform when they believe a patient has been exposed to a chemical or infectious agent. Staff should not experience repercussions for ""jumping the gun"" if their suspicions of contamination turn out to be erroneous. In Toronto, ED staff were unaware of the SARS events taking place in Hong Kong and China, because of a lack of international health alerts about SARS. 5 As a result, ED personnel did not know what pertinent questions were needed in the triage assessment (e.g., travel history). Hospitals must ensure that their personnel has up-to-date information to correctly identify and isolate contaminated patients. This consists of maintaining access to health alerts through systems such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Health Alert Network.

This ACEP section is composed of physicians actively involved in cruise ship medicine. Their objective is to advance the capabilities of cruise ship medical facilities and the quality of medical care provided aboard cruise ships. 21 The guidelines address standards for medical facility design, medical staff qualifications, diagnostic equipment, and formulary selection, with a goal of providing general and emergency medical services to passengers and crew. 24 Medical care aboard cruise ship is designed to provide cruise line passengers and crew members with timely access to comprehensive services for minor to severe illness and injury. The international maritime requirement to have a doctor aboard ship is actually determined by the size of the crew. Only vessels with 100 or more crew members on an international voyage of 3 days or more are required to sail with a physician. 25 No international maritime regulations require a doctor to be aboard ship specifically for passenger medical care. The availability of doctors and nurses aboard cruise ships for passenger medical care are a result of the maritime requirements for crew medical services. In reality, the provision of services to both crew members and passengers by medical staff has become the standard within the cruise industry to meet the needs and expectations of all people onboard the vessel. 14, 21 Cruise ship physicians are recruited from countries worldwide. Employment by a particular cruise line may be dependent upon the doctor's nationality, as per the ship's flag state regulations, or the company's own hiring preferences. All physicians must meet the qualifications for appointment as a ship's medical officer. This typically includes an unrestricted medical license, medical board certification, 3 years of clinical experience post medical school, competence in advanced life support and minor surgical skills, and fluency in the official language of the cruise line. 24 Cruise ship nurses have comparable requirements for employment. The number of medical staff aboard any particular ship is dictated primarily by the total number of people aboard ship. This can range from a lone doctor for a small ship of 200 people to a medical staff of two physicians and five nurses for a mega-ship carrying more than 5,000 passengers and crew members. 14 The medical facility aboard a modern cruise ship is designed to provide essential medical services within the space constraints of an ocean-going vessel (see infirmary photo). Most of the medical conditions that arise aboard ship can be treated as they would be at a doctor's office or ambulatory care center at home. The infirmary is staffed several hours a day for routine medical evaluations. The medical staff is also available 24 hours per day to respond to medical emergencies. More serious problems (such as myocardial infarction, respiratory distress, or cerebrovascular accidents) may require emergency evacuation to a fully staffed and equipped shore-side hospital after the patient is stabilized in the ship's medical facility. 26 Accordingly, one should view a ship's medical facility as an infirmary or sickbay and not a full-service hospital.",26.49941687837685,11.380900287324245

[33] [34] [35] Although guidelines and frameworks exist to aid health systems in managing medication shortages, 36, 37 no single approach can completely eliminate the clinical implications and associated risks for patients. Pharmacists are well positioned to reduce risks of further medication shortages arising from COVID-19 by reassuring patients and members of the public of the continued availability of OTC and prescription medications based on rational levels of demand and implementing policies to prevent unnecessary stockpiling.

This may be a reflection of the general shortage of health care providers that not only affects routine patient care, but also disaster planning. Smaller-sized hospitals report less health care worker surge capacity than do larger facilities, which is logical given that smaller hospitals have fewer staff from which to draw during a disaster. It is critical, however, that hospitals of all sizes continue to develop plans for obtaining extra staff to respond during an infectious disease emergency, because this will affect a hospital's ability to care for patients. One way to accomplish this is for hospitals to include provisions for health care worker incentives to encourage them to come to work during an infectious disease emergency, something that less than half of U.S. hospitals report including in their disaster plan.",17.168052923500756,6.080539154645877

The response is conducted through the intervention of several agencies and must be fl exible and adaptable for any type of event. It is important to immediately establish a response framework with a unifi ed command structure that establishes a chain of command, control, and coordinate the resources, in terms of staff, stuff, and structure. The Incident Command System (ICS) provides a structure to enable agencies with different legal, jurisdictional, and functional responsibilities to coordinate, plan, and interact effectively on scene [ 11 ] . The medical response is provided at the scene by the emergency medical services (EMS), with triage, treatment, and transport to the hospitals. EMS plays a crucial role in the immediate phase of the response to disaster. The response must be quick and effective on the scene as well as in the determination of hospital destinations for every patient, to guarantee an appropriate standard of care and to avoid bottlenecks and congestion at hospitals. Rarely, EMS is able to triage, treat, and transport every single patient from the scene. Often some casualties reach the closest hospital on their own, giving rise to disruption in the chain of triage and to the hospital. The ability of a healthcare system to suddenly expand its capacity beyond normal services to meet the increased demand for qualifi ed medical staff and services during a large-scale event is defi ned as ""surge capacity"" [ 12 ] . The surge capacity depends on the features of the healthcare system, but also by an effective EOP and training of the staff.",25.951837573521857,11.304037013576163

However, the WHO and CDC scientists around the world have been searching for the causative agent of SARS. Clinical specimens from patients with SARS were analysed to detect the unknown virus. Drosten et al. (2003) conducted virologic testing from respiratory and blood samples of SARS patients in Frankfurt, Germany and detected a novel coronavirus. They concluded that the extremely high concentration of the virus particles in sputum specimen were consistent with high level of contagiousness, its presence in the serum suggested a long viremic phase, and during the convalescent period, presence of the virus in feces could increase its period of infectivity which compared to the typically short infectivity of acute viral respiratory infections.

It was discovered during this research that ""mitigation measures were found to be most common when proactive mitigation measures were mandated by regulatory agencies and legislation."" 55 Tax incentives, government assistance grants, and building code and insurance requirements may also serve to motivate administrators and decision makers to put the necessary time and effort into mitigation planning. 30 The Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP), designed to provide leadership and funding through grants to and cooperative agreements with states, territories, and eligible municipalities to improve surge capacity and enhance community and hospital preparedness for public health emergencies, 52 has undergone significant cuts over the past few years that threaten to undo progress made in the last decade. HPP appropriations have decreased from $426 million in FY2010 to $255 million in FY2014, including a one-third cut in the FY2014 omnibus. 56 HPP provides financial incentives to ensure that hospitals are able to coordinate, cooperate, and reduce loss of life during an emergency.

As one of the most seriously affected hospitals, People's Hospital treated over 8,360 patients with fever with 205 of them diagnosed as SARS cases from April 5 to April 24. As one of the top third most visited comprehensive hospitals in Beijing, People's Hospital designed its urgent care division ""both to save space and to make things easy for patients, with all testing and fee paying windows clustered together"" in one hall way, which posed serious health risks to its visitors in contagious respiratory epidemics (""Resolving Mysteries"") . Overwhelmed by large numbers of fever patients, hospital authorities decided to convert first the laundry room on April 7 and then the boiler room on April 13 into a SARS ward. While the first SARS ward held sick patients, the second ward contained infected medical staff. Moreover, its emergency room was packed with fever patients, many of them later diagnosed as SARS. The high in-hospital infection rate scared many cleaners and personal care workers away; doctors, nurses, and administrative staff had to clean SARS wards themselves. Moreover, the hospital was forced to convert its patio into a temporary medical observation center, which later became its ""hotspot of infection"" (""Resolving Mysteries"") . Because of the lack of prevention guidelines and the heavy workload, a total of 93 medical workers and hospital staff contracted SARS during this period. To make matters worse, the People's Hospital had to keep staff in ordinary wards because all hospitals in Beijing were overfilled with SARS patients.",23.035964785591894,11.767791959148294

Considerations of infection prevention and the avoidance of crosscontamination may additionally dictate that infected patients be placed in a geographically separate location. In situations where there are inadequate numbers of individual rooms, patients with confirmed infections may be cohorted in common areas to reduce the risk of cross-contamination. 40 During a standard hospital surge, it is anticipated that institutions can tolerate a 20% increase in critically ill patients with minimal impact. Increases of up to 200% of normal capacity may occur, but only at the cost of degraded capability and a possible modification in the standard of care. When ICU capacity is exceeded, less-ill patients may need to be transferred to other levels of care, such as patients not requiring mechanical ventilation, vasopressor support, or intensive neuromonitoring. Conversely, areas of the hospital capable of ICU-level monitoring, such as a postanesthesia care unit (PACU) or a monitored step-down unit, may need to be repurposed as temporary ICUs, especially if cohorting of seriously ill patients is planned.

If a disease outbreak overwhelms local capacity, even at surge levels, institutions will need to determine a just allocation of scarce resources. If hospital transfer outside of the affected region is possible, this will require coordination by regional and national authorities. Scarce resources, such as ECMO or access to an ETU, will require allocation in a manner that is open, consistent, and based on broadly accepted ethical principles.

An example of these efforts is the 2011 Beyond the Border (BTB) initiative, which is a bilateral endeavor launched by President Barack Obama and Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper in February 2011. BTB articulates a shared approach to cross-border security in which both countries work together to address threats at and away from their borders. 27 The health security objective of the BTB work plan focuses on enhancing collective preparedness and response capacity for health security threats, including supporting the ability to share mutual public health and medical assistance across the US-Canada border by establishing a bilateral framework for the deployment of medical countermeasures. Similarly, the North American Plan for Animal and Pandemic Influenza (NAPAPI), a trilateral effort among the United States, Canada, and Mexico, focuses on strengthening the ability of all 3 countries to jointly prepare and respond to pandemic threats. NAPAPI calls for the sharing of pandemic influenza medical countermeasures in the human and animal health sectors in North America during a pandemic event. 28 The Global Health Security Initiative (GHSI) is a ministerial-level collaboration among Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the United Kingdom, the United States, the European Commission, and WHO to strengthen health preparedness and response for CBRN threats and pandemic influenza. As reflected in the 2007 GHSI ministerial communique, GHSI members ''considered the need to develop a sustainable global infrastructure [for medical countermeasures] that would allow us to work together to counteract the health consequences of natural or man-made threats.'' 29 In the 2013 GHSI ministerial communique, the heads of the health sector of these countries and organizations recognized the ''significant progress [of GHSI members and WHO] towards building an operational framework for the international deployment of medical countermeasures which contemplates the legal, regulatory, and logistical issues to be considered during such a deployment.'' 30 For the first time, policymakers, regulatory and legal experts, and logisticians have come together to explore mechanisms to address the issues encountered during the 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine deployment. These discussions are intended to assist WHO to establish a mechanism to accept medical countermeasures from donor countries or manufacturers and to deploy them to countries where assistance is needed to respond to a public health or medical emergency. This issue has also been examined during the 2013 Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) meeting of experts, and the BWC has provided a forum for the continued development of these partnerships to address the identified barriers to the international sharing of assistance. 31 While ensuring the ability to deploy medical countermeasures across international borders is a key component of global health security, there will likely be situations where there are not sufficient medical countermeasures available to meet the needs of the global population. The current Ebola outbreak is a clear example of this. Although some experimental treatments and vaccines exist at various degrees of development and in limited quantities, it is challenging to ramp up production, conduct clinical trials, and distribute the scarce resources in a fair and equitable manner. 32 This situation has raised many of the legal, regulatory, and logistical issues discussed here. It has also led to discussions of the ethics associated with using medical countermeasures that have never been tested in humans and, given the extremely limited amount of medicine available, if used, who should receive them. 33 To address these potential shortages in access and availability of products as well as transportation and administration capabilities, existing and new international collaborations should be leveraged to explore opportunities for pursuing joint international efforts.",13.663526617595766,10.839829330730662

During normal operations, many health care facilities as well as first-responder or transportation assets lack appropriate weight-based assistance devices. Even if available, these patients require increased number of staff to help safely move them. 20 In disaster settings where medical staff may have limited availability and security, EMS, volunteers, and other nonmedical personnel may be used to assist health care workers in patient movement, lifting, and other physical tasks. 17 In addition to the increased number of staff required to manage obese patients, the staff themselves are similarly increasing in size along with the general population, putting themselves at risk for injuries and illnesses related to their size.

Once exposed to a disaster scenario, patients require on-scene treatment and transportation to a facility capable of managing them. Unlike normal events, in which most survivors find their own conveyance to the closest hospital, obese patients will most likely not be able to do that, relying therefore on emergency medical services (EMS). Less critically ill patients may be taken to lower-acuity facilities or, in the setting of a slowly evolving event like pandemic flu, a community surge facility such as an acute care facility. For example, special accommodations may also be needed to get these patients immunized, because it is unlikely Geiling that they will be able to get to a community vaccine or medication point of distribution (POD). If hospitalization is required, these patients will need to be managed regionally as is done with pediatric or burn patients at present. Regional Medical Control Centers should monitor what facilities can manage these patients and ensure that proper transportation assets are available to assist in their movement. 8 In addition, community health planners need to be aware of these patients in their community, in the same way they should be aware of patients with home oxygen or medical devices. If these patients need evacuation because of a pending disaster or sudden event, then the local medical control should be proactive in seeking resources to move them to appropriate care or transportation hubs for moving them out of the region. 9 When disasters occur, the effect on the health care system depends on the nature of the event. In sudden-impact disasters such as transportation accidents, bombings, or fire, large numbers of patients tend to present to the closest facility over a short time span, typically within 3 hours. The hospital is mostly affected in the emergency department and, perhaps, the operating room. However, more protracted events such as pandemic flu would have a more prolonged effect on intensive care units (ICUs). These valuable resources may quickly become overburdened, requiring resources to surge to meet those needs. Ideally, hospitals discharge less critically ill patients to home, long-term care facilities, or even community disaster centers, leaving staffed ICU beds available for those needing this care. However, because those strategies also become overwhelmed, hospitals will need to expand their internal critical care capabilities with creative approaches to surging equipment, staff, and care space, that is, stuff, staff, and space. Because of the increased needs and comorbidities of obese patients, they pose additional challenges to this surge strategy. 10 Stuff Simple measures such as determining vital signs may be challenging in a disaster setting. In a review from France, prehospital management problems of morbidly obese patients included inability to measure blood pressure in 9%, inability to gain venous access in 13%, and difficulty in intubating 20% of the patients, often requiring advanced airways. 11 The routine use of noninvasive blood pressure cuffs may not be useful because of the inherent inaccuracies of the cuff's bladder size to arm circumference. 12 Normal emergency department and ICU procedures may also need additional support, including changed or decreased quality of electrocardiograms, poor radiographic or ultrasonographic imaging, increased reliance on invasive monitoring or procedures, such as diagnostic peritoneal lavage if the patient cannot fit the computed tomographic scanner, and advanced airway support due to oropharynx size or neck mobility limitations. 13 In 2008, the Task Force on Mass Critical Care reviewed the recommended ventilator characteristics for disaster settings as well as ancillary equipment. 14 Although review of that information reveals no specific recommendations for the needs of the obese patient, it does point to the requirement to ensure the equipment cached for disaster events do, indeed, fit these patients. The ventilator characteristics should meet such patients' needs, although if noninvasive ventilation is considered (which was not recommended by the Task Force), appropriately sized masks must be available. In addition, monitoring equipments such as blood pressure cuffs and pulse oximeters as well as central venous catheters and other tubes and lines must be of sufficient sensitivity and size to care for these patients.",15.551863401503578,9.204724158128029

The influx of patients to the emergency departments (EDs) necessitates preparedness to expand surge capacities of the varied hospital facilities including the ED, intensive care units, inpatient departments, and laboratory capacities [71, 72] . Nevertheless, compared to natural disasters or other types of emergency situations, an HCID outbreak presents different challenges, as the patients do not necessarily present to the emergency departments simultaneously and for a short period of time but rather do so over a prolonged time span [65] . The patients may present a high risk for transmitting the infection and thus pose a risk for spreading the disease to the personnel or other patients that are hospitalized. Therefore, those managing the event need to take into account unique elements of surge capacity such as designated infrastructure and equipment (i.e., isolation facilities), communication measures, and means for infection control [65, 73] . It is recommended that establishment of a designated ""biological ED"" be considered, separate from the routine EDs, to facilitate safety measures and prevent potential infection of staff and other patients that present to the hospital concurrently.

In order to evaluate if the mobile e-nursing carts became the media of multi-drug resistant organism (MDRO) transmission, ATP-bioluminescence and culture were performed to assess the efficacy of surface cleaning in 10 high-touch surfaces of mobile e-nursing cart. The mean value of ATP-bioluminescence of the surfaces was 1112.6 RLU. The culture grew 180 isolates of microorganism (56.3%). The result revealed that the cleaning is insufficient. There's no a universal regulation. After investigation the will of cleaning by questionnaire, it correlated with the convenience of cleaning tools. Therefore, this study tried to assess efficacy of cleaning by four different cleaning tools. This study also evaluated the will of medical staff for cleaning the mobile e-nursing cart by different cleaning tools. By the analysis, we try to find out how to increase the will of medical staff for cleaning the mobile e-nursing cart, to make sure the cleaning and to avoid healthcare-associated infection. Methods: 1. The mobile e-nursing carts were cleaned by four different tools. To assess the outcome of cleaning, ten high-touch surfaces of each cart was checked by ATP-bioluminescence after cleaning. 2. Questionnaire was designed to medical staff to evaluate the satisfaction the medical staff for different cleaning tools. Results: 1. The use of four different cleaning tools in the e-nursing carts of the vehicle clean, found that different cleaning products can make the surface after cleaning. The mean value of ATPbioluminescence of the surfaces was 484.5 RLU. 2. Total 128 questionnaire were filled in by medical staff. The questionnaire included the items of convenience, operation, cleaning effect, odor and stimulation to skin. The result showed that the medical staff satisfied with antiseptic wet tissue B. Conclusion: A cleaning tool with convenience to operation, effective cleaning, lower stimulation to skin and smell will increase the will and frequency of cleaning for medical staff.

We consulted the dermatologist, he was diagnosed as subacute dermatitis and contact isolation was implemented thereafter. He was referred to other hospital and then scabies was diagnosed. Methods: The spread of scabies clusters were due to delayed diagnosis and contact isolation (No wearing a protective clothing when contact with the patient, not using of personal medical equipment). The infection control department implemented the following strategies: (1) Organizing the education and training of scabies. (2) Formulate the rules of those patients who were transferred from nursing home should implement contact isolation, and the skin should be checked such as: fingers, palms, wrist, armpit, hip, around the navel, genitourinary parts.

Among all the requirements for a successful endotracheal intubation, conventional laryngoscopy is regarded as the most difficult practice because professional training and skills experience are usually insufficiently provided. Inappropriate training and lack of equipment support not only results in inaccurate esophageal intubation but also leads to unnecessary airway injury. 1 One of the obstacles is that conventional laryngoscopy does not reveal the vocal cords as a result of the discrepant anatomic structure or the lack of skill. 2, 3 To overcome the poor visibility of the vocal cords, transillumination of the neck with illuminating stylets (i.e., lightwand) has been developed with an overall success rate of intubation between 97.9% and 100%. 4, 5 However, the lack of direct visual confirmation of the airway orifice could lead to unnoticed esophageal intubation until hypoxemia has developed. Theoretically, the potential catastrophe associated with ""blind"" intubation can be avoided under video-guided intubation when the assistant and supervisor are simultaneously attentive. 6 Another critical disadvantage of direct laryngoscopy is the hygiene hazard. To obtain a maximal view, the performer (and/or the supervisor) has to place their eyes close to the patient's mouth. As a result, contaminated exhalations from the patient's airway may directly contaminate the performer's face. Thus, endotracheal intubation is known as the most risky procedure for medical staff because the patient's exhalations are capable of transmitting infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and open tuberculosis. To keep medical staff safe from this iatrogenic possibility, the performer has to stay away from the infectious source as far as possible.",18.248504952747073,8.254247370020009

Military surge strategies offer excellent examples of how to systematically leverage medical resources by flexing available manpower that may not be considered traditional clinical complements. JIT training paradigms can augment targeted capabilities over relatively short time frames and can provide large groups of caregivers led by specially trained medical team leaders, allowing systems to manage large numbers of acute care patients. 25, 26 Telemedicine platforms may also be used to augment staff and provide expert assistance ""virtually"" when the necessary technology is available to support the effort. 27 Effective strategies that are commonly used to expand staffing resources during a crisis surge is the planned incorporation of disaster medical responders from other communities via preexisting memoranda of understanding or capability expansion through the JIT training and use of nontraditional personnel. Availability of these resources varies widely between jurisdictions, and often includes state or regional teams in addition to federal disaster resources. The federal disaster teams are incorporated into the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) within the US Department of Health and Human Services.

Reductions in medical and nursing staff may seem appropriate given the reduction in overall patient attendance, but increasing waiting and process times suggest that despite the decrease in numbers, workload has increased with a progressively complex, ageing population. The strong correlations between increased process time and increased waiting times may not be surprising, but there was an even stronger correlation between the reduction in medical staff numbers and the increase in process time. This suggests that reductions in staff adversely impact waiting and process times for all patients despite the decrease in overall patient numbers, which lends support to increasing staff numbers back to their original levels at least.",18.930297688007606,7.172295029586641

After the outbreak, medical staff and scientists from all over the world have been racing against time to carry out the basic and clinical research on the new coronavirus and the new coronavirus pneumonia. A series of achievements have been made, which deepens our understanding of the new coronavirus, and provides theoretical support for the prevention and treatment of the new coronavirus pneumonia [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . However, it is still a critical period for the prevention and control of the new coronavirus pneumonia outbreak. The burn department, as an emergency department, is facing serious risks. In order to improve the patient treatment rate, avoid medical staff infection or reduce the risk of infection, according to the characteristics of the new coronavirus pneumonia, our own experience, the latest release of the diagnosis and treatment program of China and the relevant recommendations of national prevention and control, combined with the latest literature at home and abroad and hospital management experience of related departments, etc., our institute, one of the biggest burn centers in the world, raised some advices on the medical practice in burn department during the new coronavirus pneumonia pandemic, hoping to provide useful information to medical staff in burn department and hospital managers.",21.460178699099593,10.058200717072934

However, this is often difficult to do during a disaster when ambulances are occupied with the ongoing prehospital response. Moreover, most areas will not have a sufficient number of dedicated critical care transport teams to evacuate large numbers of critically ill; thus, regular critical care staff would be required. This would take critical care staff away from the hospital during transport and would be an inefficient use of valuable staff (ie, 2:1 or 3:1 registered nurse/respiratory technician/ medical doctor-to-patient ratio).",21.23872321340524,9.890419520165313

The potential of becoming infected can be reduced by a systematic and integrated approach that assesses infection risk. The latter leads to an acceptable choice of materials and techniques for personal protection and prevention of cross contamination to other patients and staff. We present a protocolized approach that uses diagnostic criteria to clearly define benchmarks from the medical history along with clinical symptoms and laboratory tests. Patients can then be rapidly assigned into one of three risk categories that direct the choice of protective materials and/or techniques.

The importance of matching the high acuity of the patients with appropriately skilled staff is an important method to ensure the safe care of all ICU patients. It has been shown that nurse inexperience can adversely impact on the quality of care provided to critically ill patients (Morrison et al., 2001) and the contributing factors to such occurrences were all present during the recent pandemic -staff shortages, high unit activity and lower levels of supervision. Additionally, many staff were working a large amount of overtime during the pandemic and this has also been shown to increase both errors and near misses (Scott et al., 2006) . However, the reality of the situation was that if the medical and nursing staff had not have worked the extra hours, it would not have been possible to staff the ICU. The nurse managers identified that in a future pandemic actions to minimise staffing problems would include limiting annual leave during this time and also booking contract or agency nursing staff in advance to cover the increased staffing needs of the ICU. It is essential to increase staffing levels during a pandemic period to assist in facilitating adherence to staffing protocols, to facilitate adequate meal breaks for staff and to assist bedside nursing staff in getting supplies and running blood tests. If safe to do so, the transfer of lower acuity patients to nearby ICUs should also be considered to reduce the burden on staff.",18.186744062308698,9.370436353357116

Genotypic analysis including pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and resistance genes identification showed that all strains were closely related. The measures to control the multi-resistant strain dissemination included (a) IR-Kp carriers isolation in private rooms, (b) disinfection with alcohol-based-hand antiseptics, (c) wearing disposable gowns and gloves before entering the room of carriers, (d) daily staff training, (e) environmental cleaning. These measures have been reinforced at the end of may by (a) cohorting IR-Kp carriers in one separate section of ICU, (b) nurse staff exclusively dedicated to IR-Kp carriers, (c) decreasing admission in the surgical care center, (d) strict control of patient transfer to other care centers, (e) antibiotic prescription control. Screening of all patients was performed twice a week using imipenem containing plates (4 mg/l).

The mission concluded that the level of assistance provided to the migrants by the Bulgarian Government has clearly improved but the medical response system is very fragile and not fully prepared to respond to a possible new and larger influx of migrants. The main weakness of the response system is the weak provision of primary health care through clinics in migrant centres or the assignment of general practitioners (GP) to migrants due to the fact that clinics are understaffed and interpretation services are not always available. As a consequence, the first recommendation of WHO is the revision of the National plan for crisis management with a focus on reorganizing primary health care services and rationalizing the use of available resources [27, p. 15 ]. To put this into context, in the following section we provide an overview of the institutions and personnel involved in refugee and migrant management. Upon arrival in Bulgaria, the asylum seekers first face the authorities of the Ministry of Interior. By law, migrants can be held for up to 24 hours at a location, where basic health screening is conducted, and from there they are directed to the Registration and Reception Centre (RRC), the Transit Centre (TC) or detention centres where primary care is carried out.

Guidelines for collection of appropriate specimens, transport of the specimens to the testing site, and laboratory policies (e.g., limits on the number of specimens that can be submitted for a specific test, list of pathogens routinely sought in stool cultures) should be available. The test menu and guidelines should be readily available on the hospital computerized information system and ideally integrated with electronic ordering of tests. The computer system should document receipt of specimens in the laboratory, provide a record of testing in progress, and report preliminary and final results. The microbiologist should coordinate with key members of the medical staff a policy of immediate telephone notification of critical laboratory results, such as positive blood or other normally sterile fluid and tissue cultures, isolation of highly infectious pathogens, and significant positive stain results from clinical specimens. In addition, the microbiologist and medical staff should develop guidelines for reporting antibiotic susceptibility results for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi. Periodic publication of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns for the most common bacteria can be used to guide empirical therapy. 2 The laboratory must ensure that its operation meets all current regulatory requirements (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments), including initial verification and ongoing validation of procedures that are used by the laboratory. 3, 4 Participation in external proficiency surveys, an effective program of quality control, and the use of established quality assurance benchmarks can ensure the accuracy of the laboratory test results.

Few surplus resources to accommodate these casualties exist in our current health care system. Plans for ''surge capacity'' must thus be made to accommodate a large number of patients. Surge planning should allow activation of multiple levels of capacity from the health care facility level to the federal level. Plans should be scalable and flexible to cope with the many types and varied timelines of disasters. Incident management systems and cooperative planning processes will facilitate maximal use of available resources. However, resource limitations may require implementation of triage strategies. Facility-based or ''surge in place'' solutions maximize health care facility capacity for patients during a disaster. When these resources are exceeded, community-based solutions, including the establishment of off-site hospital facilities, may be implemented. Selection criteria, logistics, and staffing of off-site care facilities is complex, and sample solutions from the United States, including use of local convention centers, prepackaged trailers, and state mental health and detention facilities, are reviewed. Proper pre-event planning and mechanisms for resource coordination are critical to the success of a response. The terrorist attacks of 2001 and the threat of large-scale infectious disease outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and pandemic influenza have revealed potentially large gaps in the ability of the health care system to find either the capacity or the special capabilities to cope with disasters that severely injure or infect a large number of victims. 1, 2 Although much current planning revolves around large-scale terrorist or epidemic events, the recent Rhode Island nightclub fire demonstrates that even a moderate-sized incident may generate large numbers of victims whose care requires supplemental staff and specialized resources and overwhelms local capabilities. 3 There is an urgent need for communities and regions, not just individual health care facilities, to develop tiered, scalable, and flexible surge capacity plans to provide care for a large volume of patients.

Decisions about the initiation and timing of invasive ventilation can be difficult, and early discussion with critical care colleagues is essential. Appropriateness of invasive ventilatory support can also require advanced discussion with patients and families. In the past 10e15 years, the role of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) has expanded, not least in an attempt to minimize the complications inherent in invasive ventilation. Indeed, NIV is now considered first-line therapy in some conditions (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary oedema, mild to moderate hypoxaemic respiratory failure in immunocompromised patients), and a 'trial of NIV' is often considered in respiratory failure resulting from an increasingly wide range of causes. With NIV, the importance of the environment (setting, monitoring, experience of staff) and forward planning cannot be overemphasized. When used for other than the standard indications, NIV should be employed in a high-dependency or intensive care setting in patients for whom invasive ventilation would be considered.",14.919051732095186,7.231024658595757

It is a medical emergency that can be alarming for the medical staff and devastating for the family. Epiglottitis clearly has not been eliminated, but due to its rarity there are concerns about a potential lack of familiarity with its management among emergency physicians, pediatricians, anesthesiologists, and otolaryngologists. 60 Up to 20% of infants with epiglottitis are misdiagnosed initially, usually with viral LTB. 4 Typically there is a short history of fever, severe throat pain, stridor, and respiratory distress, but the symptoms progress rapidly. Children become toxic and tend to sit anxiously in the classic tripod position (sitting upright, with the chin up, mouth open, bracing themselves on their hands) as air hunger develops (Fig. 23.3) . They often drool because they cannot swallow their secretions, and the voice is muffled due to pain and soft tissue swelling. Stridor may progress, and when marked (or if it disappears completely), signals almost complete obstruction of the airways. Complete, fatal airway obstruction may occur suddenly and without warning. The most serious complication of this disease process (and any infective upper airway obstruction) is hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy resulting from respiratory arrest. This tragic complication is almost always preventable with clinical suspicion, prompt diagnosis, and correct management. may be made when an air leak develops around the endotracheal tube, but repeat endoscopy may be useful to aid this decision. Again, facilities for emergency tracheostomy must be available. Some give dexamethasone before extubation to reduce post extubation stridor. 4",13.670730413482255,8.235098431030892

We have taken advantage of the rhesus macaque/SIV model to begin to initially define the pDC response in acute SIV infection. We have combined absolute blood cell counts with 5bromo-2′-deoxyuridine delivery in vivo to label recently divided cells that have been mobilized from bone marrow into blood and tissues ( Fig. 1) [24, 60] . We found that as early as 3 days after intravenous virus inoculation, pDC experience a significant mobilization resulting in a three-to sevenfold increase in pDC in blood [60] . This mobilization may be related to a systemic surge in proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α [61] , which in mouse models causes rapid pDC mobilization [32] . The increase in pDC in blood tapers rapidly, and by 14 days post-infection, blood and lymph node pDC are depleted to levels that inversely correlate with plasma viral loads. Interestingly, while the absolute number of pDC in lymph nodes decreased in acute infection, the proportion of lymph node pDC that had recently divided based on 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine incorporation increased 10-to 20fold above that seen in uninfected monkeys [60] .

Quarantine policy to prevent additional transmission of MERS, Daejeon, South Korea* Action  The cohort quarantine applied to admitted patients and their caregivers (professional or family) exposed to the MERS case-patients.  Inpatients admitted to the same hospital room before quarantine were quarantined in the same room because their degree of exposure was probably the same. Their caregivers were also quarantined in the same room because of the need for caregiving.  The medical staff (physicians, nurses, and medical technologists) exposed to the MERS case-patients were subjected to home quarantine. However, members of the households of medical staff were not subjected to home quarantine until and unless that medical staff member exhibited any symptoms. Contact between household members and the medical staff member was severely restricted.  The wards under cohort quarantine were controlled by unexposed medical staff using level D protectors (Microguard 2000; 3M, Bracknell, UK). Each protector included an N95 mask, protective glasses, a whole-body protective gown, gloves, and boots.  The body temperature of persons (including inpatients and caregivers) and medical staff admitted to cohort or home quarantine was checked, and these persons were clinically interviewed twice daily. If they reported any symptoms (including a febrile sensation or chills) or if they were asymptomatic but with a body temperature >37.5C°, they were immediately placed in a quarantined area at each hospital. The KCDC performed laboratory tests at this stage; the results were available 3 d later. If the doctor in charge strongly suspected MERS, that patient could be transferred, with careful precautions, to a national isolation hospital within 1 d.  All wards were disinfected by use of sodium hydrosulfite, 80% (vol/vol) alcohol, and 2% (vol/vol) chlorhexidine twice during each shift, thus 6 times/d.  South Korea operates a nationwide medical insurance scheme; all costs incurred by MERS patients were covered.  Persons with confirmed MERS were transferred to another quarantine room that had negative-pressure equipment. Strategies for caregivers  The infection control team carefully explained the risk for MERS and the need for cohort quarantine to all caregivers. Some caregivers did not wish to remain in hospital wards with inpatients. They were taken home and placed in in-home quarantine and used the same MERS quarantine strategy applicable to medical staff in close contact with the patients.  Caregivers attended only noninfected inpatients who required total care. If an inpatient was confirmed to have MERS, nursing care was provided by professional nurses wearing protectors.  The infection control team continuously educated caregivers on how MERS was transmitted and how to prevent infection.",27.25989549001026,10.759554110209033

All patients underwent clinical and blood tests aimed at identifying the possible pathogen. All possible close contacts with sick people were asked to visit within 24 h of onset of symptoms: in detail, 'close contacts' were considered in those who had shared rooms and people visiting patients routinely.

The implementation of the preventive measures such as air isolation, contact tracing, and active clinical surveillance of close contacts allowed to get evident decrease of the number of cases and rapid control of the outbreak within about two weeks. Interestingly, we believe that a key factor in the management of the epidemic has been the availability of an adequate ratio between the number of subjects evaluated and the size of the medical staff available.

Different strategies to expand hospital surge capacity, such as opening unlicensed beds, canceling elective admissions, and implementing reverse triage can be interactively evaluated [141] . Computer simulation modeling to assess the effect on emergency department length of stay of increasing the number emergency department beds versus altering the admitted patient departures from the ED has been used to find the optimum patient flow interventions [142] .",16.112636472108793,6.157490392265708

Respiratory infection control in the ED is challenging due to patient crowding, inadequate staff coverage, low resources, and the high proportion of immuno-compromised patients (35) . Additional challenges to compliance include the presence of trainees rotating through the department, and an increased reliance on traveling nursing staff who may not be familiar with local policy or may be overwhelmed with other tasks. In the event of a severe pandemic during which 30% of the health care workforce is expected to become ill, compliance with transmission-based precautions will become increasingly dif- ficult due to shortages in health care providers, nursing staff, and environmental services staff to provide cleaning and disinfection. Limiting factors to compliance also include logistical problems such as the number of private rooms available in the ED, the available supplies of personal protective equipment such as surgical masks, and the volume of patients in the ED. For example, one challenge during the SARS epidemic was fulfilling increased demand for personal protective equipment and biohazard bags (36) . Policies to enforce strict isolation are costly and time intensive and these policies may prevent health care workers from entering those patient rooms with the same frequency due to the burden of mask and gown use, with a potential impact on patient care and satisfaction (37) . Clearly, there is a need for solutions to the many challenges faced in properly employing CDC droplet precautions in the ED, including effective educational strategies.",19.322593532884312,11.21820399066753

A major surge constitutes the need for mass critical care. Most hospitals can accommodate a minor surge (an increase in admissions of up to 15% above normal capacity) and could probably cope with a moderate surge that requires a regional response. However, in a mass pediatric critical care situation, both local and regional resources would be overwhelmed.

ECMO has been used in the ordinary surge circumstances of the 2009 Influenza A/H1N1 Pandemic, although the adult task force did not address the use of ECMO as an option for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome/hypoxic respiratory failure during a mass critical care situation. Despite this, it was extensively used in adults during the 2009 Influenza A/H1N1 epidemic in Australasia (7). ECMO is offered in the treatment of single-system pulmonary disease, unresponsive to conventional treatment, in many tertiary care pediatric centers. The overall survival of 48% where it was used in pediatric patients during the 2009 pandemic will continue to make this a controversial issue (www.elso.med.umich.edu/H1N1Registry). The accepted standard for staffing of one ECMO patient is one nurse and one ECMO specialist per patient, as well as the immediate availability of a senior specialist in pediatric critical care. This could be altered to a single-caregiver model in the event of a surge situation. However, unlike the 2009 pandemic surge, mass critical care involves a tripling of PICU capacity with altered levels of care, which would involve one PICU nurse supervising non-PICU supplement providers caring for perhaps three to six patients. It is therefore unlikely that ECMO would be available as a therapeutic option.

Although the study is conducted in medical staff at a large general hospital, it is included here as it is being used as an early detection system for outbreaks rather than solely to prevent nosocomial transmission. The study finds that as documented fever is rare in sick leave amongst staff, passive surveillance in healthcare workers would be efficient in identifying outbreaks of febrile illness. Effective markers were found to be clustering of illness, prolonged or repeated absence from work, or the incidence of abnormally high fevers. The authors conclude that such a system is practical and likely to be sensitive in this setting should appropriate indicators be chosen, but that currently the system is not specific.

To reduce the risk of infection at an early stage, all possible methods should be undertaken, such as to restrict hospitalization, expedite discharge, prohibit visits, provide physical supplies, and provide psychological assistance. A 14-day clinical observation period is indispensable before formal hospitalization procedures. It has been suggested that an observation room outside the routine ward should be set up for isolation and observation, so as to ensure the safety of patients with mental disorders during isolation. In particular, patients who cannot control their behavior should be more carefully assessed and stricter protective constraints than usual should be implemented. The intensive use of ward beds will increase the inconvenience of emergency deployment, the potential rate of cross infections, and the error rates due to fatigue of medical staff under high pressure. Therefore, remitted patients should be transferred to an outpatient clinic as soon as possible.

However, because private pharmacies and private practitioners are less likely to be located in lower income neighborhoods, plans to make access to potentially lifesaving vaccines and drugs speedier and more equitable might, in fact, exacerbate disparities. Distribution plans may need to include mobile community health centers (staffed by nurses and nurse practitioners) that can travel to low-income areas, along with a variety of community medical and other service providers and nontraditional sites like soup kitchens, sheltered workshops, and transit points, which have become popular places for administering yearly infl uenza vaccine (40) .

Although PWH had eventually identified the index case-patient and then immediately isolated this patient and other infected carriers, a total of 239 individuals, including medical staff, students, patients, and visitors, were cross-infected with SARS in PWH due to the unawareness of this previously unknown disease when this patient was admitted (SARS Expert Committee of Hong Kong SAR Government 2003).

In case of confirmed or suspected cases of infection, the hospital management can easily and quickly trace back the contacts between people in the wards, by retrieving the data about the locations the infected patients had visited and listing the individuals who visited those places at the same times, from the ward management system.

Such cross-infection can be difficult to prevent as carriers of some deadly infectious disease may only show mild symptoms (such as fever, cough, and muscle pain) at an early stage after being infected so that medical staff are not able to identify these carriers and isolate them in the first place. The outbreaks of SARS in Hong Kong and MERS in South Korea are examples of cross-infection of deadly diseases among people in healthcare settings.

Patients reported high levels of intrusion (18.5±9.2) and avoidance (20.2±8.8). Caregiver levels were also high for intrusion (15.0± 10.0)and avoidance (17.8± 10.1). Based on clinical cut-offs,82% reported stress within moderate to severe levels. Due to care costs,74% patients depleted savings,44% downsized living accommodations; 32% caregivers worked extra jobs to help pay for care,60% reported extra stress at work. To reduce costs,49% patients delayed seeking psychological counseling. Among patients, increased intrusion correlated with having no one to help with insurance questions (p<.0001). Increased avoidance was associated with delay in seeking psychological counseling (p<.0001) and less awareness of co-pay assistance (p<.0001). 33% patients and 40% caregivers felt too overwhelmed to apply for financial help. Discussion: These data suggest that managing cancer costs is associated with clinically significant stress levels. Those with greatest need may not seek help, underscoring the need for programs that help families manage the stress related to the cost of care. The patient-provider relationship and specifically physicians' ability to communicate empathy greatly impacts chronic disease management. Empathetic communication is significant in navigating difficult circumstances like dealing with oncology patients. Unfortunately, research demonstrates that empathy declines in 75% of medical students as they advance in their training. There is growing recognition that medical education must address this decline in empathy and properly prepare physicians to work with diverse patients. However traditional educational techniques in India are unlikely to meet this need. Experiential learning may be used to address this problem.

Spurred to action by the 2002 severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak, 324 the Chinese Government has adopted a number of policies to address antimicrobial use (fi gure 13). In 2011, the Ministry of Health in China launched a campaign to promote appropriate use of antimicrobials in hospitals. 326 Following consultations with stakeholders, the government announced a multifaceted package of policy reforms. 325 Hospitals that did not meet established targets risked being downgraded and dismissal of their leadership; medical staff violating the regulations could have professional qualifi cations revoked.

However, HA-MRSA transmission occurred in >20% of intubated patients in 2004, and about half of them developed HA-MRSA infection. Analysis of our surveillance data in 2004 revealed that intubated patients had an eight-fold higher risk of acquiring MRSA than did non-intubated patients. We considered this to be because the ICU staff administered more frequent intensive care such as tracheal aspiration and body position changes to intubated than to non-intubated patients, thus increasing the chance of MRSA transmission by medical staff or equipment to intubated patients. On the basis of this analysis, we hypothesised that the use of extensive (pre-emptive) contact precautions for all intubated patients could prevent HA-MRSA transmission and infection.",15.934288771812188,8.106691633813007

Infectious disease outbreaks such as COVID-19, as well as other public health events, can cause emotional distress and anxiety. These feelings of distress and anxiety can occur even in people not at high risk of getting sick, in the face of a virus with which the common people may be unfamiliar. I read publications on ""Vicarious traumatization in the general public, members, and non-members of medical teams aiding in COVID-19 control"" and on ""Traumatization in medical staff helping with COVID-19 control"" with a great interest (Li et al., 2020; Joob and Wiwanitkit, 2020) . Li et al. reported how much people and medical staff suffer from vicarious traumatization and how this vicarious traumatization of non-front-line medical staff is more serious than that of front-line medical staff (Li et al., 2020) . As in South and Southeast Asia countries, also in Italy, there are similar problems in medical staff due to high workload and intermittent lack of protective devices. In addition, some slight form of racism is demonstrated against health care professionals who potentially have a higher risk of being infected and between non-front-line medical staff towards front-line medical staff. We don't have to forget the many doctors and nurses were infected and many of them died due to COVID-19 infection. Also in Italy, local people also have high levels of stress due to no firm estimate of how long pandemic will last and how long our lives will be disrupted or whether or not we or our loved ones will be infected. Previous research has revealed a profound and wide spectrum of psychological impact that outbreaks can inflict on people (Lima et al., 2020) . New psychiatric symptoms in people without mental illness can occur or aggravate the condition of those with pre-existing mental illness and cause distress to the caregivers of affected individuals (Kelvin and Rubino, 2020) . Most health professionals working in isolation units and hospitals very often do not receive any training for providing mental health care (Lima et al., 2020) . Barbisch et al. (2015) described how the confinement ""caused a sense of collective hysteria, leading the staff to desperate measures"". Suicidal cases were reported in India (Goyal et al., 2020) but also in other countries, Italy included, where two infected Italian nurses committed suicide in a period of a few days probably due to fear of spreading COVID-19 to patients. It is possible that fear and anxiety of falling sick or dying, helplessness will drive an increase in the 2020 suicide rates. In the United States (US), the COVID-19 Pandemic's New Epicenter, a dedicated Lifeline (the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline) was activated for emotional distress related to COVID-19 to prevent suicide.",25.25248227376497,12.058840261405354

Where this is mandated by government, it may be impossible for local staff to offer the traditional level of service. If it is determined locally, increased clinical risk following centralization could be attributed to clinicians rather than managers. Medical staff should highlight the clinical consequences from laboratory closure and try to retain on-site services if at all possible.

Results All pharmaceutical-grade products show a purity ranging from 95% to 108%. The main contaminant proteins are prealbumin, transferrin, α-1 acid glycoprotein, haptoglobulin, and retinol-binding protein. All of them are in conformity with the European Pharmacopeia specifications. The warfarin-binding capacity of the 10 albumin preparations was studied. An average binding constant of 2.6 (±0.3) x 10 5 M -1 (n = 1) was found. The presence of stabilisers reduced the binding of dansylsarcosine significantly (by 27-40%). The esterase-like activity toward pnitrophenyl acetate and the reactivity of Cys34 differed from product to product. Interesting is the absence of free Cys34 in the recombinant albumin. Conclusion Significant differences were observed between the 10 different human albumin preparations, recombinant or not. We confirm that the presence of stabilisers such as tryptophan derivatives significantly reduces the binding capacity of Sudlow's site II. Two important physiological properties of albumin, the esterase-like and antioxidant activities, were also found to be modified to different extents in all pharmaceutical-grade products in comparison with the albumin without stabiliser. The benefits of albumin administration should be considered carefully, taking into account the different functions and properties of albumin.

Only 52/87 (59.8%) could calculate the anion gap and only 1/87 listed fluid as a cause of a metabolic acidosis. Eighty-three staff (93.4%) knew that a metabolic acidosis caused an increased respiratory rate. Normal saline was the first-choice fluid for resuscitation in almost 60% (52/87) cases. The chloride concentration of normal saline was known by 12/87 staff (13.8%). The serum chloride concentration was known by 28/87 staff (32%). Conclusion The majority of medical staff prescribe normal saline as their first-choice intravenous fluid.

In many SARS-affected areas, PTSD-related symptoms are found in the population. In Hong Kong, survivors of SARS reported symptoms related to posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression. Symptom severity was associated with high perceived life threat and low emotional support. Women and participants who had a low educational level were more likely to have symptoms of avoidance.

There was initially some hesitation in South Korea in naming hospitals where MERS patients were receiving treatment. What was initially intended as a measure to protect the institution and/or its patients and their privacy ultimately proved to be a communication error: the lack of transparency led to speculation and scaremongering. The unfortunate behaviour of patients and their relatives' that was allowing MERS to spread was ultimately counteracted by providing factual information on the virus and concrete . The timing of the WHO's declaration of the situation in West Africa as a public health emergency of international concern was unanimously portrayed as too late. One reason for this delay may have been the public criticism levelled at the WHO for announcing a PHEIC for the pandemic Influenza H1N1 in April 2009. The extent of this H1N1 outbreak was smaller than initially expected. Another criticism was the lack of cooperation between the WHO and local communities during the first months of the Ebola outbreak. There was a lack of clear instructions on site as to how to deal with victims to prevent the disease from spreading across the country. Traditional and cultural customs-such as the form of interment typical in West Africa-should have become known at a much earlier stage and comprehensible information on how these practices contributed to the spread should have been provided. P eople make decisions not for apparently irrational reasons, but because they assess risk individually on the basis of various criteria. In terms of how the public perceived Ebola, the context and connotations in the media coverage were therefore important factors. Was Ebola described as a research, a medical or a social/political issue? Due to the high number of media reports worldwide, the analysis is complex and not conclusive although some surveys provide data on the public's perception and reactions.",16.348128348230986,8.912943754964951

Tel.: +886 6 9264115x3409; fax: +886 6 9264265. system motivated this research, since the mechanism could be further generalized to be an on-line surveillance system to automatically monitor a variety of emerging/notifiable infectious diseases (ENID), such as SARS and avian influenza (bird flu), if health IC cards were nationally distributed. Since timeliness is critical in preventing the spread of ENIDs and quick responses to the (possible) occurrence of ENIDs reduce infections to people and to medical institutions, many countries have their own formal mechanisms and policies for reporting and controlling such diseases. For example a 24 h delay is allowed for a medical institution to voluntarily report a suspect case to CDC in Taiwan medical institutions that a SARS or avian influenza patient contacted or visited. Thus, a mechanism to help to reduce the spread of community infection and to decrease public panic is important. This paper proposes a mechanism, named EDICTS, for emerging/notifiable infectious diseases control, tracking and surveillance, which is based on the on-line national health IC card system. A national health IC card system includes health IC cards, an IDC (IC card data center), which stores all IC cardholders' information, PoPs (point of presence) in each medical institution and a health network that interconnects IDC and all PoPs. Generally a PoP is located at the register station, the first line of all primary care practices and emergency departments. A PoP consists of a smart card reader, a personal computer connected to the health network, and related software such as HIS (healthcare information system) and smart card application programs. It is assumed that each cardholder would show his or her card to a medical staff at the registration and that CDC defines the policies and checking rules for the patterns of emerging/notifiable diseases, which are called edicts, for EDICTS. Once CDC decides to enable EDICTS, CDC informs IDC. Upon receiving edicts from CDC, IDC disseminates them to each PoP via the network. The EDICTS residing in each PoP updates the policy. Then EDICTS at each PoP automatically monitors such clinical cases (suspect case-symptomatic cases only, not confirmed yet) by constantly checking the patterns, entered by medical staff, of patients' visits. EDICTS is active in both sending information to IDC and to alerting the first-line medical staff, if a case should appear.",19.750191407959317,10.055438825633356

Thus, the findings indicate that these EVD patients had a higher mortality. There are many explanations for this observation. First, antiviral drugs specific to Ebola virus infection are not available. Second, Ansumana et al. documented a clinical experience wherein conventional intravenous fluids and empirical treatment using antibiotics or/and antimalarial drugs could efficiently reduce the mortality rate to 23.4%, 14 suggesting that supportive treatment for EVD patients as early as possible, including sufficient rehydration and electrolyte balance, plays a critical role in reducing patient mortality. However, a shortage of medical equipment for handling high-risk blood samples made it difficult to identify the severe cases and give them supportive treatment early enough to prevent dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, including hypokalemia, 15 which is frequent in EVD cases. Third, during the early days of Ebola virus infection, medical staff were presented with non-specific symptoms in EVD patients, and a higher infection rate occurred among the medical staff. In addition, intravenous fluids and blood sampling may lead to needle stick injuries, which increases the risk of Ebola virus transmission for medical staff. All these reasons led to a high rate of EVD incidence in medical staff. For example, nearly 200 doctors and nurses died from the Ebola virus infection in Sierra Leone between May 23 and October 31, 2014, 16 which resulted in tension and fear of the disease not only in the general population, but also among the medical staff. This is one of the reasons for the decrease in number of volunteers. 17 Fourth, under the hot and humid climate in Sierra Leone, medical staff wearing PPE can only work continuously for 1-1.5 h because of sweat-induced dehydration and the loss of the protection role of the PPE. This working time limitation meant that more medical staff were needed to take care of the patients; however, no further medical staff were available in the clinical setting, which increased the workload for existing medical staff. From October 1, 2014 to December 31, 2015, the study hospital was an EHC and was then designated as an ETC; however, no difference in mortality rates was observed between the EHC and ETC periods. Thus, comprehensive clinical therapeutic strategies are urgently required.",29.353478835664042,13.491139207606164

Unfortunately, many of the lessons learned and applied to the training of local personnel during the Kikwit outbreaks were rapidly forgotten and had to be relearned and reinstituted during later Ebola outbreaks in the Congo and elsewhere [43, 44] .

Hospitals should prepare to be self-sufficient for at least 7 days before outside help and supplies can arrive. Hospitals need long-term crisis management plans due to viral epidemics lasting for months. Medical staff will need to be flexible in how they deliver medical care (e.g., modified physical examinations) and, where possible, to try to develop standardized procedures based on reality of the situation (e.g., triage protocol based primarily on observation and limited exam). Supply shortages could occur due to the nature of supplies needed in a viral infection (e.g., barrier protection), the increased number of supplies needed and the extended duration for which supplies are needed. Expect a loss of staff for multiple reasons (e.g., abandoning post, illness, inability to obtain replacement staff). Expect staff who stay to do well during initial crisis, but potentially experience emotional symptoms such as psychosomatic symptoms when crisis becomes routine. Need to provide incentives and recognition to staff/volunteers to maintain morale both during and after the crisis. Provide for needs of staff and families, such as food and security.

As the Kikwit Ebola outbreak demonstrated, during massive viral epidemics, surge capacity is decreased, not increased [21, 23] . Instead of being able to render aid (e.g., personnel or bed space), surrounding hospitals were actually shut down by the government in order to prevent the spread of the infection. The ability of outside staff being used to help augment existing staff shortages rarely occurs during a true emergency since other facilities do not want to share staff and distant staff wish to avoid exposure and the risk of death. Also, a viral outbreak (i.e., avian flu) could potentially go on for months to years, making the longterm use of outside personnel impractical [21, 23] . Hospitals need to have plans in place that define how they will function for a prolonged period of time with at least a 40-50% reduction in staff [23] . Whatever plans are enacted, there needs to be provision for handling routine medical emergencies such as heart attacks, surgical emergencies and pregnancies [21] . These plans also need to make provisions that assume that other facilities will have closed and that their institution is the only functional hospital for their region.

Thus, there was a tendency to be more conservative in not conducting laboratory tests on blood samples and intravenous fluids from the patients. (3) In addition, during the period as an EHC, the lack of staff experienced in the disease, communication problems between patients and the medical staff (lack of English or lower educational level, such that some patients did not fully understand the questions asked by doctors), the lower proportion of intravenous rehydration, and the lack of laboratory tests (viral loads were available for all of the patients) further contributed to the incomplete medical records. Thus, it was a challenge for us to protect our staff from becoming infected when managing the EVD patients in Jui Government Hospital. Luckily, none of the Chinese medical team staff were infected with the virus during their clinical duties. This could be explained as follows: first, precise specifications and protocols were formulated and strictly enforced during the clinical duty of all of the medical staff to prevent virus infection. Second, the Chinese medical team staff were from the Beijing 302 Hospital, the leading and largest hospital specific for infectious diseases in China; staff at this hospital successfully managed patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during the SARS epidemics in 2003, those with A/H1N1 influenza in 2009, and patients from other epidemics. Based on this experience and expertise, we followed not only the regulations and protocols suggested by the WHO, but also proposed a series of other protocols to prevent Ebola virus infection during clinical duties. In particular, we put forward some important concepts including ''Taking off PPE is more important than wearing it in the clinic'' and ''take off the PPE in different zones, according to the rules of order''. More importantly, a supervisor monitored the process in real-time using CCTV throughout the time when medical staff were performing their clinical duties to ensure their safety .",25.031591349202774,9.368013264909816

It is important for medical personnel to see these reactions for what they are: misguided but selfprotective behaviors, manifestations of the illness (e.g., delirium) and the patient's fear of being sick. If medical staff do not appreciate the source of these behaviors, they may question their role, become hostile and experience a loss of professional identity and a breakdown of their own protective denial. (Why should some individuals place themselves at risk when they are being viewed as the enemy?) Due to this potential antagonistic relationship and the possible delirium that can be caused by the infection, doctors and support staff need to be ready to deal with agitated patients both mentally and physically.

Because the LH surge can be measured or estimated (via serial serum progestrone levels) with some accuracy, timing events with the LH surge as a reference point (day 0) can be helpful. The LH surge typically triggers ovulation within 2 days of the surge, and, if fertilization occurs, gestation is 64 to 66 days from the LH surge to parturition.",15.440279617489814,8.03877968699088

Patients decide to use medical care based on their consideration of risks and benefits. During an infectious disease epidemic, patients use medical care when they feel that the benefits of healthcare utilization are greater than the risk of infection.1 When there were concerns about nosocomial infections, those with low-acuity diseases, which are considered to have little benefits from emergency service use, were less likely to visit the ER. In Korea, due to the absence of limitations on healthcare utilization and the weak gatekeeping role of healthcare delivery system, unnecessary hospital utilization of low-acuity patients is prevalent.2829 As a result, overcrowding in a tertiary-care hospital ER caused the MERS epidemic, and low-acuity patients decreased most when the risk of infection overwhelmed the benefit of emergency service use. A study of the SARS epidemic showed that restriction of non-urgent hospital utilization during the epidemic did not increase mortality and complication rates.30 The authors of that study concluded that restriction of non-urgent visits is a safe public health strategy to control nosocomial infections and to maintain hospital surge capacity. Examining the scale of ER visits for low-acuity diseases with little benefit from service use is important, not only for preparing appropriate emergency surge capacity but also for providing evidence to redesign emergency service to decrease healthcarerelated infectious disease outbreak.",13.510320808484014,6.317010861732412

Efforts should be made to provide adequate care for both groups of patients. Multiple media reports from Wuhan and Hubei province tell the story of sick people unable to access medical care. Overflow of healthcare system will unequivocally lead to suboptimal outcome in all patients regardless of their diagnosis. Surge capacities should be prepared, in terms of infrastructures, human and material resources, procedures, and organizations. Healthcare facilities should secure extra beds and instruments (e.g., ventilators) for surge capacity. Patients who could be cared at home or at long-term care facilities should be discharged, and elective medical care could be postponed. Resources for care of patients with COVID-19 needs to be checked and stocked. While their effects are yet to be proven by clinical trials, agents such as lopinavir/ritonavir, interferon, chloroquine, and remdesivir have been used for treatment [89]. Antibiotics are expected to be administered to many patients, thus their stocks and contingency supply plan must be reviewed. Medical surge operation cannot be executed effectively by individual facilities alone. Public health authorities should coordinate joint operations to utilize limited resources in the most effective way. Designating hospitals for COVID-19 care would be more beneficial for the efficient use of limited resources and could maintain essential healthcare for patients requiring emergent or intensive management for other diseases.",15.292167236001504,9.268416231231813
An air ambulance with dedicated equipment and medical staff is the fast and efficient mode of international medical transportation,0.23032162436101694,2.4985241889953613,2.4429771900177,c5775fe9-1f45-4883-9916-933f987a88b2,noncomm_use_subset/Epidemiological and clinical profile of Korean travelers receiving international medical repatriation,"Several problems arise when transporting patients back to South Korea. First, it is illegal for Korean doctors to engage in medical activities in foreign countries. Thus, after obtaining permission from the hospital and the airline, domestic medical personnel and equipment should be prepared. Such preparation should include access to information about the patient's condition and ability to synchronize the flight schedule of the patient with availability of medical personnel. Also, the domestic hospital receiving the patient must be identified. An air ambulance with dedicated equipment and medical staff is the fast and efficient mode of international medical transportation, but extremely expensive (5–10-fold the cost of other transportation modes). In previous studies, the main causes of death among travelers were conditions associated with age, cardiovascular disease, and motor vehicle traffic accidents.[8–13] Marine sports–related injuries were the next most common cause, but the most common cause of all traumas, including death, was pedestrian accidents.[6,14–16] According to our research, air ambulances are very effective for seriously injured patients who require intensive care, and the cost of this service can be reduced if specialists operate portable intensive care equipment. In this study, an air ambulance was used twice, once upon the aggressive insistence of a family member and once when a patient was in shock. However, 12 patients who had received recommendations from foreign hospitals for air ambulance transport were successfully transferred just with stretcher of flight without fatal outcomes, because our portable equipment was adequate. These patients had already undergone all required operations, had stable vital signs, and were not in shock. The transfer time of air ambulance had been increased by not only the need to refuel often due to the small size of airplanes, but also transit problems due to use of airplane of nearby country caused by absence of airplane in patient's located country. The costs and durations of stretcher and prestige transport differed minimally when regular passenger planes were used. A stretcher required 6 economy seats. Given the 2 accompanying medical personnel, the cost of the 8 seats was almost the same as that of 3 seats in using prestige. Ship was the least expensive mode of transportation, and it was also much less stressful than air transport; however, the transfer time for this mode was very long. The ship also had certain disadvantages: the boarding time was very long, and motion adversely affected both the patients and the medical personnel. It should be noted that a short transfer time is very important for seriously ill patients. As in earlier studies, 5 patients received a recommendation to travel by ship because of the pressure problems expected after neurosurgical operations in foreign hospitals.[17,18] However, patients who underwent procedures such as vascular clipping who had experienced 3 postsurgical days without incident did not develop complications during transfer. Arranging transport prior to surgery and establishing good communication with local staff are crucial to ensuring that patients are transported as safely and quickly as possible. These arrangements also reduce costs. The most important obstacles in this process are the refusal by foreign hospitals to release patients and the refusal by airlines to let patients fly. Of course, the patients’ state of consciousness also affects the transfer time, which is associated with the abovementioned problems. However, as consciousness changes over time, it may be inappropriate to decide whether to transfer a patient by reference to only 1 symptom. We found that the required approvals followed when we personally called the medical staff of foreign hospitals or visited the hospitals; under such conditions, the obstacles vanished. Therefore, directly contacting and communicating with the specialized staff of foreign hospitals is essential for reducing unnecessary overseas hospital stays and costs. One limitation of this study was small number of cases. This is the first study on this topic in South Korea and has contributed to our establishment of a system to transport seriously ill or injured South Korean patients back to Korea.",15.217009498778909,8.537929220931108

Anxiety affects sleep quality because anxious people often find it difficult to fall asleep and may wake up frequently during sleep [27]. Also, the combination of anxiety with sleep disorders may make it difficult to fall asleep [28]. The fact that stress is closely related to sleep quality has been confirmed by a previous study [29]. Increased stress can increase the levels of vigilance regarding the environment, which will reduce sleep quality [30]. However, self-efficacy is a positive mental state that may enhance sleep quality [31]. People with high self-efficacy can maintain relatively stable emotions even under pressure, and they may experience fewer episodes of night waking, sleep anxiety, and sleep onset delay [32]. Self-efficacy also increases concentration and self-control [33]. Even though all medical staff experience pressure at work, people who have high self-efficacy are able to control their emotions and try to sleep regularly after work. Therefore, with high self-efficacy, medical staff may have good sleep quality. Anxiety has been shown to increase sensitivity to work pressure and the working environment and has a negative effect on self-efficacy because it reduces positive behaviors and initiative [34,35].",20.165054729682872,6.760306124275856

Although the decision-to-deliver interval for general anesthesia (GA) is faster than that for RA [6], RA is preferred to GA because it is safer and causes less maternal and neonatal morbidity than those of GA [67]. The other consideration in this case was spread of the infection. Although her chest X-ray and laboratory results improved, the patient had pneumonia within 2 weeks.

However, a major limitation is that the models presented here use data on physical infrastructure but do not account for staffing or ventilator supplies. Healthcare workers, especially those involved in critical care, are at high risk for COVID-19 infection and thus there may be staffing shortages that reduce the utility of the critical care beds that could be gained under surge responses. There have already been reports of hospitals being unable to accept patients, not because of lack of beds but due to lack of staff to cover those beds. Some states, like New York, are currently recruiting retired healthcare workers to assist with staffing shortfalls, an approach that might be generally applicable in alleviating shortfalls during the current epidemic. These retirees are, however, generally older and can be particularly vulnerable to poor outcomes from COVID-19. Our models also cannot account for the innovation, ingenuity and perseverance of medical staff, many of whom are trained to work in crisis situations. It is likely that medical staff will find solutions that are unanticipated by our models, that can subsequently be included as they become known and more widely applied across healthcare systems.

Our models also did not account for heterogeneities arising from specific high-risk communities in different localities.

Some cases were diagnosed in out-patient settings where medical information was briefly documented and incomplete laboratory testing was applied. There was a shortage of infrastructure and training of medical staff in non-specialty hospitals, which has been aggravated by the burn-out of local medical staff in milieu of a surge of cases. Second, because many patients still remained in the hospital, we did not compare the 28-day rate of the composite endpoint.

For Renmin Hospital sampling sites, the air circulation in MSA by design is isolated from that of the patient rooms. While for Fangcang Hospital, the nonventilated temporary PARR has limited air penetration from the patient hall where the SARS-CoV-2 aerosol concentration was generally low. We believe one direct source of the high SARS-CoV-2 aerosol concentration may be the resuspension of virus-laden aerosol from the surface of medical staff protective apparel while they are being removed. These resuspended virus-laden aerosol originally may come from the direct deposition of respiratory droplets or virus-laden aerosol onto the protective apparel while medical staff having long working hours inside PAA, as shown from the SARS-CoV-2 deposition results in ICU room. Another possible source is the resuspension of floor dust aerosol containing virus that were transferred from PAA to MSA. The two virus-laden aerosol sources also appear to correspond to the sub-and supermicron peaks found in size-segregated samples. We hypothesize the submicron aerosol may come from the resuspension of virus-laden aerosol from staff apparel due to its higher mobility while the supermicron virus-laden aerosol may come from the resuspension of dust particles from the floors or other hard surfaces. The findings suggest virus-laden aerosols could first deposit on the surface of medical staff protective apparel and the floors in patient areas and are then resuspended by the movements of medical staff. The second batch of TSP samples taken in Fangcang MSAs all tested negative with reduced number of patients from > 200 to 100 per zone and implementation of more rigorous and thorough sanitization measures in Fangcang.
