In its original formulation for an SIS model, the quasistationary state method relies on forcing the system out of the disease-free state. Every time the simulation produces a fully susceptible population, one inputs an active configuration previously visited by the system. With multipartite viruses, however, there is an additional challenge, represented by the fact that the disease-free state is not the only absorbing state. Every time the system becomes free of a specific variant (or wt) disappears from the system, it will be free of it forever. Hence, we force the system out of any state that does not contain all the v variants and the wt. The result of the simulations is shown in Fig. S.1 . ",11.222787268363703,7.939063712548359

This suggests that pandemic planning needs to take into account the possibility that staff may be absent for reasons beyond those currently anticipated in UK planning documents. In particular, staff who are physically able to attend work may nonetheless be unwilling to do so. Although there are some barriers that cannot be mitigated by employers (such as illness, transport infrastructure etc.), there are a number of remedial steps that can be taken to lesson the impact of others (providing accommodation, building reciprocity, provision of information and guidance etc).

The first is the complex, branched anatomy of the lungs and biomechanical barriers, such as the mucus layer covering the airway cells [41, 42] (Figure 2) . A remarkable feature of the respiratory tract is its high degree of branching. Airway consists of respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and alveolar sacs. All of these structures bear alveoli, the tiny air sacs in which the gas exchange takes place. It is generally acknowledged that the critical factor for efficient siRNA delivery depends on the properties of RNAi drug particles in terms of size, charge, shape, velocity and density. For efficient pulmonary siRNA delivery, the particles must be deposited in the lower respiratory tract. Deposition in the airway is affected by the particle size and patient's pulmonary function. A particle size between 1-5 μm is found to be the most appropriate for deposition at the lower respiratory tract [23] . In addition, the presence of mucus and surfactant proteins, the mucociliary clearance actions, and phagocytosis by macrophages present major barriers to targeted pulmonary delivery. Therefore, delivery systems usually require delivery vectors, and these vectors need to be designed in order to maximize the siRNA deposition to the diseased area of the respiratory tract. Besides, the extracellular barriers to siRNA delivery also depend on physiological features of the respiratory tract, which may change with the disease stage and characteristics of the patient. At the active stage of lung disease, the physiological conditions of the airways might change and have significant impact on the efficiency of the pulmonary delivery system. During infection, inflammation, and allergic reaction, there is an increase in mucus secretion along with the impaired mucociliary clearance [43] . Moreover, asthma and COPD are both chronic inflammatory conditions of the lung associated with structural ""remodeling"" that is inappropriate to the maintenance of normal lung function [44] . The airway wall thickness, the high viscosity, and the composition of the mucus layer might be altered in patients who have inflammatory lung diseases. Figure 2 . Extracellular barriers to pulmonary siRNA delivery. The anatomical feature of the respiratory tract is its high degree of branching. The mucus lines the respiratory epithelium from the nasal cavity to the terminal bronchioles. The deposited particles on the ciliated epithelial cells are rapidly cleared by the mucociliary clearance actions. Mucus and mucociliary clearance of mucus-trapped particles is a pulmonary defense mechanism as a physiological barrier. In the alveolar, clara cells and type II alveolar cells secrete on the surface of the alveolar epithelium, forming a thin layer of pulmonary surfactants. The surfactants act as the main barrier for siRNA delivery because they reduce the transfection efficiency. In addition, the macrophages located in the alveoli rapidly engulf the foreign particles by phagocytosis. The particles taken up into the macrophages are subsequently degraded inside the cells. These factors present major barriers to targeted pulmonary delivery.",13.215906333183145,9.748294265011165

As the pace of globalization and international travel increases, new diseases will continue to emerge and spread. Our best defense against these events is to have in place systems that will quickly detect their occurrence and to improve understanding of what is needed to stop them. Without effective biosurveillance systems, political leaders will have little information to guide decisions about what measures should be taken to ensure that small outbreaks don't go on to become costly epidemics and what measures would be likely to exacerbate the toll of the event. Though important strides have been made toward development of these systems in the United States, critical gaps remain, and eroding financial support for biosurveillance threatens to undermine progress made to date. To ensure it has the best information available to successfully manage the infectious disease events that will inevitably occur during the next administration, the US government should expand its support for the biosurveillance mission.",12.770417027976155,9.009948117193693

It can also be applied to identify peptides that home to a variety of cancer tissues [32] [33] [34] . For in vivo panning, phage library is administered intravenously (usually through the tail vein) into a mouse and allowed to circulate for a certain time period. The animal is then sacrificed, the desired organs or tissues are then extracted, and homogenized in saline solution. Washing to remove the unbound or nonspecifically-bound phage clones is typically mediated via perfusion of the left ventricle. The organ-or tissue-associated phages are amplified through bacterial infection and injected into another animal. After several rounds, targeting peptide motifs for specific organs are identified.

An adult LN can expand up to 10-fold during an infection (48) . Old LNs expand modestly, but never reach the cellularity seen during an adult immune response (15, 49) . During infection, chemokines and cytokines are transported through FRC networks to HEVs where they are transcytosed and displayed on the luminal side of HEVs to recruit naïve T cells (50) . Antigen-bearing DCs crawl first through LV into LN through afferent lymphatics, then along FRCs in search of their cognate T cell. Loss of LN organization and boundaries between B and T cell zones make the host more susceptible to infection (50) . Depletion of FRC in adult CCR19-DTR mice resulted in reduced responses to replication incompetent influenza A or to a coronavirus-based vector, likely due to the reduction in chemokines reaching HEVs to recruit lymphocytes into the LN, and/or a reduction in coordination of immune cells within the LN (46) . Somewhat unexpectedly, FRC depletion also had a profound negative impact on both B cell homeostasis (reduced B cell follicle size and disrupted T/B boundary), and decreased T-dependent and T-independent antibody responses.",14.127092565754417,7.965757948141075

The barriers to replication may include differences in viral receptors, mucosal barriers, signaling molecules and other mechanisms. As a result, the kinetics of viral replication and clearance in small animals are often different from natural human infection. In addition, human viral infections in small animals are mostly asymptomatic, which makes clinical correlation difficult.

This property is primarily tested in vitro in cultured tumor cells. We have learned, however, that in the native tumor microenvironment in living hosts many viruses are no longer able to infect tumor cells or to kill them even if they manage to infect them. Tightly packed tumor cells and the network of supportive molecules of the extracellular matrix form a physical barrier to virus particle diffusion. It has also become evident that the tumor cells themselves may be much more capable of thwarting oncolytic virus advances than previously thought, with some tumor cells residing in a seemingly permanent non-permissive antiviral state. Tumors harbor multiple cell types in addition to the neoplastic cells, which may promote and propagate both physical and cellular virus resistance. As the efficacy of virotherapy in human cancer patients still falls shy of the achievements in animal models, it appears quite plausible that one or more of the barriers described in this review indeed constitute a real and formidable obstacle for oncolytic virus advancement into routine clinical use.

National mink biosecurity guidelines recommend the use of effective security fences, self-closing, lockable gates, and enclosed sheds to minimize wildlife access to mink [7, 15] . Just over half of respondents reported having fences around their mink sheds/farm, although information on the types of sheds used was not collected. Reasons for not having such measures were not collected, but cost is a possible explanation. The logic for implementing biosecurity standards, specifically in mink production, is evident in the near eradication of Aleutian disease virus in Denmark. Voluntary implementation of testing, quarantine, and limited movement of mink decreased the number of positive farms from 100% in 1976 to 15% in 1996; further reduced to <5% in 2001 following implementation of additional government-mandated biosecurity measures [9] . Even if the goal is not eradication of a specific disease from a geographical area, limiting the spread of potential pathogens and preventing outbreaks of infectious disease should represent a viable goal for the Canadian mink farming industry. Despite mortality of preweaned kits being a significant cause of loss to producers, few studies have evaluated specific causes of death. In this study, we sought to estimate associations between management practices of farmers with causes of preweaned kit mortality, as well as characterizing the current state of biosecurity practices of the Canadian mink farming industry.

Similarly, restricting movement during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 reduced the risk of infection for everyone [3] , though at the cost of some inconvenience to each individual. However, in the worst case a particular action does not only go against an individual's wishes but actually causes harm to that individual. For example, some uninfected individuals with flulike symptoms could have been put at increased risk of infection with SARS if they were forcibly held in quarantine during the outbreak [4] .

This has substantial implications for public health educators and planners in implementing pandemic preparedness plans. It was evident that the knowledge score was the main predictor of the attitude and practice scores with strong correlation between knowledge and practice scores and knowledge and attitude scores. On the other hand, attitude scores alone did not predict practice score and the correlation between attitude and practice scores was weak. This shows that good knowledge is important to enable individuals to have better attitudes and practices in influenza risk reduction. In a previous study on SARS, better knowledge was also found to equate with better adoption of precautionary practices [6] . Clear communication and provision of updated information also helped improve vigilance and preparedness during the current pandemic [11] . A recent study found that educating the public about specific actions to reduce risks and communicating about the government's plans and resources helped to improve compliance to good practices [9] . Of interest, higher educational status in our cohort was a significant negative predictor of good practice, showing that educational status alone does not determine behaviours. Two previous studies on influenza [9] and SARS [2] also showed that education level did not have any effect on uptake of recommended behvioural patterns. Regarding influenza vaccine uptake and education level, some studies have showed that a higher education level resulted in higher influenza vaccination uptake [20, 21] , while another study on influenza vaccination uptake showed varying influence of education levels on influenza vaccination in different countries [22] . As such, it is important to focus on inculcating the correct knowledge to individuals as it will influence both attitudes and practices. On the other hand, positive attitudes on its own may not translate into desired behavioral change in the absence of adequate knowledge. For the exposure groups, influenza cases had the highest practice scores of all 4 groups. Use of masks was also highest among the influenza cases. Having been infected with pandemic influenza appears to have a substantial impact in behavior and adopting risk reduction practices. Although most if not all of these influenza cases will not be re-infected by the same pandemic virus again, adopting these practices will place them and their close contacts at lower risk for other influenza and respiratory virus infections.",13.450268706741344,6.690443555883411

Thus, we can eliminate from figure 4a the biologically irrelevant curves of transcritical bifurcations emerging from the DBT point in order to obtain the boundaries between Regions I, II and III shown in figure 4b. The DZH bifurcation occurs at the simultaneous intersection of two curves of Hopf bifurcations associated with v 2 and v 3 and the curve of transcritical bifurcations involving v 2 and v 3 . As predicted from linear stability analysis, the Hopf bifurcation curve associated with the wt-free state v 2 does not depend on the infection rate of the wt virus a w and thus appears as a straight line given by a m ¼ 1.55. Emanating from the DZH point is a curve of TPO bifurcations. To better understand the dynamics that occur near the DZH point, one-dimensional bifurcation diagrams are obtained by setting a w ¼ 8 and treating a m as a bifurcation parameter and then setting a m ¼ 2 and treating a w as the bifurcation parameter. The resulting diagrams are shown in figure 5 , with open circles denoting unstable POs. Figure 5a shows that as a m is increased from zero when a w ¼ 8, the wt-free state v 2 first undergoes a transcritical bifurcation with the virus-free state v 1 , then a subcritical Hopf bifurcation, and finally a transcritical bifurcation with the coexistent state v 3 . None of these bifurcations change the stability of the equilibria. Thus, the associated curves of transcritical and Hopf bifurcations in figure 4a do not represent boundaries between the five characteristic regions and are not shown in figure 4b. For these infection rates, all of the equilibria are unstable and the dynamics are therefore determined by the stability of POs. For sufficiently small values of a m , the system is in Region V, and there is a stable PO around the coexistence state v 3 . This PO is created by the Hopf bifurcation that defines the boundary between Regions III and V shown in figure 4b. As a m is increased, the unstable POs around the wt-free state v 2 that emerge from the subcritical Hopf bifurcation grow in size. Eventually, this unstable PO collides and exchanges stability with the stable PO around v 3 through a TPO bifurcation at a m ¼ 2.3972. During the TPO bifurcation, the stable and biologically meaningful PO around v 3 becomes unstable and some components enter negative phase space. Afterwards, the PO around the wt-free state is stable and the system is in Region IV.",13.812326257092023,6.682735224199089

As a result of this variation, we are unable to provide a numerical tabulation of the numbers of health departments that struggled with each gap or displayed given strengths. Second, because we did not employ a methodology that could conclusively assess change over time, we cannot be certain that the improvements we identified were truly reflective of improvement, and not due to the inclusion of more sophisticated health departments in the latter part of our exercise period. We doubt this is the case, however, given the national emphasis on preparedness and planning and the ways in which health departments participating in later years qualitatively described their improvement. Furthermore, similar observations regarding improvements in public health preparedness during the same time period have recently been reported by others [24, 25] . We also cannot asses the potential influences that external events (e.g., hurricanes, outbreaks) may have had on health departments during the time period of our work, but it is noteworthy that all exercises were concluded before Hurricane Katrina struck.

Visible actions representing typical flu-like symptoms include sneeze and cough that are associated with changing patterns of hand to head distances, among others. The technical difficulties lie in the high complexity and large variation of those actions as well as numerous similar background actions such as scratching head, cell phone use, eating, drinking and so on. Results: In this paper, we make a first attempt at the challenging problem of recognizing flu-like symptoms from videos. Since there was no related dataset available, we created a new public health dataset for action recognition that includes two major flu-like symptom related actions (sneeze and cough) and a number of background actions. We also developed a suitable novel algorithm by introducing two types of Action Matching Kernels, where both types aim to integrate two aspects of local features, namely the space-time layout and the Bag-of-Words representations. In particular, we show that the Pyramid Match Kernel and Spatial Pyramid Matching are both special cases of our proposed kernels. Besides experimenting on standard testbed, the proposed algorithm is evaluated also on the new sneeze and cough set. Empirically, we observe that our approach achieves competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-arts, while recognition on the new public health dataset is shown to be a non-trivial task even with simple single person unobstructed view. Conclusions: Our sneeze and cough video dataset and newly developed action recognition algorithm is the first of its kind and aims to kick-start the field of action recognition of flu-like symptoms from videos. It will be challenging but necessary in future developments to consider more complex real-life scenario of detecting these actions simultaneously from multiple persons in possibly crowded environments.",12.712470003405553,6.963018864347308

For example, several participants tried to untie the mask because they thought it would be safer to remove that way, though some admitted that in practice they would probably rip the mask off. However, most participants described using both strategies to doff gowns and typically did not see much conflict or tension between them. While ripping gowns was not perceived as inherently unsafe, some participants described difficulties ripping gowns off in a controlled manner or described other barriers (see Cognitive Processes and Barriers and Facilitators). For gloves, most participants described only doffing safely; they mentioned expediency (or lack thereof) only in reference to alternative glove doffing methods (eg, the ""beak method""), which they rarely use in routine practice.

As for the system architecture, an assessment mechanism is first used to diagnose the current condition of the building. Second, an optimization mechanism adopting GAA* is developed to optimize renovation strategies within several constraints. Finally, a simulated vacant school building converting to a public community hospital renovation project is introduced to validate the proposed system. The solutions suggested by the system are shown to be superior to the results from the project decided by the hospital managers, not only in budget utilization, but also of quality improvement. In this study, reusing and renovating vacant buildings can not only be helpful to reduce energy consumption within the buildings, but also be friendly to the environment and beneficial to nearby communities. Although the proposed system demonstrated its robustness and efficiency for decision-making, the system still had certain limitations. First, the system is developed for hospital managers, and most of them are non-experts in architecture/engineering/construction fields; providing a simplified method for current condition assessment and restoration actions is necessary. This simplified process, however, might cause the system to be incomprehensive. Second, the system was only tested by hospital buildings; although the data modules and interfaces of the system provide managers with great flexibility to clarify, modify, and customize the assessment criteria and renovation strategies to apply to different building types, future efforts to examine its feasibility on different building projects are highly suggested. Third, the system paid more attention to environmental sustainability issues, renovation actions resulted from functionally spatial adjustment were not considered. Finally, only general specification of materials, resources and equipment for hospital buildings were included in the system; future research could continuously expand practical or specific data to establish a more integrated decision support system.",12.439926277425585,8.66994342584346

Each annual meeting aimed to analyze the state-of-the-art of important themes in the field of vaccines and expand the vision for the years to come. The participation of excellent speakers and expert discussants ensured the high quality of the meetings, whose conclusions were published in international journals (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) . The meetings were organized close to a popular event, the horse race named ""Palio di Siena, "" for which the town is worldwide famous. Thus, those meetings were called the Palio Meetings. More recently, with the acquisition of the vaccine company in Siena by GSK, the venue of the meeting was moved to other locations in USA and Europe, but the traditional name was maintained. The topic of the meetings can vary but the mission is always based on one or more of the following pillars: (1) must define the state-of-the-art of cutting edge topics related to infectious diseases; (2) must advocate science policies to promote progress and improvement in human health; and (3) must be a strategic forum aimed to build new initiatives. Table 2 reports the topics of the Palio Meetings during the years. It was therefore almost mandatory that the subject of the 2017 Palio Meeting should be on the growing emergency caused by antibiotics failure, with the title ""Prioritizing vaccines to fight antimicrobial resistance. "" This event shortly followed a meeting organized by David Salisbury on 2017 March 29-30 at the Chatham House, in London (25) . The London meeting provided a clear consensus that vaccines complement the actions of antibiotics and can contribute to control, reduce, and sometimes eliminate diseases caused by AMR pathogens, more than any other intervention. Thus, the main scope of the 2017 Palio Meeting was to build on the conclusions of the London meeting, and posed the question of how can we make vaccines achieve their full potential and become one of the top tools to tackle AMR. Indeed, the discussion led to conclude that there is a need to make stronger, more evidence-based cases supporting the importance of vaccines in AMR prevention (24) .",12.688239745627872,8.023233384207746

Gerrard et al. [37] explained that perceived personal vulnerability is usually depicted as a necessary (but insufficient) motivator of precautionary behavior. In the case of disease, perceived vulnerability refers to the extent to which individuals feel that they would acquire some disease. According to Brug et al. [34] , not only the perceived ability to avoid SARS, but also one's ability compared to others, influences the perceived risk of acquiring SARS and the worry about contracting the disease. In an empirical study, Tang and Wong [33] found that elderly participants who perceived greater personal vulnerability to SARS were more likely to adopt SARS-preventive behaviors.

In contrast, when continual introduction of AIV from wLBMs contributes to prevalence levels in rLBMs, as is likely the case, rigorous decontamination (100% efficacy) is only 50% effective at decreasing environmental contamination when decontamination occurs as often as weekly ( Figure 1B, right) . The constant influx of infected birds leads to conditions where decontamination must occur more often than weekly in order to reduce environmental contamination by more than 50% Figure 1B , right).

A guiding principle for development of the tiers is that the provision of usual critical care, when able to meet demand, is always a preferred approach. When it becomes apparent that the risk for harm to all critically ill patients has exceeded baseline, response in isolation is discouraged, and attempts to muster additional resources must be undertaken. Barbera and Macintyre 19 proposed six layers of ""health and medical response management across intergovernmental and public-private divides"": (1) individual hospital, (2) health-care coalition, (3) local jurisdiction, (4) state response, (5) interstate regional response, and (6) federal responses. When it is determined that activities of a given layer remain insufficient to reduce the risk to critically ill patients, then assistance from the next layer should be requested. For everyday care, variation from best-care practices is undesirable and not deliberately permitted (tier 0). During small critical care expansions (eg, boarding critically ill patients in postanesthesia care units and EDs), most if not all usual critical care practices remain intact; and at most minor departures from best-care processes may occur (eg, frequency of patient turning may decrease). This is tier 1, and it occurs frequently during multiple casualty events 44 as well as periodically in many US communities as a result of occasional small surges in critical illness in the community. This does not represent EMCC, and expectations of high-intensity resource commitment for patient needs persist. It is not uncommon when EDs or ICUs are over capacity for other departments in the same hospital to be unaware of the ongoing crisis. When crucial patient care functions are at risk, an individual hospital may recover rapidly by declaring an intrafacility disaster and activating its hospital command center 43 to mobilize adequate space and supplies and necessitating adaptive critical care strategies for a short-term period (hours) [see Summary of Suggestions from the Task Force for Mass Critical Care Summit, Fig 1, 2] .",14.535087929236404,9.284011853857466

The agreement relies on signatory states to then make appropriate laws, and provides justification for state laws which derogate from patent-holder rights in circumstances such as national emergencies.

Although coagulation can reduce the concentration of pathogenic microorganisms, filtration and disinfection are the primary barriers. Filtration is the main barrier for the removal of waterborne protozoan parasites and enteric pathogenic bacteria. Virus removal is enhanced by coagulation, but filtration cannot be totally relied upon because of the small size of viruses. Thus, disinfection becomes the main barrier for viruses. Use of membranes (e.g. ultrafiltration, nanofiltration and reverse osmosis) in the water treatment processes can cause large reductions in all classes of pathogens, but are not absolute barriers for pathogen removal.

According to the maxim, each of us is obliged to treat others in the same moral way in which we would like to be treated. This idea signifies the importance of self-discipline and propriety as a way to live, and this empathetic notion is the norm in the social context (Confucius, 1938) but is also applicable to industrial practices.

As such, health is a unique, local commodity, inextricably tied to communities and States. It is international insofar as its protection depends upon more than one State's actions. It is also increasingly being framed as global in practice: from the WHO through to the current focus on universal health coverage (UHC) and the Framework Convention for Global Health (FCGH). Health critically depends upon the implementation of systems based in and on State capabilities, notably with regard to services such as maternity care, as well as on surveillance at and across borders, as is the case with transnational threats such as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and H5N1 (avian influenza).",12.073953348352454,8.095661637469012

One important mechanism to help prevent transmission is the use of telemedicine. This technology, already utilized by numerous large health care systems around the world, is ideal in public health crises as it allows for patients to be triaged while minimizing exposure of patients and health care workers to potential infection. Additionally, telemedicine provides an opportunity for specialists that might not otherwise be available to evaluate patients. While there are currently barriers to the widespread implementation of telemedicine such as coordination of testing in patients triaged as high risk, this is a technology that will likely prove important to promote viral containment (86) . Other essential principles are to minimize non-essential/non-urgent in-person provider-patient interactions as much as possible (i.e. social distancing), and limiting elective cardiac catheterization, operating room and echocardiographic procedures. If such procedures are necessary, the number of required personal should be kept to a minimum. (38, 89) .

Most pathogens that are excreted into the environment usually die. However, some of them reach fingers, fluids, new hosts such as flies, and floor or surfaces that are used for food preparation or eating. From any of these sites, pathogens may reach food and infect a new human host. All these transmission routes can be blocked by changes in domestic hygiene practices (Curtis et al., 2000) . This model envisions two types of barriers to reduce disease transmission. Preventing transmission at the level of the primary barriers prevents the entry of the pathogens into the environment, and these initiatives are the most effective interventions to prevent disease transmission.

Specifically, core HBM components of perceived threat, perceived benefits and barriers, and environmental cues contributed an additional 20.3% of the variance in volitional health behavior of facemask-wearing; whereas these components accounted for only 9.2% of the variance in habitual health behaviors. These findings may be explained by individuals' deliberate evaluation process. Most psychosocial models, including the HBM, suggest that deliberate evaluation of the threat related to the disease as well as benefits, barriers, and cues surrounding specific health behaviors are crucial in predicting whether or not an individual practices a certain health behavior [12, 36, 37] . In this study, consistent facemask-wearing was novel to most Chinese adolescents in Hong Kong and required active evaluation of these psychosocial factors before they decided to practice such behavior. As mentioned, cues to wear facemasks were not only targeted at individual adolescents but were also available in adolescents' social network through their parents and teachers [33] .

A question is then, why right now? We argue that a rich ""humus"" was supplied by the current scientific, cultural, and socio-demographical context of industrialized countries which has dramatically changed the relationship between humans and disease. In this context, individuals frantically demand ""predictability"" during a pandemic event [38] or ""rationally"" refuse a vaccine-the invention that has protected so much human life in the last hundred years. In short, technology has turned us from victims of nature per se to victims of our own actions locked in a feedback loop with natural forces. This is why it is now that studying BE is important, and we expand on this in the following paragraphs. Until 1750 the millenary fight between man and disease-the third horseman of the Apocalypse-is the story of a long-lasting unperturbed ecological equilibrium. During this fight human behavioral responses to infectious disease threats always took place, as is documented by the great writers, from the Athens' ""plague"" described by Thucydides, to the Black Death whose visit to Florence was immortalized by Giovanni Boccaccio in the ""Decameron,"" to the seventeenth-century plague described by Daniel Defoe and Samuel Pepys, and two centuries later on by Alessandro Manzoni (Fig. 1) . However, most these responses are reported by historians as taking place at the community level (e.g., enforcing quarantine of sick individuals and also of goods [97] , or closing the city gates, 1 and mass migrations-especially by rich people-toward the country 2 ), so that individual actions, though reported, were usually perceived as minor and passive. Most of all these actions, collective or individual, were lacking any scientific basis. 3 Most importantly, these actions were unable to mitigate plague epidemics or to perturb the ecological equilibrium between man and disease: infectious diseases continued to impose a major and intractable health burden on populations worldwide for several millenniums.",14.097803885180312,9.546228403899566

Regarding the biophysical conditions as climate conditions, and natural and built environment, a barrier underlined was the unpredictable occurrence of outbreaks due to the climate change. Main barriers identified within the Health System were the lack of material resources and capable personnel; that public health priorities are hardly ever included in vector control, programs discontinuity, lack of preventable initiatives and lack of budget allocation. Other factors different from health with a great impact in prevention deal with garbage collection, education or built environment, and traditionally do not prioritize public health problems and also may lack of resources. Governance level barriers relate to discontinuity of programs, lack of budget allocation, the absence of effective functional link between political decisions and experts' recommendations, and lack of programmatic coordination with local government.

The first model, which is also called the Prisoner's Dilemma, is applied under a scenario of a static game with perfect information. Two players, I and II, acting in a rational way with full knowledge of the possible payoffs to each other, choose a compromise dominant strategy that results in the best payoff for neither individual. The second model applies to the case of a dynamic game with imperfect information. In this scenario, the players take their later actions based on the imperfect information at hand, assign probabilities to the actions already taken by others, analyze the respective payoffs that result from their responses to such possibilities, and make continuous observations and due adjustments through several trial games to achieve the equilibrium status.

The solution boundaries are expected to be located close to where their cost is low, i.e., where g s is small. Hence, we try to avoid placing the boundaries of selection regions there and let the remaining pixels not covered by any selection region snap into the best boundary location. We use homogeneous image regions for the B k , which can be derived from super-pixels (Vedaldi and Soatto, 2008; Comaniciu and Meer, 2002) or from an image oversegmentation using a watershed method (Vincent and Soille, 1991) . Formulation (3) is more general than a direct super-pixel segmentation (e.g., one can use seed regions covering only a subset of the image to guide the segmentation while having complete representational freedom close to putative segmentation boundaries). To define the B k , we use quick-shift (Vedaldi and Soatto, 2008) to find super-pixels and erode them so that they do not touch the potential segmentation boundaries. Quick-shift is an efficient mode-seeking algorithm based on medoid shift (conceptually similar to the popular mean-shift segmentation algorithms Comaniciu and Meer, 2002) . It provides a tuning parameter to control under-and over-fragmentation of modes and can therefore be used to indirectly control the number of selection regions to be detected. Our method is not dependent on quickshift, and other clustering methods such as mean-shift or k-means (Jain et al., 1999) could be substituted. Fig. 2 shows an illustration of the selection regions. In addition to the max-flow method addressed in this paper we expect this approach of facilitating area-constraints through selection regions also to be generally useful for other segmentation methods.",13.770178164402864,8.251089286681093

However, some lack of knowledge was noted in the topics of precautions relating to contact isolation, airborne isolation, and when a negativepressure room should be used. These findings might highlight a defect in curricula in nursing schools and continuous education programs in the participating hospitals. It is consistent with previous studies who revealed poor student nurses' knowledge regarding infection control practices. 17, 21 Several factors contributed to the nurses' lack of knowledge in some topics; one of these was dissatisfaction with the content of the infection control educational courses during their studies. 23 Other factors included a shortage of well-designed infection control programs that targeted health care workers during their clinical practices. 24 Although nurses in this study showed acceptable knowledge about isolation precaution, their compliance was poor. The results show that few nurses reported that they followed standard isolation precautions (52.7%). In addition, few nurses were observed following standard isolation precautions (20.2%) and transmissionbased isolation precautions (11.9%). These findings confirmed that nurses in Jordan were not strictly complying with activities that protect them from the transmission of infectious diseases. Our finding is consistent with the Al-Rawajfah et al 17 study that revealed nurses in Jordan have low compliance to infection control practices. The researchers revealed that the lack of resources is a major barrier for compliance with infection prevention guidelines among Jordanian nurses. Other barriers from the literature that could not be measured in our study include heavy workload 11 and lack of safety climate. 25 Also, the Nmadu et al study 26 reported that lack of supplies and organizational structure were significant barriers to nurses' compliance with isolation precautions.",12.259773368173189,7.8799778859681595

First, an important assumption is that all of the players in the game are rational, which means that each player pursues the welldefined exogenous objectives that are most preferable to him or her, based on his or her knowledge and/or expectations of the behavior of the other players (Dixit & Nalebuff, 1991) . It is on this assumption that a game can be divided into two branches, namely, a cooperative game, in which the sets of possible actions of individual players are jointly made with others, and a non-cooperative game, in which individual players make decisions separately based on their own interests. It should be further noted that cooperation can and often does arise in non-cooperative models in situations in which the players find that being in a coalition is in their own best interests (Turocy & von Stengel, 2002) . Second, in terms of the sequence, the game can be further classified into a static game, in which the players take simultaneous actions, or a dynamic or repetitive game, in which the actions are taken in sequenced orders. A strategic or normal form is introduced to study a static game, whereas an extensive form, or a game tree, is applied in dynamic game research. Finally, turning to the information component, a game can be categorized into a perfect information game, in which any player at the point of making a decision possesses complete knowledge of the moves of the other participants, and an imperfect game, in which the players are not well informed of one another's actions.",14.01881869972968,7.685887532625877

The system learns a MaxEnt(Maximum Entropy) model from the training data, based on a simple feature set that combines UMLS(Unified Medical Language System) knowledge with information gathered from the EMR text. Software maintenance: Information retrieval techniques are being exploited by an increasing number of tools supporting software maintenance activities. Identifiers are among the most valuable sources of information for software maintenance. When a programmer introduces an abbreviation (e.g., rect) as an identifier, the difficulty of understanding the identifier is increased. Corazza et al. [31] proposed a method of automatically splitting identifiers into their composing words and expanding abbreviations. The solution is based on a graph model and performs linearly in time with respect to the dictionary size. Because only complete words are considered in the identifier, multi-word abbreviations cannot be handled effectively, but this approach regarding identifiers is the most commonly used. Alatawi et al. [32] proposed a Bayesian unigram-based inference to expand abbreviations automatically into their original words to enhance source code maintenance. In this technique, a list of candidate words is extracted automatically from the source code for a given abbreviation and the statistical properties of the unigram of the abbreviation are employed as evidence to find the best candidate word. Due to the use of the unigram model, this approach cannot be utilized to address abbreviations that are expandable into phrases. Alatawi et al. [12] presented a bigram-based approach that could be used to expand an abbreviation into a phrase automatically with multiple unigrams. In this method, the abbreviation is firstly divided into segments. Then, the candidates for each segment are generated, where the candidates consist of the sequences of full forms of segment. Finally, the best phrase is chosen from the phrase candidates according to the bigram language model (LM).",12.165071797547439,5.0942515564582695

This might be applicable from an internal view (being healthy), or an external one, such as the view from public health that concerns community (that is, conditions for being healthy). An 'unhealthy' state can be explained by a pathogen or other kind of destabilising event that impacts or creeps into a biological system, resulting in an altered, often unwanted and endured state. This might be the presence of a virus in an individual, or even the conditions (opportunities and barriers) of healthy living. Public health often takes a similar focus, aiming to create healthy circumstances and conditions for people by focussing on the determinants of health. In this respect, OH uses health as an inclusive determinant, such that it includes actions that are broad in orientation and scope, so that health activism ought not be limited to human agents. OH is therefore an investigation of the scientific, social, economic and ecological determinants of human, non-human and ecosystem health, but also a 'shared benefit' approach. Our use of 'shared' points to ethical consistency; that actions that affect a broad spectrum of agents should be fairly applied. Just as racism is paradoxical in human societies, some exclusionary actions between human beings and non-human animals might be similarly judged as speciesistic. This echoes ideas of equality, and the interests of minorities or the vulnerable being protected against parochial or vested interests. It also befits an examination of incongruity, need and fairness, and justice-these components of comprehensive doctrines are only knowable through ethical study, and in this respect, we are less confident in setting the OH agenda, for such a task requires far greater elucidation than is possible here.

In the best case, these calculations and the underlying studies may be used as convincing evidence that no action is needed because the process is able to remove and inactivate the contaminant. This can be of critical relevance for influenza vaccines where a seed virus strain cannot be readily exchanged by another strain, and when timeconsuming measures to remove adventitious agents may no longer be possible if a contamination is detected late during the annual vaccine-manufacturing period. Modelling the whole process may also help to identify where virus exclusion tests are needed, for example, for those viruses that grow to high titres and cannot be adequately removed or inactivated. Moreover, virus titres calculated for each relevant step of the entire process can also indicate where such exclusion tests are useful and where they are not. For example, from Table 3 it can be seen that an exclusion test for adenovirus would not be appropriate for the modelled process if it were to be conducted at the bioreactor harvest stage, or further downstream, because the expected worst-case viral titre would be below the method's detection limit. Conversely, the calculations show that testing for reoviruses may be useful to identify any contaminating reovirus, although the comfortably high safety margins of the risk assessment indicate that such measures are not absolutely necessary. The calculations presented here validate the capacity of the cell culture-derived influenza vaccine manufacturing process to remove and/or inactivate any type of potential contaminant, and it can be concluded that the risk of exposure to adventitious agents in vaccines produced in MDCK 33016 cells, using the specific manufacturing processes, is negligible.",15.679012427113081,7.096064007563957

Professor Fidler, a lawyer, from Middle America uses the recent outbreak of respiratory infection caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS) as a model for examining the rights and wrongs of current legal powers and how structures may change to encompass future threats. He parallels public health with international relations following the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, which ended the Thirty Years War. This landmark treaty enabled European states to overrule the views of a single country and laid the basis for future international relations and eventually the UN and World Health Organisation. I think this analogy is rather overplayed but the book does give some good historical insight into how countries have fought the threat of infections that cross their boundaries. The phrase 'germs are epidemiological phenomena; passports are political phenomena' is catchy but does not add to the commonly heard mantra that infectious diseases do not respect international boundaries. In the author's view 'Westphalian public health' is exemplified by the WHO International Health Regulations which were created in 1951 but have never worked and are increasingly abandoned by many countries failing to report outbreaks for fear of economic repercussions and richer countries using their own methods of surveillance and control. SARS nearly became a worldwide epidemic and the rise of new strains of influenza A virus present a possible major global emergency. In the post-SARS world international health relations have improved even if that cannot be said of political relations. The Chinese authorities appear to have learnt from their mistake in declaring SARS as a potential problem early enough to prevent spread via Hong Kong to many other countries in Asia and in particular to Canada. I recommend this book to anyone thinking about the barriers to communicable disease control across boundaries.

This will likely generate new studies on their impact on patient and population health. As these studies are planned and executed, our review suggests the following. First, we note a general dearth of rigorous study designs. Better designed studies that follow the Good Evaluation Practices in Health Informatics (GEP-HI) [161] and are reported using the Statement on Reporting of Evaluation Studies in Health Informatics (STARE-HI) guidelines [162, 163] will support future efforts that can more rigorously systematically review and synthesize outcomes. More rigorous review and synthesis will provide stronger evidence that many policymakers seek as they contemplate policies and funding beyond initial investments in eHealth systems [164] . In addition, given a rich dialogue in the Discussion sections of many articles on the barriers and facilitators of adoption, we suggest that future research more rigorously examine the implementation of ICT in LMICs. There exists a growing body of implementation science literature in the developed world [165, 166] , which would be strengthened by contributions from LMICs if implementation were more rigorously studied in parallel with outcomes. Furthermore, we observed that many studies involve partners from multiple universities, research institutes, and countries with diverse funding streams. Finding harmony across fragmented stakeholders appears to be a goal of the applied work taking place in these LMICs, yet this is not emphasized as a measurable component of research in the current body of literature.

Our account points to the significance of research that is sensitive to ways of working with risk 'proximity' as an ongoing spatial and temporal achievement. Here, we have highlighted how different imaginative practices have the effect of pushing away physically close hazards, but also how events or presences seemingly managed or absenced by such practices, or simply distant in time and space, can return as haunting reminders of what once was or might yet be, and which in turn therefore continue to mediate experience. Our analysis has, for instance, specifically highlighted the active production of silence as a recurring theme in the existing literature -that is, the apparent absence of anxiety, although often belied by a residual ambivalence towards the source of risk. Our account certainly does not proffer a generic framework to explain such silences but instead questions the premise that we can define, measure and account for risk experience as a stable (social, cultural or psychological) phenomenon. We have therefore sought to elucidate a number of ways in which silence is actively performed 4 Contra the impression of a stable or fixed 'hazard personality' given by psychometric research on the characteristics of technological hazards (e.g. Slovic et al., 1980) . through simultaneous practices of absencing/presencing many facets of risk (Zonabend, 1993; Mort and Michael, 1998) . More sustained attention to these practices of silence would not only furnish insights into the everyday experience of technological hazards but would also expand our spatial conceptions of the constitution of risk subjectivities. Indeed, we suggest that, from an analytical perspective, existing explanatory frameworks might usefully be extended and developed through an engagement with the ideas about the spatial practice of proximity we have outlined here. Research might, for instance, explore the ways in which contrasting risk configurations (in terms of spatial, temporal, politicaleconomic or material features) elicit different patternings of subjective proximity (i.e. practices of absencing and presencing). Such work might well provide more nuanced insights into how issues of trust relations, peripherality and dependency, place and identity impinge on the everyday experience of risk. Indeed, as discussed already, much research fails to directly acknowledge the role or implications of spatial practices or the contingency and even contradiction associated with them. In light of such transitory and fluid qualities, we therefore stress the need for further research directed less towards developing fixed categories, measures and typologies and more towards opening up this enlarged concept of risk proximity.",12.797844779734449,6.461596171344938

Below we consider the fact that the epidemic is though to have started in October 2004 as an additional qualitative constraint. The best fit trajectories for cases and fatalities are shown in Fig. 1 , together with the data points, while parameters are displayed in Table 2 . These estimates predict an incubation time and lifetime of the infective state to be on the shorter end of their allowed ranges and mortality at the higher end. The contact rate is high leading to a large basic reproductive number, which measures the expected number of new cases caused by the introduction of an infective individual in a population of susceptibles. Given the population conditions, the high infant mortality due to the disease, and cultural practices of care for the ill and deceased we believe these numbers could not be excluded. This estimate predicted that the outbreak was then nearly over. The number of new infected cases was dropping in time. Its final state would be reached around May 9, with a total number of cases of 276 and 261 deaths. The upper end of the 95% confidence level intervals, shown in Fig. 2 , would take these numbers up to 304 cases and 287 deaths by May 9-10.

An earlier phase of modernity was organized primarily in terms of nationstates, which sought to manage many of the risks people faced, although markets and other phenomena did cross state boundaries. 2. Modern social and political theory grew with the dominance of nation-states and internalized the nation-state as the tacit model for the ideal-as-societyinfluenced by the actual power of nation-states, but also by the widespread aspiration to organize the world on the basis of nation-states. 3. An earlier philosophical cosmopolitanism developed in Europe in this context, calling on people ethically to transcend narrow nationalist views, as though the sociological conditions of their lives did not really matter. 4. Today we have to make a clear distinction between the norms of cosmopolitanism (which you find as a normative concept already in the sociology of Auguste Comte and Émile Durkheim) and the facts of cosmopolitization which are a genuine issue of empirical-analytical social sciences. Cosmopolitan sociology neglects the Durkheim/Parsons model of 'value integration' of national society. It neglects also theories which declare the death of the social. But it emphasizes the transformation of the social and a new methodological cosmopolitanism to study the ambivalences of the cosmopolitization of intermediated institutions. 5. The same applies to the international level: consider global free trade and financialization, corporate deterritorialization and transnationalized production, globalized labour use, internet communication, globally orchestrated bio-scientific manipulation of life forms and, last but not least, globally financed and managed regional wars. As stated earlier, recent world history seems to dictate that surviving these new civilizational forces, let alone benefiting from them, requires every nation to actively internalize them and one another. This is what I call '(reflexive) cosmopolitization'; and the civilizational condition shared across the globe I call 'reflexive' or 'second modernity'. 6. I do not see the nation-state as disappearing, but rather see it as only one of many actors in a global power game. The focus needs to be on that global power game and not on the nation-state. Importance could accrue to regional powers like 'Cosmopolitan Europe', ('Cosmopolitan Asia' etc.). 7. Such a shift in focus requires the restructuring of the social sciences not only conceptually, theoretically, and methodologically, but also in the very organization of research. All their fundamental concepts-especially those of social class, family, work and the nation-state-need to be re-examined. Many are 'zombie concepts' that continue to live on even though the world they related to at one time no longer exists. 8. Cosmopolitan sociology is just at its beginnings. It entails more questions than answers [British Journal of Sociology 2006, 57(1); 2010, 61(3); Soziale Welt 2010, 61(3-4)]. But it does involve a fundamental re-organization of the social sciences, and a dramatic shift in focus-from methodological nationalism to methodological cosmopolitanism. And it must also be critical in its orientation. One critical focus must be on the increasing inequality in the world and its social explosiveness. The focus on the nation-state has led to a shameful subordination of 'objective' and 'value-free' sociology to the imperatives of the nation-state which blinds even empirical sociology to the fundamental transnational transformations of domination and inequality. 9. Another critical focus: problems of social inequalities and justice in first industrial nation-state modernity were once pursued and fought over as the 'goods' of modern society (things like incomes, jobs, social security etc.); in the cosmopolitical age, those 'goods' are off-set by conflicts over the 'bads'. These include the very means by which many of the old goods were in fact attained. More pointedly, they involve the threatening and incalculable side effects and so-called 'externalities' produced by nuclear and chemical power, genetic research, the extraction of fossil fuels, and the overriding obsession with ensuring sustained economic growth. The social and psychic volatility wrought by cultural relativism, on the one hand, and recognition of risk, on the other, generate an enormous discontent, which in turn inspires various political and social movements for reform and resistance.",13.394646219095712,9.145069474069668

National boundaries draw a sharp distinction between politically relevant and irrelevant inequality. Inequalities within national societies are enormously magnified in perception; at the same time inequalities between national societies are faded out. The 'legitimation' of global inequalities is based on an institutionalized 'looking the other way'. The national gaze is 'freed' from looking at the misery of the world. It operates by way of a double exclusion: it excludes the excluded. And the social science of inequality, which equates inequality with nation-state inequality, is unreflectively party to that. It is indeed astonishing how firmly global inequalities are 'legitimated' on the basis of tacit agreement between nation-state government and nation-state sociology-a sociology programmed to work on a nation-state basis and claiming to be value-free! My point is that while the performance principle legitimates national inequality, the nation-state principle legitimates global inequality (in another form). How? The inequalities between countries, regions and states are accounted politically incomparable. In a perspective bounded by the nation-state, politically relevant comparisons can only be played out within the nation-state, never between states.

First reason of a lack of incentive is the problem of the financial costs and benefits. Implementing hospital-wide safety practices requires considerable financial investment [10, 11] . Although these costs may be theoretically offset by savings associated with improved care and fewer adverse events [13, 14] , in practice these savings are rarely apparent to hospital administrators [4] . Few measurement tools have been developed to accurately gauge the impact of safety programs [7, 15] , limiting the ability of hospitals to definitely link safety practices with improved patient care. Second barrier is concerned with public perception. A lack of data on hospital safety frequently limits the number of choices patients have in selecting a hospital, such that hospitals without safety programs are not necessarily penalized by reduced patient volume. The high cost and limited hospital benefit of patient safety programs makes the decision to implement rigorous safety practices extremely difficult.",12.623878799407802,6.957027535523169

When considering incentive programs, policy makers must understand the factors that influence the spread of system-level activities to improve patient safety. One such factor may indeed be financial considerations, and it is possible that the issue of patient safety might be a low priority for those who manage hospital finance [7, 12, 16] . A second factor that may play a role in the increase of patient safety measures is the presence of dedicated full-time staff for patient safety and infection control. It is clear that the presence of dedicated full-time infection control nurse have had success in implementing systematic infection control programs [17] , which in turn have led to reduced rates of nosocomial infections [18, 19] . While it remains difficult to evaluate the impact of patient safety programs on outcomes such as decreased adverse events because of lack of evaluation tools and difficulty in measuring rare outcomes over short time periods for small samples of patients with progressive diseases [15] , the utility of employing this type of dedicated staffing as a mechanism to expand patient safety practices can be assessed. The Institute of Healthcare Improvement breakthrough collaboratives, for example, examined the presence or absence of implemented prevention programs in hospitals as a measure of outcome [20] . Finally, hospital size and infrastructure may influence the amount of safety programs. Because the financial investments involved in patient safety systems are development and maintenance costs, rather than the costs of safety practices for each individual inpatient, the economic burden associated with patient safety might be disproportionately large for small hospitals. In fact, there is evidence to suggest that there are economies of scale in the cost of patient safety and infection control programs [10] .",12.858295467654127,6.751730576659977

While to the best of our knowledge, there has been no study that investigates the change of adverse events (which may be impossible due to the difficulties in identification of adverse events), some studies that focused on other indicators such as morbidity, failure to rescue and hospital-acquired infection have been reported. However, even these studies provide little evidence to suggest that the healthcare system is safer today than it was in 1999 [3] [4] [5] [6] . Small improvements in healthcare safety have not yet been reflected in national statistics [7] , suggesting that further work is needed to protect patients from adverse events [8, 9] . Considering that public regard for patient safety issues have risen since 1999 in Japan and other countries including the United States (US) [1, 10] and the state of implementation of patient safety systems in Japan is similar to that of the US [11] , the phenomena in the US seem to be similar to the state of patient safety in Japan.",14.553627020063892,6.708381213823968

It is now feasible to directly study and modify a major reservoir of DCs in peripheral lymphoid tissues of mice. To do so, antigens are incorporated into antibodies that selectively target to DCs, currently antibodies to an endocytic receptor, DEC-205/CD205. With these engineered antibodies, there is greatly enhanced presentation in vivo on MHC class I and II products. Simultaneously, it is important to control DC maturation state. Appropriate stimuli can differentiate DCs and render them immunogenic, whereas in the steady state, most DCs are immature and can induce peripheral tolerance. These in vivo antigen targeting strategies are now being pursued to better control the induction of tolerance to autoantigens, and the induction of immunity to microbial and tumor antigens. DC function can also be studied with ex vivo approaches. A broadly recognized mechanism for peripheral tolerance induction involves regulatory or suppressor T cells. It has become apparent that DCs induce and/or expand these regulators, including CD4+ CD25+ suppressor T cells. We find that DCs serve as presenting cells to expand antigen-specific suppressors ex vivo, and that the expanded cells efficiently control the development of diabetes in NOD mice. Although this field is just beginning, we would like to suggest that more direct consideration be given to DCs in the design of therapies for autoimmune disease.",12.812685716479464,9.365356059784993

Healthcare organizations review emerging information from country and state public health organizations, develop and modify existing policies and procedures, identify methods of educating health professionals about the emerging disease, modify EHRs/DSS, deploy screening and develop HIT related strategies that facilitate communication among the members of the healthcare team.

Each node, which has a number of states, contains a conditional probability table (CPT), which specifies the conditional probability of the node being in a specific state given the state of its parent nodes. For example, the BBN built here represents the relationship between diseases and biosecurity practices. Given specific biosecurity practices, the BBN uses Bayes' rule to calculate posterior probabilities of disease occurrence.

Firstly, we assessed how the state of each biosecurity practice independently altered the probability of disease. To do this, the state of each biosecurity practice was altered in turn (i.e. setting one state to 100% at a time) and the probability of disease was recorded. We then calculated the relative risk (RR) of each disease compared to the steady state BBN; for example, a change in the probability of PRRS from the steady state of 15% to 18% equals a RR of 1.2.",13.917465288183353,7.502994868715049

There was no discussion of actions that domestic poultry farmers or the poultry industry could take. Further, much of the media coverage stated, or at least implied, that Australia would be well prepared to handle a potential pandemic. Finally, a high proportion of articles suggested that appropriate treatments were currently available or would become available in time, thereby implying that Australia had the ability to ameliorate the effects of an avian pandemic. Thus, by inference, members of the general public may have felt that it was unnecessary for them to undertake simple preventative actions (such as increased hygiene) when a pharmacological treatment or a vaccine would be available to avert a pandemic.",12.207330286272953,6.732797253051407

It may be difficult or impossible to assess the contribution of any one action (energy level for defibrillation, airway maneuver, drug) on the most important outcomes, such as neurologically intact survival to discharge. In fact, it is likely that it is the combination of actions, each performed correctly, in time and in order, that results in optimal survival and function. A few studies give insight into this necessary shift from studying of changes in individual actions (point improvements) to studying the effects of changing the entire sequence of actions (flow improvement). 21,22 The compression-ventilation ratio was one of the most controversial topics of the 2005 International Consensus Conference. The experts began the 2005 conference acknowledging that rates of survival from cardiac arrest to hospital discharge were low, averaging ≤6% internationally, 23, 24 and that survival rates had not increased substantially in recent years. That observation led to the 2005 change to a universal compression-ventilation ratio for all lone rescuers of victims of all ages and to an emphasis on the importance of CPR quality throughout the 2005 Consensus on CPR and ECC Science With Treatment Recommendations (CoSTR) document and subsequent ILCOR member council guidelines. 25 Resuscitation outcomes vary considerably among regions. 26, 27 In recent studies the outcome from cardiac arrest, particularly from shockable rhythms, is improved.

Rosenau introduced the idea of 'governance without government' (Rosenau and Czempiel 1992), maintaining that governance 'regimes' composed both of States and NSAs would form to tackle specific issues in the international realm. NSAs have long been engaged in shoring up or tearing down State sovereignty, with (Hösle 2003) or without the consent of the State. While on the one hand a tension exists between theory and practice of State sovereign obligation with regard to human security, it also means that though threats to human security abound on the part of both State and NSAs, precedents likewise exist for mitigating these to the benefit of human security. To a large extent, Rosenau has been proven correct: if NSAs are included, then a plethora of organizations exist dedicated to treating HIV/AIDS, providing water and sanitation, and even administering public transportation in municipalities around the world. However, these are not regimes in the sense that they have a central organizational structure, that their interventions are legally binding, or that any mechanisms are in place to ensure the continuation of their work if and when they opt out. This is not a central theme of Risse's work, which focuses on 'areas of limited statehood' (Risse 2007) . Here NSAs might perform functions theoretically if not in practice associated with State responsibility for human security. Yet they are not bound to such actions, for instance, of service delivery and health care. Critically, instead of shoring up States' lack of capacity, NSAs have contributed to the fragmentation of their power-including their ability to guarantee traditional and human security:",12.729963737745686,8.542232844538352

For example, the average dairy herd size for California in 2016 was 1,249 milking cows, with herds up to 10,000 milking cows, whereas the latest report on dairy cattle management practices published by USDA categorizes herd sizes with more than 500 cows as large (California Department of Food and Agriculture, 2016; USDA, 2016a). Other differences include California's climate, which allows for year-round outdoor housing of calves and cattle, which is impractical in many parts of the country (Lago et al., 2006) . Climate and dairy management practices in California are not homogeneous across the state, however. As an example, in 2011, California held 22.6% of the nation's organic dairy cows, most of which were found in the northern part of the state . It is clear, that the development of a risk-assessment tool for California dairies cannot be based on national averages but should be based on data collected from within this unique industry. The objective of our study was to identify factors associated with BRD in preweaned calves on California dairies by correlating management practices on California dairy farms to prevalence of BRD in calves exposed to these practices. Our hypothesis was that BRD is associated with management practices related to risk factors for BRD, such as the amount of colostrum and milk fed, housing type, and vaccinations. The research described here is a further step in the development of a risk-assessment tool for BRD in preweaned calves on California dairies following the survey of management practices related to BRD in preweaned calves on California dairies (Love et al., 2016a) .",12.81412278164021,7.883850605209739

By the end of 2005, there were 149 low-standard HCW disposal facilities in operation in China, distributed throughout different areas. According to the National Hazardous Waste and Healthcare Waste Disposal Facility Construction Plan, 331 modern, high-standard, centralized facilities will be built up in China in municipal level cities. Although incineration is still the main technical option for HCW disposal in China, it is expected that, especially for medium and small size facilities, non-incineration technologies will develop quickly and will soon become the main technical option. The basic management needs -both from the point of view of pollution control and final disposal -have been defined, and a system of technical and environmental standards has been formulated and implemented; however, there are still some shortages. This is particularly true when considering the best available techniques and best environmental practices developed under the Stockholm Convention, with which the present technological and managing situations are not completely compliant. In this framework, the lifecycle (from generation to final disposal of wastes) of HCW and holistic approaches (technology verification, facilities operation, environmental supervision, environmental monitoring, training system, financial mechanism, etc.) towards HCW management are the most important criteria for the sustainable and reliable management of HCW in China.",11.801677925017712,5.9322299479638865

Results: Crisis guidelines were found to have 4 generic barriers to adherence: (1) lack of imperative or precise wording, (2) lack of easily identifiable instructions specific to each profession, (3) lack of concrete performance targets, and (4) lack of timely and adequate guidance on personal protective equipment and other safety measures. The cross-sectional study also yielded profession-specific sets of often-experienced barriers. Conclusion: To improve adherence to crisis guidelines, the generic barriers should be addressed when developing guidelines, irrespective of the infectious agent. Profession-specific barriers require profession-specific strategies to change attitudes, ensure organizational facilities, and provide an adequate setting for crisis management.",14.750803520354662,10.780414086108964

These unprecedented alliances are eroding physical and political barriers and opening up new opportunities for growth and change. 2 Widespread infections like HIV, H5N1 virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and most recently H1N1, demonstrate the need to tackle health issues globally rather than locally. 3e6 In addition, initiatives like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDG), the Global Fund and the United President's Emergency Fund for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) have in different ways dramatically increased awareness of the state of global health. The poor state of health care delivery in many parts of the world and widening global health disparities increasingly are considered national security priority issues in many high resource countries. 7, 8 Tackling the global burden of disease will require improvement in accessibility to health care and the reversal of the disequilibrium in global health research investment that allots over 90% of the available funds to health problems affecting only 10% of the world population. 9 Furthermore, there is urgent need to develop innovative therapies and expand access to current therapies against diseases like the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (TB), and numerous emerging infectious diseases that pose major threats to the health of people in both resource-limited and resource-rich countries. 8 The discovery of these interventions and their accessibility will depend on the extension of clinical research studies to previously underrepresented populations across the world. 9, 10 The conduct of such clinical studies at these international sites, especially in developing countries obviously are fraught with numerous challenges that require patience, an understanding of the local culture, and a firm determination to do the right thing.

In veterinary medicine, zoonoses present a risk to practitioners, yet little is known about how these risks are understood and how this translates into health protective behaviour. This study aimed to explore risk perceptions within the British veterinary profession and identify motivators and barriers to compliance with IPCs. A cross-sectional study was conducted using veterinary practices registered with the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons. Here we demonstrate that compliance with IPCs is influenced by more than just knowledge and experience, and understanding of risk is complex and multifactorial. Out of 252 respondents, the majority were not concerned about the risk of zoonoses (57.5%); however, a considerable proportion (34.9%) was. Overall, 44.0% of respondents reported contracting a confirmed or suspected zoonoses, most frequently dermatophytosis (58.6%). In veterinary professionals who had previous experience of managing zoonotic cases, time or financial constraints and a concern for adverse animal reactions were not perceived as barriers to use of personal protective equipment (PPE). For those working in large animal practice, the most significant motivator for using PPE was concerns over liability. When assessing responses to a range of different ""infection control attitudes"", veterinary nurses tended to have a more positive perspective, compared with veterinary surgeons. Our results demonstrate that IPCs are not always adhered to, and factors influencing motivators and barriers to compliance are not simply based on knowledge and experience. Educating veterinary professionals may help improve compliance to a certain extent, however increased knowledge does not necessarily equate to an increase in risk-mitigating behaviour. This highlights that the construction of risk is complex and circumstance-specific and to get a real grasp on compliance with IPCs, this construction needs to be explored in more depth.",12.835268474378326,8.463119403387456

It may be through the drug delivery system using passive action on infected cells via the mononuclear phagocytic system, which may enhance the therapeutic index of the antimicrobial along with a reduction in side effects (Park et al., 2015) .

Regarding bacterial infections, the development of resistance against antibiotics is the major problem in antimicrobial therapy (Basnet and Skalko-Basnet, 2013) . Resistance to antibiotics occurs for the following three reasons: (1) modification of the active sites of drug-binding proteins, (2) destruction or modification of the antibiotic by the enzymatic mechanisms of the organism, and (3) activation of the efflux mechanism for the antibiotic by the organism (Borges-Walmsley et al., 2003; Arenz and Wilson, 2016) .",12.684978651233985,8.868325935333933

This kind of knowledge transfer is aided by a pragmatic capacity to represent and model consequences of different actions, and these different approaches are useful under different circumstances.

A compilation of current literature strongly suggests that to slow the development of resistance to antimicrobial agents it is optimal to use drugs with more than one mechanism of action or target, to prescribe those with demonstrated ability to minimise or reverse resistance problems, and to avoid underdosing of potent antibiotics. The most recent information also indicates that it is best to limit empirical use of b-lactam plus fluoroquinolone combination therapy, since these two classes activate some common resistance responses, and using them together can facilitate multidrug resistance in important pathogens, particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species.

They are the principal actor in the political process of tourism development (Bramwell, 2011) . The governments may be in a position to offer incentives or impose requirements on actors to alter their behavior so as to promote sustainability (Bramwell, 2011) .

The role of government has to change from a steering role to one that engages with and manages partnerships (Beaumont & Dredge, 2010 Political economy concerns how politics affects choices in a society. It is a useful concept to understand how the political and economy conditions of a society shape the power relationship among key actors (Jessop, 2008) , especially the capacity and role of a government (Pierre, 1999) . The political economy approach starts from the proposition that the state is a ""social relation"" and is ""socially embedded"" (Jessop, 2008, pp. 1, 5) . The politicaleeconomic environment of a city establishes parameters and legitimacy for local political interaction and decision-making, especially the role of government in the decision-making process (Digaetano & Klemanski, 1999) . Conditions created by a particular politicale economic environment produce opportunities for developing certain governing alignments (alliances and power structures) while imposing constraints on others. According to Jessop's strategicrelational approach to political economy, actors are reflective and are capable of taking a strategic view of the structural constraints and are able to select their specific actions within those constraints strategically. Therefore, ""the strategic choices of actors and organizations in the state are likely to be affected by the structural pressures in a specific society, including the broad economic and socio-cultural change and the lobbying by actors in civil society"" (Bramwell, 2011, pp. 468e469) .",15.336204642212575,9.128714052791064

Hence all vaccine adjuvant safety assessments are subjective in nature.

They argue that the complex history of the indigenous communities in Canada presents unions with a challenge distinctly different from organizing other historically underrepresented groups since Aboriginal peoples have an inherent right to self-governance. They outline the efforts of two national public sector unions as they approach organizing and representing Aboriginal workers in two broad categories of workplaces: workplaces that are not located on recognized Aboriginal territory or in the north and/or are owned and managed by settlers, and workplaces that are either Aboriginal owned and managed and/or are located on recognized Aboriginal territories or in the north. Union activities in the former have primarily involved drawing connections between a colonial past and present day inequalities to address racism in the workplace and labour market while in the latter, largely non-unionized, organizing has been the priority. Mills and Clarke hold that as unions are guided by principles of social movement unionism and indigenity, alternative models of organizing evolve that ultimately extend the boundaries of union activism.

A husband's neglecting/abandoning her if diagnosed with breast cancer is a woman's greatest fear and barrier to screening/early detection, a major reason for rising breast cancer morbidity and mortality in Malaysia. Thus, MENCARE!, focusing on men advocates to empower women for breast cancer screening, has been implemented. MENCARE! trains men working in public and private corporations to provide support for women's breast cancer screening. Project effectiveness was evaluated by assessing changes in policies and procedures in one public agency and changes in men's knowledge, attitudes on breast cancer, and actions to support women's breast cancer screening, using multistage pre & post advocacy evaluation design with mixed Methods: One month and one year post-training evaluation of 75 male advocates through questionnaire surveys and 3 focus group discussion (FDG) were conducted. In-depth interviews were conducted with 5 management personnel pre and one-year post advocacy. Organisationally, while existing health package within the agency still did not include breast cancer screening, it would support all cancer treatment 100% at the one year post-advocacy. The flexible time-off procedure for male staff needing to support spouse/family for breast cancer screening continued a year later. ""Many of them have gone for screening"" was observed by one personnel interviewed one year post-advocacy. Request for a mobile mammography clinic on-site was made by management a year later. Individually, the training increased male staff's knowledge of breast health, cancer and screening in certain though not all aspects. The training increased their willingness to be involved in all types of support for women: to discuss/motivate women to get early and complete treatment, to prepare types and levels of support. Yet, men expressed some problems: lack of awareness/ exposure to what is commonly regarded as a women's disease/ problem; embarrassed to talk about women's breasts; lack of screening facilities and medical insurance, especially in rural areas; and men's busy work schedule. Buying in of public or private corporations and targeting male support at the work-place appears strategic in addressing women's delayed or low uptake of breast cancer screening through changes in organisational policies and procedures as well as individual changes in knowledge, attitudes and support actions. Once a health intervention is proven effective at a technical level, the steps required to generate a delivery system that produces positive health outcomes are nontrivial and poorly understood. For governments, the political environment often precludes experimentation or data-driven decision-making at the program level. Particularly in HIV, the political processes often fail to serve those most at risk, the socially marginalized. We explore the Bill and Melinda Gates' Foundation's novel approach of building a large-scale HIV prevention program in India, called the Avahan Initiative, through partnerships with NGOs, small-scale delivery experiments and rigorous data collection, to then transition to the government, to understand its effectiveness as a strategy to yield scientific programming and policy nationally.",11.104328008631857,8.041466494648652

Machine Learning Approaches for Prediction of Mouse Life Span,"Machine learning approaches vary considerably in terms of their complexity, performance on easy versus difficult tasks, and the ease with which investigators can apply these methods. We have carried out a performance evaluation of many machine learning approaches for the specific task of predicting mouse life span, which provides guidance for future studies addressing this issue. It should be borne in mind that, for any algorithm, performance is data-dependent and will vary across contexts. It is therefore impossible and incorrect to identify a single ''best algorithm'' that will always yield the best predictive performance (20) . We anticipate, however, that any survivorship data set containing life-span-predictor variables will share some properties with data analyzed here. For instance, some level of ''overlap'' between mice belonging to different life-span quartiles seems inevitable, such that accurate predictions will require recognition of complex decision boundaries (see Figures 1 and 2) . The best algorithms identified in our analysis were most successful at characterizing such decision boundaries, and therefore provide good starting points for future investigations aimed at prediction of mouse life span. We found that life span was accurately predicted by SVM and SLDA algorithms, but that the NSC approach provided the best overall performance. This algorithm was developed in the context of DNA microarray data sets and was used to classify cancer subtypes based on gene expression patterns (29) . The approach is also straightforward to implement and can be understood by nonexperts. It is computationally inexpensive, as 10,000 simulations can be carried out in ,1 hour on a standard desktop PC; other algorithms listed in Table 2 required as much as 2 days for execution using the same hardware. The method is similar to the Nearest Centroid approach, which uses p predictor variables to obtain a p-dimensional centroid for each life-span quartile, and predicts life-span quartile for new cases by determining which centroid the test case is most similar to. In the NSC approach, however, class centroids are standardized and ''shrunk'' toward an overall centroid (calculated by averaging centroids among life-span quartiles), which has the effect of emphasizing those predictors with low levels of variation in each class (see 29) . This yields a classification rule characterized by complex, nonlinear decision boundaries, which has been found to perform well on challenging machine learning tasks (29, 46) .",14.752965346490138,7.70930337849277

Machine Learning Approaches for Prediction of Mouse Life Span,"Machine learning methods vary considerably in their complexity, and it is uncertain for any particular application which algorithm will provide the best overall performance (20) . The best algorithm depends on the quality of predictor variables and the ''decision boundaries'' that best distinguish mice belonging to different life-span quartiles ( Figure 1 ). If quartiles are clearly separated by linear decision boundaries, simple algorithms may predict lifespan quartile with high accuracy (see Figure 1A ). In contrast, if quartiles can only be separated by complex, irregular decision boundaries, accurate prediction of life-span quartile will require more sophisticated algorithms (see Figure 1B ). We therefore applied many algorithms to determine which approaches provide the best results for prediction of lifespan quartile ( Table 2 ). The manner by which algorithms generated predictions varied considerably among the different methods. Some algorithms generated predictions by constructing regression models (simple linear regression, multinomial logistic regression), whereas others constructed decision trees or sets of classification rules (e.g., binary decision trees, random forest, Ripper rule learner). Other algorithms fit probability models to mice associated with each life-span quartile, and used posterior class probability as a basis for prediction (e.g., naive Bayes). In some cases, predictions were generated in nonparametric fashion without construction of a formal classification model (e.g., k-nearest neighbor, nearest centroid, nearest shrunken centroid [NSC]). All algorithms were implemented using the R statistical software package. Specific functions of the R extension package used to implement each algorithm are listed in Table 2 , and full descriptions of each package and function can be accessed online (http://www.r-project.org/).",16.66231046906773,7.566894085974319

Hence, territorial practices cannot be reduced to the historically specific mode of territorialisation at work in the formation of modern state territories. Instead, territorial practices have to be conceived of in a broader sense: by 'carving the environment through boundary-drawing activities' (Brighenti 2010a: 60) , they 'enable the production of functions, the management of distances and the setting of thresholds between events' (Brighenti 2010b: 223) .

I include a brief review of antibacterial drugs and personal experience with bacterial resilience mediated by horizontal gene transfer. Chapter 6 shifts focus to cancer as a threat to human health. Personal experience in discovery of novel therapeutics for the treatment of leukemia forms the body of the chapter. The spontaneous resolution of AML in children with Down syndrome highlights human resilience and the foundation for optimism in finding a cure to leukemia. Chapter 7 is a review of chemicals in the environment as a threat to human health. Brief examples of chemical carcinogenesis are included to illustrate how chemicals disrupt genomes. Historic research ignored RNA damage as a transient an irrelevant consequence of chemically induced nucleic acid damage. The emergence of important forms of RNA and their possible role in resilience is proposed.",12.439544442057628,7.948902774816757

For example, many of the same countries profiled as top destinations for medical tourists seeking care are also profiled on the American College of Surgeons Web site link (www.operationgiving back.facs.org), where health care professionals at all stages of their surgical career can Medical Tourism search for opportunities to volunteer as the other type of medical tourist, the health care worker who travels to provide medical care. New Orleans is also on the list of destinations, and as the Web site is open source, international surgeons could consider volunteer opportunities in the United States best suited to their expertise and interests here. However, regardless of their level of skill, physicians and surgeons interested in providing medical care in other countries may face legal barriers regarding licensing, structures that have been put in place to establish standards with the goal of protecting patients. Health care that involves invasive procedures is not without risk even in developed countries. The recent investigation of hepatitis C at an endoscopy clinic in Las Vegas has demonstrated how standards are necessary but not sufficient, even in developed areas. 77 Recognition of the common source and subsequent gaps in basic infection-control practices were possible because, as a result of vaccination, rates of hepatitis in the United States have declined to the point where individual cases can be investigated. 78 These public health and legal checks and balances provide valuable insight but also add to health care costs, 79 and although outbreaks receive wide attention, the majority of cases of hepatitis in the United States are now imported by travelers from developing parts of the world. 78 It has been said we live in a global village. Medical tourism demonstrates how dynamic the boundaries of the village seem to be and how transit between countries, particularly between country of birth and country of residence, affects health in both areas. The patient having a check-up before visiting a child studying abroad may also plan to have major dental procedures and be of an age to have missed both natural exposure and vaccination programs for hepatitis A or B, be unaware of prevalence rate and vaccination practices at the destination, and be convinced that he or she can tell whether the facility is safe just ''by looking,'' particularly when significant cost savings are at stake. The field is changing constantly; some international sites now describe care not just for adults but children, particularly for what are perceived as cosmetic procedures, such as orthodontics. 22 Physicians should either be familiar with up-to-date sources of information (eg, www.cdc.gov/travel) or referral options, and inquire whether or what role travel plays in their patient's life.",13.340500900049275,6.8298737616486775

VFC is a state-operated federal entitlement program that provides free Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices-recommended vaccines to children 18 years of age or younger who are uninsured, Alaska Native or Native American, eligible for Medicaid, or receive their vaccines in a federally qualified health center. 77 At the state level, funds are earmarked for vaccine purchase and immunization programs. 35 State funds also have been used to purchase vaccines for children and adolescents not eligible for VFC. A combination of VFC, state/local, and Section 317 program funds (i.e., VFC only, VFC and Underinsured, VFC and Underinsured Select, Universal, and Universal Select) has been used by a number of states to purchase all recommended vaccines for children in the state, including the privately insured. 78 Many states use universal programs that expand the eligibility for VFC vaccines by supplementing VFC purchases at federally discounted prices. The universal purchase states have been successful in raising vaccination rates among the underinsured 79 and increasing access to newer and more expensive vaccines for children without insurance. 75 However, criticisms of the universal purchase programs have been raised, including (1) vaccine manufacturers' claims that universal purchase programs unfairly provide for the purchase of all vaccines at lower government contract prices, thus eliminating the private market for vaccines and decreasing revenue; (2) although immunization charges are reduced under this program, patients still pay for the vaccine administration fee; and (3) some contend that taxpayer money should not be spent to provide free vaccines for children whose insurance would otherwise pay for it. 79 State Medicaid and State Children's Health Insurance Program funds also are provided for vaccine purchase, although the level of Medicaid funding varies from state to state.",14.376986679822743,9.070091321157108

Politically, in the case of UNITE-HERE, there are limits to its Schumpeterian unionism as practiced. While UNITE-HERE in general, and Local 75 specifically, have been viewed as successful examples of union renewal (see Schenk, 2005) , it is inaccurate to characterize these efforts as any significant movement toward social movement unionism. Instead, union strategies reflect a re-territorialized neoliberal economy and state as they actually exist on the ground. The experience with HWRC did create a space for Local 75 to engage with the state and begin to consider new spaces in which it can shape the development of the accommodation sector in Toronto. The union is, however, participating in the creative destruction process as it advocates turning crises into a skills upgrading opportunity. While this is common, the local and sector specific nature of the union's demands in this case limit broader social reforms and even the possibility of a shift toward a movement based unionism. UNITE-HERE's proposal of limited reforms to address the crisis is in keeping with the neoliberal state's transition away from universal welfare provisions. In the end, these demands for relatively small reforms were not even met and the limited funding for the HWRC was a small investment for the state. Establishing a program that fosters flexibility and shifts the responsibility to adapt to crises to workers is simply a variant of neoliberal labour market policy. While the HWRC had some success, it was largely localized resistance. Instead of arguing for broad changes or 'why can't Canada be more like Sweden?', the union settled for 'why can't Toronto be more like Las Vegas?' Such a Schumpeterian approach by UNITE-HERE is expected given that the strategic potential to (re)regulate the local labour market through such a centre and the new spaces for engagement created by the re-scaling of state economic development strategies. Such strategies are, however, unlikely to inspire a mass social movement needed for economic transformation (or even much needed national employment insurance reform).

In the presence of cognate CD4 T-cell help, these vaccine specific B cells start to expand. 30 Some of the activated B cells differentiate into plasmablasts whose function is to secrete an early protective wave of antigen-specific antibodies. 30 In a primary vaccination, those early antibodies are mostly IgM and bind to the vaccine antigen with a relatively low affinity. A subset of the activated B cells will continue expanding forming specially organized structures in the secondary lymph nodes known as germinal centers (GCs). 30 GCs are where vaccine-specific B cells with the highest antigen binding affinity are preferentially selected and also where the majority of antibody isotype-switching from IgM to IgG and IgA occurs. 31 Antibodies can protect against viral infections via several ways:",12.089672672541345,8.29637134246726

While obviously not providing causal process accounts, counterfactuals have a strong bearing on the plausibility of arguments about avoidance and may thus usefully be employed to explain choice between a limited number of options. 62 For the WHO, the problem with discursive contestation stemmed from the fact that the immediacy of the SARS crisis and the perceived necessity to react swiftly and assertively stood in conflict with the tenacious struggle among member states on how to reform the IHR and thus give expression to a normative shift in global health governance. In the reform process, the WHO itself had been a part of the argumentative interaction, openly promoting the norm of global health security and thus discursively contesting the sovereignty norm. 63 But when the SARS outbreak began, the norm was not yet established. If it were not to stand idly by while the SARS crisis unfolded, the WHO would have to take a course of action which was incompatible with the sovereignty norm for all practical purposes.

According to the Oxford dictionary, safety is defined as the condition of being safe; freedom from danger, risk, or injury. Safety can also refer to the control of recognized hazards in order to achieve an acceptable level of risk. In terms of work, this mainly concerns physical aspects of the work environment. However, the changing nature of work was associated with the emergence of new types of risk relating to psychological and social aspects of the work environment. This brought about greater focus on health at work. A very influential definition that shaped thinking and action in subsequent years was the World Health Organization definition of health as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity (World Health Organization [WHO], 1948) . This definition promoted a more holistic view of health away from a mere focus on physical aspects towards considering social and mental health aspects. Although the WHO definition already referred to a state of well-being, definitions of well-being include additional dimensions to health, such as social, economic, psychological, and spiritual. Well-being refers to a good or satisfactory condition of existence; a state characterized by health, happiness, and prosperity. Obviously achieving this state is not relevant to the workplace or work alone but rather an overall evaluation of one's life across many areas. As such, actions to improve HSW can be taken within the work context and outside of it. Actions taken in the workplace represent workplace interventions that are implemented in the work setting and consider the characteristics of work environments and workers. On the other hand, actions taken outside the workplace represent public health interventions that are implemented in various settings (for example, in schools, communities or countries) and take into consideration the characteristics of particular populations.",13.208429667941394,8.903886160013162

While every individual is responsible for their own actions in various contexts of life, in a specific setting like the work environment, additional responsibility lies with the employer since the work environment will expose workers to particular work characteristics that might in turn pose a certain level of risk to their HSW. While employer responsibility might be formalized under law, this is not the case across countries or in relation to all possible types of risks to workers' HSW, and in particular new and emerging risks, or risks that are either new or gain in prevalence with the changing nature of work. Accordingly, it is important to consider not only legal duties that employers have towards their workforce but also ethical duties that will extend beyond legal compliance. In addition, while employers bear a legal responsibility towards their workforce, they also bear responsibility towards society. This has meant that enterprises have increasingly been held accountable towards society and that interventions in the workplace, whether legally required or not, are now being increasingly considered in terms of their impact beyond the workforce alone but rather society as a whole (see Chapters 3, 4, and 5). This represents a blurring of boundaries between traditional occupational safety and health and public health initiatives that have also resulted in greater emphasis on the concept of well-being in addition to health and safety.",12.398534199514714,8.108700455547924

Bioethicists like Stephen Holland regard the communitarian lens as useful since it aims at realizing collective interests. This same idea offers a strong justificatory argument for adopting it in relation to public health interventions. 148 Communitarianism pays attention to the social sphere, institutions, and interrelationships in relation to moral judgments that will inform public health policy and practice.

The six items were then fabricated from a variety of antimicrobial copper alloys, where the criteria for alloy selection were reflective of the ability of the antimicrobial alloys to be readily fabricated into that particular component ( Fig. 4.4) . Properties of strength and durability were operationally defined such that the resulting component would be able to withstand the rigors placed on the finished goods within the built environment of an active clinical setting and for the ability of the materials to withstand standard hospital cleaners, including sodium hypochlorite. Additionally, the surface finish was to provide consistent wear and aesthetics over the lifespan of the product. All of the copper alloys used for component fabrication were made from solid alloys registered with the EPA [87] . Subsequent to the published report, manufacturers have introduced numerous products fabricated from EPA registered solid copper that meet or exceed the criteria used by the referenced authors [70, 74, 75] . From a design standpoint, it is important to note that these results were 'additive' to other infection-control implementations already in place. Single patient rooms, hand-washing sinks, hand sanitizing alcohol dispensers, contact precautions required of MRSA and VRE carriers/infected patient(s), and an active hand hygiene staff education program were already in place in the units of the hospitals studied. Should these conclusions expand to other areas of the hospital, then employing inherently antimicrobial surfaces could represent a significant enhancement to mitigating infectious bacteria within hospitals. For example, by instituting a 'best practices' approach that implemented cleaning and hand hygiene designs and protocols, the California's Healthcare-Associated Infection Prevention Initiative showed a reduction of HAI by 3.2 %. With many of these best practices already in place, the initial findings from the clinical trials are showing an additional double-digit reduction in infections.",12.835223034847917,6.812171867033044

Regulators can influence the prevailing values of financial risk, non-financial benefits, complexity, and trialability by taking (enhanced) financial, legislative, and regulatory measures, for example, based on the European Orphan Drug Regulation (EODR). Consumers can improve the prevailing values of complexity and trialability by participating in the study of rare diseases and the development process of orphan drugs (such as diagnosis, pathogenesis (animal) models, ways of treatment, and number of patients involved in clinical trials).

This energy must be provided and released at the right time and at the right place to drive the merger between the viral and target membranes. Although cholesterol-rich lipid domains have been implicated in cell entry, their proposed involvement was puzzling because ordered lipids are thought to be detrimental to membrane bending and fusion. However, we recently discovered that Lo/Ld phase boundaries facilitate fusion in model systems and demonstrated that line tension at these boundaries might provide an additional previously unrecognized driving force for fusion (23). This previous work was limited because no receptors or co-receptors were present and because it could be argued that pure lipid model membranes oversimplify biological membranes. To overcome these limitations, we demonstrated in this work that a very similar mechanism governs HIV fusion with biological host membranes containing its natural receptors. We directly observed that lipid domain boundaries are the portals for HIV binding and membrane fusion, presumably because they present the weakest points in the host membrane. On the basis of these results, we propose the following model: HIV gp120 binds to CD4 receptors located in cholesterol-rich lipid domains, which exist transiently in the plasma membranes of living cells. If located near CCR5 co-receptors at domain boundaries, this initial binding leads to structural changes of gp120 and binding to the CCR5 co-receptor, enriching bound virions at the boundaries (Fig. 6A). After CD4 and CCR5 binding, gp41 changes its conformation to expose the fusion peptide to lipids in the boundary region (16). The predisposed preference of CCR5 for membrane domain boundaries greatly facilitates the targeting of the fusion peptide to these same fusion-promoting areas of the host membrane. Although we did not examine the other HIV co-receptor, CXCR4, in this study, it might function equivalently to CCR5 in recruiting virions to domain boundary regions for more efficient fusion. Because receptors cooperate with membrane domain boundaries to form HIV entry sites, it would be interesting to examine in future studies the binding and fusion efficiencies of HIV particles with GPMVs or SPPMs, where CD4 and CCR5 are distributed differently or randomly.",13.115578806387646,6.6275851672843515

In development, robustness is described as canalization, whereby developing cells are directed toward a specific outcome from uncertain starting conditions and despite various cellular and environmental perturbations (Waddington, 1942). In Waddington’s “epigenetic landscape,” environmental influences lead to the establishment of “valleys” that guide the direction of genetic processes and define a generation of cell types with a discrete nature (Waddington, 1942). Accordingly, distinct cell phenotypes are represented by the placement of a cell state within a particular valley (Fig. 1 A). The Waddington landscape is not just a metaphor but rather an accurate reflection of the state of gene regulatory networks that operate within cells (Huang et al., 2005). The gene expression levels in the cells can be viewed within the high-dimensional state space, where each point in the state space represents one gene expression pattern within the gene regulatory network (Fig. 1 B). The convergence of individual dimensions, i.e., gene expression trajectories, from the high energy, unstable state to the low energy, stable state generates the so-called attractor state, toward which specific cells are pulled over time (Macarthur et al., 2009; Fig. 1 C). The stable attractor state occupies the basin of the state space and is surrounded by unstable states. Such topography provides an explanation for the self-stabilizing nature of gene networks where the hills that separate attractors represent unstable network states. It has been proposed that attractor states define the stable phenotypes of specific cell types (Sooranna and Saggerson, 1979; Huang et al., 2009). The self-organizing and self-stabilizing property of the cell state, which defines gene expression profiles, is a natural feature conferred by attractors. The attractor state can be reached via an almost infinite number of paths, all of which lead to cell type–specific gene expression patterns that are highly resistant to noise and can reestablish themselves after small perturbations (Huang et al., 2009). However, in the presence of sufficiently high levels of fluctuations or in response to a deterministic signal, cells can switch between attractors and generate new and potentially heritable phenotypes (Kalmar et al., 2009; Muñoz-Descalzo et al., 2012; Li et al., 2016).",10.936874268781066,5.046838512436372

But as constructivism has gained wide acceptance in education, it has become difficult to distinguish knowledge building from constructivist learning, and Bereiter and Scardamalia have begun to favor the term “knowledge creation,” which is well established in the literature on innovation (Gundling 2000; Nonaka and Takeuchi 1995).1 The term refers to a set of social practices that advance the state of knowledge within a community over time (Paavola et al. 2004). Knowledge creation involves more than the creation of a new idea; it requires discourse (talk, writing, and other actions) to determine the limits of knowledge in the community, set goals, investigate problems, promote the impact of new ideas, and evaluate whether the state of knowledge in the community is advancing.

Captive snake breeding operations typically operate at high stocking densities, and breeders commonly attend trade shows, where animals from different sources are juxtaposed. In addition, animals from geographically and ecologically diverse areas are commonly imported and mixed with minimal quarantine. These practices increase pathogen exposure and lower barriers to transmission. The outcome is evident in the case of farmed turtles, which typically have very high Salmonella carriage rates, in contrast to the low prevalence in wild turtle populations (66–68). It is also possible that these practices select for increased virulence, as has been the case for feline calicivirus (FCV), which has independently evolved multiple times from a pathogen that causes a relatively benign upper respiratory disease to one that causes hemorrhagic disease with high mortality (69). This increase in FCV virulence has been documented only in high-density environments, such as shelters.

Our approach was to better understand the barriers to adherence to IPAC practices within the rehabilitation context. We used epidemiological data to identify important triggers of outbreaks and then drilled down to understand the main drivers. For example, delays in testing and initiation of droplet and contact precautions were occurring due to lack of clarity around syndromic criteria which was addressed through systematic training. Lack of private rooms was an additional barrier noted by our staff, but our experience showed that earlier initiation of transmission-based precautions actually led to the same number of isolation-days presumably due to reduced nosocomial transmission. Finally, we uncovered a number of system problems that made it easier for staff to work while sick rather than staying home. These included the perceived pressure from human resources attendance management and the challenge in accessing OHS. Once these were addressed through redevelopment of an OHS electronic software reporting programme, better reporting of illness was seen. These examples underscore the impact of process changes that are linked to the specific barriers to best practice rather than relying on education alone.9",15.876519007939846,7.723078543156944

As telemedicine has inevitably altered the traditional working relationships within the healthcare network, how to ensure high-quality communication among healthcare practitioners poses a significant challenge. As such, frequent, timely, accurate, and problem-solving focused communication among clinical staffs from hospitals at different levels in the healthcare system is essential to minimize the risk incurred in handling patients with possible COVID-19 infection 3 . However, we have found that high quality of communication is not always maintained during the telemedicine coordination. Therefore, a learning telemedicine system platform for coronavirus care was developed across connected hospitals, serving as the overarching authoritative source for diagnostic decision making and knowledge sharing for treatment. The platform could aggregate COVID-19 patient records across 126 connected hospitals and rapidly expand to enable open collaborations with key stakeholders such as government authorities, research institutions and laboratories.

The telemedicine service platform layer enables a specialist treatment team of provincial specialists to conquer distance and provide access to clinicians working in the regional hospitals.

We find that a state with no neighbors adopting a given policy was 32.0% (95% CI: 8.4 to 50.8) less likely to adopt it than a state with 50% or more of its neighbors adopting that policy.

How can a membrane structure access the state of local energy minimum between two energy barriers? How does the system transition from a single energy barrier for homogeneous boundaries (Figs. 3 and 4) to two barriers when a gradient in spontaneous curvature at the boundaries is imposed? To answer these questions, we next investigated how the aligned and anti-aligned switches are controlled by the spontaneous curvature gradient at the exterior boundary. To do so, we compute the spontaneous curvature at the top and bottom of the inner ramp for various C 1 /C 0 ratios and fixed helicoid pitch (P/(2πL) = 0.05). As shown in Fig. 6 , the aligned and anti-aligned switches vanish at a distinct value of the boundary gradient in spontaneous curvature. This mechanism can be understood using simple symmetry arguments: for C 1 = C 0 no variation in spontaneous curvature in the z-direction can exist, implying that the anti-aligned switch must vanish ( Fig. 5 and Fig. 6f ). On the contrary, for C 1 = −C 0 , the boundary condition imposes the spontaneous curvature along the z-axis to be symmetric with respect to the mid-plane of the helicoid. This therefore requires the aligned switch to vanish (Fig. 6b) . Every time the inner ramp radius passes a critical value, the limits in spontaneous curvature associated with the vanishing switch take opposite signs.",17.967802599168994,8.75586064088743

A by-product of our work is the suggestion that the frameshift efficiency is likely determined by the stability of the 5 end hairpin that the ribosome first encounters during translation.",10.478535443154366,6.423896305126535

As a result, individual researchers are naturally averse to sharing primary data prior to manuscript acceptance. The second issue-underutilization of existing, community supported tools and analysis frameworks-may be due to the lack of sustained efforts to educate the biomedical community about best practices in (genomic) data analysis.
