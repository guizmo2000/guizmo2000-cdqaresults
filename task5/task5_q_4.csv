In the SEIR model the population is divided into 17 compartments, with the infectious compartment being subdivided into three groups based on clinical severity (asymptomatic, mild and severe infections). All severe cases were at risk of death, and assumed to need hospitalisation and antiviral treatment (of which a certain proportion also required mechanical ventilation). All asymptomatically and mild infected patients were assumed to recover. Hospitalisation and treatment with antivirals were assumed to reduce the infectious period and the probability of death for severe cases.

In Iran, the first cases of COVID-19 were officially announced between February 19 and 23, 2020 and it soon became clear that Iran is one of the countries that is worst-hit by COVID-19 outbreak (1, 2) . It is now evident that most cases of COVID-19 disease develop mild respiratory and constitutional symptoms (3), while some cases are asymptomatic (3, 4) . Involvement of other organs, including liver and kidneys has been reported in patients with COVID-19 (5). Many questions remain unanswered about associations and presentations of COVID-19. Shohada-e-Tajrish Hospital, a university hospital located in Tehran, Iran, was designated as one of the main centers providing diagnostic and healthcare services for patients suspected to be infected with the new virus. Here, we share our experience regarding computed tomography (CT) findings suggestive of COVID-19 disease among patients who underwent radiologic investigation due to traumatic injuries. Several trauma patients had findings on their chest and/or abdominal CT scans, which were suggestive or highly suggestive of COVID-19 (1). The findings were noted in the lung bases that were visible on an abdominal CT scan or on a clinically indicated spiral CT scan of the chest. The most frequent mechanisms of injury were fall and car accident. Conscious patients did not report dizziness or loss of consciousness before the trauma and most of them did not have any symptoms related to COVID-19 (e.g., fever, shortness of breath). To our knowledge, there is no study or report about the possible association between COVID-19 and trauma in the lit-erature. So, the mentioned observations could be just a coincidence, but this association could still be proposed as a research objective. The importance of this finding is that CT characteristics of COVID-19 could be seen in patients who were admitted to the hospitals not due to COVID-19 related symptoms, but because of chest and abdominal trauma. This issue should be considered by health care workers serving trauma patients and it should be kept in mind that during an outbreak of respiratory infections, in particular COVID-19 disease, every attempt should be made to protect the health and safety of the staff even when providing care for trauma patients.",31.049425877675215,11.756092546523291

We retrospectively studied whether the admission serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels can serve as a predictor of illness severity. Methods: Included were all consecutive adult patients who presented to the emergency department (ED) between May-December, 2009 with a flu-like illness, a confirmed diagnosis of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) infection and a serum CRP level measured within 24 hours of presentation. Patients with a proven additional concurrent acute illness (e.g., bacteremia) were excluded. We used the ROC curve analysis, Kaplan-Meier curves and the Cox proportional hazard model to evaluate the predictive ability of CRP as a prognostic factor. Results: Seventeen (9%) of the 191 enrolled patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), of whom eight (4%) required mechanical ventilation and three (2%) died. The median admission serum CRP levels were significantly higher among patients who required subsequent ICU care and mechanical ventilation than among patients who did not (123 mg/L and 112 mg/L vs. 40 mg/L, p < .001 and 43 mg/L, p = .017, respectively). A Cox proportional hazard model identified admission serum CRP levels and auscultatory findings over the lungs as independent prognostic factors for ICU admission. Admission serum CRP levels were the only independent prognostic factor for mechanical ventilation. Thirty days after presenting to the ED, none of the patients with admission serum CRP level <28 mg/L (lower tertile) required either ICU admission or mechanical ventilation. At the same time point, 19% of the patients with admission serum CRP level ≥70 mg/L (upper tertile) needed to be admitted to the ICU and 8% of the same upper tertile group required mechanical ventilation. The differences in the rates between the lower vs. upper tertile groups were significant (Log-Rank p < .001 for ICU and p < .024 for mechanical ventilation).

COVID-19 is a self-limiting disease in more than 80% of patients. Severe pneumonia occurred in about 15% of cases as revealed in studies with large cohorts of patients. The gross case fatality is 3.4% worldwide as of February 25, 2020. This rate is 4.4% for patients in Wuhan, 4.0% for patients in Hubei and 0.92% for patients outside of Hubei. The exceedingly high fatality in Wuhan might be explained by the collapse of hospitals, a large number of undiagnosed patients, suboptimal treatment or a combination of these. Up to date, we still do not have any specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents but an anti-Ebola drug, remdesivir, may hold the promise. As a nucleotide analog, remdesivir was shown to be effective in preventing MERS-CoV replication in monkeys. Severity of disease, viral replication, and lung damage were reduced when the drug was administered either before or after infection with MERS-CoV [10] . These results provide the basis for a rapid test of the beneficial effects of remdesivir in COVID-19. Other antiviral agents worthy of further clinical investigations include ribavirin, protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir, interferon α2b, interferon β, chloroquine phosphate, and Arbidol. However, we should also bear in mind the side effects of these antiviral agents. For example, type I interferons including interferon α2b and interferon β are well known for their antiviral activity. Their beneficial effects at an early phase of infection are well expected. However, administration at a later stage carries the risk that they might worsen the cytokine storm and exacerbate inflammation. Notably, steroids have been experimentally used widely in the treatment of SARS and are still preferred by some Chinese physicians in the treatment of COVID-19. It is said to be capable of stopping the cytokine storm and preventing lung fibrosis. However, the window in which steroids might be beneficial to patients with COVID-19 is very narrow. In other words, steroids can only be used when SARS-CoV-2 has already been eliminated by human immune response. Otherwise, SARS-CoV-2 replication will be boosted leading to exacerbation of symptoms, substantial virus shedding, as well as increased risk for nosocomial transmission and secondary infection. In this regard, it will be of interest to determine whether the report of fungal infection in the lungs of some patients in Wuhan might be linked to misuse of steroids. Nevertheless, the screening of new pharmaceuticals, smallmolecule compounds and other agents that have potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects will successfully derive new and better lead compounds and agents that might prove useful in the treatment of COVID-19.",26.098079891905762,13.638769426114312

Of the 22 patients, 20 (91%) were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), including 14 directly admitted to ICU and 6 transferred to ICU during hospitalization. The main adverse outcome measure was in-hospital death. As of July 10, a total of 7 patients had died in hospital, and 15 patients were discharged in recovered condition. The median time from the onset of illness to death was 18 days (IQR, 12 to 54 days). All the patients were devided into mortality (n = 7) and survival (n = 15) groups. Table 1 shows the comparison of patient age, sex, comorbid illnesses, outcomes as resulting in required mechanical ventilation or developing acute respiratory distress syndrome, and clinical symptoms, between mortality and survival groups. The mortality rate in this study was 32% (7 of 22 patients). There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to patient age, sex, comorbidities, and clinical manifestations. All the patients in mortality group developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and all of them required mechanical ventilation, while in survival group 33% (5/15) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (P = 0.004) and 27% (4/15) required mechanical ventilation (P = 0.005). Only two patients in mortality group required invasive mechanical ventilation, while others required non-invasive mechanical ventilation.

In another study, Jung and colleagues reported a confirmed case fatality risk of 5.3% to 8.4% for COVID-19 (23) . However, due to the rapid spread of COVID-19, there is a higher number of death cases in the recent pandemic (N=3043, up to 02 March 2020) compared to SARS and MERS (N=1871) (29) . There is a poor prognosis for the disease in middle and older aged patients (28) .

Even though death outcome is uncommon in young people, a few deaths are reported in this age group in China and Iran. Availability of and access to healthcare facilities has likely contributed to increase in death outcome. As a probable explanation for the difference between fatality rate in Wuhan (3%) and other provinces (0.7%) in China, death rates are likely affected by shortage in health resources due to increasing number of patient who had sought diagnosis and treatment services in the early phase of the epidemic in Wuhan (31).",26.964264492886876,11.77031962796466

Although a 30-bed ward in an infectious disease hospital in Wuhan was established for psychiatric patients on 3 February 2020, the rapidly escalating number of cases has led to a severe shortage of hospital beds. As an alternative, isolation wards have been established in psychiatric hospitals for psychiatric patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19, but this option could increase the risk of hospital-acquired infection especially if there is inadequate capacity for infection control in these hospitals [1] . Another option is to establish specific quarantine facilities for clinically stable psychiatric patients with mild-moderate symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Gymnasiums, exhibition centers and sports centers have been converted into 'Fang Cang' (temporary quarantine hospital facilities) for infected patients with mild symptoms [14] (Figure 1 ). In conclusion, the COVID-19 outbreak has raised numerous challenges for psychiatric hospitals in China to safely manage patients' major psychiatric disorders in addition to preventing and treating COVID-19.

In addition, our patient population was drawn from a limited geographical region and it is not known how our findings may translate to other regions. Additional studies are required from other countries and populations to further validate our models. In order for patients to receive HRCT after invasive mechanical ventilation (n = 5 in derivation cohort, n = 6 in validation cohort), it is necessary for a physician to be on call/available. Usually, in Taiwan hospitals, the emergency room (ER) is close to the CT room so the transport time is within 10 minutes for nearly all patients 30 . The ER is staffed by experienced emergency doctors who are on duty 24 hours a day.

A recent nationwide analysis in China demonstrated that, of 1590 COVID-19 cases from 575 hospitals, 18 had a history of cancer (1 vs 0.29% of cancer incidence in the overall Chinese population, respectively), with lung cancer as the most frequent diagnosis [5] . Patients with cancer were observed to have a higher risk of severe events compared with patients without cancer (39 vs 8%; p = 0.0003). Moreover, cancer patients who underwent recent chemotherapy or surgery had a higher risk of clinically severe events than did those not receiving treatment. With the limit of a small sample size, the authors concluded that patients with cancer might have a higher risk of COVID-19, and poorer outcomes, than individuals without cancer.

Cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) is a phenomenon of immune hyperactivation typically described in the setting of T cell-engaging immunotherapy, including CAR-T cell therapy but also anti-PD-1 agents [15] . CRS is characterized by elevated levels of IL-6, IFN-γ and other cytokines, provoking consequences and symptoms related to immune activation, ranging from fever, malaise and myalgias to severe organ toxicity, lung failure and death. In parallel, one of the most important mechanism underlying the deterioration of disease in COVID-19 is represented by the cytokine storm, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome or even multiple organ failure [16] . The cytometric analyses of COVID-19 patients showed reduced counts of peripheral CD4 and CD8 T cells, while their status was hyperactivated. In addition, an increased concentration of highly proinflammatory CCR6+ Th17 in CD4 T cells has been reported, and CD8 T cells were found to harbor high concentrations of cytotoxic granules, suggesting that overactivation of T cells tends to contribute to the severe immune injury of the disease [17] . Moreover, the pathological findings associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome in COVID-19 showed abundant interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate in the lungs, dominated by lymphocytes, once again implying that the immune hyperactivation mechanisms are at least partially accountable for COVID-19 severity [17] .

Numerous studies have been published, establishing evidence and opinion-based guides for emergency physicians, who are at the front line. Although many have established pathways for dealing with patient screening, testing, prognosis and disposition, I would like to discuss the management of the crashing patients in need of ventilation who we ought to be prepared for the most. As of now, it is essential to contain a crashing suspected/confirmed COVID-19 patient within the confines of a negative isolation chamber due to a high risk of aerosolization, with strict adherence to personal protective equipment (PPE), exclusively comprising of N95 or preferably a powered air purifying respirator (PAPR) (1). Most experienced staff should look after the patient, in order to minimize contamination to few personnel only. Since conventional methods of Non-invasive mechanical ventilation (CPAP/BiPAP) are inadvisable due to aerosol generation, it is suggested to secure a definitive airway with extreme precaution (2) . Pre-oxygenation can be performed with a Bag Valve Mask device with positive end expiratory valve and a viral filter, if available. It is recommended to form a good facemask seal with both hands, while making sure not to deliver any positive breaths (2) . Induction and relaxant medications should be administered at a maximum dose in order to prevent cough or gag reflex during the procedure (3). A video laryngoscope should be used so as to avoid having the operator position their face close to the patient. The most senior physician should at-tempt maintaining the airway, in order to maximally ensure first pass intubation success; however, in a failed airway scenario, attempts should be made to establish a surgical airway immediately. The endotracheal tube (ETT) should be positioned at a predetermined depth and secured properly. Avoid auscultation attempts to prevent instrument contamination, and look for bilateral chest rise or end tidal capnography waveform. If available, a viral filter should be connected to the adapter of the ETT, and another should be placed at the exhalation port of the ventilator (2) . A plastic transparent sheet can be placed over the patientâȂŹs head and chest to prevent droplet spread (4). All contaminated instruments should be placed in a transparent bag for immediate disposal and/or decontamination. The ARDSnet (acute respiratory distress syndrome network) protocol should be followed for patient ventilation. In case of poor PaO2/FiO2(PF) ratio (<150), place the patient in prone position (5) . Allow for permissive hypercapnia (pH > 7.2), if hemodynamics remain stable (6, 7) . Do not give fluid boluses and maintain the patient in negative balance (8) . If needed, place a central venous access line in femoral site for administering vasopressors to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure. Following intubation and initial ventilation, immediately proceed to transfer the patient to intensive care unit, after which, perform decontamination of the initial zone and the equipment used. Consider meticulous removal of PPE and debrief.",34.04310736901134,13.253060929440451

It is difficult to explain this discrepancy. It may be due to the difference in the units that were used to measure delayed treatment (hours vs. days). Unlike in previous studies, we measured the time to anti-PCP treatment was calculated in hours instead of days [32] . Another potential explanation for these conflicting results is differences in the study populations. We only included HIV-negative patients in our analysis of the association of time to anti-PCP treatment on mortality. In addition, the majority of patients required mechanical ventilation on admission. These results suggest against empiric treatment PCP in HIV-negative patients who present with hypoxemic respiratory failure given the various (potentially harmful) side effects of this treatment. PCP in HIV-negative patients causes acute fulminant pneumonia with abrupt-onset respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation [9, 10] . We observed a high mortality rate in our patients who required mechanical ventilation, which was consistent with the findings from previous reports [14] [15] [16] 18] . In addition, the severity of illness (at the time of ICU admission) was associated with higher mortality. These findings suggest that a patient's general condition and underlying disease associated with PCP are more important than is early initiation of anti-PCP treatment in HIV-negative patients.",25.30588357748914,8.717058529191362

This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of laboratory parameters in predicting cases with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19. Methods: This diagnostic accuracy study was conducted on suspected COVID-19 patients, who presented to Behpooyan Clinic Medical center in Tehran (Iran) from 22 February to 14 March, 2020. Patients were divided into two groups based on the results of real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19, and the accuracy of different laboratory parameters in predicting cases with positive RT-PCR was evaluated using area under the ROC curve (AUC). Results: Two hundred cases with the mean age of 41.3± 14.6 (range: 19-78) years were studied (0.53% male). The result of RT-PCR for COVID-19 was positive in 70 (35%) cases.

However, the optimal timing or method of performing tracheostomies in this population remains to be established. In the present study, we compared outcomes of early and late tracheostomy in critically adult patients with diff erent clinical conditions. Methods All patients needing tracheostomy in the Critical Care Medical Center of Hiroshima Prefectural Hospital from January 2009 to December 2011 were surveyed. Patients with tracheostomy who were not indicated for mechanical ventilation were excluded from the subjects. Early tracheostomy (ET) was defi ned as <10 days after tracheal intubation and late tracheostomy (LT) was defi ned as ≥10 days after intubation. We compared patient characteristics, type of tracheostomy procedure, length of weaning from ventilator and outcomes between the groups. Data are shown as the mean ± SD, with unpaired t test and Mann-Whitney U test used for statistical analyses. Statistical signifi cance was accepted at P <0.05. Results One hundred patients were surveyed. The ET and LT groups included 49 and 51 patients, respectively. Tracheostomy was performed using a percutaneous procedure in 48 patients (ET: 25, LT: 23) and a surgical procedure in 52 patients (ET: 24, LT: 28). Sixty-two patients (ET: 34, LT: 28) survived to discharge and 16 patients died in the ICU (ET: 7, LT: 9). Fifty-six patients (ET: 31, LT: 25) were weaned from ventilator support and tracheostomy cannula was removed in 20 patients (ET: 11, LT: 9). There were no signifi cant diff erences in type of tracheostomy procedure, period from tracheostomy until ICU and hospital discharge, rate of patients who could be weaned from ventilator and removed tracheostomy cannula, and ICU and hospital mortality between the groups. The length of mechanical ventilation and the time to removal of tracheostomy cannula were signifi cantly shorter in the ET group (5 ± 7 vs. 26 ± 41 and 29 ± 24 vs. 94 ± 83 days, respectively). Conclusion In this retrospective study, early tracheostomy reduced the length of weaning after tracheostomy and the time to removal of tracheostomy cannula, while there were no diff erences in the length of ICU stay and patient outcome. In critically ill adult patients who require mechanical ventilation, a tracheostomy performed at an earlier stage may shorten the duration of artifi cial ventilation.

The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is formerly known as the '2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Pneumonia', which was originated from a wet market in Wuhan, Hubei province, China in early December 2019 [1] . On the 7 th January, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) identified and isolated this novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted between persons via close contacts [2] leading to COVID-19. Infected patients may develop severe and even fatal respiratory diseases (e.g., acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute respiratory failure) ending up in intensive care [2, 3] . Due to potentially serious health outcomes brought by COVID-19, from 23 rd January, 2020, Wuhan and other regions in China have adopted strict quarantine measures to prevent and control the disease epidemic [4, 5] . From 27 th January, 2020 onwards, all provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities in China have initiated an emergency response to major public health emergencies [4] . On Ivyspring International Publisher the 30 th January, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a global health emergency [6] .

Chen et al., found that LDH had significantly increased in most patients, while albumin had decreased, but ALT and AST showed no significant changes (11) . The mentioned val- ues were also reported for patients with MERS-CoV, where elevated ALT, AST and LDH was observed (6) . Another study indicated that 2-11% of patients with COVID-19 had liver co-morbidities and 14-53% of cases had abnormal ALT and AST levels during progression of COVID-19 disease (12) . Furthermore, Shi et al. studied patients whose COVID-19 diagno- sis was confirmed by computed tomography (CT) scan while in the subclinical phase and found that incidence of AST abnormality among these patients was significantly lower than those diagnosed after the onset of symptoms (13) . Therefore, liver injury is more prevalent in severe cases compared to mild cases of COVID-19. In another report, Yang et al. found no difference in the incidence of abnormal liver function between survivors (30%) and non-survivors (28%) (9) . Liver damage in mild cases of COVID-19 is often transient and can return to normal without any special treatment (12) . We have found that the number and percentage of WBC, LYM and NEU were significantly different between positive and negative RT-PCR cases for COVID-19/or SARS-CoV-2. In comparison to the normal range, we found low WBC and LYM counts in patients with positive RT-PCR COVID-19, whereas NEU counts were higher in these patients. In previous reports, low LYM and WBC counts were found in most patients, which is in line with our study (14) . Laboratory studies showed leucopenia with leukocyte counts of 2.91 ÃŮ 109 cells/L, 70.0% of which were NEU (15) . Therefore, our result suggests that NEU might not be affected with SARS-CoV-2 in the initial phase of the disease. It also suggests that SARS-CoV-2 might mainly act on lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes, as does SARS-CoV. Virus particles spread through the respiratory tract and infect other cells, inducing series of immune responses, and causing changes in number of peripheral white blood cells such as lymphocytes (11) . Some studies suggest that a substantial decrease in the total number of lymphocytes indicates that coronavirus affects many immune cells and inhibits cellular immune function (11) . Tsui and others reported that high neutrophil count on admission of COVID-19 patients, and elevated LDH level were independent predictors of an adverse clinical outcome (16) . In the present study, ROC curve was used to analyze the specificity and sensitivity of different variables in suspected COVID-19 patients. The AUC of laboratory parameters such as ALT, CRP, AST, LDH, and NEU indicated that they could be used to predict the presence of COVID-19 disease, while those of albumin and WBC were below the reference line of ROC curve, indicating that they were poor predictors of the disease. The data is in line with results reported by Wang et al. (17) and Gao et al. (4) . In the current study, the AUC of CRP, ALT, LDH, urea and NEU were above 0.80; thus, they are effective and have very good predictive value for predicting COVID-19. It seems that, some blood laboratory parameters could be used in screening cases with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19. Considering the significant difference in laboratory parameters evaluated in this study between the 2 groups, one can hope to model or predict the results of coronavirus testing based on routine laboratory tests.",29.55151005016203,10.038899323833506

There are such cases with every infectious disease. They are also present during the flu epidemics, but they are extremely rare. This suddenly gives us another possible strategy for quarantine exit, where children and those under 50 years of age could first emerge if they do not have any underlying illnesses. Here, after this table, it already seems like we are beginning to have an increasing number of options to get out of quarantines and learn to live with this virus until the vaccine becomes available. However, at least a few more studies need to be carried out to confirm that this age group can be substantially protected, to provide reassurance that the virus is not becoming more dangerous for those younger than 50 years, too. There is another strangeness to the situation in Italy that will not be intuitive to the general public. The actual number of deaths attributable to COVID-19 in Italy will not be possible to estimate for several months after the epidemic finally ends. Namely, at present, due to the sole focus on the epidemic, most of the cases of death of very old people who have been diagnosed using a throat swab have been attributed to COVID-19. However, once the epidemic is over, it will be necessary to compare the deaths in individual areas of Italy with the average for the same months in the previous few years. It could be shown that a part of the already ill would have died in the same month, or a year, even without being infected with the new coronavirus. It is possible that among some of them COVID-19 accelerated this inevitability by a few weeks or months. Some of the deaths observed during the epidemic in Italy may need to be reclassified later and attributed to underlying diseases in accordance with expected levels, and those above expected levels will then be attributed to COVID-19.",31.717252335588793,13.553554879202673

We found a heavy skew of infection towards older age groups, with substantially fewer children infected. This pattern could indicate agerelated differences in susceptibility to infection, severe outcomes, or behaviour. However, a substantial portion of the patients in our database are travellers, a population that is usually predominantly adults (although does not exclude children). Furthermore, because patient data in our dataset were captured by the health system, they are biased towards the more severe spectrum of the disease, especially for patients from mainland China. Clinical reports have shown that severity of COVID-19 is associated with the presence of chronic conditions, 16, 17 which are more frequent in older age groups. Nevertheless, we would also expect children younger than 5 years to be at risk of severe outcomes and to be reported to the healthcare system, as is seen for other respiratory infections. 18 Biological differences could have a role in shaping these age profiles. A detailed analysis of one of the early COVID-19 clusters by Chan and colleagues 19 revealed symptomatic infections in five adult members of the same household, while a child in the same household aged 10 years was infected but remained asymptomatic, potentially indicating biological differences in the risk of clinical disease driven by age. Previous immunity from infection with a related coronavirus has been speculated to potentially protect children from SARS, 20, 21 and so might also have a role in COVID-19. In any case, if the age distribution of cases reported here was to be confirmed and the epidemic were to progress globally, we would expect an increase in respiratory mortality concentrated among people aged 30 years and older. This mortality pattern would be substantially different from the profile of the 2009 influenza pandemic, for which excess mortality was concentrated in those younger than 65 years. 21 In our dataset, we saw a rapid increase in the number of people infected with COVID-19 in several provinces of China, consistent with local transmission outside of Hubei province.

Mechanical ventilation systems are fan driven. Positive pressure mechanical ventilation systems are fanned on intake and result in exfiltration of space (i.e., air tends to leak out of ventilated space). On the other hand, negative pressure mechanical ventilation systems are fanned on exhaust and result in infiltration of space [5, 69] . Natural ventilation systems rely on natural forces such as wind or a density-generated pressure differences between indoor and outdoor to drive air through building openings. Some purpose-built openings include doors, windows, solar chimneys, and wind towers [5, 69] . Advanced natural ventilation systems with passive cooling or heating have also been developed. In these systems, outdoor air is supplied via stacks fed from below-ground concrete plena providing passive cooling or heating. Air leaves the space through stacks. In Table 7 : Summary of advantages and disadvantages of different types of ventilation systems for hospitals [5] . [69] . Hybrid (mixed-mode) ventilation systems rely on natural driving forces when sufficient and use mechanical ventilation for augmentation as necessary. Usually, exhaust fans are used to assist natural ventilation in a negative pressure arrangement [5] . In some systems, passive down-draught cooling (PDC) encourages air to fall through chilled water pipes at a high level during hot weather. During cool weather some systems use exhaust flows to warm the incoming air. Usually, sensors and control technologies are required for optimum performance of hybrid systems [69] . Table 7 shows major advantages and disadvantages associated with the ventilation systems described above [5] .",32.429843281552465,11.065922033981327

During this epidemic, four live-born infants were born in our medical center, to pregnant women with the COVID-19 infection. Three of the four pregnant women gave birth by cesarean section due to concerns about symptomatic maternal infection. The other infant was born by vaginal delivery to a mother experiencing fever (highest temperature 38.3 • C), with a diagnostically confirmed infection. The most important question is whether the COVID-19 could be transmitted vertically to the fetus from the pregnant mother and cause a clinically significant infection. Recently, a finding from nine other cases suggested that there is no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy (1) .

Firstly, COVID-19 is a novel disease just recently recognised. The first version of a guideline for diagnosis and management of COVID-19 was announced on 16 January 2020. It took time for the medical professionals to learn about the virus and the disease in order to make correct diagnosis. Secondly, the diagnosis of COVID-19 requires two independent confirmatory laboratory tests, which should be taken at least 1 day apart. Our results showed that the lag correlation is shorter for the suspected than for laboratory-confirmed cases. Thirdly, the supply of laboratory testing kits may have been insufficient in the early stages of the coronavirus outbreak, which would have limited the number of patients that can be confirmed. Finally, the Internet searches and social media mentions are not only initiated by the patients and their family members, but also globally by the general public who are concerned about this rapidly spreading disease.",29.092978242164634,12.156384373797996

COVID-19 is now rapidly spreading worldwide, and this letter is written as the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a global emergency on January 31st amid concerns about a growing outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. Most of the published articles on COVID-19 have highlighted lungs as the main organ involved in the disease, while few articles have reported SARS-CoV-2 involvement in other organs, including liver and kidneys, which can impair the metabolism and excretion of the medications taken to treat the disease. According to Zhang et al. the incidence of hepatic abnormalities significantly increases after infection with COVID-19 and during the course of the disease, which may indicate the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the liver or side effects of the medications used by patients (1) . Also, Xu et al. have reported steatosis and liver injury in the liver biopsy of a patient with COVID-19 (2) . In addition to liver injuries, some articles have also reported an increased incidence of acute renal injury following COVID-19, which could be due to the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the inflammation induced by the disease, or a synergistic effect of both on kidneys (3, 4) . Additionally, Cheng et al. have reported that patients with acute renal injury have a higher mortality rate compared to other patients (3) .

Medicines currently prescribed to treat COVID-19 include Oseltamivir, Lopinavir / Ritonavir, Ribavirin, and Chloroquine Phosphate or Hydroxy Chloroquine Sulfate. All of these medicines are metabolized in the liver. Most of the metabolites derived from Oseltamivir, Ribavirin and some of the metabolites of Lopinavir / Ritonavir, Chloroquine Phosphate and Hydroxy Chloroquine Sulfate are found in the urine due to renal excretion. Therefore, injury to the liver and kidneys can impair metabolism, excretion, dosing and expected concentrations of the medications, which can increase the risk of toxicity using the aforementioned medications. According to the reports, liver and kidneys can be damaged in patients with COVID-19, which may make reaching the therapeutic dose of the medicines difficult and increase the risk of adverse drug reactions in patients. As a result, frequent and careful monitoring of liver and kidney functions in patients with COVID-19 can lead to early diagnosis of liver and kidney disorders, and also help in achieving the optimal therapeutic concentrations and reducing the risk of adverse drug reactions.",28.872365692211282,11.856679864360473

Interestingly our docked model supports this despite the variability between these spike proteins' S1 domains, with the same CD26 residues in close proximity to the active region of S1 domain in COVID-19. We also observed additional residues (Q286, I287, N338, V341, R336) of CD26 predicted to interact with the S1 domain of the spike protein via van der Waals or by hydrogen bonding.

Some of these unique residues of S1 domain are also predicted interact with the ACE2 protein [6] .

Currently, the analysis suggests (details of this analysis will be published elsewhere [7] ) that COVID-19/Wuhan 2019-nCoV belongs to Category B, indicating that, similar to SARS-CoV, COVID-19/Wuhan 2019-nCoV can be efficiently transmitted via the respiratory mode. However, due to the fact that the outer shell of this virus is among the hardest in the coronavirus family, the model suggests that COVID-19/Wuhan 2019-nCoV is likely to be more resilient in body fluids and the environment than most of its cousins, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Therefore, our model predicts that COVID-19/Wuhan 2019-nCoV can be efficiently spread by respiratory means, as in the case of SARS-CoV, but it also has the potential to remain outside the body longer than SARS-CoV, and, probably, MERS-CoV. The possibility of fecal-respiratory transmission of COVID-19/Wuhan 2019-nCoV is especially of concern, as was the case for SARS-CoV in the Amoy Garden, Hong Kong3.

Recent guidelines published by the British Thoracic Society recommend palliative treatment for the patients with AE of IPF, whereas those ILDs that are reversible, need to be diagnosed and treated actively [62] . Thus the reversible ILD with acute respiratory failure should be treated by intensive care treatment with mechanical ventilation, and thus BAL, transbronchial biopsy and surgical lung biopsy should be considered as the diagnostic procedures. Taken together, current invasive/intensive treatment has no definitive role in AE of IPF, while intensive treatment and methods of extensive diagnostics should be considered in the acute exacerbations of the other ILDs.

First, division of the cumulative number of deaths by that of cases should be adjusted by the delay in time from illness onset to reporting. Second, assessing only confirmed cases among all infections can offer limited insights into the severity among all infected individuals. Third, ascertainment bias and IFR are reduced by a shorter virus detection window and lower RT-PCR sensitivity. In the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, health officials will need to confront the uncertainty in the risk of death, and prompt identification of high-risk individuals using the approaches covered in this article is needed. Subjectively, COVID-19 involves mild infections among the general population, but the risk of death among young adults is higher than for seasonal influenza, and the mortality among older adults with comorbidities requires close attention.

We found a heavy skew of infection towards older age groups, with substantially fewer children infected. This pattern could indicate agerelated differences in susceptibility to infection, severe outcomes, or behaviour. However, a substantial portion of the patients in our database are travellers, a population that is usually predominantly adults (although does not exclude children). Furthermore, because patient data in our dataset were captured by the health system, they are biased towards the more severe spectrum of the disease, especially for patients from mainland China. Clinical reports have shown that severity of COVID-19 is associated with the presence of chronic conditions, 16, 17 which are more frequent in older age groups. Nevertheless, we would also expect children younger than 5 years to be at risk of severe outcomes and to be reported to the healthcare system, as is seen for other respiratory infections. 18 Biological differences could have a role in shaping these age profiles. A detailed analysis of one of the early COVID-19 clusters by Chan and colleagues 19 revealed symptomatic infections in five adult members of the same household, while a child in the same household aged 10 years was infected but remained asymptomatic, potentially indicating biological differences in the risk of clinical disease driven by age. Previous immunity from infection with a related coronavirus has been speculated to potentially protect children from SARS, 20, 21 and so might also have a role in COVID-19. In any case, if the age distribution of cases reported here was to be confirmed and the epidemic were to progress globally, we would expect an increase in respiratory mortality concentrated among people aged 30 years and older. This mortality pattern would be substantially different from the profile of the 2009 influenza pandemic, for which excess mortality was concentrated in those younger than 65 years. 21 In our dataset, we saw a rapid increase in the number of people infected with COVID-19 in several provinces of China, consistent with local transmission outside of Hubei province. As of Jan 31, 2020, province-level epidemic curves are only available by date of reporting, rather than date of symptom onset, which usually inflates recent case counts if detection has increased.

Notably, other lines of evidence suggest that local transmission is now well established outside of Hubei province, because travel increased just before the Chinese New Year on Jan 25, 2020, and before implementation of the travel ban in Wuhan. 22 Accordingly, our own data include evidence of transmission clusters in non-travellers, with, for instance, a second-generation transmission event reported in Shaanxi on Jan 21, 2020.",29.27232430368081,11.509193166805261

Despite careful selection for ICU admission and advances in critical care, the prognosis remains grim, with an overall 1-yr survival rate of less than 10% in patients who receive mechanical ventilation [27, 34, [65] [66] [67] . Outcomes are not related to the source of stem cells (bone marrow vs. peripheral blood vs. cord blood donors), the underlying malignancy for which BMT was performed, and patient-related characteristics, such as age or comorbidities [27, 61, 67] . Ten factors have been identified to be associated with mortality after a critical care illness-most are surrogate markers of GVHD: 1) BMT from unrelated donor, because of increased risks for GVHD and associated complications; 2) GVHD itself, with epithelial injury and subsequent organ dysfunction (liver, gastrointestinal tract and skin,), and with toxic and infectious complications from immunosuppression (aspergillosis and other severe opportunistic infections); 3) the need for mechanical ventilation (associated with approximately 20% survival); 4) acute respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation 4-6 weeks after BMT (GVHD period, 10% survival); 5) the association of severe sepsis and resistant GVHD; 6) thrombotic microangiopathy due to endothelial activation triggered by GVHD, total body irradiation, toxicity of immunosuppressive regimen, and infectious diseases; 7) multiple organ failure in the setting of severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease; 8) acute respiratory failure from pulmonary aspergillosis; 9) late noninfectious pulmonary complications, including diffuse alveolar hemorrhage [68, 69] , bronchiolitis obliterans [70] , and other new onset obstructive ventilatory disorders; and 10) relapse of the underlying malignancy after BMT. We recommend unrestricted intensive care support of allogeneic BMT recipients in three situations: patients at the earliest phase of transplantation (before GVHD develops) and BMT recipients proposed for ICU admission after 1 year of transplant and without GVHD or with controlled GVHD, and patients who require mechanical ventilation for status epilepticus related to posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). In all other situations, ICU admission and goals of therapy should be decided on an individual basis. Because survival remains exceptional, it seems reasonable to discourage ICU admission and mechanical ventilation in patients with severe sepsis or acute respiratory failure and uncontrolled GVHD.",29.796722461219105,14.576402466796253

Answering this question requires accurate forecasting the spread of confirmed cases as well as analysis of the number of deaths and recoveries. Forecasting, however, requires ample historical data. At the same time, no prediction is certain as the future rarely repeats itself in the same way as the past. Moreover, forecasts are influenced by the reliability of the data, vested interests, and what variables are being predicted. Also, psychological factors play a significant role in how people perceive and react to the danger from the disease and the fear that it may affect them personally. This paper introduces an objective approach to predicting the continuation of the COVID-19 using a simple, but powerful method to do so. Assuming that the data used is reliable and that the future will continue to follow the past pattern of the disease, our forecasts suggest a continuing increase in the confirmed COVID-19 cases with sizable associated uncertainty. The risks are far from symmetric as underestimating its spread like a pandemic and not doing enough to contain it is much more severe than overspending and being over careful when it will not be needed. This paper describes the timeline of a live forecasting exercise with massive potential implications for planning and decision making and provides objective forecasts for the confirmed cases of COVID-19.",29.693806335199934,10.52501261825777

All patients but four presented with a typical chickenpox skin rash, suggesting that VZV-CAP is mostly a dreaded complication of primary VZV infection rather than recurrent VZV infection. The four patients without rash were all immunocompromised (solid cancer or hematological malignancy). Atypical cases of recurrent VZV infection with pulmonary involvement have been reported, almost exclusively in immunocompromised patients, and cannot be excluded in our study [30] [31] [32] [33] . In addition, exogenous clinical reinfection by VZV has also been demonstrated and is thought to occur more likely in immunocompromised patients [30] . The illness course was characterized by a short period of acute and severe respiratory deterioration, requiring invasive mechanical ventilation in half of the cases, shortly after ICU admission. We identified that risk factors for intubation were related to the presence of a bacterial coinfection, the severity of the respiratory failure, and the onset of other organ failures. Neither comorbidities nor underlying immunosuppression were independent predictors of invasive mechanical ventilation. These results are in agreement with previous studies suggesting that the underlying medical context was no longer significantly associated with the risk for intubation after adjustment for the severity of the acute disease [34] [35] [36] . The factors we identified are easy to assess at the bedside and may contribute to recognizing hospital admission patients who may benefit from early ICU admission. Results are presented for the imputed data Candidate predictors were: age, any comorbidity, underlying immunosuppression, SOFA score at day 1, oxygen flow at ICU admission, alveolar consolidation on chest X-ray, antibiotics at ICU admission, and early bacterial co-infection CI confidence interval, ICU intensive care unit, OR odds ratio, SOFA Sequential Organ Failure Assessment In our study, the overall mortality was 24% and reached 43% in patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation. Viruses have been increasingly recognized as pathogens responsible for both severe community-acquired and healthcare-associated pneumonia [11, 29] . Choi et al. recently demonstrated in a prospective study that, in the ICU setting, the mortality rate of patients with viral pneumonia was similar to that of patients with bacterial pneumonia [11] . Nevertheless, most of our knowledge on severe forms of viral pneumonia is related to the influenza virus. We report that patients with VZV-CAP who required intubation experienced a long period of invasive mechanical ventilation (14 (7-21) days) and a high rate of bacterial coinfections (69%). These findings might be explained by the extent of skin and mucosal vesicular lesions.

The follow-up until discharge or death is a point of difference from other case series to date. Their cohort had many characteristics in common with other reports 3-5 -a median age of 56·0 years (IQR 46·0-67·0), a high percentage (62%) of men, and nearly half (48%) of patients with comorbidities. In-hospital death was associated with, on admission, older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03-1·17; p=0·0043), a higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (5·65, 2·61-12·23; p<0·0001), and blood d-dimer greater than 1 μg/mL (18·42, 2·64-128·55; p=0·0033), findings known to be associated with severe pneumonia. 6, 7 The study also presents early data on changes in clinical and laboratory findings over time, which could help clinicians to identify patients who progress to more severe disease. In-hospital mortality was high (28%), much higher than in other reports that had incomplete follow-up data, 3, 5, 8 and was very high among the 32 patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, of whom 31 (97%) died. This might reflect a higher proportion of patients admitted with severe disease in the early stages of the outbreak. In another report from Wuhan, mortality was 62% among critically ill patients with COVID-19 and 81% among those requiring mechanical ventilation. 9 While the world awaits further information from other locations, including from outside China, the current message is that mortality is high among the minority of people with COVID-19 who get severe disease.",42.67806275792036,17.36238282161444

Coronavirus disease 2019 has spread rapidly around the globe, including Asia, North America, Europe, and Africa. 1 The 2019 novel coronavirus is likely similar to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. They belong to the Betacoronavirus genus and can cause severe respiratory disease, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary oedema, and respiratory failure. 2 Tracheal intubation for invasive mechanical ventilation is the mainstay therapy to correct hypoxaemia. Preoxygenation with the standard bag-valve mask oxygenation followed by rapid-sequence intubation has been proposed in non-severely hypoxaemic critically ill patients requiring tracheal intubation to reduce the risk of aspiration and desaturation.

This lung injury can be the result of primary pulmonary parenchymal injury such as pneumonia or aspiration or from a systemic process such as sepsis or trauma. Increased capillary permeability leading to inflammation is the inciting factor for ARDS. Damage to the capillary endothelium and alveolar epithelium results in protein accumulation within the alveoli, activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and then pulmonary fibrosis. This cascade leads to loss of functional lung tissue. Chest radiography demonstrates bilateral opacities. As ARDS progresses, lung compliance decreases, hypoxemia ensues and patients can progress to ventilator dependence. (3, 4) In practice, ARDS is defined by the Berlin Definition. This requires that patients have acute At present, there are no studies examining specific ventilatory strategies in patients with COVID-19, however, there is a large body of experience with ARDS patients. Until more COVID-19specific evidence-based medicine is available, expert recommendations support adherence to these ventilatory strategies in COVID-19 patients. (6) Mechanical ventilation is recommended for patients with moderate or severe ARDS who remain hypoxemic or profoundly symptomatic despite supplemental oxygen. In mechanically ventilated patients, a lung-protective ventilation strategy should be employed to decrease ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). When treating ARDS patients with mechanical ventilation, the target tidal volume is typically 6 mL/kg of predicted body weight with goal plateau pressure <30-cm H 2 O. One interesting finding in COVID-19 ARDS is that some patients are found to be severely hypoxemic, but with surprisingly good lung compliance. In these patients, more liberal tidal volume settings may be considered. PEEP should be adjusted based on FiO 2 , with consideration of higher PEEP (>10 cm H 2 O) in moderate and severe ARDS. Notably, lung protective ventilation (low tidal volume) allows permissive respiratory acidosis with maintenance of a pH ≥ 7.25. Relative hypoxemia with a PaO 2 of 55-80 mmHg or SpO 2 of 88-95% may also be considered to limit high oxygen requirements. (3) In ARDS patients with PaO 2 /FiO 2 ≤ 150 mmHg, consideration should be given to initiation of prone positioning. If significant ventilator dyssynchrony is present, neuromuscular blockade may also be considered. (7) It should be noted that mild ARDS may be managed with noninvasive forms of ventilation.",35.94553372199724,15.672008134200041

Notably, these observations in COVID-19 patients are similar to those who suffered from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during the 2003 epidemic. There may be a biological mechanism behind this epidemiological anomaly. 17 Several kinds of vaccines and antiviral drugs that are based on S protein have been previously evaluated. Du et al. showed vaccines can be based on the S protein include full-length S protein, viral vector, DNA, recombinant S protein and recombinant RBD protein. Considering that, in the in vitro study, antiviral therapies are design based on S protein include RBDeACE2 blockers, S cleavage inhibitors, fusion core blockers, neutralizing antibodies, protease inhibitors, S protein inhibitors, and small interfering RNAs. 18 There are some recombinant compounds such as IFN with ribaverin which has only limited effects against COVID-19 infection. 1 The receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 has a higher affinity for ACE2, while it is a lower affinity for SARS-CoV. 1, 19 Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and its homologue ACE2, belongs to the ACE family of dipeptidylcarboxy dipeptidase. However, their physiological functions are varied. On the other hand, ACE2 serves as the binding site for COVID-19. Based on this information, Gurwitz suggested using available angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1R) blockers, such as losartan, as therapeutics for reducing the severity of COVID-19 infections. 20 At present therapy is based on identifying and developing monoclonal antibodies that are specific and effective against COVID-19 combines with remdesivir as a novel nucleotide analog prodrug that was used for the treatment of the Ebola virus disease. 17, 21 To understand the rate of virus spread among people, it is crucial to figure out whether COVID-19 is mutating to improve its binding to human receptors for infection considering its high mutation rate. Any adaptation in the COVID-19 sequence that might make it more efficient at transmitting among people might also boost its virulence. 22 The COVID-19 is expected to become less virulent through human to human transmissions due to genetic bottlenecks for RNA viruses often occur during respiratory droplet transmissions. 3",26.816658690354082,11.79295981146226

The infected mice had increased cytokine production, increased alveolar epithelial permeability, and activation of apoptosis pathways. This suggests that the key treatment of children with severe RSV infection, mechanical ventilation, can worsen the response of the lungs to the underlying viral infection.

Nevertheless, a new theme from animal studies is that the interactions between the mechanical ventilator and the lungs of children might be different than in adults. Smith and colleagues 26 compared the pulmonary responses of juvenile (3 weeks old, 5-7 g) and adult (16 weeks old, 25-30 g) mice in a model in which the mice were treated with intratracheal LPS, then subjected to mechanical ventilation for 2 or 4 hours. The adult mice had a synergistic increase in lung inflammation and protein permeability, as compared with animals treated with LPS alone, or mechanical ventilation alone. In contrast, a synergistic interaction between LPS treatment and mechanical ventilation was not found in the juvenile mice. This finding suggests that the adverse interactions between innate immunity and mechanical stretch increase with age. Microarray studies showed that there were major differences in clusters of genes activated in the juvenile and adult lungs in response to LPS and mechanical ventilation and suggested pathways that might be responsible for the different responses of juveniles and adults. Alvira and colleagues 98 treated neonatal and adult mice with intraperitoneal LPS and found that lung inflammation and apoptosis occurred in adult but not neonatal mice. This finding was associated with persistent activation of NF-kB p65/p50 heterodimers in the neonates, whereas in the adults there was initial activation of NF-kB p65/p50 followed by sustained activation of NF-kB p50/p50 homodimers. Developmental differences in NF-kB activation could influence the severity or outcome of pulmonary infections, or the pulmonary response to mechanical ventilation. These studies comparing infant and adult animals could provide a much better perspective on the mechanisms that account for protection from ALI in children and increased susceptibility in adults.",28.2973094357284,10.51209327833168

For instance, age is the strongest risk factor for CVD and the effect of aging on immune function may be equally important for COVID-19 suceptibility and severity. Exemplary of this, the effect of age on the immune system is exemplified by low protective titers among 50% of adults older than 65 who receive the influenza vaccine (30, 31) . Other traditional CVD risk factors such as diabetes and hyperlipidemia impact immune function, and conversely, dysregulated immunologic status corresponds with elevated risk of incident CVD (32) (33) (34) (35) . Thus, prevalent CVD may be a marker of accelerated immunologic aging/dysregulation and relate indirectly to COVID-19 prognosis. An increased frequency of adverse CVD events post COVID-19 infection might also play a role in prognosis, similar to other viral infections such as influenza with mechanistic underpinnings which are complex, multi-factorial, and bi-directional (36, 37) . In addition, COVID-19 infection may trigger pathways unique to this pathogen which contribute to outcomes in CVD patients. For instance, higher expression of ACE2 in patients with hypertension and CVD has been postulated to enhance susceptibility to SARS-CoV2, although the data are conflicting and without clear suggestion for treatment ( Figure 1 ) (5) .

The best available data do not provide a clear indication of which pathway will be dominant. On the one hand, our estimates of the proportion of health-care workers with child-care obligations might be optimistic because non-working adults might not be able to provide care or might require care themselves. On the other hand, it is possible that family members outside the household (eg, grandparents), neighbours, or friends could care for children, though no data are available in the CPS on these possibilities. Feng and colleagues 16 have cautioned that older people might become primary caregivers in this scenario, which puts this sensitive group at greater risk of infection.

What we know about distancing policies is based largely on models of influenza, 4, 17 in which children are a vulnerable group for morbidity. Anderson and colleagues 18 emphasised that children do not appear to be a sensitive group to COVID-19, and preliminary data on COVID-19 suggest that children are a small fraction of cases and might be less vulnerable than older adults. 19 If these early results hold up, then the already uncertain benefits of transmission reduction from school closures will be reduced compared with those from influenza. Conversely, school closures might be implemented earlier in COVID-19 outbreaks, which might lead to greater levels of prevented cases. Furthermore, school closures might lead to other adults staying home, which could also reduce cases.

Respiratory droplets and contact are the main routes of transmission of COVID-19 [2] . However, the fetal-oral routes may also be a potential human-to-human transmission [3, 4] . Admittedly, recent studies have reported the detection of the virus (SARS-COV-2) in feces [4] [5] [6] . SARS-COV-2 infects human cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [7] , and the expression of ACE2 in the small intestine is significantly higher than that in the lung [8] . In theory, the intestine is the target organ for SARS-COV-2 infection. In fact, diarrhea as a bowel symptom is not rare in COVID-19 patients. Although the occurrence of diarrhea is not as high as that of fever and cough, it may be the first symptom of COVID-19. Here, we summarized the occurrence of diarrhea that are currently publicly available (Table 1) . A total of 2506 COVID-19 patients were included, of which 145 had diarrhea before admission and the overall occurrence of diarrhea was 5.8% (145/2506). In our own data, the occurrence of diarrhea is 6.3% (4/64) (not yet published). Differential occurrence of diarrhea across studies may be due to different criteria for determining diarrhea. Another possible reason is that the patient's bowel movements were not listed as the focus of observation. In general, diarrhea is not a common symptom in patients with COVID-19. More attention is needed because diarrhea is a reminder that SARS-COV-2 invades the intestine. In autopsy reports of patients with COVID-19, staged narrowing and expansion of the small intestine may be a more intuitive warning [9] . Future research should focus on how long SARS-COV-2 persists in the feces of COVID-19 patients with diarrhea. This helps to better manage discharged patients and to properly dispose of the patients' feces, thereby avoiding potential sources of SARS-COV-2. Clinicians, especially digestive physicians, should pay close attention to the atypical symptoms of COVID-19 and take personal protection against the feces of patients. When discharged from home, patients with COVID-19 should pay special attention to hand hygiene and avoid sharing toilets with family members.

Given the high attack rate [77] [78] [79] and prolonged aerosolization of this virus, [20] augmented infection control and containment training for OR, ICU and floor teams is necessary. [73, 80] Teams should seek to minimize AGPs and limit the length of these procedures whenever possible. For example, anesthesia may consider avoiding bag-mask ventilation, employing rapid sequence intubation techniques, and applying intratracheal or intravenous lidocaine to avoid postoperative coughing. [81, 82] specific multilevel risks of surgery and potential compromise in oncologic efficacy with deliveryrisks of alternative therapies in the context ofa multidisciplinary setting discussion andalong with shared patient-provider decision-making. Despite the amplified risks, surgery will still be indicated for many patients and appropriate preparation will be critical to ensure the safety of the patient, provider and all other involved HCWs. Legend AGE: aerosol-generating event; AGP: aerosol-generating procedure; TLM: transoral laser microsurgery; TORS: transoral robotic surgery *: Frequent, serial re-evaluation of patient-and surgical-risk will be required, particularly with anticipated improvements in management of patient-level risk. At the time of manuscript submission: there is known COVID-19 community spread with unknown disease prevalence; 1% of patients develop symptoms 14 days after exposure; among patients who develop symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 incubates for a median of five-days during which time viral shedding occurs; ~15% of COVID-19-positive individuals are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic throughout the course of their disease; ~20% of patients with COVID-19 will have exhibit false negative SARS-CoV-2 tests. Therefore, there is justification for a conservative assessment of patient-risk for COVID-19. Despite this judicious approach, a ""low-risk"" patient could still be COVID-19 positive, particularly if the patient is not reliable, does not report breaches in quarantine or positive symptoms, or is asymptomatic with a false-negative test. Improved COVID-19 test sensitivity and faster specimen processing, analysis and result generation may be reasonably feasible and could substantially improve management of patient-level risk. **: Surgery-and post-surgery-specific risks may diverge according to this algorithm. For example, a patient undergoing a parotidectomy with neck dissection would present medium surgery-specific risk of COVID-19 transmission to operating room personnel and low-post-surgery-specific-risk of nosocomial COVID-19 or transmission to HCWs involved in postoperative care -assuming admission to a designated, COVID-19-free unit. A patient undergoing partial glossectomy for an early-stage oral cavity cancer and neck dissection without free tissue transfer would present high-surgery-specific risk of COVID-19 transmission to operating room personnel and medium post-surgery-specific risk of nosocomial COVID-19 or transmission to HCWs involved in postoperative care.",28.652518346033364,10.8775407050477

To date, the clinical characteristics of COVID-19-infected cancer patients are largely unknown. Patients and methods： ： ： ：In this retrospective cohort study, we included cancer patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 from three designated hospitals in Wuhan, China. The clinical data were collected from medical records from Jan 13, 2020, to Feb 26, 2020. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the risk factors associated with severe events defined as a condition requiring admission to an intensive care unit, the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. Results: 28 COVID-19-infected cancer patients were included; 17 (60.7%) patients were male. Median age was 65.0 years (IQR:56.0-70.0). Lung cancer was the most frequent cancer type (7, 25.0%). 8 (28.6%) patients were suspected to be from hospital-associated transmission. The following clinical features were shown in our cohort: fever (23, 82.1%), dry cough (22, 81%) and dyspnoea (14, 50.0%), along with lymphopaenia (23, 82.1%), high level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (23, 82.1%), anaemia (21, 75.0%) and hypoproteinaemia (25, 89.3%).

Unlike traditional natural ventilation systems, natural ventilation today depends on modern computer control system, modern design of ventilation openings, assisting fan design, etc. Thus, if properly designed, natural ventilation can also be reliable, in particular if combined with a mechanical system using the hybrid ventilation principle [22] .

It is important to mention here that although the cerebral damage may complicate a COVID-19 infection, it appears that it is the widespread dysregulation of homeostasis caused by pulmonary, renal, cardiac, and circulatory damage that proves fatal in COIVD-19 patients. With that being said, a dominant cerebral involvement alone with the potential of causing cerebral edema in COVID-19 can take a lead in causing death long before systemic homeostatic dysregulation sets in. Access of the COVID-19 virus to the brain via the transcribrial route, as described previously for other CNS targeting pathogens, 7 could have been the case in a recently reported patient with hyposmia and the cases of acute respiratory failure in COVID-19, 5 which needs to be further elucidated by isolating the SARS-CoV-2 virus from the zones that are in proximity to the olfactory bulb. It is expected that the differences in the sequence of spike proteins between COVID-19 virus and SARS-CoV ( Figure 2A ) will enable scientists to identify epitopes in COVID-19 virus for the development of monoclonal antibodies against this virus. With the recent COVID-19 outbreak, there is an urgent need to understand the neurotropic potential of the COVID-19 virus in order to prioritize and individualize the treatment protocols based on the severity of the disease and predominant organ involvement. Also, a staging system based on the severity and organ involvement is needed in COVID-19 in order to rank the patients for aggressive or conventional treatment modalities.

Most of the evidence of ACE2 expression in the brain ( Figure 1 ) comes from literature and mammalian tissue expression databases, 2 which prompted us to investigate neurotropic effects of SARS-CoV-2 and its contribution toward the morbidity and mortality of patients with COVID-19. 3.1. Evidence of the Distribution of ACE2 in the Human Brain. The brain has been reported to express ACE2 receptors ( Figure 1A , C) that have been detected over glial cells and neurons, which makes them a potential target of COVID-19. Previous studies have shown the ability of SARS-CoV to cause neuronal death in mice by invading the brain via the nose close to the olfactory epithelium. 3 The contribution of the neurotropic potential of SARS-CoV-2 in patients reported in the recent outbreak of COVID-19 remains to be established. In the SARS-CoV infections that were reported in the past, autopsy findings of the patients have shown strong evidence of the presence of SARS-CoV by electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and real-time reverse transcription-PCR 3 . Patients with acute SARS-CoV illness have also demonstrated the presence of the virus in cerebrospinal fluid. The role of the blood-brain barrier in containing the virus and preventing it from gaining access to the neural tissues needs to be further explored in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Recently, a study posted in medRxiv 4 has reported neurological manifestations in COVID-19 in the current outbreak that involved 214 patients, of which 78 (36.4%) patients had neurologic manifestations, which affirms our rationale of the neurotropic potential in the COVID-19 virus.

Patients who test positive for the novel coronavirus will, at a minimum, require a 14-day quarantine per CDC recommendations. 15 At the other end of the spectrum, cancer patients with immunosuppression may require hospitalization and isolation precautions, thereby preventing the continuation of radiation treatments. Data from a report of the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 showed that 6.1% of patients required intensive care, mechanical ventilation or died. 16 Although it is yet unclear how the virus will behave in the US, the situations in China and Italy suggest the burden on hospitals and intensive care units will be significant. Additionally, this study demonstrated that pneumonia and lymphocytopenia were prominent at 91.1% and 83.2%, respectively, which would impact decisions to hold off on treatments pending improvements in the patient's clinical status and immune recovery. 16 These treatment interruptions would be of utmost concern in tumors for which treatment package time significantly impacts outcomes such as head and neck and cervical tumors. 17, 18 However, this is also of concern in lung tumors and other thoracic tumors, for both tumor control and the lungs potentially lying in the path of treatment beams. Treatments would likely need to be paused while monitoring the course of COVID-19 in this setting. Treatment delays may also be due strains on the healthcare system in the setting of a pandemic due to travel restrictions, availability of workforce, and/or lack of access to hospital care. 19 If possible, travel restrictions for the general public should be tailored for patients with cancer, such as being done currently in Italy. 20 Little data exists currently to guide radiation treatment decisions in the setting of a pandemic. However, we may borrow insight from the response of Radiation Oncology clinics during Hurricane Maria. As per Gay et al, mitigating the impact of a natural disaster on cancer patients requires 4 components or ""PCOC"": prepare, communicate, operate, compensate. 21 In preparing, consideration should be made for scenarios which may require delayed treatment starts, or shorter fractionation regimens (i.e. hypofractionation), given that COVID-19 poses a substantial immediate risk for elderly patients. Again, there is a paucity of data to guide these decisions and priority should be given to higher risk tumors (H&N, Cervix, Lung, etc.), which are nicely referenced in the Hurricane Maria review.

In China, although containment measures have significantly reduced new cases of COVID-19, in other countries, this reduction has not been similar. In Colombia, despite the implementation of the rules established by the national government, exists an elevate concern both for mortality and for the limited capacity of the health system to respond effectively to the needs of patients infected and requiring intensive care by the respiratory complications associated with this infection. 1 The data collected so far on the number of infected people and the evolution of the epidemic are imprecise. Even though to date in Colombia (March 19, 2020) there are no deaths yet, nor patients in intensive care by COVID-19, the diagnoses of infection by SARS-CoV-2 have increased (Fig. 1) . In this country, since the first case was reported (March 6, 2020), the number of infected patients follows an exponential trend, like other countries in the region, except Ecuador, with a lower incidence. If this trend continues, in a week (until March 26, 2020) or two (April 2, 2020), there will be 2581 and 40,535 infected patients, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2 . 1, 2 According with the Knowledge of this infection so far, the high-risk age groups are among the people over 60 years of age, primarily due to the burden of disease and the complications that this infection generates in them. Regarding to the current COVID-19 data available from Colombia, the proportion of patients in that age group is 15%, and of them, 4.7% needing hospitalizing, proportion which is lower than in other age groups. Additionally, as of March 19, most cases are imported (64%). 3 On the other hand, according to the official reports of the World Health Organization (updated to March 19, 2020), in Latin American countries the first cases of mortality by COVID-19 occurred in Argentina after the 12th day of the first case was diagnosed, and in Panama was the first death was reported after the sixth day. This situation differs from European countries, where COVID-19 associated deaths started until after the 23rd of the first diagnosis (France). Additionally, the reports curve of some European countries has a slower start compared to Latin American countries. This situation may be due to a higher degree of alertness in this region, motivated by the experiences of European and Asian countries, leading to earlier diagnostic tests (early detection).

SARS was eventually contained by means of syndromic surveillance, prompt isolation of patients, strict enforcement of quarantine of all contacts, and in some areas top-down enforcement of community quarantine. By interrupting all human-to-human transmission, SARS was effectively eradicated. By contrast, by Feb 28, 2020, within a matter of 2 months since the beginning of the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), more than 82 000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported with more than 2800 deaths. Although there are striking similarities between SARS and COVID-19, the differences in the virus characteristics will ultimately determine whether the same measures for SARS will also be successful for COVID-19. COVID-19 differs from SARS in terms of infectious period, transmissibility, clinical severity, and extent of community spread.

Moreover, unemployed populations and informal or so-called zero-hours contract workers will experience further impoverishment, which increases risk of tuberculosis. 5 Amid the expanding COVID-19 pandemic, our plea on World Tuberculosis Day is that we do not forget the tuberculosis pandemic, which, at present, is still the leading cause of infectious disease mortality. We need to continue to mobilise funding for research for better tuberculosis diagnostics, vaccine development, novel therapeutics, equitable access to care, and innovative social protection interventions for tuberculosis-affected households. 5 We should drastically increase and sustain investment in health systems that are responsive to the needs of the poor and resilient to the threat of infections, especially those that are air-borne and require isolation facilities.

Both cause major infection-related morbidity and mortality around the world. Tuberculosis was the leading cause of mortality from an infectious disease worldwide in 2018, causing 1·2 million deaths. 1 COVID-19 has infected more than 300 000 people and caused over 13 000 deaths in the first quarter of 2020 alone. 2 Both COVID-19 and tuberculosis can present with respiratory symptoms, and diagnosis and treatment of people with tuberculosis, or tuberculosis and COVID-19 co-infection, are likely to be compromised during the COVID-19 pandemic. Older people and those with comorbidities are at increased risk of severe disease and adverse outcomes in both diseases. 3, 4 And, as we are discovering for COVID-19, both diseases have considerable social impact-including stigma, discrimination, and isolation-in addition to the economic impact from country productivity losses and catastrophic costs to individuals and households. 5 There are also stark differences. While tuberculosis is a slow pandemic and has accompanied humankind for millennia, 6 the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19 is new and spreading rapidly around the world. Tuberculosis has been labelled a pandemic many times over the past three centuries, whereas this is the first COVID-19 pandemic. Children are less severely affected by COVID-19, whereas 1·1 million children had tuberculosis disease in 2018, of whom 200 000 died. 1 The vast majority of cases and deaths from tuberculosis occur in low-income and middle-income countries, whereas high-income countries have low rates. 1 By contrast, Europe became the second epicentre of COVID-19 after China, which might explain, in part, why COVID-19 can be expected to mobilise more global resources and person-power in a year than tuberculosis has in decades. However, underprepared and vulnerable countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Central and South America might soon see substantial rises in COVID-19 cases and deaths, and concerted, collective action must be taken now to avoid catastrophe. 7 There are many unknowns. The clinical and epidemiological interactions of COVID-19 with tuberculosis (with or without HIV) are likely to be highly complex. Simply put, tuberculosis transmission might rise because of increased respiratory symptoms associated with COVID-19, or decline owing to COVID-19-related self-isolation and quarantine. There is increasing recognition of the millions of people treated for tuberculosis who have residual, long-term lung damage 8 who are likely to be at a higher risk of severe disease and death from COVID-19. Because of extreme pressures on health systems, exacerbated by COVID-19, people with tuberculosis are likely to face decreased access to diagnostic and treatment services, which might also result in adverse outcomes.",34.99130514957173,11.471149424654069

[68] [69] [70] Therapeutic options that could be evaluated and used for COVID-19 include molecules binding to the virus, molecules, or inhibitors that target specific enzymes involved in viral replication and transcription, small-molecule inhibitors targeting helicase, essential proteases, or other proteins of the virus, host cell protease inhibitors, host cell endocytosis inhibitors, siRNA, anti-sense RNA and ribozyme, neutralizing antibodies, mAbs targeting host receptor or interfere with S1 RBD, antiviral peptide targeting S2, and natural products. 2, 11 There is a long list of anti-CoV agents, mostly preclinical compounds yet to be evaluated as anti-COVID-19 agents. Some of these agents are in phase III trials for COVID-19, including remdesivir, oseltamivir, ASC09F (HIV protease inhibitor), lopinavir, ritonavir, darunavir, and cobicistat. 71 Many existing MERS-and/or SARS-CoVs inhibitors can be screened for efficacy. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) sequence of SARS-CoV-2 has shown 96% identity to that of SARS-CoV, a critical finding since drugs developed for SARS-CoV RdRp might show similar efficacy for SARS-CoV -2 RdRp. 28 S protein is considered the major target for designing CoV antiviral therapies such as S protein inhibitors, S cleavage inhibitors, neutralizing antibodies, RBD-ACE2 blockers, siRNAs, fusion core blockers, and protease inhibitors. 19 All such therapeutic strategies have shown potential in vitro and/ or in vivo anti-CoV activities. Comparatively, even though in vitro studies performed with these agents have shown efficacy, most of them lack sufficient support due to the lack of randomized animal or human trials, hence of limited use for COVID-19. Hence, the necessary support of extensive animal and human trials is required for such therapeutics to become useful. The binding of COVID-19 and ACE2 affects the balance of renin-angiotensin system (RAS), potentially leading to exacerbation of severe pneumonia. Thus, it is speculated that ACEI and angiotensin type-1 receptor (AT1R) inhibitors might be able to reduce pulmonary inflammatory responses, thereby reducing the mortality. 72 The guidance to COVID-19 control might be based on existing measures for MERS and SARS, with some further precautions due to the unknown nature of this new CoV. 14, 73 The main treatments such as mechanical ventilation, ICU admission, and symptomatic and supportive care are recommended for severe cases. Furthermore, RNA synthesis inhibitors (like 3TC, TDF), remdesivir, neuraminidase inhibitors, peptide (EK1), anti-inflammatory drugs, abidol, Chinese traditional medicine, such as Lianhuaqingwen and ShuFengJieDu Capsules, could be the promising COVID-19 treatments. 2 However, further clinical trials are required for confirming safety and efficacy for COVID-19. A major limiting factor in the quest for identifying an ideal vaccine or therapeutic agent is time. It may take months to even several years for researchers to develop, produce, standardize, evaluate, approve, and commercialize therapeutic agents for COVID-19. Hence, current efforts should be directed toward identifying and evaluating drugs and immunotherapeutics that have proven efficacy against viruses similar to COVID-19.",32.486230899370234,13.153394752062145

Another option is to repurpose broadly acting antiviral drugs used for other viral infections. Such drugs have the advantage of easy availability, known pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, solubility, stability, side effects, and also well-established dosing regimens. 4 Repurposed drugs are potential therapeutic options managing CoV infections. Repurposed drugs such as lopinavir/ ritonavir and interferon-1β possess in vitro anti-MERS-CoV activity. The in vivo study conducted in common marmosets (non-human primate model) showed that animals treated with lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-1β had better outcomes than untreated animals. 74 The combination of lopinavir-ritonavir and interferon-1β is being evaluated for MERS in the MIRACLE trial. 75 The same two protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir, when combined with ribavirin, were found to be associated with favorable clinical responses in SARS patients indicating therapeutic efficacy. 10 As an early attempt to evaluate these repurposed drugs in COVID-19, a controlled trial of ritonavirboosted lopinavir and interferon-α 2b therapy has been registered for hospitalized patients in China (ChiCTR2000029308). 76 Oral administration of neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir has been used as an empirical drug for COVID-19 suspected cases in China hospitals even though there is no evidence of its efficacy. 2 Recently, the in vitro antiviral efficacy of approved drugs such as ribavirin, penciclovir, nitazoxanide, nafamostat, and chloroquine was compared with that of the two broad-spectrum antiviral drugs remdesivir and favipiravir for COVID-19. Among the evaluated drugs, both remdesivir and chloroquine were found to be highly effective in controlling COVID-19 in vitro. 63 The study also pointed out that the three nucleoside analogs such as ribavirin, penciclovir, and favipiravir may not have significant in vivo antiviral effects against COVID-19 since higher concentrations were required to reduce the viral infection in vitro.

By March 10, 2020, 116 166 cases have been reported globally, causing 4088 deaths. The epidemic has spread to 118 countries around the world. 2 With immunocompromised status and physiological adaptive changes during pregnancy, pregnant women could be more susceptible to COVID-19 infection than the general population. As COVID-19 is rapidly spreading, maternal management and fetal safety become a major concern, but there is scarce information of assessment and management of pregnant women infected with COVID-19, and the potential risk of vertical transmission is unclear. In The Lancet Infectious Diseases, Nan Yu and colleagues 3 report the clinical features and obstetric and neonatal outcomes of pregnancy with COVID-19 pneumonia in Wuhan, China. Seven pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia were assessed and the onset symptoms were similar to those reported in non-pregnant adults with COVID-19. All patients received oxygen therapy and antiviral treatment in isolation. All patients had caesarean section after consultation with a multidisciplinary team and the outcomes of the pregnant women and neonates were good. Three neonates were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and one was found to be infected with COVID-19 36 h after birth. The findings of the study provide some indications for clinical assessment and management of pregnant women with COVID-19, but questions remain on how to manage pregnant women infected with COVID-19.",34.020337443378764,13.115123871753136

Thus, an assessment of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with novel approaches is essential to the global debate. This study is the first to develop both time series and panel data models to construct conceptual tools that examine the nexus between death from COVID-19 and confirmed cases. We collected daily data on four health indicators namely deaths, confirmed cases, suspected cases, and recovered cases across 31 Provinces/States in China. Due to the complexities of the COVID-19, we investigated the unobserved factors including environmental exposures accounting for the disease spread through human-to-human transmission. We used estimation methods capable of controlling for cross-sectional dependence, endogeneity, and unobserved heterogeneity. We predict the impulse-response between confirmed cases of COVID-19 and COVID-19-attributable deaths. Our study reveals that the effect of confirmed cases on the novel coronavirus attributable deaths is heterogeneous across Provinces/States in China. We find a linear relationship between COVID-19 attributable deaths and confirmed cases whereas a nonlinear relationship is confirmed for the nexus between recovery cases and confirmed cases. The empirical evidence reveals that an increase in confirmed cases by 1% increases coronavirus attributable deaths by~0.10%-~1.71% (95% CI).

In such a scenario, differentiating whether the cause of death is specifically due to COVID-19 or the result of treatment limitations can be difficult. Among patients who die before reaching the hospital, some will present too late in the course of the disease to be saved, whereas end-of-life care will be viewed as preferable for others because little chance of survival with a meaningful quality of life exists. In some patients, this decision might be influenced by known individual preferences. Similarly, not all critically ill patients in hospital will be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), because the chances of meaningful survival for some will be viewed as too low; 8 for these patients, non-invasive ventilation and perhaps even some vasopressor support could be provided in so-called middle care units, but in case of further deterioration, mechanical ventilation will not be considered and death will occur because of severe hypoxaemia. As noted by Phua and colleagues, 1 a quarter of patients who died early in the Wuhan, China, outbreak did not receive invasive ventilation. 9 Patients who deteriorate despite mechanical ventilation can be placed on resource-intensive ECMO systems (figure). 10 The decision not to use ECMO might be made because the support system is not available or because such care is considered to be disproportionate in the context of limited staff numbers. The same considerations might apply to patients who develop renal failure. Use of renal replacement therapies is uncommon in those with COVID-19, 4,6,7 although acute kidney injury might occur in a third of patients.",38.71443559150707,16.197997408084905

First, for patients admitted to the ICU, death might occur despite full intensive care support, including mechanical ventilation, ECMO, vasopressors, and renal replacement therapy. On modern ICUs, such deaths are expected to be infrequent; however, robust estimates of the number of deaths cannot be made from the mostly descriptive reports currently available. A second possible scenario for ICU and hospital patients is related to limitation of life-sustaining therapies because of poor predicted outcomes associated with old age, frailty, comorbidities, or profound disability, or because of effects of distributive limitations associated with lack of personnel, beds, or materials. A combination of these two factors often exists. A third scenario relates to patients admitted to the ICU or hospital whose deaths are not directly related to COVID-19. Especially in areas with high infection rates, patients might be admitted to the ICU with, for example, severe trauma or acute brain injury, test positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the ICU stay, and eventually die because of the initial injury; these deaths will still be attributed to COVID-19 and included in the statistics. Similarly, some patients might have SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the actual contribution of the virus to the patient's death might be minimal. For example, in a patient with metastatic cancer or terminal organ failure, is the viral infection or the patient's underlying condition the cause of death? The actual role of SARS-CoV-2 infection in such deaths is particularly difficult to evaluate in countries where only one cause can be reported on a death certificate.",37.11093733607433,14.337007878865258

In patients with severe CAP who develop hypoxemic respiratory insufficiency, noninvasive mechanical ventilation is associated with a significant reduction in the need for endotracheal intubation and mortality at 30 days when compared to initial oxygen therapy delivering high inspired fractions of oxygen. An initial therapeutic test with noninvasive mechanical ventilation with strict monitoring of failure indicators is, therefore, recommended. 121, 122 High risk patients should be carefully assessed on admission using any of the prediction rules, and should be reevaluated frequently to ensure early detection of any deterioration in clinical or oximetric parameters.

This procedure might avoid the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation because it provides high concentrations of humidified oxygen, low levels of positive endexpiratory pressure, and can facilitate the elimination of carbon dioxide. 4 WHO guidelines support the use of high-flow nasal oxygen in some patients, but they urge close monitoring for clinical deterioration that could result in the need for emergent intubations because such procedures might increase the risk of infection to health-care workers. 5 For patients with COVID-19 who require endotracheal intubation, use of low tidal volume (6 mL/kg per predicted bodyweight) with a plateau airway pressure of less than 30 cm H 2 O, and increasing the respiratory rate to 35 breaths per min as needed, is the mainstay of lungprotective ventilation. If the hypoxaemia progresses to a PaO 2 :FiO 2 ratio of less than 100-150 mm Hg, there are several therapeutic options. The level of positive endexpiratory pressure can be increased by 2-3 cm H 2 O every 15-30 min to improve oxygen saturation to 88-90%, with the goal of maintaining a plateau airway pressure of less than 30 cm H 2 O. Lower driving pressures (plateau airway pressure minus positive end-expiratory pressure) with a target of 13-15 cm H 2 O can also be used. If the patient is not responding to adjustment of the level of positive end-expiratory pressure, additional strategies might stabilise them. Recruitment manoeuvres probably have little value, 6 prone positioning should be instituted, unless there is a specific contraindication, and can be initiated along with the interventions already described. For persistent refractory hypoxaemia even with prone positioning, neuromuscular blockade, and efforts to optimise positive end-expiratory pressure therapy, there are additional options. Inhaled 5-20 ppm NO might improve oxygenation. Insertion of an oesophageal balloon to measure transpulmonary pressures to set an optimal positive end-expiratory pressure can be considered in patients with moderate-to-severe obesity, although a 2019 trial in patients with ARDS did not show the benefit of this procedure in most patients. 7 Fluid management is important to consider as a measure to reduce pulmonary oedema. 8 In the absence of shock, fluid conservative therapy is recommended to achieve a negative fluid balance of 0·5 to 1·0 L per day. In the presence of shock, fluid balance might be achieved with renal replacement therapy, especially if there is associated acute kidney injury and oliguria. Antibiotics should be considered since secondary bacterial infections have been reported in patients with COVID-19. 9 Glucocorticoids should be avoided in view of the evidence that they can be harmful in cases of viral pneumonia and ARDS from influenza. 10 Rescue therapy with high-dose vitamin C can also be considered. 11 Finally, ECMO should be considered using the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the EOLIA trial. 3 Since treatment of severe ARDS from COVID-19 is an ongoing challenge, it is important to learn from the patients who have been treated to gain an understanding of the disease's epidemiology, biological mechanisms, and the effects of new pharmacological interventions. Currently, there are some research groups working to coordinate and disseminate key information, including information on patients who have been treated with ECMO for COVID-19, although an accurate estimate of the number of such patients is not currently available. The Extracorporeal Life Support Organization is an international non-profit consortium that plans to maintain a registry of patients to facilitate an improved understanding of how ECMO is being used for patients with COVID-19.",26.194756370424283,13.475767945819765

Some studies suggest a high rate of AKI events upon COVID-19 infection, whereas a recent study from Wuhan, China, reported that AKI happened in <5% of the hospitalized patients with this viral infection. 11 As more studies are underway, it is prudent that during an active COVID-19 we ensure the mitigation of PEW risk and immediate correction of PEW in all patients with kidney diseases including transplant recipients. We encourage adequate protein and calorie intake, be it enterally or parenterally, so that any occurrence of hypokalemia or hypophosphatemia can be avoided and that PEW, sarcopenia and cachexia can be prevented or immediately corrected. 12 In the midst of this serious infection there is no role for delaying nutrition support or for low protein, low phosphorus, or low potassium regimens if the patient has COVID-19 infection. 13 Therefore, the need to supervise the nutrition regimens of patients with kidney diseases may be enhanced during this period and should not be ignored while focusing on other, seemingly more urgent, matters.

The challenge is even greater in patients with diabetic and hypertensive kidney disorders or proteinuric patients, since many of them have received ACE inhibitors or ARB agents. Additionally, emerging data suggest that derivatives of the antimalarial agent quinine such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may help against COVID-19 infection; some of these drugs are actively used in infected dialysis patients. 1 While clinical trials are underway to test these and other agents and related hypotheses, an important question for the nutrition community is whether there are certain nutrients and food patterns that can prevent the viral infection or mitigate its severity.

[3] Since 2002 there have been two other global outbreaks of highly-pathogenic coronaviruses: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). While SARS and MERS are not identical to SARS-CoV-2 in their genetic structures or clinical manifestations, the recent outbreaks of these viruses may provide insights on the effects of COVID-19 in the context of pregnancy. The literature on SARS and MERS in pregnancy are limited to a handful of case reports and series. [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] Many of these cases involved severe morbidity including the need for intensive care and cardiorespiratory support. Notably, there were cases of maternal mortality associated with SARS and MERS infection. The only published case-control study showed that pregnant women with SARS experienced worse outcomes than nonpregnant women of similar age. [10] Reports varied with respect to the effects of SARS and MERS on pregnancy outcomes. Spontaneous abortion has been reported among women infected with SARS and MERS in the first trimester.4 As well, stillbirth, intrauterine growth restriction, and preterm birth have been reported in pregnancies affected by SARS and MERS in the second and third trimesters. [4, 9] It is important to note, however, that a number of pregnancies had good outcomes despite maternal infection with SARS or MERS. [6, 7, 8] Broadly speaking, and drawing upon our knowledge of other respiratory illnesses in pregnancy, adverse It remains to be seen whether the effects of COVID-19 on pregnant women and their fetuses will be similar to those of SARS and MERS. To date, the reported case-fatality rate for the general population infected with COVID-19 is lower than that of either SARS or MERS (estimated at 1%-2% vs. 9%-10% and 35%-40%, respectively). Similarly, by now, there have been over 60 cases of pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 in China and the vast majority of these women have had mild to moderate pneumonia. [11, 12, 13, 14] To date here has been one case of severe maternal morbidity secondary to COVID-19 reported. [12] This 31-year-old woman was infected at 34 weeks gestation and went on to experience severe respiratory compromise and multi-organ dysfunction requiring extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The pregnancy outcomes of the reported cases have been largely good, [11, 12, 13] with spontaneous and iatrogenic preterm labour being the most commonly reported adverse pregnancy outcomes. One stillbirth has been reported and this occurred in the case of severe maternal illness reported by Liu et al. [12] Given the limited data, it is too early to determine if higher rates of adverse outcomes are expected in pregnant women infected with COVID-19. As with SARS and MERS, pregnancy outcomes are likely to be strongly correlated with degree of maternal illness. [12] There has been no evidence of vertical (mother-to-infant) transmission found in any cases of SARS, MERS, or COVID-19. Additionally, analyses of amniotic fluid, serum, placenta, and breastmilk from pregnant women confirmed to have SARS or COVID-19 infection have found no detectable viral RNA, [8, 13] further supporting that vertical transmission is unlikely. Importantly, maternal infection with SARS, MERS, or COVID-19 has not been associated with teratogenicity. However, because of the small number of reported cases of infection during the first trimester (when embryogenesis occurs), risk of congenital anomaly associated with COVID-19 cannot be completely excluded.",31.226650258897905,11.71690242424578

Patients in whom NIV was successful had shorter hospital stays and lower mortality rates, similar to those of the nonventilated patients. The mortality of patients in whom NIV failed was similar to that of the patients requiring intubation from the start. 18 Another critical preparedness task was to ensure a safe hospital environment for other patients and for health care workers (HCWs) during an epidemic.

When no or few cases of disease have been reported in a country, laboratory testing is restricted to travellers presenting with an acute respiratory syndrome and coming from regions or countries with widespread transmission. When contact tracing efforts are implemented, criteria for laboratory testing often include symptomatic contacts of confirmed cases or asymptomatic contacts during or after quarantine. After local transmission is established, some countries, such as South Korea, have chosen to test all individuals who have acute respiratory syndrome or who have had contact with a confirmed case. 3 Because of limited testing capacity, other countries, such as Italy or Spain, have restricted laboratory testing to those seeking hospital care for severe COVID symptoms or to those prone to severe disease (the elderly and patients with comorbidities). 4 Thus, curves based on confirmed cases in countries that have been changing the testing recommendations and are now using stringent testing criteria could provide a false impression of flattening (or unmask much steeper curves), which could lead to misinterpretation of the status of the epidemic. By contrast, and as a basic epidemiological concept, comparisons of the number of COVID-19 cases by country or region should be adjusted by the size of the population at risk, using incidence risks (ie, new cases in a population at risk within a specified period of time, also called attack rates in the context of an epidemic). Similarly, mortality is better expressed as mortality risk (ie, number of deaths in a specific time interval divided by population size among which deaths occurred, commonly referred to as mortality rate; figure) and, if possible, should be stratified by age, given the differences in age-specific mortality rates for COVID-19 5,6 and the differential age structure by country. When the epidemic is contained and all cases are identified and contacts traced, absolute number of cases would still be an acceptable indicator if testing criteria have not changed. However, the capacity of countries to detect imported cases varies but is generally poor, estimated to be around 38% at the global level. 7 Thus, the crucial question is how to monitor disease burden when local transmission is widespread and a large proportion of the population has been quarantined or confined at home. We believe that the basic principle is to try to select an indicator that includes the numerator that is least affected by changing testing criteria and that is adjusted by population size. In regions with strong hospital admission or mortality surveillance systems, such an indicator could be the incidence risk of hospital admissions of laboratory-confirmed cases and COVID-19 mortality rates, which should provide a reliable picture of the epidemic, with the following assumptions: (1) most people with severe disease are admitted to hospital and are tested for SARS-CoV-2;",27.116362231481837,12.163509261735348

Children have lungs that are still developing and typically have fewer comorbidities than adults with ALI. Nevertheless, a new theme from animal studies is that the interactions between the mechanical ventilator in the lungs of children might be different than in adults. Smith et al compared the pulmonary responses of juvenile (3 wk, 5-7 gm) and adult (16 wk, 25-30 gm) mice in a model in which the mice were treated with intratracheal LPS, then subjected to mechanical ventilation for 2 or four hours 26 . The adult mice had a synergistic increase in lung inflammation and protein permeability, as compared with animals treated with LPS alone, or mechanical ventilation alone. In contrast, a synergistic interaction between LPS treatment and mechanical ventilation was not found in the juvenile mice. This suggests that the adverse interactions between innate immunity and mechanical stretch increase with age. Microarray studies showed that there were major differences in clusters of genes activated in the juvenile and adult lungs in response to LPS and mechanical ventilation and suggested pathways that might be responsible for the different responses of juveniles and adults. Alvira and associates treated neonatal and adult mice with intraperitoneal LPS and found that lung inflammation and apoptosis occurred in adult but not neonatal mice 98 . This was associated with persistent activation of NF-kappaB p65/p50 heterodimers in the neonates, whereas in the adults there was initial activation of NF-kappaB p65/p50 followed by sustained activation of NF-kappaB p50/p50 homodimers. Developmental differences in NF-kappaB activation could influence the severity or outcome of pulmonary infections, or the pulmonary response to mechanical ventilation.

Despite surgical tracheostomies being routinely performed in the surgeon's daily practice, the surgeon's risk of exposure to COVID-19 during this procedure is consistent. Due to the direct access to the airway and the mechanical ventilation, which generates a huge amount of droplets in case of air-leakage from the cuff, tracheostomies place surgeons to be the highest risk category, together with ICU nurses and doctors.

An important factor is older age; studies have shown that older patients are at substantially higher risk of death. In a study from China, the mortality rate among patients aged 50 years and over was 13 times that for patients aged <50 years (10) . In another study, every 10-year increase in age was associated with twofold increase in death (11) . In a study from Hong Kong, multivariate analysis revealed that those who are older than 60 years (relative risk, 5.10; confidence interval (CI), 2.30-11.31]; P < 0.001) and lactate dehydrogenase level greater than 3.8 m kat/L at presentation (relative risk, 2.20 [CI, 1.03-4.71]; P = 0.04) were independent predictors of mortality (12) . Comorbidities, especially diabetes mellitus but heart disease as well, have also been repeatedly demonstrated to be risk factors for adverse outcomes in SARS (4) . The aforementioned risk factors were noted in a Toronto study of 196 patients with SARS (13) . Thirty-eight (19%) SARS patients became critically ill. The interquartile range age of the 38 patients was 57.4 (39.0-69.6) years. The median duration between initial symptoms and admission to the intensive care unit was 8 (5-10) days. Twenty-nine (76%) required mechanical ventilation. At 28 days, mortality was 13 (34%) of 38 patients, and for those requiring mechanical ventilation, mortality was 13 (45%) of 29.

Patients who died were more often older, had preexisting diabetes mellitus, and on admission to the hospital were more likely to have bilateral radiographic infiltrates (13) . High viral load at presentation can also be associated with poor outcomes. In a prospective study from Hong Kong, the following factors were independently associated with worse survival: older age (61-80 years) (adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 5.24, 95% CI 2.03-13.53), presence of an active comorbid condition (adjusted HR 3.36, 95% CI 1.44-7.82) and higher initial viral load of SARS coronavirus, according to quantitative PCR of nasopharyngeal specimens (adjusted HR 1.21 per log 10 increase in number of RNA copies per milliliter, 95% CI 1.06-1.39) (14) .",26.73820969583654,11.023676748998188

Comparing all pairs of V max , V mean and V min values, we found that V max and especially V mean are significantly greater at the 1:2 and 1:3 pump settings, but not at the 1:1 setting. We also found that the end diastolic velocities (V min ) were significant lower during the pump deflation. None of our patients had a significant diastolic flow velocity reversal during the pump deflation. Conclusions Left ventricular support with IABP significantly changed the flow velocity pattern of our patients. The pump significantly increased the V max and the V mean at the 1:2 and 1:3 settings because of pump inflation during the diastole. We suggest that the velocities did not change at the 1:1 setting because the end-diastolic flow velocities reduce during every pulse, according to pump deflation. Background Patients with critical illness can acquire a syndrome of weakness and dependence on mechanical ventilation that has been linked to peripheral nerve and muscle injury. Our aim was to systematically review published data on the diagnosis, risk factors and outcomes of patients with critical illness neuromuscular abnormalities (CINMA). Methods MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library were searched, and studies were included if they reported on ICU patients > 16 years old who were evaluated for CINMA clinically and electrophysiologically, and they contained sufficient data to quantitatively measure the association between CINMA and clinically relevant exposures and/or outcomes. Two reviewers independently extracted data on study methodology and quality, methods for diagnosing CINMA, and CINMA prevalence, risk factors, and outcomes. Results In 1,421 ICU patients who were evaluated in 24 studies, 655 (46%) were diagnosed with CINMA. All enrolled patients were receiving protracted mechanical ventilation, had sepsis, or had multiple organ failure. Diagnostic criteria for CINMA were heterogeneous and few reports explicitly differentiated between the polyneuropathic, myopathic and mixed types of CINMA. CINMA was linked in several studies to hyperglycemia, the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, sepsis, renal replacement therapy, and catecholamine administration. In contrast, across studies there was no consistent relationship between CINMA and patient age, gender, severity of illness, multiple organ failure, and use of glucocorticoids, neuromuscular blockers, aminoglycosides, or midazolam. Mortality was not increased in patients with CINMA, but mechanical ventilation and ICU and hospital stays were prolonged. Conclusions The risk of CINMA is nearly 50% in a subset of ICU patients with sepsis, multiorgan failure, or protracted mechanical ventilation, but there were no data to support CINMA as an independent predictor of death. The impact of frequently cited risk factors is uncertain, but emerging data indicate glycemic control decreases CINMA risk in vulnerable patients.",29.16299647375768,12.400317035115648

For example, aggressive public health steps to contain the spread of the virus locally may make it relatively safe for a patient to start an immunosuppressive therapy. Our concern is that the COVID-19 pandemic may trigger a large number of neurologists and patients to reconsider treatment strategy and choice of initial DMT and to opt for less effective immunomodulatory DMTs. This change needs to be considered carefully. The COVID-19 pandemic in all likelihood will be short lived and it would be unfair to patients treated during the epidemic to be disadvantaged in the long term regarding the management of their MS. Neurologists have spent an extraordinary amount of time and effort to activate the MS community: to advance the principle that 'time is brain', to treat MS proactively to a target of no evident disease activity (NEDA) and more recently, to flip the pyramid and use higher efficacy treatments first line.

Most transplant patients are on triple immunotherapy, compared to pwMS who are on monotherapy and even then, the level of immunosuppression is generally low. Hence, the mortality/morbidity risk to an individual on a DMT, infected with COVID-19, may be actually quite moderate to low. Another hypothesis being considered is that moderate immunosuppression may prevent severe complications associated with COVID-19 infection. The severe pulmonary complications of COVID-19 infection are consistent with ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) caused by an over-exuberant immune response to the virus (Ramanathan et al., 2020) . As a result, several exploratory trials are currently being undertaken in China and elsewhere using immunosuppressants to try and dampen the immune response to the virus. Interestingly, fingolimod, a S1P modulator licensed for MS, is being tested as a treatment for COVID-19 associated ARDS (continued on next page) G. Giovannoni, et al. Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders xxx (xxxx) xxxx (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04280588). Interferon beta is also being trialled in COVID-19 based on its antiviral properties (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04276688). Then there is the virology to take into account. SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, is a new human pathogen that is likely to have recently crossed species (Andersen et al., 2020) . COVID-19 will eventually become endemic and hence pose a seasonal risk to patients on immunosuppressive therapies. As it is a small RNA virus with low fidelity it is likely to mutate rapidly making a one-off vaccine only a partial solution. Vaccines take time to be developed, tested and introduced at a population level. Delaying treatment, de-escalating therapy by switching to immunomodulatory DMTs, such as interferonbeta, glatiramer acetate or teriflunomide, or interrupting dosing of DMTs to wait for a vaccine will delay the adequate treatment of MS, especially as it may take 12-18 months to develop a vaccine. We, therefore, need a pragmatic response on management of the potential threat of COVID-19 in individuals with MS. If patients have active MS they need to be treated based on the clinical evidence at hand and hence may need to be treated with higher efficacy DMTs. This should be implemented in conjunction with appropriate behavioural modifications to reduce or ideally prevent exposure to the virus.",25.335034212300283,10.935485057324355

The authors of a 2015 Cochrane review, summarising three randomised controlled trials consisting of 1089 patients in total, concluded that evidence was insuffi cient to promote the use of either volume-controlled or pressurecontrolled ventilation over the other. 99 Airway-pressurerelease ventilation is used for its ability to maintain a high mean airway pressure-and thus maintain alveolar recruitment-while permitting spontaneous ventilation. Unfortunately, the evidence base is limited by suboptimum control groups in the studies done and concerns about possible high tidal volume and mean airway pressure. 100 Non-invasive ventilation can be tried in mild acute respiratory distress syndrome. A small study 101 of 40 patients showed reduced requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation and a non-signifi cant reduction in mortality with this approach.

Viruses that are associated with human infections have been found on ocular surface tissues or in the tear film. These include, but are not limited to, both DNA and RNA viruses such as adenovirus, other coronaviruses, herpes virus, human immunodeficiency virus, influenza virus, and Zika virus [18, 22, [26] [27] [28] [29] . That said, these viruses are typically found at low levels and it is generally believed that they are not transmitted from the ocular surface (with the exception of adenoviral infections).",24.949894391405522,9.490966368235924

The unbelievable courage of the men and women who provided care to COVID-19 patients, knowing that they might die from the same mysterious illness that was killing their patients, is an example of what is truly remarkable and best about humanity. Their lesson of sacrifice and selfless caring is one that can never be washed away, nor ever diminished. Not ever. To this end, we dedicate this issue of JACC: Basic to Translational Science to the Chinese healthcare workers who died from COVID-19, as well as all of the other health care workers around the world who are caring for COVID-19 patients.

The COVID-19 epidemic is unique because of its scale, the speed of its spread, the lack of pre-existing scientific data and the importance of media coverage. 1 It impelled the hospitals taking charge of the cases to face the many new challenges associated with the outbreak. 2 However, the resilience of health systems in response to COVID-19 is under question, including in high-income countries. 3, 4 Health system resilience can be defined as the capacity of health actors, institutions, and populations to prepare for and effectively respond to crises; maintain core functions when a crisis hits; and, informed by lessons learned during the crisis, reorganise if conditions require it. 5 Bichat-Claude Bernard hospital is a 1000-bed University hospital in Paris belonging to the Assistance Publique -Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP), the largest hospital system in Europe employing more than 90,000 people in 39 hospitals. The hospital is one of the reference centres in France for patients with suspected or confirmed emerging infectious diseases, such as patients with Ebola or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

Considering the speed of transmission of COVID-19, individuals from vulnerable health systems are at particular risk. An example is the Eastern European countries that in recent years faced health system vulnerabilities due to post-communism delayed reforms, corruption, and the emigration of physicians [3] . Romania is a concerning example of a vulnerable health system [3] with the highest governmental instability within the EU [4] , the leadership of the Romanian Ministry of Health changed 25 times in 27 years, a turnover three times higher than in other EU countries [4] . In its recent history, Romania experienced a series of economic crises (in the 1990s, and in late 2000s) which forced an estimated~5 million people to emigrate, including in countries where currently COVID-19 was identified (especially in Italy, Spain, Germany and United Kingdom). Many of these migrants regularly travel back to Romania which increases the likelihood for COVID-19 to spread [1] to Romania. Rising public awareness among migrant travelers and providing hygiene products is highly suggested to limit the spread of COVID-19. After the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Romanian Ministry of Health released late January a set of recommendations and proceeded to the acquisition of medical equipment with the purpose of initial identification of travelers that show COVID-19 symptoms [5] . As the Romanian government collapsed on February 5th, 2020, public auctions were suspended and the confusion among population is very high combined with the political instability. As this unstable situation continues how will Romania cope with the spread of the COVID-19 by incoming travelers? Romania has 14 international (out of 16) airports that are highly connected with airports across all EU (in 2019, over 23 million passengers used these airports), including from countries where COVID-19 was already identified in the EU. The vulnerability is even higher considering the high potential of false-negative rate of diagnostic of COVID-19 that already has been documented [6] and the lack of personnel. As such, public awareness, widespread public health measures, and close collaboration with countries from which incoming travelers are arriving in Romania is a key to limit the spread of COVID-19 and promote the wellbeing of travelers and the members of the community (resident or diaspora).",28.59796911315822,9.512158643631599

The Wake Up and Breathe Collaborative study evaluated how adherence to spontaneous awakening trials (SATs) and SBTs affects the incidence of VAE and VAP. 16 This collaborative was really an education initiative that prospectively tracked the incidence of daily SAT, SBT, and VAEs in participating ICUs over 2 years from 2011 to 2013. Each participating ICU designated a physician, nurse, and respiratory therapist to champion the education and data collection. The results of the study were impressive. Initial compliance with SAT and SBT in most centers was low but through the course of the study rates of daily SAT and SBT significantly improved while the rate of VAC and IVAC per episode of mechanical ventilation was significantly decreased. During the study, the duration of mechanical ventilation decreased by 2.4 days, ICU LOS by 3.0 days, and hospital LOS by 6.3 days. There were no changes in the rate of hospital morality or VAP. Not surprisingly, the rate of self-extubations per episode of mechanical ventilation increased but there was no change in the rate of reintubation within 24 hours. This paper brings to the forefront VAP is not an adequate surrogate for quality. Dr Klompas, the architect of the new criteria, outlines future efforts directed at minimizing VAE in a recent review. 16 He summarizes several strategies to reduce or prevent VAEs. Intrinsic to the efforts are approaches that minimize the duration of mechanic ventilation and coincide with the Society of Critical Care Medicine's initiative Awakening, Breathing, Coordination, Delirium monitoring/management and Early exercise/ mobility bundle. This bundle has been shown to improve patient outcomes by eliminating sedative and narcotic infusions, decreasing delirium, increasing patient participation in SATs and SBTs, and promoting early participation with occupational and physical therapy. All of these efforts, in turn, reduce duration of mechanical ventilation, and translate to decreased incidence of VAE. 16 Other efforts that may play a role in reducing VAE include using lung-protective ventilation and preventing overaggressive fluid or blood product resuscitation. Although there have not been any studies to date demonstrating the effects of these strategies on VAE, each has been shown to mitigate lung injury, which may lead to deterioration of pulmonary function in ventilated patients.",32.787743546089075,14.033665851883281

We suspect that GI symptoms may cause patients with COVID-19 to be more prone to electrolyte disturbance, such as significantly decreased serum sodium levels (p=0.016), and hence they trend towards the severe/critical type of the disease. Other reasons should be considered and explored based on future data. In addition, the higher rates of familial clustering may be related to faecal shedding in shared toilets in households. Further multivariate analysis revealed sputum production from infected areas and increased LDH/glucose levels as independent risk factors for the disease.

NGAL protein levels are typically very low in various biological fluids (17). Previous studies have demonstrated that NGAL expression is associated with acute injury, particularly acute kidney injury. However, an association between NGAL and acute lung injury has not yet been reported. The present study characterized the expression profile of NGAL in mice subjected to different mechanical ventilation protocols. NGAL mRNA and protein expression levels in lung tissue increased under all mechanical ventilation treatments; however, a significant increase was observed following high-volume or high-PIP mechanical ventilation. A similar NGAL increase was further detected in BAL fluid and serum, and was notably increased following high-volume or high-PIP mechanical ventilation. NGAL expression was time-dependent under high-volume mechanical ventilation treatment. Immunohistochemical localization studies revealed increased NGAL expression in lung endothelium, alveolar epithelial cells, and infiltrating neutrophils. NGAL is easily detected in serum and BAL fluid (10,11). The results of the present study verify the role of NGAL as a novel and potential biomarker for VALI. A previous study revealed that plasma concentrations of NGAL were increased in oleic acid-induced acute lung injury and a conventional mechanical ventilation model in piglets (18). Serum NGAL levels were additionally significantly increased in lung transplant patients (19).",28.659087371478602,12.331583232757989
