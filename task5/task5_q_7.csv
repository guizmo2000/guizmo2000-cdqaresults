Both index cases and household members used masks. The rates of laboratory-confirmed influenza and ILI were the same in the intervention and control groups in the intention-to-treat analysis. 14 However, in the second trial, mask use with hand hygiene was protective in household contacts when the intervention was applied within 36 hours of onset of symptoms in the index case (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.87). 15 Since masks were used by sick patients and their household members in these studies, the effect of mask being 'source control' is more difficult to quantify precisely. 7",12.178428493923539,5.299382238631752

In addition to passage around the mask, some of the small particle aerosols are able to pass through the mask's filter media. Therefore, in addition to RPDs, filtration testing was done on medical masks prior to enrollment of subjects to ensure consistency between models across study locations. The filtration performance of the N95 respirators and medical mask models in the study were tested in a manner similar to that used by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). Devices were attached to a test fixture and placed in a TSI 8130 automated filter tester operated with an air flow rate of 85 liters per minute. The TSI 8130 uses a photometer to measure the flux of light scattering from aerosol particles. Polydispersed particles (mass median diameter of~0.3 microns) were generated from a 2 % NaCl solution and passed through each device being tested for 1 min. Each test was repeated 3 times with a fresh N95 respirator or medical mask. To be certified as an N95 respirator, filter penetration needs to be less than 5 % (or 95 % efficient).

Intuitively, RPD should better protect HCP against airborne infections than MM, but objective evidence has not validated this supposition. One possibility that may explain this discrepancy between expectations and observations is pragmatic: HCP, in general, do not tolerate N95 respirators as well as medical masks [29, 30] , perhaps prompting them to remove respirators more frequently and/or for longer periods, increasing the likelihood of exposure to infections. Models have shown that 25 % or more non-wear time during exposure negates any significant differences in protective ability between types of RPDs [17, 31] .

The movement during CC decreased the acceptable performance rate of the cup-type and valve-type, but not the fold-type respirators. If a respirator's fit is compromised, leakage can occur through various routes, including the filter, face-seal leakage, and the exhalation valve. [10] However, all filters in this study were N95 or higher. Moreover, face seal leakage is a main component of respirator leakage. [11] Thus, the movement of the wearer may influence the protective performance of N95 filtering facepiece respirators. To reflect the effect of movements, simulated workplace testing for respirator fit typically considers 8 standard exercises: normal breathing, deep breathing, turning the head side to side, moving the head up and down, talking, grimacing, bending over, and normal breathing. [12, 13] It is likely that the movement during CC differs from that during these 8 standard exercises. Our simulation study revealed that dynamic motions, like those during CC, decreased the protective performance of the respirators. Although CC using mechanical devices could solve this problem, manual CCs remain the standard of care for the treatment of cardiac arrest. [14] Thus, we believe that the user should consider the required motions during CC when selecting and fitting a respirator for procedures that involve a risk of infection.",20.78537924176966,9.493600208364727

In this context, the fold-type and valve-type respirators have flexible sealing surfaces, whereas the cup-type does not, suggesting that users may more easily customize the relative shape of the fold-type and valve-type respirators to achieve a better face seal. The low baseline fit factor and high reduction in the adequate performance rate for the cup-type respirator may be related to the fixed shape of the cup, as the fit factor can be affected by the wearer's size and shape. In the present study, only 2 participants reported preferring the cup-type respirator, which may be related to the mask's rigidity causing facial discomfort. The valve-type respirator may have a better breathing performance, as the valve can help to quickly transfer the exhaled gas to the outside of the respirator. Although the valve in a respirator reduces Medicine exhalation resistance, [10] it may also increase the risk of leakage, and additional studies are needed to quantify the leakage through the exhalation valve. Furthermore, although the fold-type respirator showed better performance than the valve-type respirator in our study, its wearing comfort may be suboptimal, and a future study of the contact characteristics of these masks is warranted. [15, 16] The skill level of the operator and training in wearing a respirator could affect the protective performance of respirators. To reduce the impact of the degree of training and experience on the respirator fit, all participants received real-time feedback after their respirator training, based on the manufacturer's instructions. Such a training course may help improve the baseline respirator fit for all types of respirators. To reduce the risk of infection, it is important to ensure that the wearer knows how to properly fit the respirator before entering an area of potential infectious spread. [17] Based on the present study, it appears that the respirator shape and wearer movements can affect the respirator function, and fit testing is needed to confirm whether the respirator is functioning properly during tasks that involve moving the head (e.g., CCs). This type of testing may help improve the safety and protection of healthcare providers in emergency departments. Furthermore, healthcare providers should select and fit appropriate respirators based on the manufacturer's instructions.",14.77098274799668,6.811581410967996

The penetration of particles and pressure drop (Δp) through the mask are used to determine q f and q f,o . Experimental results reveal that the most penetrating particle size (MPS) for the pre-decontaminated N95, Gauze and Spunlace masks were 118 nm, 461 nm and 279 nm, respectively, and the respective penetration rates were 2.6%, 23.2% and 70.0%. The Δp through the pretreated N95 masks was 9.2 mm H 2 O at the breathing flow rate of heavy-duty workers, exceeding the Δp values obtained through Gauze and Spunlace masks. Decontamination increased the sizes of the most penetrating particles, changing the q f values of all of the masks: q f fell as particle size increased because the penetration increased. Bleach increased the Δp of N95, but destroyed the Gauze mask. However, the use of an autoclave reduces the Δp values of both the N95 and the Gauze mask. Neither the rice cooker nor ethanol altered the Δp of the Gauze mask. Chemical decontamination methods reduced the q f,o values for the three electret masks.

In current study, only the tested N95 masks matched the minimum 42 CFR Part 84 criteria [10] because they had both an acceptable pressure drop and penetration. In 2011, Viscusi et al.

Since the breathing resistance of N95 is 9.2 mm H 2 O at 5.95 L min −1 , the wearer may not notice a difference in pressure drop after decontamination. Therefore, for N95 respirators with a pressure drop below a 35 mm H 2 O threshold, the aerosol penetration must be kept below 5% consistent with 42 CFR 84 subpart K [10] .

Generally, medical masks are considered sufficient for droplet-transmitted infections such as influenza. 18 However, this study has demonstrated a clear benefit of using N95 respirators (both continuous and targeted) to protect HCWs against droplet infections and does not show significant protection of medical masks. In the light of these findings, it may be prudent to use respirators when the transmission mode of a disease is unknown or when HCWs exposed to droplet-transmitted infections with a high-case fatality rate. 6 This study has some limitations. Firstly, the reporting of the results included in Figure 1 is different from the IPD meta-analysis results. This is due to the uneven distribution of randomisation arms and differing seasonal attack rates between the trials. In Figure 1 , these between-trial differences were not taken into account. The IPD meta-analysis takes into account of these and gives an unbiased association. Secondly, the control arm in trial 1 was not randomised; however, the risk of bias is less due to similar study setting, outcome measures and participant characteristics. Moreover, whether infection was acquired in the community or the hospital cannot be determined, but the RCT design should result in community exposure being distributed equally across all arms. Finally, we categorised pathogens according to various transmission modes, while certain viruses are transmitted via multiple routes. The pooled data were suggestive of an effect of respirators against influenza, but probably did not have enough statistical power for this outcome.

Even though there is no good evidence that the virus is transmitted by airborne routes (in the absence of aerosolizing procedures), some would argue that, to avoid transmission, it is better to be more conservative. However, this approach is not without downsides as, if the virus becomes more widespread, it could result in shortages of N95 respirators. Such shortages occurred during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic leading to concerns that respirators might be unavailable for patients with clear indications, such as those with tuberculosis.

Despite this, significant challenges remain. On the one hand, humans are constantly challenged by new viruses including Zika virus, MERS-coronavirus, or Ebola virus.

Third, healthcare providers need to be better trained to maximize the effectiveness of infection control measures, including use of masks, respirators, and other personal protective equipment. It may be reasonable to recommend limited use of personal protective measures in certain other settings such as mask-wearing by the ill or perhaps surface disinfection of very heavily trafficked public areas. However, other use of personal protective equipment by the general public is not recommended at this time. Fourth, and also consistent with other studies, we founds that widespread government mandates to segregate individuals, including isolation, quarantine, sheltering, location-based community restrictions, and travel restrictions, are less likely than voluntary measures to be recommended, especially over the longer-term [55] . Instead, less invasive voluntary efforts to reduce social contact, especially self-isolation of the sick at home, self-quarantine of the exposed, and, when feasible, sheltering by the well ought to be widely supported. This will require education, persuasion, and social support to ensure that medical and non-medical needs are met, with the latter being central to the success of sequestration measures in all settings.

Due to these factors, the use of N95 respirators on a large scale is impractical and expensive during an epidemic or pandemic. Past experiences of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), H1N1 swine flu in 2009, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) indicate that surgical masks have been most widely adopted by the public as personal protective measure, despite controversy on their effectiveness [6] [7] [8] [9] . Currently, among other factors, filtration in respirators and masks depends on filter characteristics, including fiber diameter, packing density, charge of fibers and filter thickness, as well as particle properties, such as diameter, density and velocity [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . However, in the lack of a system to deactivate the collected pathogens, safety concerns naturally arise about secondary infection and contamination from virus-laden filter media during utilization and disposal. Furthermore, since re-sterilization is not possible without causing damage, respirators and masks are recommended for single use only 9, 15, 16 . Scientific efforts have been focused on treatment of filters with materials possessing well-known antimicrobial properties, such as iodine, chlorine and metals [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] , although with limited effectiveness against virus aerosols [26] [27] [28] .

Participants identified the fasteners (eg, bands, straps) on masks and gowns as particularly problematic. For example, a common barrier was the (perceived) need to untie certain mask and gown designs (n = 14). Knots were often behind participants' heads or backs, making them hard to find or hard to reach (particularly for HCWs with mobility issues). Sometimes knots were also hard to untie. Furthermore, when untied, the loose fasteners or the PPE itself could be hard to control and could pose a contamination risk. Several participants described workarounds that prevented or minimized the problem of untying PPE (n = 5), such as tying just 1 knot, not tying the fasteners while donning, or simply ripping the PPE off rather than untying the fasteners. However, ripping off PPE was not easy with certain designs (n = 7), particularly the masks with bands and the gowns with thicker belts. Some participants also found the gown with the tape-tab neck closure harder to rip off in a predictable and controlled way. While gloves were not associated with the barriers described above, several participants (n = 6) described difficulty safely doffing the glove on the second hand (because the other hand was exposed). PPE fit was also a barrier to doffing all types of PPE (n = 10), typically when PPE fit too tightly. However, while 2 participants found tighter-fitting gowns harder to doff, 2 participants found looser-fitting gowns harder to doff. Participants also identified personal barriers (n = 10), such as wearing personal items (glasses, watches), having long hair, and having mobility issues. However, some PPE designs helped mitigate these barriers. For example, procedure masks with ear loops were the easiest to doff for participants who wore glasses. Some participants also admitted that they struggled to recall the correct doffing approach, but they generally described remembering or ""figuring out"" how to doff correctly. Finally, 3 participants explicitly commented on the benefit of using familiar PPE designs because it allowed them to rely on their doffing habits.",10.18450661316355,6.457143983594516

Clinic-based PCPs realize that PPE should be worn to protect themselves, other healthcare staff members, and patients during pandemics [12] . However, insufficient funds to purchase a large amount of PPE, and a lack of storage space, may lead to reluctance to maintain large supplies [12] . In Japan, primary care clinics are generally managed as small private practices, with limited space and small budgets. These clinics are likely to curtail the elements of preparedness that require finances and space. Most primary care providers in PCPs believe that governments are responsible for stockpiling and providing PPE during pandemics [12, 24] . Without explicit guidelines that designate who is responsible for providing PPE during pandemics, supplies of PPE are likely to be inadequate. This PPE supply shortage may lead to PCPs declining to see patients with influenza-like illness, to protect themselves and their staff, which makes the personal lives and families of medical staff the priority instead of the provision of care to the community. This premise is supported by the observation that 37.5% of the general practices in Canada closed their doors during the SARS outbreak [25] . Practical incentives (e.g., financial support) and/or strategies for the distribution of stockpiled supplies of PPE should be developed by the national health authority so that individual PCPs can respond effectively during pandemics. We found that sufficient supplies of N95 masks were not maintained by PCPs, but that adequate supplies of surgical masks were available. It is not known whether a surgical mask is as effective as an N95 mask in providing protection against influenza and other respiratory viruses. If surgical masks are sufficient, then inventories of N95 masks are not necessary. The size and nature of infectious influenza particles that are transmitted during coughing or sneezing are not well understood, and the efficacy of a surgical mask to prevent disease transmission is not known [26] . Theoretically, an N95 mask should be used for particles < 5 μm transmitted via aerosol, and the efficacy of an N95 mask for the prevention of transmission of influenza has been shown [27] . However, studies conducted in healthcare settings have not yet reached a definite conclusion regarding the use of different types of masks. During the 2009 pandemic influenza, an N95 mask was significantly associated with a lower risk of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection, compared with a surgical mask [28] . In contrast, results of a randomized trial suggested that a surgical mask does not seem to be inferior to a N95 mask for the protection of health care workers against seasonal influenza viruses [28] . The Japanese preparedness plan and guidelines do not recommend a specific type of mask, and published recommendations regarding the use of specific types of masks are not consistent [29] . The cost of N95 masks is also relevant. Phin et al. (2009) showed that N95 masks can have significant financial and logistic implications because they cost 30 times more than surgical masks and should be replaced every 3 years [30] . Considering the current lack of evidence for the superiority of N95 masks, the cost of purchasing large quantities for stockpiling, and the general lack of storage space, it seems unrealistic to prepare for pandemics with N95 masks. Overall, PPE is the most appropriate choice for limiting disease transmission, but further studies of which particular PPE is most effective are clearly necessary. Our findings revealed that a BCP was not implemented by most clinic-or hospital-based PCPs. Institutions that reviewed the national pandemic preparedness plan and guidelines were more likely to have a BCP. A BCP is a contingency plan for responding to the surge in patient numbers during a pandemic. A BCP provides guidance on how to maintain essential functions and supplies when there are limited human resources. A BCP also identifies essential practice functions, staffing contingencies, flexible working hours and family care plans for staff members, criteria for clinic closure, ancillary staff recruiting and training, record keeping to ensure accountability for actions and inactions, and the use of antiviral medications. A BCP also includes plans for simulation exercises that complement training and that evaluate and refine local practice plans and leadership delegation [16] . Hospital BCP and clinic BCP are different, because the content of BCPs should depend on the institutional setting, size of practice, and role in the community. For instance, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [31] , the American Academy of Family Physicians [32] , and the Canadian Medical Association [33] issued checklists of BCP for clinics, which are relatively concise; conversely, the CDC's checklist of BCP for hospitals is longer and more complicated [34] .",35.68291002972312,17.41256258350795

Of the seven topics of pandemic preparedness and response, we found that PCPs were particularly not well prepared with respect to PPE and BCP. PPE is recommended as the main method for protecting primary healthcare workers and patients from pandemic influenza and other infectious diseases [18, 19] . However, primary care clinics were less likely than hospitals to keep adequate supplies of PPE. There was significantly less recommended high-level PPE such as N95 masks, gowns, and eye protection at clinics than at hospitals. A systematic review that investigated the efficacy of PPE for protection against respiratory viruses suggested that PPE is highly effective at preventing the spread of SARS. Odds ratios for various PPE (with a lower OR meaning more protective) are: masks (OR 0.32); N95 masks (OR 0.09); gloves (OR 0.43); gowns (OR 0.23); and hand washing, masks, gloves and gowns combined (OR 0.09) [21] . Shaw et al. [12] reported that the successful containment of SARS outbreaks depends on the appropriate use of infection control measures such as PPE [22] . In the case of influenza A(H1N1) pdm09, appropriate use of PPE, such as gloves, seemed to reduce the risk of A(H1N1)pdm09 transmission [23] . Insufficient infection control preparedness increases the probability that PCPs, especially clinic-based PCPs, will be exposed to (and contract) respiratory infectious diseases. This vulnerability can reduce the capacity of community clinics to respond to a large number of patients that require treatment during a pandemic, and puts the health of all patients attending local health care services at risk.",26.9247586708307,10.289516936142135

As in the case of the SARS epidemic, the current epidemic must be fought with public health measures. As a first measure, the Chinese authorities have closed the 'wet' seafood market in Wuhan. Due to the close contact of live animals with humans, these markets offer ideal conditions for the transmission of zoonotic infections. After two coronavirus infections having emerged from Chinese 'wet' food markets, strict hygiene measures are clearly warranted. However, consuming meat and other products of wild animals has a long tradition in China. There is a philosophy of medicine food homology, ('eaten when hungry is food, eaten when ill is medicine') such that in China pangolin products, for example are reputed to help against rheumatism; 'meridian obstruction'; liver disease; and to improve eyesight (Li and Li, 2020b) . More recently, consumption of meat of wild animals has become a sign of social status. It will not be easy to eradicate these false medical beliefs. Interdiction might create black markets; therefore, some scientists recommend strictly controlling, instead of forbidding, this market. Protecting the healthcare workers against nosocomial infection is another urgent need, since patient care will already represent a heavy burden to the health system and any reduction in health personnel would cause further problems. Face masks are insufficient protection for them; N95 masks, goggles and protective gowns are needed for medical personnel (Chang et al., 2020b) .

However, scientific evidence is lacking for the effectiveness of wearing masks by the uninfected person in contrast to the proven effectiveness of hand washing against respiratory infections. The SARS epidemic was contained by means of syndromic surveillance; isolation of patients; and quarantine of contacts. These measures will also play an important role in the current epidemic which, due to its sheer size, will necessitate more draconian measures such as limiting the movement of persons to and from hotspots of infection, resulting in the lockdown of Wuhan and of particular small cities in Italy and Germany. WHO has declared the novel coronavirus epidemic as a public health emergency. This expanding epidemic will be a stress test for existing health systems, including those of industrialized countries. It should also be a further motivation to strengthen fundamental research in trans-species viral infections and on potential zoonosis impacts, particularly from bats, under changing environmental conditions. From the viewpoint of citizens, when it comes to the protection of lives, one might ask whether one should not put the same spending on public health and preventive research as on the spending on defence budgets.",17.704070508634256,9.970701566392503

In Japan, primary care is the frontline against emerging infectious diseases in communities. Although the importance of pandemic preparedness in primary care has been highlighted previously, few studies have thus far investigated the preparedness among primary care practices (PCPs) or differences in the preparedness of different institutional settings. We examined PCP preparedness and response to the 2009 influenza pandemic in Japan, and explored the role of a pandemic preparedness plan during the pandemic. Methods: We used a survey questionnaire to assess how well individual PCPs in Okinawa, Japan, were prepared for the 2009 influenza pandemic. The questionnaire was mailed to all eligible PCPs (N = 465) in Okinawa, regardless of their institutional setting. In addition, we assessed the differences in the preparedness of clinics and hospitals and determined whether the national preparedness plan affected individual preparedness and response. Data were analyzed using descriptive and logistic regression analyses. Results: A total of 174 (37.4%) PCPs responded to our survey. In general, high-level personal protective equipment (PPE) such as N95 masks (45.4%), gowns (30.5%), and eye protection (21.3%) was stocked at a low rate. Clinic-based PCPs were significantly less prepared than hospital-based PCPs to provide N95 masks (OR 0.34), gowns (OR 0.15), and eye protection (OR 0.18). In addition, only 32.8% of PCPs adopted an adequate business continuity plan (BCP). After controlling for institutional setting, reading the national preparedness plan was significantly associated with establishment of a BCP (OR 5.86), and with knowledge of how to transfer a swab specimen to a local medical laboratory (OR 5.60). Conclusions: With regard to PPE availability, PCPs (especially clinic-based PCPs) were not adequately prepared for the influenza pandemic. Awareness of the national pandemic preparedness plan is likely to promote prefecture-wide implementation of BCPs and surveillance activity.",20.611574734089274,9.421618544750535

N95 respirators require fit testing, need to be replaced, and tend to be uncomfortable which create opportunities for their improper and therefore ineffective use. Moreover, the N95 respirators would impose a large cost to an organization who decides they will outfit their employees with them in the event of a pandemic. This cost is imposed by buying a stockpile of the respirators, and the provision of fit-testing for each and every employee issued a respirator. Consider an organization that decides that during a two week pandemic disease wave they will issue N95 masks to 1000 employees. Each respirator unit has a cost of $1, and because the respirators need to be changed every 2-3 hours, each employee working an 8-hour day will require 3 masks per day. Therefore, each employee would require 30 masks over 2-weeks (10 working days), leading to a cost of $30 per employee for a total of $30K for 1000 employees for two weeks. This does not include the cost associated with fit-testing which takes approximately 20-minutes per person, which would therefore require 333 hours of time to fit test 1000 employees. Furthermore, a trained professional is required to perform the fit testing procedure. Finally, does the employer provide N95 masks for the families of the employees such that protection is afforded to the family and the employee at home?

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have interim recommendations on the use of facemasks and respirators for the current pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus. The CDC defines the term facemask as a disposable mask cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as a medical device, such as surgical masks. Surgical masks are designed to help stop droplets from being spread by the person wearing the mask, not to protect against breathing in very small particle aerosols that may contain viruses [8] . We will use of the term 'respirator' for an N95 or higher filtering facepiece respirator certified by the CDC/National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH); a respirator is designed to protect the person wearing the mask against breathing in very small particles that may contain viruses [8] . The CDC states that the effectiveness of the use of facemasks and respirators in various settings is unknown and do not generally recommend the use of facemasks or respirators in home or community settings nor in non-medical occupational settings [8] .

With limited supplies of antivirals and vaccines, countries and individuals are looking at other ways to reduce the spread of pandemic (H1N1) 2009, particularly options that are cost effective and relatively easy to implement. Recent experiences with the 2003 SARS and 2009 H1N1 epidemics have shown that people are willing to wear facemasks to protect themselves against infection; however, little research has been done to quantify the impact of using facemasks in reducing the spread of disease. We construct and analyze a mathematical model for a population in which some people wear facemasks during the pandemic and quantify impact of these masks on the spread of influenza. To estimate the parameter values used for the effectiveness of facemasks, we used available data from studies on N95 respirators and surgical facemasks. The results show that if N95 respirators are only 20% effective in reducing susceptibility and infectivity, only 10% of the population would have to wear them to reduce the number of influenza A (H1N1) cases by 20%. We can conclude from our model that, if worn properly, facemasks are an effective intervention strategy in reducing the spread of pandemic (H1N1) 2009.",22.616562468312488,10.680562013264305

The need for a clinical health workforce to treat smallpox will be high, with case numbers in the 1000s to 100,000s in many of the scenarios modelled, and just over 100,000 clinical HCWs in Sydney. Limiting the number of HCWs working in designated smallpox facilities is a sensible strategy. A possible approach to such a scenario would be a reduction of staff to patient ratios, as well as using trainee HCWs. Protection of these clinicians is key, with vaccination being the mainstay. Up to 100,000 doses of vaccine will need to be reserved for clinical HCWs and plans in place to commence vaccination. PPE will not be an alternative to vaccination, but an additional protective measure for HCWs. Today, work health and safety requirements would dictate that PAPRs or disposable respirators with a hood and coveralls be available to clinicians treating smallpox cases. Perceived lack of protection during a serious emerging infection outbreak may result in refusal to work or industrial action by HCWs [37] . HCW may be well protected by PPE, but there is large uncertainty around effectiveness of PPE. Studies of other viruses transmitted by the respiratory route suggests good effectiveness of respirators against smallpox [38] . It should be noted that surgical masks are unlikely to offer protection to HCWs based on available data [38] . Stockpiling may provide a short duration of supplies. The modelled epidemic may run for 150-300 days or more, depending on the scenario. A very large quantity of respirators may need to be stockpiled, depending on the percentage of HCW involved in direct care of smallpox patients. Given the likely duration of an epidemic, plans should put in place for rapid procurement of PPE supplies beyond the stockpiled capacity.

Therefore, the first branch of the algorithm involves determination of whether the patient is symptomatic or asymptomatic. For asymptomatic patients, the goal is prevention of disease in both the individual and the population. This is accomplished by assessing exposure history and patient risk and, if it exists, providing post-exposure prophylaxis (with vaccine or with immune serum globulin if the patient is immunocompromised). 11 The patient must then undergo public health monitoring for 21 days to monitor for the development of signs and symptoms. Home quarantine should be strongly considered, as patients with measles may be contagious for a few days prior to onset of symptoms. 12 Conversely, patients with signs and symptoms of measles (prodrome of fever, cough/coryza/conjunctivitis, Koplik spots followed by rash), should be immediately masked and isolated using airborne precautions. To assist in risk assessment, EPs should inquire about immunization status, sick contacts, and travel to a region with measles. All healthcare providers, including those who have been vaccinated, should don N95 respirators or equivalent respiratory protection prior to caring for suspected measles patients. As with other airborne diseases, clinicians must be current on their ""fit testing"" requirements (typically renewed annually) in order to properly use an N95 respirator.

Front-line HCWs had higher seroprevalence than other hospital staff or the general population in a study in Taiwan presumably due to greater exposure, [28] whereas several nosocomial outbreaks occurred in hospitalized immuno-compromised patients [29] [30] [31] . Infection control measures recommended by the WHO during the influenza pandemic included droplet and standard precautions among the HCWs in addition to maintaining a minimum distance of . 1 m between patients when providing routine care to patients infected with pandemic H1N1 influenza and those with influenza-like symptoms [12] . Our coughing propagation distances from the HPS would support the WHO recommendation for the HCW to wear a medical mask if working within approximately 1 m from the patient or upon entering the room/cubicle of a patient on droplet precautions [12] . Surgical masks appeared to be as effective as N95 respirators for respiratory protection of HCWs during the routine care of patients hospitalized with seasonal influenza, [32, 33] and were also as effective in reducing production of infectious aerosols during coughing when worn by influenza patients [34] . The incidence of nosocomial pandemic H1N1 infections appeared to remain low in staff members using surgical masks in a hospital despite admitting substantial numbers of pandemic H1N1 patients [35] . A systematic review has shown that the surgical masks perform similar to the N95 masks in reducing the transmission of respiratory viruses but the latter are more expensive, uncomfortable and irritating to the skin [36] . Recently, Noti et al have shown that about two-thirds of influenza virus particles from a coughing manikin (in a simulated patient room with a high-efficiency particulate air filter) were blocked from entering the mouth by surgical masks or N95 masks that were not properly fitted whereas over 99% of infectious virus particles were blocked by a well-fitted N95 mask on the breathing simulator [37] . Nevertheless it seems more practical for the HCWs to wear the surgical masks as a preventive measure against nosocomial infections in view of its reasonable filtering capacity, better comfort, and higher compliance.",30.89907500526007,12.621867139471009

However, that study did not specifically examine the impact on busy healthcare workers. Pregnancy has been reported to be the most common cause for denying medical clearance for N95-mask use in a non-medical setting but the specific adverse effects of the respirator itself have not been documented [18] .

This study shows important descriptive findings of changes to respiratory physiology with mask use, which do not appear to have sufficient significant clinical impact based on the parameters monitored, that had been deliberately kept within the normal ranges to ensure safety of the subjects. Although harm was not demonstrated in the context of this experimental protocol, the significant changes to respiratory physiology caused by breathing through N95 mask materials raise the concern regarding prolonged use of N95-masks by pregnant healthcare workers. Our results suggest that pregnant women may experience more fatigue and require more rest breaks from mask use. Scheduled work breaks should be considered for pregnant healthcare workers working in high risk areas which require prolonged use of N95 respirators. In face of the imminent threat of pandemic airborne respiratory diseases it should be emphasized that the benefit of using N95 mask to prevent serious emerging infectious diseases should be weighed against possible respiratory consequences associated with N95 mask usage. Use of alternative protective methods such as surgical masks with lesser airway resistance, should be considered in appropriate settings [31] [32] [33] . These have been shown to be equally effective for the prevention of droplet infections such as influenza [31] , although they are insufficient for protection against airborne pathogens. Innovative interventions to improve the design of FFR, are urgently needed in the face of the imminent threat of pandemics of acute airborne respiratory infections. The key is to ensure healthcare worker protection from infectious agents without jeopardizing the wellbeing of the pregnant healthcare workers and their fetuses. ",24.86041621057247,12.24344284624675

Other studies in both non-pregnant and pregnant subjects have shown, on the contrary, an increase or decrease in BF but the TV and V E were not measured in these trials [17, 27, 28] . In contrast, our pregnant subjects were unable to proportionately increase both TV and BF to maintain their V E during rest and in response to exercise while breathing through N95-masks materials. A significant 26 % reduction in V E, with a 23 % reduction in mean TV was noted during exercise, possibly due to diaphragmatic splinting. This decrease in V E led to a corresponding decrease in VO 2 (13.8 %) and VCO 2 (17.7 %) (Fig. 7) . The decrease in FeO 2 and increase in FeCO 2 are likely due to a stimulation of the respiratory drive resulting in greater efforts required to breathe through the N95 mask materials and a concomitant greater extraction of O 2 for aerobic metabolism. These results also suggest that the N95 mask may impede gaseous exchange resulting in hypoventilation. Although the subjects appeared to adapt to the increased workload with no changes in the other maternal and fetal physiological parameters with no evidence of hypoxia found on finger-tip capillary oxygen saturation nor increased lactic acid production to suggest a shift toward anaerobic respiration, our results suggest that performing physical work with the N95-mask appears to stress the aerobic metabolism and increase the CO 2 load within the circulation.",28.365895133881416,12.137215816561406

During the 2003 SARS-CoV epidemic, researchers found that moderate levels of anxiety were associated with higher uptake of preventive measures by respondents [21] . Our findings showed the opposite trend. Specific precautionary measures including avoidance of sharing utensils (e.g., chopsticks), hand hygiene, and wearing masks regardless of the presence or absence of symptoms were associated with lower levels of psychological impact, depression, anxiety, and stress. The experiences of the 2003 SARS-CoV epidemic could have changed the perception of the general public towards precautionary measures and have led to a positive effect on the initial psychological responses to the COVID-19 epidemic by giving respondents confidence and sense of control in prevention. As the Chinese prefer to use chopsticks to pick up food commonly shared on a plate during mealtime as part of their culture, it is not unexpected that avoidance of sharing utensils (e.g., chopsticks) during meals is significantly associated with less psychological impact and lower levels of anxiety, depression, and stress. During the initial stage of the COVID-19 epidemic, health authorities outside China had different recommendations for mask usage due to a global shortage of masks. While some health authorities urged citizens not to wear masks if they were well (e.g., Singapore), other health authorities urged their citizens to always have masks and hand sanitizers ready (e.g., Malaysia, Vietnam) [36] . The official guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO) advises that healthy people should only wear masks if they are taking care of a person with suspected COVID-19 infection or if people are coughing and sneezing [37] . Our study found that wearing masks, regardless of the presence or absence of symptoms, was associated with lower levels of anxiety and depression. Although the WHO emphasizes that masks are effective only when used in combination with frequent hand-cleaning with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water, wearing a mask regardless of the presence or absence of symptoms could offer potential psychological benefits by offering a sense of security. This finding was anticipated because wearing face masks is a common practice when people are sick or to counter urban pollution or haze in parts of Asia, including China [38] . Governments and health authorities should ensure there are infrastructures to produce and provide an adequate supply of masks, soaps, alcohol-based hand rubs, and other personal hygiene products during the COVID-19 epidemic.",13.647619404504638,8.061662430900812

It can regulate multiple transcription factors, cytokines, growth factors, kinases, and other enzymes [15, 16] . However, curcumin has low bioavailability and this is attributable to its poor aqueous solubility and dissolution properties. Nanonization serves as a mechanism to circumvent this limitation, facilitating in the production of curcumin nanoparticles that are highly water-soluble. Increasing water solubility may also increase the biodistribution and bioavailability of curcumin, and potentially slow down its rapid metabolism and systemic elimination [17, 18] . We have utilized polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) for the development of a novel curcumin nanoparticle system (CURN). PVP is a strong hydrophilic polymer that has been extensively utilized in improving the solubility and bioavailability of compounds with poor water-solubility; it delays the crystallization of compounds by forming molecular adducts [19] . Our previous study demonstrated that the physicochemical properties of curcumin using the PVP nanoparticle system have improved; these include a reduction in the compound particle size, the formation of a high-energy amorphous state, and the induction of intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which altogether enhanced its water solubility and drug release.

This is different from deployment of masks in the general population during an outbreak of an infectious disease, where anyone may encounter the infectious micro-organism, implying much greater heterogeneity, in training levels (experience and understanding), goodness of fit of a mask, and activities interfering with mask use and thus reducing potential reduction of transmission. The protective effect of masks is created through a combined effect of the transmission blocking potential of the material, the fit and related air leakage of the mask, and the degree of adherence to proper wearing and disposal of masks. Personal respirators such as those worn by staff attending TB patients, are used primarily to protect the wearer, and are designed to fit to the face with as tight a seal as possible. Their efficiency is graded on the degree of protection the material offers, assuming a perfect fit and optimal compliance. In contrast, surgical masks, as commonly worn in the operating theatre, are primarily used to protect the environment from the respiratory droplets produced by the wearer. With these masks, facial fit is much looser. The fit of home made masks, which could be e.g. made of a tea cloth or other comparable material available in the home, is likely to be even looser. Thus personal respirators confer a higher degree of protection than surgical masks, and these are again likely to give a higher degree of protection than home-made masks. In professional situations, ample time might be available prior to use to ensure a perfect fit and to give extensive counselling on adherence, but it is unlikely this will apply to the general population in case of a pandemic. It is possible that the discomfort in wearing associated with a certain type of masks will lead to reduced adherence and thus to a loss in overall protectiveness [10, 11] . Indeed a review among health care workers could not determine whether personal respirators conferred better protection for the health care workers than surgical masks [10] .",27.002896293718152,10.742901786318905

Home made masks, and to a lesser degree surgical masks, are unlikely to confer much protection against transmission of small particles like droplet nuclei, but as the reproduction number of influenza may not be very high [14] a small reduction in transmissibility of the virus may be sufficient for reducing the reproduction number to a value smaller than 1 and thus extinguishing the epidemic [15] . Greater reduction in transmissibility may be achieved if transmission is predominantly carried by larger droplets. In a typical human cough half of the droplets may be small (,10 mm), but these comprise only a small fraction (2.5*10 26 ) of the expelled volume [12] .

At the same time, we cannot exclude that wearing of face masks, even FFP2 or surgical masks by patients might still significantly reduce transmission. However, the observed limited particle retention in our experiments may still be an overestimate of protection, as it may for instance be challenging to enforce adherence to mask wearing by a patient who is short of breath. Wearing of masks by caregivers might be more feasible and more effective, in particular where additional preventive measures are in place as well for caregivers. Furthermore, we should bear in mind that this is an experimental study, with relatively small numbers of volunteers, which limits the generalisability of some of our findings.

Various devices and guidelines have been developed and clinically used to minimize the risk of exposure. For example, an N95 filtering facepiece respirator is recommended by many healthcare organizations [2] [3] [4] . The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health also certifies respirators according to their filter efficiencies, in order to rank the protective performances of the various N95 respirators [5, 6] . Unfortunately, emergency physicians can still be exposed to infectious hazards while wearing certified respirators if the respirator is not properly fitted on the wearer's face [7] . For example, in the Republic of Korea, healthcare providers wearing certified N95 respirators have been infected by the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus after performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation on an infected patient [8] . Another study revealed that inward leakage of contaminants because of an incomplete face seal was 3-5-fold more common, compared to filter penetration [9] . Furthermore, head movements can affect respirator fit, based on a change in the relative positions of the face and respirator, which can potentially cause face-seal leaks [10, 11] . Therefore, to reflect the effects of head movements on respirator fit, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration uses a standard eight-movement procedure in most respirator fit tests [11, 12] .",22.709898835890378,11.157279678449541

However, all filters in this study were N95 or higher, and face-seal leakage is a major component of respirator leakage [9] . In the context, fold-type and valve-type respirators have flexible sealing surfaces, while the cup type does not, which suggests that users may more easily manipulate fold-type and valve-type respirators to achieve a better face seal. However, fold-type and cup-type respirators have similar face-seal areas [19] . Interestingly, a respirator's nosepiece helps prevent face-seal leakage in the nasal area, which is the most frequently observed area [28] . In this study, the nosepiece was freely flexible in the fold-type and valve-type respirators, but not in the cup-type respirator, which may influence the difference in leakage amounts. Facepiece respirators are equipped with nonadjustable head straps for face sealing, and cup-type respirators have head straps with greater length, thickness, and cross-sectional area, compared to fold-type and valvetype respirators [19] . The different physical properties of head straps according to types of respirators could influence the respirator fit. The pressure generated by head straps could influence the respirator fit, as Niezgoda et al. found that fold-type respirators achieved similar fit factor values, compared to cup-type respirators, at the lower seal pressure that was generated by the head strap [19] . Finally, although the valve in a respirator reduces exhalation resistance [27] , it also increases the risk of leakage, and additional studies are needed to quantify the leakage through the exhalation valve. Therefore, the respirator's characteristics (i.e., shape of the sealing surface, nosepiece type, head straps, and valve for reducing exhalation resistance) could influence the final respirator fit from the present study.",19.106325848432334,10.064875161882423

Currently there is no clinical trial data on the efficacy of cloth masks and most of the available studies are in-vitro [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] . Available evidence suggest that cloth masks may provide some protection, it is assumed to be considerable less when compared to the use of surgical masks and respirators [85] . However, it is theorized that some types of cloth fabric may provide better protection [86] . In a report by the National Institute of Health's (NIH) Committee on the development of reusable facemasks for use during an influenza pandemic, the members were hesitant to discourage the use of cloth masks, but suggested caution around their use as they were not likely to be as protective as surgical masks or respirators [72] . This review has some limitations. Firstly, the guidelines from some countries could not be located, while others did not specifically address the use of masks and respirators. Secondly, while we tried to search for the most updated version of guidelines; some countries may have updated the documents and not made them publicly available. Finally, this study focused on selected high, middle and low income countries, but did not analyze every country. The situation may be different in these countries. For example, France recommends FFP2 and Austria recommends FFP3 for the HCWs in low and high risk situations during pandemics [22] . These policies are in line with the CDC policy. On the other hand, policies of the European CDC around the use masks and respirators are the same as those of the WHO [87] .",23.23035443643202,9.931576326358462

This study aimed to examine available policies and guidelines around the use of masks and respirators in HCWs and to describe areas of consistency between guidelines, as well as gaps in the recommendations, with reference to the WHO and the CDC guidelines. Methods: Policies and guidelines related to mask and respirator use for the prevention of influenza, SARS and TB were examined. Guidelines from the World Health Organization (WHO), the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), three high-income countries and six low/middle-income countries were selected. Results: Uniform recommendations are made by the WHO and the CDC in regards to protecting HCWs against seasonal influenza (a mask for low risk situations and a respirator for high risk situations) and TB (use of a respirator). However, for pandemic influenza and SARS, the WHO recommends mask use in low risk and respirators in high risk situations, whereas, the CDC recommends respirators in both low and high risk situations.

Our data, however, are consistent for all 20 subjects, suggesting that most people will experience similar low levels of fit. Our quantitative fit tests employed a TSI Portacount device without a N95 companion. 11 The latter instrument selects a narrower range of particles to minimize the contribution of filter penetration to the measurement of fit. We sought to minimize this by including in the fit test experiments only surgical masks with filter penetration less than 0.6% at all 3 test particle sizes. In addition, our findings are similar to those of a recent study using the N95 companion. 30 N95 filters must have less than 5% penetration for an aerosol with a mass median aerodynamic diameter of 0.3 microns.

One study found that particles from healthy subjects ranged from 0.09 to 3 mm particles. Concentrations ranged from 100 to 350 particles/L during normal breathing and 150 to 2000 particles/L during talking or coughing. 19 Another showed concentrations ranging from 14 to greater than 3000 particles/L and an average particle size of 0.32 mm. 20 The filters of most of these surgical masks will allow a large majority of wearer-generated particles to penetrate and will collect only a small percentage of airborne particles generated by infectious patients. Even when equipped with filters demonstrating relatively high collection efficiency, 10% to 40% of particles will penetrate the face seal as a result of poor fit. For aerosols containing organisms with a low infectious dose (eg, tuberculosis), this level of face seal leakage would not prevent a potentially infectious exposure during even a brief encounter with a patient generating copious amounts of aerosol. [21] [22] [23] The poor performance of dental masks is of particular concern, given dental surgeons' close proximity to patients and the high aerosol concentrations generated by dental procedures. 24 A limited number of previous studies of surgical masks as personal protective devices also show that surgical masks are not equivalent to respirators. Two studies simulating inward leakage compared surgical masks sealed and unsealed on a mannequin face and found fit factors from 3 to 5 (18% to 32% face-piece leakage) for 1.8-mm dioctyl phthalate particles and 22-mm fungal spores. 15, 25 A significantly higher prevalence of antibodies for several respiratory tract viruses (influenza A and B and respiratory syncytial virus) was found in 50 dental surgeons compared with 50 controls. However, no significant difference in antibody prevalence was found between surgeons wearing masks versus those who occasionally or never wore surgical masks. 26 Surgical masks were not effective at reducing internal deposition of Technetium-99 metastable, an aerosolized radiopharmaceutic, in nuclear medicine personnel and did not significantly reduce latex particle inhalation in a study of 20 health care workers. 27,28 A surgical and laser mask showed similar fit factors of 3.0 (95% CI: 1.8-4.2) and 3.8 (95% CI: 2.9-4.6), much less than the fit factor of 102.6 (95% CI: 41.2-164) for a FFP2 respirator. 29 A recent study found a geometric mean fit factor of 2.6 (geometric SD, 1.6) for 6 surgical masks, using a TSI Portacount device with an N95 Companion. 30 There are few studies that compare the clinical efficacy of respirators versus surgical masks. In one Toronto hospital, all attending health care workers reported to be wearing ''respirators'' contracted severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during a patient intubation. 31 Closer examination reveals that employees were wearing surgical masks, not respirators. Another study found that nurses in a Toronto hospital not consistently wearing either a filtering face-piece N95 respirator or a surgical mask had 4 times the risk of contracting SARS as those consistently wearing respirators or surgical masks. 32 Fit testing is not required and was infrequently employed in Canada during the SARS outbreaks. 33 Our data illustrate how important fit is to preventing inward leakage of particles. Qualitative fit tests are considered valid measures of personal protection for respirators that must achieve a fit factor of 100 (used in atmospheres less than 10 times the permissible exposure limit). Although 2 subjects were able to pass the qualitative fit test on 2 different surgical masks when assisted with fit, we believe these results occurred because of temporary taste desensitization. Our quantitative fit test results support this conclusion. None of the test surgical masks attained an individual fit factor of 100, the minimum level expected for a half-mask filtering face-piece respirator. Assistance with fit made no difference in the degree of fit.",23.97698355448341,10.592111289066409

While use of N95 masks offers theoretical advantages over surgical masks, no studies have documented significant additional benefits in patient care settings. Importantly, consistent compliance with PPE has been proven to decrease risk of disease transmission. Indirect evidence from ''super-spreading'' events in hospitals has suggested that SARS may be aerosolized [101, 102] . Infectious disease experts advise that special care should be taken to decrease aerosol-generating procedures as much as possible and to observe additional precautions when these procedures are necessary. Recommended environmental interventions include placing surgical masks on patients with suspected SARS at triage and during transport, limiting the movement of patients with suspected SARS, and making use of physical isolation measures, including warding and use of negative-pressure isolation rooms when available [103] . Successful policies for containment of SARS in EDs demand strict attention and enforcement of ED operational protocols (including procedures for recycling of supplies and equipment, and guidelines for optimization of patient and staff traffic) [97] .

We found that 14 of these patients were exposed without using an N95 respirator. Therefore, in our participating hospitals, almost all MERS-infected HCWs were related to not using appropriate PPE.

Both were exposed to AGP, intubation of a MERS patient (seropositive case in our study) and cardiopulmonary resuscitation of a MERS patient (PCR-confirmed MERS case). Although the fitting test was not performed in either case, we guess that the N95 respirator is less efficient in AGP for high-virus-burden patients.

It is also called the N95 mask or dust mask. It is useful to know that particulate respirators are classified as not resistant to oil, N; resistant to oil, R; or oil proof, P. Depending on percent filter efficiency of the air particles they filter, they are designated as 95, 99, or 100, thus resulting in nine classes of non-powered air-purifying particulate filters. An air-purifying respirator can have an air-purifying filter, cartridge, or canister, and it can have a quarter mask facepiece, half mask facepiece, or a full mask facepiece. Powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) use a blower to force ambient air through air-purifying elements and then through tubing into a hood or helmet. Parts of a PAPR are a half or full facepiece, hood, or helmet, a breathing tube, a canister or cartridge with filter, and a blower. They may be able to provide additional protection compared to the usual N95 respirators if P100 filters are used, because they filter 99.7% of particles 0.3 μm in diameter and provide full face and neck protection including eyes and ears. Others such as supplied air respirators (as in airlines) or the self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) such as those used by divers are rarely necessary for a hospital respiratory protection program or pandemic preparedness. The reader is encouraged to look up resources from CDC, NIOSH, and OSHA [4] [5] [6] for a more detailed description of the different types of respirators. The respirator classes are given an assigned protection factor value which is applicable when the respirators are properly selected and used in compliance with the OSHA Respiratory Protection standard (29 CFR 1910.134), with properly selected filters or canisters, as needed. A higher APF value is expected to provide greater respiratory protection to employees. For example, a common N95 respirator has an APF of 5, a full facepiece PAPR has an APF of 1,000, and a full facepiece SCBA has an APF of 10,000 [6] .",20.932431905496976,12.821713067253532

They have a higher assigned protection factor and therefore useful in high-hazard situations. Patients can see the wearer's face, and they are easier for communication than an N95 respirator. Reusable respiratory protection equipment has advantages when dealing with pandemic events of potential airborne transmission (such as pandemic influenza or spread of coronavirus such as MERS). In the setting of a pandemic, it is likely that a very large volume of disposable N95 masks would be required to provide protection to every healthcare worker (including not only physicians and nurses but also any other individual, paid or not, who may share air space with individuals with potentially infections transmitted through the airborne route). In these situations, reusable equipment may be more advantageous. They have the disadvantages of being heavy to wear, interfering with stethoscope use, being noisy and sometimes making communication difficult, needing batteries or electricity, and potential for contamination with infectious material, thereby requiring decontamination and reprocessing between uses [8] . There are also theoretical concerns about how PAPRs may affect the wearer's performance. Some of this data comes from nonmedical use of respirators. Visual acuity may decrease, up to 75% in some reports, and visual range may be diminished. More concerning is the potential impact on steadiness and even cognitive impairment (although most studies have failed to prove this) during use due to thermal burden (when temperature rises over 85 °F, there is decreased reaction time, and this correlates with unsafe work behaviors) especially in hot environments [9] [10] [11] [12] . A study performed by AlGhamri et al. [13] found no cognitive impairment in individuals using N95 or PAPRs while performing predetermined tasks but found a negative effect in cognitive function when using negative pressure, full-face respirators. This study was limited by a small sample size and the lack of experience with respirator use by many of the studied subjects. A previous study showed that the use of a PAPR was associated with a potential decline in speech intelligibility, but this did not reach statistical significance when compared to other respiratory protection equipment or no respiratory protection at all. Even though full-face PAPRs do not require fit testing, they need to be properly size fitted. PAPRs are not exempt from limitations in their capacity to protect individuals when they are not properly size fitted. Gao et al. evaluated the level of protection provided by a PAPR in manikins, using different sizes of full-face masks. They found decreased protection when the manikins were not fitted with a properly sized full-face mask [12] .",22.63367891774455,10.50380845827915

The use of face masks for this purpose is more common in certain geographical regions, such as China and India, where population densities are higher, and the residents are more likely to be chronically exposed to PM 2.5 levels exceeding annual World Health Organization Air Quality Guidelines (<10 μg/m 3 ) (9). The compliance of use of respiratory face masks should be facilitated by features such as the Smart Valve and operational Micro Ventilator (Figure 1) , which are designed to aid in the evacuation of exhaled gases from the interior of the mask (11) . The enhancement of user comfort may be measured quantitatively through assessment of gas content in the dead space of the mask and systemic and facial thermoregulation (11) . Goh et al.

In contrast, wearing the mask with operational Micro Ventilator brought FICO 2 levels for both activities closer to baseline levels obtained in children not wearing the mask. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation experiments conducted in adult subjects have demonstrated that the introduction of a ventilation fan to the N95 mask is a feasible option for reducing CO 2 accumulation in the dead space of the mask and also for controlling the temperature of the air within the dead space (21, 22) .

Yet, facemasks had not been included in the prevention program, relying instead on behavioral mechanism such as, if provoked, turning away and coughing or sneezing into clothing, not hands. The use of facemasks, as a preventive measure, is widely recommended (Gilardi et al. 2015) , based on assumptions made from human hygiene and respiratory disease prevention. For influenza viruses, which show similar modes of aerosol transmission as pneumoviruses, wearing of surgical masks can reduce the overall viral copy numbers of exhaled aerosols by 3.4-fold; however, it cannot completely avoid the shedding of infectious virus beyond the mask (Milton et al. 2013) . Commonly used surgical facemasks and N95 respirators have been shown to be equally effective in filtering influenza virus (Johnson et al. 2009 ). Unfortunately, compliance seems to be a major limitation resulting in lower efficacy of face mask use (Radonovich et al. 2009 ). In a hot and humid environment under physical strain, wearing a N95 facemask is uncomfortable and it is unlikely that recommendations will be followed at all times. Due to the incomplete protection through face masks, the additional use of a field lab, which detects virus shedding, and a quarantine system could be an effective asset to existing prevention programs, as it does not rely as much on human compliance-although this would present logistical difficulties for tourism programs. An in-situ field lab could also be used for real-time and onsite diagnostics in other wildlife disease outbreaks, which would allow for timely management decisions. Furthermore it is useful in distinguishing humans infected with (and shedding) a respiratory pathogen from those with, for instance, a noninfectious smokeŕs cough.

The statistical significance of results obtained for different challenge microbial agents and for different mask configurations (masks with operational or nonoperational ventilation fans and masks with sealed Smart Valves) was assessed. Results: The results demonstrate >99.7% efficiency of each test mask configuration for exclusion of influenza A virus, rhinovirus 14, and S. aureus and >99.3% efficiency for paraffin oil and sodium chloride (surrogates for PM 2.5 ). Statistically significant differences in effectiveness of the different mask configurations were not identified. The efficiencies of the masks for excluding smaller-size (i.e., rhinovirus and bacteriophage ΦΧ174) vs. larger-size microbial agents (influenza virus, S. aureus) were not significantly different. Conclusions: The masks, with or without features intended for enhancing comfort, provide protection against both small-and large-size pathogens. Importantly, the mask appears to be highly efficient for filtration of pathogens, including influenza and rhinoviruses, as well as the fine particulates (PM 2.5 ) present in aerosols that represent a greater challenge for many types of dental and surgical masks.

Recently simple and efficient production of human proteins using the versatile gateway vector system has been developed [143] . In this approach, protein expression system is applied to the in vitro expression of 13364 human proteins and assessed their biological activity in two functional categories and developed ""human protein factory"" infrastructure which includes the resources and expression technology for in vitro proteome research. In another approach, DNA array to protein array (DAPA) is utilized, which allows the ""printing"" of replicate protein arrays directly from a DNA array template using cellfree protein synthesis [144] . Based on the nucleic acid programmable protein array (NAPPA) concept, high-density self-assembling protein microarray is developed to display thousands of proteins that are produced and captured in situ from immobilized cDNA templates [145] . This method will enable various experimental approaches to study protein function in high throughput. The adventage of protein-based microarrays allows the global observation of biochemical activities on an unprecedented scale, where hundreds or thousands of proteins can be simultaneously screened for protein-protein, proteinnucleic acid, and protein-small molecule interactions, as well as posttranslational modifications [146, 147] . The microarray format provides a robust and convenient platform for the simultaneous analysis of thousands of individual protein samples, facilitating the design of sophisticated and reproducible biochemical experiments under highly specific conditions [148] . The principal challenges in protein array development are 3-fold: (1) creation of a comprehensive expression clone library; (2) high-throughput protein production, including expression, isolation, and purification; (3) adaptation of DNA microarray technology to accommodate protein substrates [149] . Functional protein microarrays differ from analytical arrays in that functional protein arrays are composed of arrays containing fulllength functional proteins or protein domains (Figure 4) . These protein chips are used to study the biochemical activities of an entire proteome in a single experiment. They are used to study numerous protein interactions, such as protein-protein, protein-DNA, protein-RNA, proteinphospholipid, and protein-small molecule interactions [150, 151] . Companies have introduced protein arrays aimed not only at proteomic analysis but also functional analyses of proteins (e.g., Biacore AB, Ciphergen Biosystems Inc., Phylos Inc.). Affinity proteomics aim to produce antibodies to every protein expressed by the human genome and these will be characterized against purified antigens and tested on tissue arrays to collect information about their specificity for tissue antigens [152] . Companies are focused to produce various binding partners, for example, affibodies, monoclonal antibodies, and their fragments [153] . Protein chips will likely be the next major manifestation of the revolution in proteomics and offer another solution to analyze low abundant proteins and have the potential for high throughput applications to identify biomarkers [154] . Protein chips differ from previously described methods; whereas screening by 2DE or LC MS/MS can potentially detect any protein, and protein chips can only provide data on set of proteins selected by the investigator [155] .",13.2971963421017,7.65297821337268

The protection factor of N95 mask or N99 mask except G model was nearly 30 times greater than the surgical mask, and no surgical mask protection factor was above 8. Face fit testing reduces the risk of exposure to infectious agents by the airborne route (Huff et al. 1994; Hannum et al. 1996) . The fit factor obtained through fit testing may not adequately predict the true respiratory protection when the worker is performing actual work activities. As true workplace protection factors are often difficult to measure, simulated workplace protection factors are used as an alternative to estimate the respiratory protection level. In our study, simulated workplace protection factors were conducted using a TSI PortaCount Plus Model 8020. The assigned protection factor is 100 for N95 or N99 masks (AQSIQ 2010); in our study, 150 was set as pass level. The laboratory-generated protection factor results are expected to be greater than the field protection factor results due to lower workload and narrower range of head movements performed in the test. Lee et al. (2008) found that N95 masks had protection factors that were 8-12 times greater than those of surgical masks.

The majority of particle penetration of N95 masks and N99 masks comes from facepiece leakage (Liverman et al. 2009; Grinshpun et al. 2009 ). There even have debate in clinical protection efficiency of surgical mask and N95 mask against aerosol infection. Seto et al. found that not consistently wearing either a surgical mask or an N95 mask was associated with developing SARS when compared with their consistent use (Seto et al. 2003) . Only mask usage was significant in the multivariate analysis; however, there was no difference in risk of infection whether HCWs were using surgical masks or N95 mask. Loeb et al. did a retrospective cohort study of 43 nurses in 2 critical care units with SARS patients and find a trend toward increased protection from N95 masks compared with surgical masks, but this was not statistically significant (Loeb et al. 2004 ). Unfortunately, Gamage et al. pointed out that the small sample size of the cohort and other confounding factors made interpretation of the results difficult. The role of fit testing was not addressed, and the potential for accidental autoinoculation when removing gear was not examined (Gamage et al. 2005) . A cluster randomized clinical trial was conducted to compare the clinical efficacy of surgical masks versus N95 mask with and without fit testing, versus control in influenza transmission in 1,936 healthcare workers in China. N95 masks were found to have statistically significant efficacy, while surgical masks showed no efficacy (Liverman et al. 2009 ). The efficiency of N95 or N99 mask depends on user compliance. It is feasible that the improved efficiency of an N95 respirator over a surgical mask may be easily lost if compliance is poor or inadequate training is provided. Radonovich et al. study showed that no more than 30 % of workers tolerated respiratory protective devices consistently throughout an 8-h workday, citing difficulties with speaking and communication, discomfort and other physical problems (Radonovich et al. 2009 ). Few data are available on the clinical effectiveness of surgical masks and N95 masks in preventing the transmission of respiratory disease viruses. There is a pressing need for research in respiratory protection, particularly for randomized, controlled trials on the effectiveness of different protection level masks. Faced with the emergence of a virulent disease like SARS, recommended the use of N95 mask, that must be properly fit and used in conjunction with other necessary protective equipment (eye protection, gloves, coveralls, etc.) and infection control procedures. Surgical masks do not offer sufficient protection against the inhalation of viral aerosol because they cannot provide a close face seal. In our study, the filter material of the surgical mask had good protection against viral aerosol, but they had lower face fit factor and cannot provide adequate protection efficiency against viral aerosol. If the surgical masks use the face seal technology and have good face fit factor, they can be used to protection against aerosol infection particularly where the availability of N95 respirators is limited. For the HCWs of healthcare settings in general, the surgical mask is enough, and it will be excellent if the surgical masks have used the face seal technology.",32.55167118083059,13.423510229386057

Of the health care workers who died from COVID-19 in Wuhan, three were Chinese ophthalmologists who worked in the same unit including Li Wenliang, who believed that he had been infected while treating an asymptomatic glaucoma patient. 9, 10 The route of transmission in these cases is unknown, but the upper respiratory system and nasopharynx are a major site of viral infection, and likely present a higher risk to the ophthalmologist than exposure to tear film harbouring SARS-CoV2. Recent studies have shown that viral RNA may be observed in association with the small minority of patients who display conjunctivitis (i.e. < 1% of patients with COVID-19 presented with conjunctivitis). Viral RNA has not been identified in the tear film of COVID-19 patients without conjunctivitis to-date, but data representing sampling performed early in disease when viral load is highest are lacking. 11, 12, 13 The World Health Organization (WHO) and United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have recommended the use of full PPE for the examination of PUIs and COVID-19 patients. The face masks can be divided into N95 respirators and surgical masks, and both have different uses. The N95 respirator is designed with filtration requirements to prevent inhalation of small airborne particles and minimize leakage from the facial seal. 14 As such, it protects the wearer from the inhalation of viral particles. Surgical masks are often fitted loosely but can prevent respiratory droplet transmission and prevent hand-to-face contact. They are considered to be more effective in preventing spread from an infected person wearing the mask to another than in protecting the wearer from infection.

As stated, 75% of the staff wore N95 respirators and 84% reported previous fit testing; however, because of the anonymous nature of the survey, previous fit testing could not be correlated with observed appropriate PPE adherence or choice of respirator.

Perhaps this is because younger children are least capable of hygienic behaviour and have longer lived infections and greater social contact, thereby acting as portals of infection into the household. 21 Additional benefit from reduced transmission from children to other members of the household is broadly supported by the results of other study designs where the potential for confounding is greater. The seven casecontrol studies suggest that implementing barriers to transmission, isolation, and hygienic measures are effective with the use of relatively cheap interventions to contain epidemics of respiratory viruses. We found limited evidence of the superior effectiveness of barrier devices to droplets such as the N95 masks over simple surgical masks. N95 masks are respirators with 95% filtration capability against non-oily particulate aero sols. 38 Although they are more expensive and uncomfortable (especially if worn for long periods) than simple surgical masks, they may be useful in high risk situations.

Influenza spreads through person-to-person contact via airborne particles as well as by direct and indirect (e.g., via fomites) contacts. Several studies have shown that facemasks can be an effective mitigation strategy. A recent study on facemasks and hand hygiene showed a 10 -50% transmission reduction for influenza-like illnesses (Aiello et al., 2010) . Other studies have also shown that facemasks can not only act as a barrier (Del Valle et al., 2010) but they can redirect and decelerate exhaled air flows to prevent them from entering the breathing zones of others (Tang and Settles, 2009) . Several laboratory studies on mask effectiveness have shown that N95 respirators are 21.5% effective in protecting against the inhalation of nanoparticles, while surgical masks were only 2.4% effective (an Lee et al., 2008) . However, a study by Loeb et al. (Loeb et al., 2009) found that surgical masks and N95 respirators offered about the same percentage of protection for nurses in hospitals. Although several studies have shown that both surgical masks and N95 provide similar protection against influenza, a recent editorial by Killingley (Killingley, 2011) discusses two studies and argues that the results are still inconclusive and that more research is needed. For our model we will focus on N95 respirators since we are interested in analyzing optimal interventions, however, our analyses may be applicable to surgical masks based on Loeb et al. (Loeb et al., 2009 ) results. Using a mathematical model, Tracht et al. (Tracht et al., 2010) analyzed the effectiveness of facemasks in reducing the spread of pandemic (H1N1) 2009. They compared the impact that surgical and N95 masks could have on reducing the spread of influenza. Their results showed that facemasks can be an effective intervention strategy for mitigating an airborne disease.

Methods: Ten health care workers exercised at 2 health care-associated work rates wearing an elastomeric air-purifying respirator. Mixed inhalation/exhalation respirator dead space gases (oxygen, carbon dioxide) were sampled, and physiological parameters were monitored (heart rate, breathing rate, tidal volume, minute volume, oxygen saturation, transcutaneous carbon dioxide). Numerical rating scales were used to evaluate comfort and exertion. Results: Compared with controls (no respirator), significant decreases in the breathing rate at both work rates (P , .05) and increases in tidal volume at the lower work rate (P , .01) were noted with respirator use. Approximately half the subjects had transcutaneous carbon dioxide levels above the upper limit of normal after 1 hour of use. Although well tolerated, comfort was negatively impacted by elastomeric air-purifying respirators wear.

Responses from unit and hospital managers indicated a high level of knowledge of this policy (93.3% and 85.4%, respectively). Health care workers from those units overwhelming (95.5%) stated they would select an N95 respirator or a more protective PAPR when caring for a patient with suspected or confirmed pH1N1, demonstrating a high level of knowledge of the policy even if it may not have been consistently followed in practice. We did not assess awareness of the Cal/OSHA ATD standard; thus it is not possible to determine whether or not having an applicable new state regulation was a key factor in promoting the implementation of these policies in California. In contrast, a survey of medical students and residents at a Washington, DC, hospital (November-December 2009) showed that only 13% of medical students and 21% of residents would wear an N95 respirator when caring for a patient with influenza symptoms. 15 Another study conducted at a New York City hospital identified 277 unprotected health care worker exposures related to 44 patients with pH1N1 infection (May-July 2009), explained by suboptimal adherence to PPE recommendations in addition to other factors. 16 In general, the basic elements required with respirator use (eg, medical clearance, fit testing, and employee training) were in place in all hospitals, as demonstrated by consistent responses across health care workers, unit managers, and hospital managers. Because onsite evaluation visits were conducted in January-February 2010, we are unable to report on the extent of N95 respirator readiness in these facilities at the start of the pandemic. Jaeger et al 14 found that 52% of health care workers exposed to the earliest California patients with pH1N1 infections after admission to the hospital were ""N95 ready,"" defined as having been fit tested within the past year and knowing the appropriate size and location of N95 respirators. Data collected from 22 states on 48 health care workers with clinical care duties who had been infected with pH1N1 showed that 69% had ever been fit tested, another assessment of respirator readiness. 17 A National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health survey of internal medicine residents and fellows at 4 Utah hospitals conducted August-September 2009 showed a lower level of training on N95 respirator use (43%) and lower level of fit testing (22% between the beginning of their training and June 2009) than found among this California health care worker sample. 18 Interviewed health care workers overwhelmingly (94%) believed that N95 respirators would be more effective than surgical/ medical masks at protecting them from pH1N1 infection. Given that clearly understanding the differences in protection and appropriate use between respirators versus surgical/facemasks had been cited as a potential challenge for the health care field in pandemic influenza preparedness, 2 our results may reflect progress made in this area. In contrast, 24% of respondents in the Utah study believed that surgical masks and N95 respirators provided equal protection. 18 The heightened awareness among California health care workers about the role of respiratory protection against pH1N1 may have been due to publicity regarding the new ATD standard, and/or employer or union-based educational efforts.

However, due to the variability of surgical smoke and its potential hazards, the implementation of personal protective equipment (PPE) is also needed to protect healthcare workers in ORs. The Association for periOperative Registered Nurses (AORN) recognizes the hazard of the surgical smoke. AORN also urges the use of PPE and evacuation and filtration of smoke through an appropriate system (AORN, 2016a,b,c) . They recommend using fit-tested surgical N95 FFRs or high-filtration masks to protect against surgical smoke (AORN, 2008; Benson et al., 2013) . However these recommendations are not regulatory requirements, and presently the use of N95 FFRs in ORs is primarily limited to procedures involving HPV. Overall, SMs remains the standard protection devices in ORs. Recently, so-called 'N95 surgical mask respirators' (SMRs) have been introduced. The SMRs are cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in ORs, and certified by NIOSH to receive an N95 grade (although the NIOSH does not evaluate FFRs for surgical use). However, little is known about the performance of either SMs or SMRs against surgical smoke. Rozzi et al. (2012) investigated the absorption capabilities of organic vapor FFRs against the aromatic hydrocarbons generated in surgical smoke, but neither this nor similar investigations addressed the particulate matter component. A higher grade FFR (N100) was pilot-studied against surgical smoke from porcine tissue (Koehler et al., 2014) . One of these facepieces was modified by creating a FS made of ethylene vinyl acetate foam that was affixed to the inner perimeter of the respirator, replacing the stock face seal. The modification significantly improved the respirator performance by minimizing the FS leakage. It is acknowledged that N100 FFRs have limitations for deployment in ORs due to their exhalation valve component. However, it is still important to generate data about the efficiency of these highest grade facepieces against surgical smoke because it will help determine the feasibility of making appropriate design modifications to other respirators, e.g. N95 SMRs (that have no exhalation valves), in order to maximize their performance.",18.242330683954567,8.70142868637125

Face masks are also used, often in conjunction with eye protection, to protect the mucous membranes of the wearer from exposure to blood and/or body Á uids when splashing may occur. Our previous systematic reviews failed to reveal any robust experimental studies that demonstrated that healthcare workers wearing surgical face masks protected patients from HCAI during routine ward procedures, such as wound dressing or invasive medical procedures. 1, 2 Face masks are also used to protect the wearer from inhaling aerosolised droplet nuclei expelled from the respiratory tract. As surgical face masks are not effective at À ltering out such particles, specialised respiratory protective equipment (respirators) may be recommended for the care of patients with certain respiratory diseases [e.g. active multiple drugresistant pulmonary tuberculosis, 174 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and pandemic inÁ uenza]. 175 The À ltration efÀ ciency of these respirators will protect the wearer from inhaling small respiratory particles, but to be effective, they must À t closely to the face to minimise leakage around the mask. 1, 2, 176 The selection of the most appropriate respiratory protective equipment (RPE) should be based on a suitable risk assessment that includes the task being undertaken, the characteristics of the biological agent to which there is a risk of exposure, as well as the duration of the task and the local environment. Where the activity involves procedures likely to generate aerosols of biological agents transmitted by an airborne route (e.g. intubation), RPE with an assigned protection factor (APF) of 20 (equivalent to FFP3) should be used. In other circumstances, such as where the agent is transmitted via droplet rather than aerosol or where the level of aerosol exposure is low, the risk assessment may conclude that other forms of RPE (e.g. APF10/ FFP2) or a physical barrier (e.g. surgical face mask) may be appropriate, such as when caring for patients with inÁ uenza. Where RPE is required, it must À t the user properly and the user must be fully trained in how to wear and adjust it. 177 We identiÀ ed four systematic reviews of the use of facial protection, all of which had been undertaken in the aftermath of the SARS outbreak and in response to the H1N1 inÁ uenza pandemic.

Due to the 1 size (ie, extra large) of level-D coveralls, petite female HCP had baggy fits that blunted their work processes. In contrast, for large male HCP with problems rolling down the coverall off their shoulders, 1 hospital changed its protocol to advise them to pull the coverall down by holding the sleeves with hands inside the sleeves on the back. Likewise, cup-shaped N95 respirators often developed cracks in the chin area for small-jawed female HCP. When HCP failed the fit-test or found fluorescent lotion contamination, it provoked anxiety. Evolving PPE protocols over the prolonged outbreak period caused confusion for HCP at later PPE trainings attributable to changes from practical experience or other hospital benchmarks. Inconsistent government protocols (eg, different holding locations for N95 respirators; that is, by side strings or the front) increased confusion. Participants also wanted valid evidence on effective hours for PPE items. The most common doffing difficulty was locating the coverall zipper-slider and pulling it down with gloved hands. Sometimes the overlapping parts of different PPE items were ill-fitted (eg, gaps between goggles and N95 respirator). With more PPE items, the doffing order became complicated and confusing.

Perhaps Western society has another lesson to learn by observing the oriental customs besides acupuncture.' He proposed that this matter be studied in a rigorous manner. Since then, there have been many studies on the filtration efficiency under controlled laboratory settings, but until recently there has been limited study as to whether masks or respirators will provide clinically relevant protection in healthcare settings. Most data have been derived from at best observational settings and frequently has been based on anecdotal rather than controlled trials evidence. 4 focused specifically on N95 masks. 8, 9 Although the authors concluded from the pooled estimate of effect that the intervention effectiveness was 91%, this evidence was thin as the studies included showed inconsistencies and failed to adequately describe the use of controls. Jefferson and colleagues concluded that more experimental studies were needed to identify the effectiveness of wearing face masks or respirators in reducing exhaled infectious viral particles. 7 In 2009, we reported the first prospective cluster-randomized trial comparing surgical masks, non-fit-tested P2 masks (N95 equivalent) and no masks in prevention of influenza-like illness (ILI) in households. 10 Intention to treat analysis showed no significant difference in the relative risk of ILI in the mask groups compared with the control group. However, less than half of the subjects wore masks 'most of the time'. Adherence to mask use significantly reduced the risk of ILI-associated infection, with a hazard ratio of 0AE26 (95% CI 0AE09-0AE77; P = 0AE015). A recently reported randomized trial showed a significant benefit of both hand hygiene and face masks (worn by the index case and contacts) in preventing influenza transmission in households, although adherence to the face mask intervention was low among household contacts. 11 Surgical masks and N95 respirators have been recognized as an important non-invasive technology to use during this new pandemic period. However, there are many factors which may compromise the overall effectiveness of these measures. Poor training, lack of guidance and consistency in the use of masks, improper use and for N95 respirators, the need for fit-testing, may limit their usefulness. Data from the SARS experience in Toronto illustrated the need for training and monitoring; Loeb and colleagues (2004) found that nine of 32 (28%) nurses entering a SARS patient's room did not consistently wear appropriate respiratory protection. 12 There is also the problem of workplace acceptance. In a logistics exercise undertaken during the peak of seasonal influenza activity in 2007 in Australia, compliance by emergency department staff, with N95 mask wearing was found to be low, with only 36AE1% of participants wearing the mask 'occasionally' in week one and only 18AE8% by week four. Many staff reported that they found the mask hot and hard to breathe through, and others reported that they had problems both communicating with patients and storing the mask between uses. 13 Much time and effort has been devoted to developing an optimal strategy for the use of pandemic vaccines and antivirals, in addition to non-pharmaceutical measures. However, comprehensive assessments of the literature to date recognize the generally poor quality of evidence on which to base non-pharmaceutical pandemic planning decisions. Despite the lack of high level evidence, recommendations on the use of face masks and respirators for HCWs are made by many health authorities. To ensure that HCWs wear face masks to protect themselves during this time, cultural attitudes and the physical discomfort and mechanical issues associated with long-term respirator use must be addressed. Other factors that affect the use of personal protective equipment, such as staff and management attitudes about the value of respirator use, fatigue and the availability of replacement masks, also need to be considered.",33.064007909661115,15.990030114897046

The simplest and least expensive types are particulate respirators, such as the N95 respirator [57] . The chemical cartridge/gas mask respirator filters out gases and sometimes particles from inhaled air; the effectiveness of the mask for reducing exposure is dependent upon the type of filter used in the mask [57] . Some filters are designed primarily to remove particles (such as biological warfare agents) and others to remove chemicals. Powered airpurifying respirators (PAPRs) work by using a fan to blow air through a filter and into the hood worn by the user; the same types of filters used for the gas mask respirator may also be used for the PAPR [57] . Of note, some PAPRs are designed to provide additional levels of protection, including eye coverage and skin coverage, and thus may be used to protect against not only droplet and airborne transmissions but also trans-ocular and contact-based transmissions. To obtain a similar level of protection with an N95 device, additional barriers, such as face shields, must be used in addition to the respirator. N95 respirators are designed to block at least 95 % of all particles between 0.1 and 0.3 μ and have higher efficiency with larger particles. Among particles ≥0.75 μ, the filtration capacity in vitro exceeds 99.5 %, provided that there is a good facial fit [58] . Medical masks, which are not designed for particle filtration, have lower efficiency. One specific medical mask has 95 % efficiency for filtering particles ≥3 μ but there is not a minimum filtration standard for these devices [59] . Thus, medical masks may be effective for preventing exposure to large droplet particles, but not aerosols, which are increasingly noted to play a role in transmission of respiratory viruses [60] .",28.184952581057374,12.689021157667337

User acceptance of these devices is 1 potential barrier to implementing such a strategy in respiratory protection programs. Methods: To assess user attitudes toward various respirators, health care workers enrolled in respiratory protection programs in a medical system using EHFRs, N95s, and PAPRs and completed an online questionnaire that addressed attitudes, beliefs, and respirator preferences under different risk scenarios. Responses were compared between user groups. Results: Of 1,152 participants, 53% currently used N95s, 24% used EHFRs, and 23% used PAPRs. N95 users rated their respirators more favorably compared with EHFR and PAPR users (P < .001) regarding comfort and communication, however, EHFR users rated their respirators much more highly regarding sense of protection (P < .001). For all user groups, reusable respirators were significantly more likely (odds ratios 2.3-7.7) to be preferred over N95 filtering facepiece respirators in higher risk scenarios compared to ""usual circumstance"" scenarios. Conclusions: Despite somewhat less favorable ratings on comfort and communication, experienced EHFR and PAPR users still prefer reusable respirators over N95s in certain higher risk scenarios.

Only 6 of the 28 Project BREATHE characteristics are currently evaluated with Surgical N95 respirators, suggesting that adoption of these characteristics in future respirator designs should help improve respirator compliance among HCP. It should be noted that some of the Project BREATHE characteristics in Table 2 can be met today with other respirator types.

Notes: Assigned protection factor (APF) is an estimate of the exposure reduction that a type of respirator is expected to provide when used correctly. Higher APF levels are assigned to respirators types that are expected to provide better levels of exposure reduction.

In 1995, NIOSH published a new regulation, 42 CFR Part 84, replacing 30 CFR Part 11, which gave NIOSH primary authority over certification of respiratory protective devices. These new regulations also created new tests and terminology for particulate respirators, which enabled users to select from a broader range of devices to meet performance criteria recommended by the CDC for protection against TB exposure. By the late 1990s, the N95 class of disposable (single use) filtering face piece respirators (also known informally as an ""N95,"" ""N95 respirator,"" or ""N95 Mask"") became the standard of practice for HCP providing care to patients with known or suspected TB. In 2002, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and NIOSH began issuing approvals for ""Surgical N95 respirators,"" which are NIOSH-approved N95 filtering face piece respirators that also meet the FDA requirements to be labeled as a surgical mask. These devices are often recommended in cases in which a respirator that provides fluid protection and maintaining a sterile surgical field are important. [12] [13] [14] More recently, N95 respirators have been recommended by many public health organizations as a means of reducing exposure to a variety of airborne infectious diseases, such as TB, measles, and varicella (chickenpox). 15, 16 N95 respirators also serve as the foundation for preparations for emerging infectious disease threats where aerosol transmission is considered possible. When severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged in 2003, N95 respirators became widely used to protect against this pathogen because little was known about modes of transmission during the early outbreak phase. 17 The emergence of H5N1 influenza in 2005, and the novel H1N1 influenza pandemic of 2009, led to a resurgence of appropriate usage-related questions regarding respirators. For example, during the initial stages of the 2009 novel H1N1 pandemic, the CDC issued guidance calling for the use of N95 respirators, instead of surgical masks, for HCP protection. 18 This decision differed from recommendations by the World Health Organization 18 and was considered controversial by some, 19 thus leading the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to review the science behind this recommendation and develop a better understanding of PPE necessary for a novel influenza pandemic. The IOM committee concluded that properly used N95 respirators should be better at reducing exposures and protecting against 2009 pandemic influenza than surgical masks. 18 Currently, N95 respirators remain the recommended level of PPE for highly aerosol-generating procedures with seasonal influenza patients.",31.277405072786937,12.981931722997114

Neither demonstrated the superiority of N95 respirators over surgical masks. Loeb et al. looked at rates of influenza infection in nurses in Ontario, Canada, who were randomized to wear either N95 respirators or surgical masks when providing care to patients with febrile respiratory illnesses during the 2008e2009 influenza season. 24 There was no significant difference in influenza infection rates between the two groups e both were close to 23%. Similarly, MacIntyre et al. compared N95 respirators to surgical masks for their ability to protect nurses in Beijing, China, against respiratory viral infections. 25 In contrast to the Loeb study, subjects in the MacIntyre et al. trial were required to wear their respiratory protection throughout their shifts for four weeks. The results of this study were more suggestive that N95 respirators provided protection against respiratory viral infections, achieving significance for the group of illnesses broadly classed as clinical respiratory illness, but failing to demonstrate significant protection against influenza infection. While neither study included a formal 'no-masks' group, because of ethical concerns, MacIntyre et al. compared their subjects to a convenience no-masks group of nurses working in hospitals where mask use was not routine; they concluded that rates of respiratory infection were higher in this no-mask group compared with either the mask or respirator study arms. The report by Loeb et al. drew a number of comments and criticisms including questions relating to variations in the filtering efficiencies of different makes of respirators and masks, training in N95 respirator use, poor compliance with respirator use, problems in ensuring a proper respirator fit, and infection with influenza in settings outside the workplace. 26e28",34.91066071188378,12.615282379871354

The answer depends on the relative contribution of aerosols versus large droplets to disease trans-mission. The WHO cites evidence from observational studies in hospitals suggesting that droplet transmission is responsible for the majority of nosocomially acquired cases to recommend standard plus droplet precautions for persons with seasonal influenza [39] . Recent results suggest that surgical masks are effective for preventing seasonal influenza, although some controversy exists [40] . During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, an Institute of Medicine panel recommended that HCWs use N95 masks, given the uncertainty regarding risks of transmission [41] . In resource-limited settings, priority should be given to risk-reduction interventions focusing on hand hygiene, contact precautions, expedient respiratory protection, and the use of PPE that is effective for aerosol respiratory protection, particularly during exposures likely to generate aerosols (eg, intubation).",25.69640767841621,11.667801440697703

The effective functioning of N95 respirators requires a seal between the mask and the face of the wearer. Variation in face size and shape and different respirator designs mean that a proper fit is only possible in a minority of healthcare workers for any particular mask. Winter et al. reported that, for any one of three widely used respirators, a satisfactory fit could be achieved by fewer than half of the healthcare workers tested, and for 28% of the participants none of the masks gave a satisfactory fit. 29 Fit-testing is a laborious task, taking around 30 min to do properly and comprises qualitative fit-testing (testing whether the respirator-wearing healthcare worker can taste an intensely bitter or sweet substance sprayed into the ambient air around the outside of the mask) or quantitative fit testing (measuring the ratio of particles in the air inside and outside the breathing zone when wearing the respirator). Attempts have been made to circumvent the requirement for fit testing, and it has been suggested that self-testing for a seal by the respirator wearer (see http://youtu.be/pGXiUyAoEd8a for a video demonstration) is a sufficient substitute for fit-testing. However, self-checking for a seal has been demonstrated to be a highly unreliable technique in two separate studies so that full fit-testing remains a necessary preliminary requirement before respirators can be used in the healthcare setting. 30, 31 Operationally, this presents significant challenges to organizations with many healthcare workers who require fit-testing. Chakladar et al. pointed out that, in addition to the routine need for repeat testing over time to ensure that changes in weight or facial hair have not compromised a good fit, movements of healthcare workers between organizations using different makes of respirators would necessitate additional repeat fittesting. 32 Fit-testing is likely to remain problematic to healthcare organizations for the foreseeable future. In addition to the requirement for fit-testing, 'fit-checking' is also required each time the respirator is donned to ensure there are no air leaks. 33 Finding a respirator that fits a healthcare worker is not the only challenge. Many healthcare workers find that respirators are uncomfortably hot and interfere with breathing and communication. 34 Female healthcare workers were found to be more likely to complain than males. 35 However, objective studies of the impact of respirators on performance and communication show few significant effects, although hearing clarity was impaired in users of PAPRs. 36e38 Physiological measurements during simulations of clinical workloads in subjects wearing N95 respirators recorded some deviation from normal values in transcutaneously measured carbon dioxide levels, possibly linked to the measured increases and decreases in respirator dead space of carbon dioxide and oxygen levels respectively. 39 The possible consequences of these changes are unknown, although probably clinically insignificant.",22.49039365501261,10.989530282992817

This copies the common practice of placing masks on patients with respiratory tuberculosis when they need to leave their isolation room. Diaz and Smaldone developed a bench model to explore the relative importance of dilution, deflection and filtration of infectious particles by respiratory protection when worn either by healthcare workers or patients. They concluded that deflection of exhaled particles by a mask placed over the nose and mouth of a patient, coupled with sufficient air exchanges (around six per hour) was an effective protective mechanism, providing greater protection to healthcare workers than wearing masks themselves. 41 Clinical support for this approach was provided by Johnson et al., who investigated how surgical masks and N95 respirators, worn by patients with confirmed influenza, would prevent the generation of infectious airborne particles. Surgical masks and N95 respirators appeared to be equally and highly effective in filtering out influenza-contaminated particles when worn by infected patients. 42 This small study did not investigate whether masks or respirators worn by patients reduced the numbers of cross-infection events in a real clinical setting, which would be the decisive test for this approach.",30.11201047351792,10.520132298348269

HCP routinely use surgical masks to protect their face from splashes and sprays and, depending on the hazards, may switch several times throughout the course of their work shift between a surgical mask and a respirator. In general, surgical masks are viewed as more comfortable than respirators. Most HCP are more accustomed to prolonged use of surgical masks 29 ; thus, small differences in comfort between the 2 types of devices are heightened, further leading to the perception that respirators are uncomfortable. In fact, discomfort is the most typical reason HCP cite for improper use of respirators, but this may encompass a variety of sensations and experiences, most commonly facial pressure, facial heat, facial pain, labored movement of facial muscles, or skin itchiness. 21, 30, 31 Psychologic manifestations of respirator wear, such as claustrophobia, may also be considered forms of discomfort, 32 and improper usage of these devices is relatively common, 26, 33 such that it may lead to discomfort. Interference with occupational duties in the field of health care is a common problem as well. 21 Nearly half of the HCP surveyed by Baig et al reported that an N95 respirator, at least occasionally, interfered with their ability to care for patients, 26 which is their primary concern. Poor communication has been shown to be a concern with existing N95 respirators. Speech intelligibility may be diminished in some settings when a respirator is worn, especially in noisy environments such as emergency departments, intensive care units, and prehospital environments. 34, 35 Speech intelligibility issues are of particular concern, given the potential for miscommunication leading to critical treatment mistakes. 35, 36 Time constraints are often raised as factors leading to noncompliance, with 2 principle areas of deficit: the OSHA requirement to be fit tested upon being hired and annually thereafter and the time required for proper donning and doffing of respirators. There is a costdin terms of time and moneydto utilize respiratory protection, which competes for the limited resources of HCP and hospitals. 37, 38 The numerous issues expressed by HCP demonstrate the need for respiratory protection that is designed to specifically meet their needs. Furthermore, many policy experts believe that the science to drive health care respiratory protection policies is still missing. In 2007, NIOSH's National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory charged an IOM committee to examine research directions, certification and establishment of standards, and risk assessment issues related to PPE for HCP during an influenza pandemic. One of the recommendations issued by IOM in its final report 21 called for respirator developers to revisit the entire respirator design and development process with attention to the unique needs of HCP.",24.303894806059088,9.740003877483963

If SARS Co-V is not transmitted by airborne particles but only by respiratory droplets and fomites, even one surgical mask is likely to protect the user to a significant degree. If the virus is spread by airborne transmission, the likelihood that surgical masks will provide significant protection is dependent on the viral load required to cause infection and the degree of viral shedding by the patient(s). If the number of viruses required to produce clinically significant infection is low and large numbers of viruses are shed by patients, it is unlikely that even multiple surgical masks will provide significant protection. If, however, large numbers of viruses are required and small numbers are shed, it is more likely that multiple surgical masks will provide significant protection. Unfortunately, those data are not available, although an epidemiological study has suggested that SARS is only moderately infectious. 5 Data from a recent retrospective multiple logistic regression study suggest that surgical masks may afford significant protection against SARS. This study showed that wearing either a N95 mask or a surgical mask reduced the risk of contracting SARS with little difference in risk reduction. 6 These data must be treated with considerable caution for two reasons. Firstly, the authors took no account of the degree of exposure of the wearers to high-risk situations. It is likely that staff exposed to high-risk situations would be more likely to wear a N95 mask, while those only exposed to low-risk situations would be more likely to wear a surgical mask. Without controlling for this confounding factor, it is not reasonable to compare the two types of mask. Secondly, the number of staff who contracted SARS was too small to allow meaningful multiple logistic regression analysis.",16.881359512202845,7.182021088508285

Thus, adherence to standard precautions is a critical factor in the prevention of MERS-CoV transmission. 14 This adherence, as well as the initial uncertainty about transmission routes early in the course of the disease, had resulted in widespread fear of MERS-CoV. It is known that application of standard infection control results in the termination of MERS-CoV outbreaks. 2, 4, 15, 16 Here, we showed a significant increase in the use of PPE (mainly surgical masks, respirators, alcohol-based hand sanitizer, and soap). There was a significant increase in the utilization of surgical masks and respirators during the study period. There are mixed recommendations for the care of patients with MERS-CoV with regard to placing patients in airborne isolation and thus the use of N95 respirators, droplet precautions, and surgical masks. 7, 15, 17, 18 The use of surgical masks was noted to increase significantly during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, with a reported 52% increase in use. 19 This increase in the use of PPE is paralleled by an increase in cost. It is recommended that hospitals maintain an adequate supply of PPE for use during infectious disease outbreaks. In 1 study, it was calculated that 4 sets of PPE (N95 respirators, double gloves, gowns, and goggles) per day are needed for each healthcare worker in the high-risk group, and 2 sets of PPE are required for medium-and low-risk groups. 20 Another implication for the increased use of PPE is the generation of medical waste, which we did not address in this study. In 1 simulation exercise, an additional 570 L of waste was generated per day. 21 We were not able to show a significant increase in hand hygiene practices despite the significant increase in utilization of alcohol-based hand sanitizers.

A variety of protective devices are used in health care facilities and community settings including cloth masks，medical masks (medical, surgical) and respirators (such as N95, N99, N100, P2, P3, FFP2, and FFP3); But there is no consensus around the choice between facemasks and respirators to prevent respiratory diseases . The first study of the value of face masks (cloth masks) by healthcare workers began in 1918 (Weaver, 1918) . Subsequent studies found that face masks were also used to protect medical personnel from scarlet fever, measles and influenza Whitelaw, 1919) . During the outbreak of SARS, use of masks in the general population in Hong Kong was high enough to observe an effect on all respiratory infections Lo et al., 2005) , and face mask use did prevent SARS infections in health care workers . Medical masks have been widely used for 50 years, and respirators were later specifically designed for respiratory protection . Bischoff, Reid, Russell, and Peters (2011) found that N95 respirators provided improved protection compared to medical masks (surgical masks). In addition, that study also described the equal importance of wearing goggles to enhance eye protection. For other diseases that are mainly transmitted through aerosols, such as measles, chickenpox, and other viruses, the surgical mask is not adequate in providing protection against viruses transmitted through aerosols, and filter was needed within the face mask. Nevertheless, there are different opinions regarding the efficacy of face mask for personal isolation and protection. Although Smith et al. (2016) have showed the efficacy of N95 respirators and surgical masks in protecting healthcare workers against acute respiratory infection in a meta-analysis, the study also reported that there was no significant difference between N95 respirators and surgical masks in preventing the transmission of acute respiratory infection for the protection of healthcare workers. Large-scale randomized controlled trials are likely needed to evaluate the efficacy of N95 respirators in the prevention of acute respiratory infection. In addition, reuse of facemasks and respirators is widespread globally, but for its safety, the researchers have inconsistent views and lack clinical evidence (MacIntyre and Chughtai et al., 2015; Loeb et al., 2009) . We previously reviewed the use of face masks during the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic (Cowling, Zhou, Ip, Leung, Aiello, 2010) , and found that there is some evidence to support the wearing of masks or respirators during illness to protect others from being infected, and more studies in controlled settings and studies of natural infections in healthcare and community settings are needed to better define the effectiveness of faces masks and respirators in preventing influenza virus transmission.",34.22404949658465,16.547898243642578

SMs are confused with respirators because both look similar and are worn on the face. In general, the filter efficiency of N95 FFRs is superior to SMs. (7, 8) Filter efficiency is enhanced by electrostatic charge on filter media of N95 FFRs. The most penetrating particle size (MPPS) for N95 FFRs is ~50 nm (electrical mobility diameter). (8) In the case of SMs, both electrostatic as well as mechanical (MPPS >100 nm) types are available.

(10, 11) One study evaluated the health risk of nurses using respiratory protection during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in Canada (12) and showed that N95 respirators were more protective than the SMs. Similarly, N95 respirators and hand washing were found to be effective in protecting health care workers against SARS transmission. (13) Another study reported a dramatic decrease of SARS infection from 52 to 8 among health care staff after implementation of the use ofN95 masks, gloves, and gowns. (14) Recently, the efficacy ofN95 FFRs or SMs against influenza transmission was evaluated with human subjects exposed to live attenuated influenza vaccine particles. (15) Analysis for influenza virus in the nasal washes of test subjects by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction technique showed that wearing N95 respirators offered a higher level of protection than SMs. Another study measured the protection factor for SMs and FFRs on test subjects in a controlled environmental test chamber and showed that SMs may not be as protective as FFRs. (16) Some studies have reported that SMs are as effective as N95 FFRs for respiratory protection from viral respiratory pathogens. (17) (18) (19) (20) Protection performance was tested using a fluorescein-KCl aerosol spray onto the faces of subjects wearing N95 FFRs or SMs and performing intermittent exercises on a treadmill in a chamber. (17) Test aerosol size was assumed to be about 0.1-0.3 µm based on the comparison of the filtration efficiency obtained for N95 FFRs in their study with the efficiency reported by a different group. (21) After the experiment, fluorescent stain on the faces and KCl concentrations in different layers of FFRs and SMs were analyzed to calculate the filter efficiency. Results showed that both N95 FFRs and SMs gave 95% or greater filtration efficiency, and N95 FFRs had about 2% filtration efficiency higher than the SMs indicating that SMs and N95 FFRs can provide protection in a relatively low viral aerosol loading environment. A case-control study in Hong Kong hospitals showed that both SMs and N95 FFRs were significantly effective in reducing the risk of SARS infection among staff. (18) In another study, influenza virus collected during coughing of patients wearing N95 FFRs or SMs was analyzed by quantitative real time RT-PCR. (20) The efficacy of SMs and N95 FFRs was found to be similar in preventing the spread of influenza virus from patients. Similarly, the use of SMs compared with N95 FFRs showed a non-inferior rate of laboratory-confirmed influenza. (19) Comprehensive information on the relative efficacy of FFRs and SMs for submicron-size bioaerosols is lacking. To address this issue, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommended further research in key areas including the effectiveness of facemasks and respirators against infectious particles and faceseal leakage contributing to the overall total inward leakage (TIL). (22) TIL is defined as an inverse function of a protection level offered by a respirator when the contributions of aerosol penetration through filter media, faceseal leakage, and leakage through other components are considered. It is known that FFRs are designed to provide good fitting on the human face unlike the SMs. Because of the difference in facefitting characteristics, SMs will have a larger faceseal leakage than FFRs when used by workers. One way to compare the performance of FFRs with SMs is to measure the TIL under controlled leak sizes.",21.622213212289882,10.830860931350257

If treatment cannot be postponed, it should be performed in an AIIR, and DHCP should wear at least a fit-tested N95 disposable respirator. 1, 16, 17 Patient transport. In hospitals, transport of patients requiring Airborne Precautions should be limited. If a patient must be moved outside of the AIIR, the patient should wear a surgical mask, if possible, and observe respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette. 8, 16 If the patient has skin lesions, such as with varicella zoster (chicken pox) or smallpox, the affected areas should be covered to prevent aerosolization or anyone coming into contact with any infectious agents in the skin lesions. If the patient is wearing a mask and skin lesions are covered, the HCP transporting the patient is not required to wear a mask. 8 Special considerations. I have presented limited examples of conditions requiring Transmission-Based Precautions. Many conditions (for example, SARS, smallpox, varicella zoster, 2009 H1N1 influenza) can be transmitted via multiple routes and, therefore, require the use of more than one type of Transmission-Based Precaution in addition to Standard Precautions. Also, as with MDROs, additional precautions may be indicated. Additional information can be found in CDC's 2007 isolation guideline 8 and CDC's MDROs guideline. 9 In addition, as new diseases emerge, infection control guidance and information about any special considerations for various practice settings can be found at CDC's Web site (""www.cdc.gov""). A relevant example of this is 2009 H1N1 influenza. 18, 19 Sometimes called ""swine flu,"" the 2009 H1N1 influenza is an influenza virus that was first detected in people in the United States in April 2009. 2009 H1N1 is an example of a disease that requires more than one category of Transmission-Based Precautions be followed because transmission is thought to occur through droplet exposure of mucosal surfaces, indirect contact via contaminated hands or environmental surfaces, and inhalation of aerosols near an infected person. 18, 19 CDC has published specific 2009 H1N1 influenza infection control recommendations for dentistry on its Web site. 19 With respect to the Standard and Transmission-Based Precautions infection control guidance I reviewed in this article, the following precautions are recommended. dUse patient-reminder calls to identify patients reporting influenzalike illness. If the patient reports influenzalike illness, reschedule nonurgent visits for 24 hours after the patient is free of fever without the use of fever-reducing medicine. dIdentify patients with influenzalike illness at check-in. Offer a face mask or tissues to patients with symptoms, ask them to follow respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette, and reschedule nonurgent care. When evaluating patients for urgent care, separate ill patients from others whenever possible. dUrgent dental treatment can be performed without the use of an AIIR because transmission of 2009 H1N1 influenza is thought not to occur across long distances through the air, such as from one patient room to another. dUse a treatment room with a closed door, if available. If one is not available, use the one that is the farthest away from other patients and personnel. dWear recommended PPE before entering the treatment room. dDHCP should wear a NIOSH fit-tested, disposable N95 respirator when entering the patient's room and when performing dental procedures in patients with confirmed or suspected 2009 H1N1 influenza. dIf N95 respirators, fit testing services or both are not available despite reasonable attempts to obtain them, the dental office should transition to a prioritized use mode (that is, nonfit-tested disposable N95 respirators or surgical face masks can be considered a lower level of protection for personnel at lower risk of exposure or lower risk of complications resulting from influenza than personnel at the highest risk of experiencing influenza exposure until fit-tested N95 respirators are available). Detailed information is available in CDC's Interim Guidance on Infection Control Measures for 2009 H1N1 Influenza in Healthcare Settings, Including Protection of Healthcare Personnel. 18 The recommendation for using an N95 respirator when treating patients with 2009 H1N1 influenza differs from current infection control guidance for seasonal influenza, which recommends that HCP wear surgical masks for patient care. 18 Since the 2009 H1N1 influenza situation is evolving, guidance may change as additional information becomes available.

Because surgical masks protect the mouth and nose only from splashes, spray and spatter from large-particle droplets and not the smaller aerosol particles, they cannot be used when Airborne Precautions are indicated. When breathing with a surgical mask in place, much of the inhaled air comes in around the sides of the mask, along with airborne organisms. According to CDC's 2007 isolation guideline, HCP should don fit-tested N95 respirators approved by CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) when entering the room of a patient who has confirmed or suspected infectious pulmonary or laryngeal tuberculosis (TB) or who is suspected of having TB when infectious skin lesions are present and for aerosol-generating procedures. 8 This recommendation also applies when treating patients with smallpox. When HCP use respirators while treating patients with diseases requiring Airborne Precautions, they should use the respirators in the context of a complete respiratory protection program. This program should include training and fit testing to ensure an adequate seal between the edges of the respirator and the wearer's face. 1, 8, 15, 16 Because it is not likely that patients with confirmed TB or who are suspected of having TB will be treated in nonhospital-based dental clinics, a respiratory protection program is not always necessary for ambulatory care settings. Health care settings in which HCP do not treat patients with TB need only written protocols for recognizing the signs and symptoms of TB and for referring patients to a setting in which they can be treated. 17 Patient placement. A patient requiring Airborne Precautions should be in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR), which is a singlepatient room with special air-handling and ventilation capacity. If the facility has an AIIR, a respiratory protection program is required. Elements of a respiratory protection program include education about use of respirators, fit testing and user seal checks with each use of an N95 respirator. 8 In dental offices or other medical settings in which Airborne Precautions cannot be implemented because of limited engineering resources, having the patient wear a mask, placing the Airborne Precautions are used to prevent transmission of infectious agents that remain infectious across long distances when suspended in the air.",18.011108431330705,9.294046735355243

In fact, a substantial problem for hospitals during the SARS epidemic was the cost of basic PPE, such as surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks, which increased costs markedly during this period. The quantity of PPE required by larger hospitals was very large, which placed a financial hardship on these hospitals, even though many of them did not encounter any SARS cases. Some hospitals were so anxious to acquire sufficient basic PPE that they even requested recycled PPE if it was available. The supply of higher grade respirators was greater at larger hospitals than at smaller hospitals.

Faceseal leakage is known to be a major pathway that contributes to the TIL of particles. (25) (26) (27) The number of particles penetrating through the faceseal leakage pathway of the respirators and SMs tested on subjects has been shown to far exceed the number of particles passing through the filtermedium. (27) The influence of filter penetration and faceseal leakage on the TIL measured for test subjects has been described. (25, 26) In one study, the overall TIL values for Korean half-masks and three different class (top class, 1st class, and 2nd class) FFR models donned on test subjects were measured. (25) Among the FFRs, top class FFRs (≥99% efficiency) showed average TIL values of ~5.0%. However, the TIL values for lower-efficiency FFRs (""1st class"", ≥94% and ""2nd class"", ≥80%) were ~2 times higher than the TIL values obtained for ""top class"" FFRs. Overall, the results indicated lower TIL values for the higher-efficiency FFRs. This finding is supported by the data obtained in our recent study on the inter-laboratory comparison of TIL measurement. (26) Five different N95 FFR models with different filter efficiencies were tested on 35 human subjects performing the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) fit-testing exercises in two different test laboratories. A PortaCount Pro (TSI, Shorewood, Minn.) measured the C out /C in ratio which was then converted to TIL values based on the inverse relationship between the two parameters. Filter efficiency was obtained only for four of the five models. Results showed that the overall TIL values were lower for a relatively higher-efficiency N95 model, and higher for three lower efficiency models in both laboratories. Moreover, a good agreement between the two laboratories on the TIL values measured for different N95 models was obtained, indicating the measurement was reproducible. Filter efficiency dependence of TIL obtained for human subjects in the above studies may explain the higher protection offered by the N95 FFRs compared to the SMS in health care settings. (12, 14, 15) Filter efficiency of the N95 FFRs is generally higher than that of SMs because of the difference in the filter media used for construction. The N95 FFRs are developed to meet more challenging test conditions than are the SMs. Filter efficiency for N95 FFRs is >95% when tested using charge neutralized NaCl aerosols with a CMD of 75±20 nm at 85 L/min. The penetration level does not exceed 5%, up to 200 mg aerosol loading. However, the performance among SMs may vary widely because of the far less challenging test methods used for their clearance by the FDA. (28) Filtration efficiency of high and moderate barrier SMs is >98% and low barrier SMs is >95% based on the penetration measured against nonneutralized Staphylococcus aureus bacteria of 3000±300 nm at 28.3 L/min. Some types of SMs are also tested with 100 nm diameter non-neutralized polystyrene latex spheres (PSL) at 1 to 25 cm/sec face velocity which may produce wide differences in their efficiencies. Non-neutralization of test aerosol may overestimate the filter efficiency and partly contribute to the enormous difference in the filter performance among SMs. (7, 8) TIL is dependent on efficiency of the filter device. (24, 25) Because of the higher filter efficiency, N95 FFRs are expected to show lower TIL values than do SMs as described previously. (24, 26) Faceseal leakage is a major pathway for aerosol transport inside the filtering device. (25, 27) The SMs are not designed to provide a good fitting on a human face that may allow more aerosol leakage. However, SMs were found to be as effective as N95 FFRs against aerosol particles similar to the size of infectious aerosols. (17, 19, 20) In one study, the transmission of influenza during routine health care activities by hospital nurses using N95 FFRs and SMs was assessed. (15) These authors showed that SMs were equally effective in preventing influenza virus transmission among health care workers. A similar conclusion was obtained in other studies. (16, 17) However, the performance of N95 FFRs may be higher where considerable aerosol generation can occur during procedures such as intubation or bronchoscopy. (19) Other factors, including training and consistency in the use of the device and concentration of aerosol exposure, can also influence the overall effectiveness of protective devices.",14.065937205328542,7.307271850566963

Current guidance for treating patients with an infectious disease involves frequently discarding N95FFRs, resulting in rapid depletion of existing supplies. To address this concern, the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) asked the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to conduct an analysis of the potential reuse of disposable N95FFR and N95 respirator/surgical masks. During this analysis, the IOM found that the demand for N95 respirators by the health care sector alone could be over 90 million for a 42-day influenza pandemic outbreak. 1 This analysis was consistent with the observation at Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto, Canada, where 18,000 N95FFRs were used daily during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. 2 Current respirator manufacturing techniques and practices make it difficult to increase production to meet unexpected demand.

Generally, there should be 2 to 3 groups of fixed personnel to perform tracheal intubation for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. It is recommended to rotate between groups at regular intervals (usually 14 days of quarantine) to avoid excessive fatigue of medical staff and reduce risk of infection. 1.2.1 Endotracheal intubation in emergency and limited-surgery patients (usually progressive malignancies) Preparation of operating room: Anesthesia and surgery for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients should be performed in an isolated negative pressure operating room as far as possible. Patients and medical staff must enter the operating room after the negative pressure system is activated. If there is no negative pressure operating room, you must choose an operating room with special access channels and relatively independent spatial locations. Avoid the central air conditioning and ventilation system during the operation, turn off the purification system during the operation, and perform complete disinfection after the operation. 1.2.2 Preparation of patients and anesthesiologist: Patients enter the operating room to wear medical surgical masks, then remove the patient masks before the intubation until all things are ready，and try yours best to reduce the direct exposure of the patient's respiratory tract to the operating room.

Challenging the content of the pandemic plans, for example on the use of N95 respirators, was avoided in certain jurisdictions given the significant conflict that would arise. This is consistent with conflict avoidance as described by the conflict model of decision-making (Janis & Mann, 1977) . A decision that involves a potential conflict provokes a degree of stress, the excess or absence of which is in turn a major determinant of the final decision. The N95 decision in Ontario was a result of ""defensive avoidance"" such that the risks to labour disruption would not be worth challenging a recommendation from the pandemic plan. The school closure policy went against a priori guidance, which largely endorsed school closure as a containment strategy. According to the conflict model, the (largely societal) risks associated with school closures outweighed the risks of staying with the decision. These two policies contrast in how differences in antecedent conditions, available evidence and resulting decisionalconflict, guided the policy actions. It is possible that the nature of the situation, and not theory, explained the N95 decision as the political and non-evidentiary considerations were considered legitimate. Compared with N95, very little epidemiological evidence existed for school closures with support mostly coming from modelling studies. However, the potentially large societal costs of closing schools supported a change in direction. The vaccine sequencing decisions also largely agreed with pandemic plans although the manifestation of the policy was extremely heterogeneous across Canada and within provinces. With the adjuvanted vaccine for pregnant women, little to no a priori information existed and therefore cognitive dissonance did not apply. Instead, the precautionary principle was largely used to justify decisions.",17.536850934695067,10.375571908468805

Because pneumonia can be caused by a wide variety of agents, several different infection control precautions may be appropriate. The single most important procedure to prevent the spread of infection in the hospital is hand hygiene (performed either with soap and water or a waterless alcoholbased hand sanitizer). Table 5 reviews the correct precautions for specific organisms that may be encountered in the hospital setting. Two infections that merit specific mention are pertussis and influenza. These organisms are highly infectious, and exposure among hospital staff may require chemoprophylaxis. Patients with pertussis or influenza should be admitted to a single room whenever possible. Staff also should wear masks when entering the room of patients with influenza (despite the fact that droplet transmission precautions usually only require masks within 3 feet), because several reports have suggested a role for airborne transmission [102] [103] [104] . When pulmonary tuberculosis is suspected, strict attention to airborne precautions must be followed. In addition to the use of respirators and negative-pressure isolation rooms, visitation should be limited when possible; at our institution, two primary visitors may undergo screening chest radiography to ensure that they do not have active pulmonary infection.

Decontamination of victims after the release of a biologic agent is less important than during a chemical or radiologic attack because most patients would seek medical care after the incubation period, having decontaminated themselves during this period with showers and clothing changes. In contrast, an announced attack with aerosolized biologic agents would require decontamination. Decontamination with water can cause significant heat loss in children because of their larger surface to body area. Hypothermia can occur without precautions such as the use of warming lights or blankets [4] . Decontamination similar to that recommended after a chemical attack might be necessary [19] Health care professionals who help to decontaminate patients or handle contaminated clothing must wear a gown, gloves, head and shoe covers, and an N95 (disposable) respirator. N-95 respirators are often used in tuberculosis (TB) isolation rooms, in transport of TB cases, or in other areas of the health care facility.

Pandemic infection control and prevention efforts in the healthcare setting, including guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment, produced vigorous debate regarding the quality of the scientific evidence on which the recommendations were based. 64 As an example, the WHO recommended surgical masks be worn by healthcare workers for care of patients with suspected 2009 H1N1 influenza, reserving N95 respirators with 0.3particle filtering capacity, for high-risk aerosol-generating procedures. 65 In contract, CDC recommended fit-tested N95 respirator use by all healthcare workers with close contact with suspected 2009 H1N1 cases. 66 The divergent recommendations were based on very limited evidence showing superior effectiveness of the N95 mask over surgical masks for protection against the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). 67, 68 A recent report found effectiveness of surgical masks and N95 respirators in seasonal influenza prevention to be similar in a study of 446 nurses working in emergency departments and hospital units in 8 tertiary care hospitals in Ontario, Canada, although healthcare worker infection rates were surprisingly high in both groups (23.6% and 22.9%, respectively). 69 Given the limitations of the evidence, cost and availability of the N95 masks drove infection prevention decisions in many healthcare systems.

However, the convenience no-mask group was not a randomized control arm and hospitals in this group were actually selected on the basis that most of their staff did not wear masks (which is not the norm in hospitals in Beijing), suggesting that conditions in those hospitals were different than those in hospitals from the masks groups. As a consequence, it is not possible to make any definitive judgement on the efficacy of masks on this basis. One possible bias would be if those hospitals had differentially higher risk of infection compared to the intervention hospitals, for example because of the occurrence of outbreaks. However, we monitored all hospitals involved in the study for outbreaks which may have increased apparent attack rates, and none were documented.

Because of these properties, surgical N95 FFRs are preferably used by health care personnel when protection from either fluids or aerosols, or both, may be needed. Currently, FDA clears only a small percentage of the total number of NIOSH-certified N95 FFR models under the Surgical N95 Respirators category. The use of surgical N95 FFRs in surgical and nonsurgical environments increases during outbreaks involving a known or suspected respiratory pathogen. For example, a scarcity of respirators during the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome 9 and influenza 10 has been reported.",26.458118542720836,11.768351925056663

FDA clears only a small percentage of NIOSHapproved N95 FFRs as surgical N95 respirators. The extensive use of surgical N95 FFRs in surgical and nonsurgical health care practices results in shortages during emergencies and pandemic events involving a respiratory pathogen. To address this issue, NIOSH could incorporate additional test requirements in 42 CFR Part 84 respirator approval process to parallel the protections in the FDA clearance of surgical N95 respirators. Current FDA clearance procedures 3 accept NIOSH respirator certification in lieu of filter efficiency performance and differential pressure. In theory, similar arrangements for streamlined approvals could be made if NIOSH began evaluating fluid resistance as part of its certification process. Our study showed 4 out of 6 N95 FFR models approved by NIOSH but not cleared by FDA likely also meet the fluid resistance requirement for surgical N95 FFR clearance. Even the 2 N95 FFR models that demonstrated lesser fluid resistance ability still had pass rates of 80% and 92% at the lowest velocity, insufficient to meet requirements of the standard, but suggestive of ability to provide some level of fluid resistance.

All of the models block the initial spray, but differences were found in how the synthetic blood moved through the layers of the device. Figure 2 shows the blood penetration through different layers of respirator models. A representative N95 FFR sample of model C, 1 of the 4 N95 models that passed the resistance testing, was analyzed for blood penetration through the different layers. Blood color was seen on the outer and inner sides of the outer layer (model C, 1a and 1b, respectively) and middle layer (model C, 2c and 2d, respectively). There was no red color on the outer or inner side (model C, 3e and 3f, respectively) of the innermost layer of the mask demonstrating no blood penetration. Two N95 FFR models (A and D) failed the test as shown by the blood color on the inner side of the masks. Model A had 3 layers of filter media. The outer and inner side (model A, 1a and 1b) of the outermost layer showed a wide area of the synthetic blood color. The middle layer had a relatively smaller area with color on the outer surface (model A, 2c), which diminished on the inner side (model A, 2d), indicating very little blood penetration. Surprisingly, a larger area of blood color was seen on the outer surface of the innermost layer (model A, 3e and 3f), which increased along the crease line on the inner side (model A, 3f) exposed to the face. The result was consistent between the different samples of the same model. The results are supported by the design of the respirator with different layers of filter media. The outer layer was thin and hydrophobic and blood was able to penetrate at the velocities tested in the study. The dense middle hydrophobic layer can be separated into 2 layers, but is considered as a single layer for simplicity. Although the hydrophobic middle layer appears to decrease blood penetration dramatically as shown by the reduction in the area of blood color, it actually allowed the blood to pass through it. This can be seen by the appearance of a wide area of blood color on the innermost hydrophilic layer, because of its affinity toward the water-based synthetic blood.

The 2 hydrophobic layers were not sufficient to prevent blood penetration at the test velocities. The results indicate that the numbers of hydrophilic and hydrophobic filter media, packing density of the layers, and the arrangement of the layers on the outer or inner side of the mask may influence blood penetration. The penetration of synthetic blood through hydrophobic filter media layers raises a question on the interpretation of the test method. In the case of model A, the inner side of the middle hydrophobic layer showed only traces of blood color. However, blood penetration through the middle layer could be seen by the wide area of color on the outer and inner sides of the innermost hydrophilic layer. This indicates that the innermost layer should be made of a hydrophilic material to reveal penetration of synthetic blood. In the absence of a hydrophilic layer, the device may still allow blood penetration, but it may not be easily identified by the test method. The results indicate the need for the development of a more accurate test method that can identify blood penetration on the inner side of the mask with either a hydrophilic or hydrophobic layer.",14.490351332439765,10.01643277270081

There are scenarios in which splashes/sprays occur outside of surgical procedures. For example, significant volumes of respiratory secretions from infected individuals are released at high velocity in the form of a sneeze or cough, which can spray or splash on a nearby individual wearing an SM or FFR. The possibility that some devices may allow the penetration of biologic fluids exists because of the wide variation in their construction. The design of many surgical N95 FFRs and N95 FFRs prevents the inner surface of the respirators from touching a user's face. On the other hand, some models with a flat-fold type respirator may touch the facial skin during breathing, indicating that nasal secretions can diffuse through the mask under high humidity conditions of the mask. One study tested human subjects wearing SMs to evaluate the physiologic, thermal, and subjective influence of an SM on the wearer. 18 Those authors 18 reported that 11% of subjects complained about the SM sticking to the face during inhalation.

The possibility to individually address thousands of microelectrodes in parallel allows the comfortable production of individual microarrays,0.35926896020141214,2.8076727390289307,3.0310261249542236,a08818f9-52bb-448b-bc64-a7bcd110b5c6,custom_license/Microarrays as Research Tools and Diagnostic Devices,"There are three main ways to manufacture DNA microarrays: light-directed synthesis (photolithography), piezoelectric ink-jet printing, and robot spotting (Hughes et al. 2001; Tan et al. 2003; Dufva 2009 ). For photolithography, premade masks or digital micromirror devices are used. Premade masks are used by the Affymetrix platform. For every nucleotide (nt) added to the growing strand on the solid support, a mask covering regions on the microarray where no base addition should take place is applied. Previous nucleotide blocking groups are removed by a photosensitive reaction after UV light-induced deprotection, and the extension by one further nucleotide can take place. The technology is rather expensive due to mask costs. Every array design needs its own set of masks. Usually, probes are 20-25 nt in length, and 22-40 probes per gene are synthesized. Another photolithography technology is used by NimbleGen: single-nucleotide extension is performed by light-mediated inactivation of a photolabile protective group and afterward a base addition. This is similar to the Affymetrix technology. However, NimbleGen uses micromirror devices that can lead the light needed for inactivation of protective groups to every desired spot on the microarray. Therefore, there is no need for masks anymore which makes this technology much cheaper. Another technology for making microarrays is the piezoelectric ink-jet printing technology, also called HP technology deduced from HP printing technology. The Agilent sure print technology is an example for an industrial platform. They produce cDNA or oligonucleotide microarrays. cDNA is spotted directly, oligonucleotides are synthesized base-by-base in repetitive print layers using standard phosphoramidite chemistry (https://www. chem.agilent.com/Library/technicaloverviews/Public/5988-8171en.pdf). The most widely used technology for microarray production especially in the field of research institutions and universities is the robot spotting technology: e.g., proteins, PCR products or oligonucleotides are spotted on a solid glass support using split or solid pins. Using split pins, DNA is fed in by capillary forces and deposited at defined locations on the microarray using robot technology. Usually, PCR products up to 1 kb and oligonucleotides between 20 and 100 nts in length are printed. This technology is affordable and therefore often used in individual research labs. Next to these classical technologies, also semiconductor-based systems have been developed. For example, CombiMatrix uses such a system for the production of their microarrays. Thousands of platinum microelectrodes can be addressed simultaneously to synthesize individual oligonucleotides by digitally controlled synthesis. The activation of a microelectrode leads to the production of an acid by an electrochemical reaction. This leads to the deprotection of the growing oligonucleotide strand activating it for the next synthesis step. The possibility to individually address thousands of microelectrodes in parallel allows the comfortable production of individual microarrays (Ghindilis et al. 2007 ). Over 12,000 oligos are synthesized in parallel as 50 mers.",16.60190526108404,9.605821102968463

To conduct a QNFT on one N95 respirator using the PortaCount respirator QNFT system takes at least 10 min. Therefore, if three respirator brands needed to be tested for a user to find a respirator which fitted, 30 min would be needed.

The prevention of such transmission is expensive, requiring N95 respirators and negative pressure isolation rooms. This lecture first discussed whether respiratory viral infections are airborne with reference to published reviews of studies before 2008, comparative trials of surgical masks and N95 respirators, and relevant new experimental studies. However, the most recent experimental study, using naturally infected influenza volunteers as the source, showed negative results from all the manikins that were exposed. Modelling studies by ventilation engineers were then summarized to explain why these results were not unexpected. Second, the systematic review commissioned by the World Health Organization on what constituted aerosol-generating procedures was summarized. From the available evidence, endotracheal intubation either by itself or combined with other procedures (e.g. cardiopulmonary resuscitation or bronchoscopy) was consistently associated with increased risk of transmission by the generation of aerosols. ª",25.826165968645913,14.620387692316626

Even in the absence of efficient human-human transmission the consequences of transmission are potentially catastrophic because of the severity of the disease and the risk of genetic reassortment. Preparation of infection control facilities in intensive care units has been addressed in a previous publication [31] . Infection control guidelines from the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend the use of standard, contact and airborne protection, including respirators of N95 standard or higher [32, 33] . However, the United Kingdom guidelines recommend the use of surgical masks with FFP3 (N100 equivalent) respirators only for aerosol-generating procedures [34] . We believe that the WHO and CDC guidelines are more appropriate, given the frequency of aerosol generating procedures in ICU, the risk of accidental disconnection of ventilator circuits, the high mortality associated with avian influenza and the relatively ineffective filtration provided by surgical masks [35] .

Hand hygiene can reduce respiratory infection risk also in home and community settings. 138 Face masks obstruct all transmission pathways because they block both the source and the main entry pathways of respiratory viruses.

Beyond the identification of some very broad generalizations, the characteristics of viruses that determine their environmental persistence remain largely unknown. Influenza viruses are enveloped; they are assembled at the plasma membrane of the host cell and bud from lipid microdomains called ''lipid rafts''. 143 The relationship between virus envelope and host cell membrane composition is complex. It is beyond the scope of this review to go into details of the biochemistry and biophysics of lipid membranes, but a few points deserve mentioning. It has long been known that the lipid composition of the viral and cellular membrane can differ significantly. 144 On the other hand, various strains of the influenza A virus have different fatty acid compositions even if they are derived from the same cell type. 145 It remains to be convincingly shown in which way the lipids and other components of the host cell play a role in determining the phenotype and thus the phenotypee environment interaction of enveloped viruses.",17.489937569620814,8.84308659739585

In the healthcare setting, this most commonly relates to the filtering half face mask. The European standard for filtering face masks [EN 149 (currently 2009)] lists three classes of filtering face piece (FFP): FFP1, FFP2 (approximately equivalent to N95) and FFP3. 5 These are classified by inward leakage in laboratory tests and simulated real-life use. Inward leakage can result from penetration through the material matrix of the face piece or through any gap between the face piece and the wearer's face (see Appendix 1 'fit testing'). FFP3 offers the highest level of protection. Although most of the evidence base supporting the use of FFP respirators in the prevention of airborne transmission of infection is based upon N95/FFP2 devices, FFP3 is the only FFP class acceptable to HSE for use against infectious aerosols in health care in the UK (Appendix 3). In the USA, N95 (approximately equivalent to FFP2) is acceptable, as is the case in a number of other countries. ; cardiopulmonary resuscitation; bronchoscopy; surgery and postmortem procedures in which high-speed devices are used; dental procedures; non-invasive ventilation (e.g. bi-level positive airway pressure ventilation and continuous positive airway pressure ventilation); high-frequency oscillatory ventilation; and induction of sputum.

First, use of a BSL-3 ventilation system is the prerequisite for SARS autopsies. Second, because PPE is the first barrier of protection, we invested in the maximum protection available, including gas masks, impermeable protective clothing, and 3 layers of gloves. Because the use of oscillating saws, spray, and aspirators hoses may generate infectious aerosols, and because dissection of lungs can also create aerosols and droplets [8, 9] , respiratory protection for SARS autopsies is especially important. The combined filter system of the gas masks used in our facility provided the highest level of protection available to the investigators. Although the CDC recommended that N-100 particulate respirators or powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) with HEPA filters should be used if aerosols may be generated [6, 21] , PAPRs were not available in Beijing during the SARS outbreak; thus, the gas mask became the practical choice for use in our facility. However, we noticed that the gas masks made the investigators feel uncomfortable. Therefore, PAPRs would be the better choice in the future. The 3 layers of gloves made the investigators work more cumbersome and prone to mistakes, but this was nevertheless necessary for secure protection. Third, a 3-step procedure for decontamination of PPE was strictly followed. This was indispensable for the safety of the investigators, laboratory, and environment. Last but not least, we strictly adhered to administration controls, including rigorous biosafety training, supervision, and operational procedures. Our experiences suggest that monitoring personal behaviors, together with teaching of biosafety and correct attitudes to those involved in the autopsies, best ensure the safety of autopsy performance. It is noteworthy that safety administration may be neglected until something goes wrong. For example, 2 SARS cases that appeared at the end of 2003 were laboratory acquired [22, 23] . The small SARS outbreak in late March and mid-April 2004 in China also originated from contamination of 2 researchers at the National Institute of Virology in China's Center for Disease Control [24] . These incidences indicated that safety precautions and the personal attitudes of staff members are what really counts, provided that stringent engineering and PPE standards are applied. On the basis of our experience, compared with the experience at the facilities at which the 3 accidents occurred, we feel that conscientiousness about biosafety cannot be overly stressed.",15.452474098661632,7.238367568890931

A number of difficulties were encountered during the early stages of the MERS-CoV infection outbreak. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention distributed MERS-CoV response guidelines based on those from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization. Unfortunately, the contents of these Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention documents were too general; those working in hospitals needed more detailed guidelines. Thus, the Korean Society for Infectious Disease, the Korean Society for Healthcare-Associated Infection Control and Prevention, and the Korean Association of Infection Control Nurses (KAICN) jointly released more detailed MERS-CoV infection control guidelines. However, each hospital's unique environment made the application of these guidelines complicated on an organization level. Accordingly, KAICN members who were ICNs sought answers to urgent questions about infection control using social networking services and built each individual hospital's manual using shared experiences and ideas. Based on these communication processes and the guidelines of the Korean Society for Infectious Disease, Korean Society for Healthcare-Associated Infection Control and Prevention, and KAICN, ICNs provided information on how to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) and determined the routes of access to the negative pressure rooms. Further, ICNs prepared hospital manuals addressing the screening and isolation of patients, hospital environment cleaning and disinfection, medical waste disposal, laundry management, specimen collection and delivery methods, patient transportation methods, patient admission and discharge, powered air purifying respirator management and cleaning, and the safe disposal of dead patients. Moreover, because standard, contact, and airborne precautions had to be applied to patients infected with MERS-CoV and patients suspected of infection, 11 the use of PPEs increased rapidly in hospitals, and the supply of N95 masks was insufficient. In addition to providing education on the proper methods of donning and doffing PPEs in hospitals, ICNs checked their institutions' PPE inventories and were involved in maintaining sufficient PPE quantities via contact with public health centers and suppliers. Although it was known that MERS-CoV had not undergone mutations that would have made it more transmissible, 7 its infectivity was still much stronger than assumed. Patients with confirmed MERS-CoV infection were isolated in negative pressure rooms, and the health care workers attending these patients accessed the rooms in protective whole-body suits (including a full-length gown, goggles, N95 mask, gloves, shoe covers, and other components) that were labeled ""Level D."" Because most of the health care workers had no experience using Level D PPEs, ICNs provided instruction on how to put on the PPEs, monitor the manner in which the health care workers donned and removed the PPEs, and provided guidance on how to remain free from infection during the donning and doffing processes. Furthermore, ICNs communicated with local public health centers about tasks related to patients with confirmed MERS-CoV, delivered the government's MERS-CoV-related guidelines to hospitals, and implemented the gathering of MERS-CoV infectionrelated data requested by the government.",11.075584603926323,4.565074347769989

Manufacturers recommend a user seal check to identify on-site gross leakage. However, no empirical evidence is provided. Therefore, this study aims to examine validity of a user seal check on gross leakage detection in commonly used types of N95 respirators. Methods: A convenience sample of 638 nursing students was recruited. On the wearing of 3 different designs of N95 respirators, namely 3M-1860s, 3M-1862, and Kimberly-Clark 46827, the standardized user seal check procedure was carried out to identify gross leakage. Repeated testing of leakage was followed by the use of a quantitative fit testing (QNFT) device in performing normal breathing and deep breathing exercises. Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and likelihood ratios were calculated accordingly. Results: As indicated by QNFT, prevalence of actual gross leakage was 31.0%-39.2% with the 3M respirators and 65.4%-65.8% with the Kimberly-Clark respirator. Sensitivity and specificity of the user seal check for identifying actual gross leakage were approximately 27.7% and 75.5% for 3M-1860s, 22.1% and 80.5% for 3M-1862, and 26.9% and 80.2% for Kimberly-Clark 46827, respectively.

One is that only 2 brands of respirators (ie, 3M and Kimberly-Clark) were used for gross leakage detection through QNFT. Although our aim was not to investigate the prevalence of gross leakage of all different models of N95 respirators, it was possible that different results might be obtained with different respirators. Nevertheless, we believe that the results supported the unacceptably low sensitivity and positive predictive value and futile likelihood ratios of the user seal check in identifying gross leakage of respirators. Apart from this, participants' characteristics might affect the passing rate of fit testing. First, most participants were novice users, except that some worked in clinical settings as health care workers. Previous experience and knowledge of donning an N95 respirator were insufficient, which may influence the passing rate of QNFT on gross leakage detection. This is different from a previous study, where Viscusi et al recruited subjects who were required to pass a standard QNFT. Therefore, the current results may underestimate the passing rate of QNFT. 24 Second, Asian participants' weight (reported here) and facial anthropometries (eg, face length, face width; not reported here) were significantly different from that of non-Asian people, which hence affects the passing rate of QNFT. Such differences might reduce the generalizability of the results but increase the specificity of that to Asian populations. Concerning environmental factors, the average monthly humidity in Hong Kong (subtropical climate) ranged from 67%-86% in 2014 34 ; yearly humidity computed from 2000-2014 was 78.1%. Most hospitals are only equipped with central air conditioning systems, and indoor humidity of wards may vary from 65%-75%. Relatively high humidity might underestimate the positive result of the user seal check in the current study because participants rely on subjective comparison between inward and ambient air to detect the leakage. Unlike well-controlled internal hospital settings in other regions, these environmental differences may limit the current results in that they are less relevant to other settings but are highly situation-specific results for many hospitals located in subtropical climate regions. Further studies are recommended to replicate the works from Myers et al 23 and Viscusi et al, 24 which examined the effectiveness of the user seal check on improving N95 respirator donning among Asian wearers. Another study may investigate how the change of body weight and facial anthropometries of Asian health care workers contributes to leakage of N95 respirators.",18.7800188718816,9.721537553320639

It has been reported that drug-resistant strains have already appeared, and the proportion of resistant endemic strains has reached 18% in Japan; 23 such resistance has also happened for a pandemic strain. 24 In any case, both the development and stockpiling of vaccines or drugs entail political and financial difficulties. When severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was in the news in 2003, various face masks, particularly N95 masks, were in urgent demand. As the N95 masks physically filter viruses out by fitting tightly over the mouth and nose, users have to breathe hard and so are unable to wear the masks for extended periods. Therefore, the N95 mask is not practical except in situations such as when healthcare workers or patients' family members are in close contact with patients in an emergency room or a ward. Based on experience with the SARS corona virus, Seto et al. 25 pointed out that cheaper polypropylene surgical masks were quite effective to prevent transmission among healthcare workers, and the masks were crucial for protection from droplet transmission. Kariwa et al. 26 studied the efficacy of several povidone-iodine (PVP-I) products for inactivating the SARS corona virus. 26 Here, I have compared the antiviral activity of GV with 0.5% PVP-I diluted from Isodine (Meiji Seika, Tokyo, Japan), which contained 10% PVP-I, corresponding to 1% effective I 2 . As shown in Fig. 2 , 0.0063% GV had a much greater killing effect than 0.5% PVP-I on the H1N1 virus. Certainly, PVP-I is a good disinfectant and it has been used for disinfection against various bacteria and viruses, but it seems to be difficult to dye cloth using I 2 products. On the other hand, using GV, we can dye cloth and retain the capacity to kill influenza viruses (Fig. 4) . When a reassortment has occurred, the unexpected variant influenza virus aquires new antigenicity, which voids the effectiveness of vaccines now in use. Even if this happens, however, GV may destroy not only the envelopes of H1N1 but also those of H5N1 and those of new variant strains. This is because the envelopes of influenza viruses, like cellular membranes which are easily damaged by GV, are essential and are made up of universal membrane components, i.e., lipid bilayers and proteins. Very recently, we have been given a warning of the increasing threat of an avian influenza A virus (H5N1) pandemic, issued by the writing Committee of the WHO. 27 Moreover, in articles in Science 28 and Nature 29 , it has been reported that the virulent 1918 influenza virus has been resurrected, and this constructed virus could be useful for preventing another pandemic. If the dyed cloth described here is made use of in cheaper masks, which easily become wet with exhalation and saliva, they might be able to capture respiration droplets. Consequently, I believe that a next influenza pandemic could be reduced if such GV masks (called Flu Mask) were used not only by health professionals but also by the general public worldwide. Moreover, GV seems to attack the envelope of influenza viruses (Fig. 3B) , so GV and GV-dyed cloth might be effective in preventing infections with other respiratory enveloped-viruses, such as the SARS corona virus.",21.863914696370244,9.743934191066163

The use of a mask and goggles is also recommended whenever dealing with a feverish patient or whenever there is any reason to suspect a viral infection, particularly a blood-borne viral infection. N95 masks are highly recommended when treating patients with severe respiratory signs or in cases of hemorrhagic fever, and isolation is recommended in these cases, especially the latter. Definitive laboratory diagnosis and identification of the etiology should be sought when dealing with viral infections, especially the acute and potentially lethal ones.

When we stratified by type of mask, we observed an increased risk for MERS-CoV infection among HCP who reported always using medical masks and, conversely, a lower risk among those who reported always using N95 respirators. Taken together, these results raise the hypothesis that short-range aerosol transmission might have factored in transmission. Previous studies suggest that some respiratory viruses (e.g., influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, rhinovirus) that are transmitted primarily by droplets and/or contact might simultaneously be spread through aerosol under certain conditions and perhaps by certain patients (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) .

These devices are also loose fitting and easy for HCP to by-pass. Respirators protect HCP from inhaling aerosols and from projected droplets. Tight-fitting respirators and respirators with loose-fitting hoods can limit self-contact by HCP. Elastomeric full-facepiece respirators and respirators with loose-fitting hoods offer better respiratory protection and more facial coverage against splash than FFRs. Given the severity of SARS-CoV infection, the higher level of protection afforded by a PAPR with a loose-fitting hood may be warranted. The JHA also indicated that contamination of the torso, arms, and hands is likely. Body and hand coverings should be used because, although SARS-CoV does not infect through the dermis, contaminated clothing and skin may serve as an environmental reservoir. Given the relatively short duration and limited fluid volume produced during intubation of SARS patients, fluidimpermeable gowns may not be required, particularly if HCP are able to rapidly doff soiled body coverings and perform hand hygiene. The exposure surface for MRSA is the dermis and the nares. Although infection typically requires a wound, colonization can occur at many locations on the body (Table 3 ). During intubation HCPs may be exposed to respiratory secretions and vomitus, which are unlikely to contain MRSA unless the patient is colonized in the nares or throat, or has an active MRSA pneumonia. Aerosols formed during intubation may be inhaled by an HCP into the nares, or transferred to the nares during self-contact with hands contaminated during the procedure; the torso and arms may be contaminated with respiratory secretions ( Table 2 ). Unless the HCP has an open wound or indwelling device, there is low risk of developing infection from exposures associated with intubation. PPE is necessary to prevent contamination of HCP clothing and skin, which could serve as an environmental reservoir for future transmission. Colonization of HCP rarely leads to overt symptoms; however, protection of the nares with a mask or respirator could decrease the risk of colonization or further transmission. Selection of PPE for intubation of a MRSA patient, however, should consider the likelihood of undiagnosed colonization or infection by another microorganism.",19.87937525814632,11.104391659965621

The most appropriate means of protection, for health care workers (HCW) against such threats, is not well defined. [1, 2] Some studies have suggested the use of surgical masks for HCW as inhalational barrier protection. [3, 4] However, surgical masks are neither tested nor certified for use as respiratory protective devices. They are classified under United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 21 CFR 878.4040, as a general classification of medical apparel intended to protect both patients and persons in contact with patients from transfer of microorganisms, body fluids, and particulate materials. Respirators, in contrast, are designated as inhalational protection devices. [5] [6] [7] Regulatory recommendations are often based on in vitro assessments of filtration efficiency. [8] [9] [10] However, clinically relevant in vivo studies are limited and may not reflect the in vitro data. [11] For example, studies conducted during the SARS and H1N1 outbreaks failed to show significant differences in rates of infection between HCW wearing surgical masks or respirators. [4, 12, 13] In addition, in vitro studies have shown that N95 respirators and surgical masks may underperform when challenged with viruses of smaller particle sizes such as influenza. [8, 14] Reponen et al. reported that the physical size of the SARS coronavirus and influenza virus classifies them as highly penetrable through both surgical masks and N95 respirators.

These recommendations are based on well-designed experimental, clinical, or epidemiologic studies (Category IA). Authors of these recommendations point out studies that show plain soap failing to remove organisms, and the possibility of contamination of soap or soap dishes. 16 One study concluded that handwashing was generally less effective than hand rubs. 56 Another review of hand antiseptics and viruses found experimental evidence demonstrating that some formulations of hand rubs, particularly those with alco-hol, outperformed regular handwashing. 57 Studies of an alcohol-based hand rub found a decrease in school absenteeism and infections in an extended care facility when hand rubs were made available; however, the effect on respiratory disease could not be determined since the studies did not analyze absenteeism by cause. 58 -60 As demonstrated in a study of Air Force recruits, handwipes with PCMX are effective against ARD, 24 in spite of the CDC recommendations on hand hygiene for healthcare workers, which states that antimicrobial-impregnated wipes are not as effective as hand rubs. 16 Personal protection in the form of surgical masks is recommended for isolation precautions for airborne and droplet transmission in hospitals. 61 For diseases transmitted by droplets, masks are recommended for susceptibles who come within 3 ft of infected patients. 61 These isolation precautions are not based on experimental, clinical, or epidemiologic studies, but on strong rationales and suggestive evidence. Surgical masks are used to prevent tuberculosis (TB) 61 transmission (worn by patients outside their isolation rooms), and masks may also be recommended in cases where the route of transmission is uncertain, such as during the SARS outbreak in 2003. 3 There is evidence that wearing surgical or well-fitted respiratory masks (in addition to other infection control measures) lowered the risk of SARS in healthcare settings in Hong Kong and Toronto in 2003. [62] [63] [64] Filters that can capture particles as small as 1 micron in size, with a minimum filter efficiency of 95%, are used in commercial respirators tested and certified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health as N95 respirators. 65 N95 respirators are recommended for tuberculosis, rubeola (measles), and varicella (chickenpox) control in clinical settings. 61, 65 Susceptible people should wear an N95 respirator on entering a room with a patient known or suspected to be infected with any of these pathogens. 61, 65 The use of masks or respirators in military training centers to prevent ARD has not been documented. Surgical masks have been used as a NOVARDI to prevent ARD in military training; however, there are no formal reports on their efficacy. 28 In 1942, the AFEB's Commission on Influenza discussed the possible impact of masks on respiratory disease prevention and recommended use of a gauze-covered mask with a Canton flannel filter and flexible nose band.

AORN, 15 the Laser Institute of America, 43 the American National Standards Institute, 43 and The Joint Commission 44 each recommend that surgical smoke be filtered and evacuated through the use of room ventilation and local exhaust ventilation methods; NIOSH recommends a combination of OR air exchanges and local exhaust ventilations as the first line of protection for controlling surgical smoke. 4, 18, 19 Despite these recommendations, a 2007 survey of 623 AORN members indicated weak compliance with recommended control measures. 45 In 2010, a follow-up survey of 1,356 AORN members indicated that the use of wall suction, a less-effective local exhaust ventilation method, had increased significantly for almost all smoke-generating procedures, as did the use of high-filtration surgical laser masks. 46 However, the use of smoke evacuators and the use of NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators had not changed significantly. 46 In addition, a recently published comprehensive analysis of all literature pertaining to lasergenerated air contaminants suggests that the known exposure risks coupled with the inconsistent use and marginal adoption of recommended local exhaust ventilation and respiratory control measures warrant a campaign for targeted health and safety training. 47 Based on the compendium of evidence, the authors of the literature review recommend the use of a surgical N95 respirator in the presence of laser-generated air contaminants as a prudent course of action. 47 High-filtration surgical laser masks are not designed to provide protection from the atmospheric contaminants present in surgical smoke, 43 and high-filtration surgical laser masks provide less protection to the wearer from particulate hazards than a fit-tested surgical N95 respirator. 47 According to the AORN ""Recommended practices for laser safety in perioperative practice settings,"" during high-risk or aerosol-generating procedures in patients with or suspected of having transmissible infections (eg, HPV, tuberculosis, rubeola, varicella), respiratory protection that is at least as protective as a fit-tested surgical N95 respirator should be used in conjunction with local exhaust ventilation. 15 compliance with recommended precautions and practices is an important indicator of a health care organization's commitment to a culture of safety. This includes the appropriate selection of protective facemasks. The differences in the protective features of high-filtration surgical laser masks and surgical N95 respirators for commonly encountered respiratory hazards are illustrated in Figure 3 , which can be used as a selection guide. Health care administrators should encourage individual health care workers, in conjunction with infection preventionists and occupational health or industrial hygienists, to examine the appropriate selection and use of protective facemasks.

This guidance is based on a pathogen's known epidemiology (ie, patterns of transmissibility and infectivity). 15 Particle size does not affect the infectivity of the pathogen; however, the principle that smaller airborne particles can travel farther and remain suspended in room air longer than larger particles (ie, droplets) is also an important factor to consider in selecting the best protective facemask ( Figure 1 ). Filtering facepiece respirators, such as N95 respirators, are designed to protect the user from both droplet and airborne particles, and they come in many sizes and are designed to seal to the face. Both surgical N95 respirators and surgical masks are disposable, single-use devices that should be worn during a single patient encounter by a single person and should not be shared between wearers. 18 High-filtration surgical laser masks were designed as a form of barrier or source control. When placed on a contagious patient, surgical masks limit the spread of large-sized droplet respiratory secretions to others. When worn by a health care worker, the patient's incisions are protected from infectious agents present in the worker's mucus and saliva, while at the same time, the worker is protected from any sprays of blood or body fluid coming from the patient. Only protective facemasks cleared by the FDA as medical devices are recommended for use in health care workplaces. The FDA does not independently test the devices but rather reviews the manufacturer's testing data for n filter efficiency, n breathing resistance, n flammability, and n fluid resistance. 19, 21 In addition, with regard to the filter efficiency requirements for FDA clearance, a surgical mask must perform as well as one other cleared surgical mask currently on the market. 19 Two key features associated with the level of protection provided by high-filtration surgical laser masks are filtration efficiency and fit. Studies have shown that the filtration efficiency for surgical masks is highly variable depending on the type of mask and the manufacturer. 22, 23 The filtration efficiency can be as high as that of a surgical N95 respirator, but even when surgical masks with the most efficient filter media (ie, high-filtration surgical laser masks) are properly worn, the fit factor obtained is quite low. Oberg and Brosseau 22 conducted filtration performance and fit tests with nine types of surgical masks and found that none of the models tested exhibited adequate filter performance and facial fit characteristics to be considered equivalent to a surgical N95 respirator. Surgical masks are not designed to seal to the face. Without an adequate seal to the face, inhaled breath is not forced through the filter and instead flows through the gaps around the seal area, providing minimal protection by allowing potentially hazardous contaminants to enter the workers' breathing zone through gaps between the wearer's face and the mask. Therefore, surgical and high-filtration surgical laser masks do not provide the degree of protection to be considered respiratory PPE.",25.92343401816441,11.506064599428909

Responses from unit and hospital managers indicated a high level of knowledge of this policy (93.3% and 85.4%, respectively). Health care workers from those units overwhelming (95.5%) stated they would select an N95 respirator or a more protective PAPR when caring for a patient with suspected or confirmed pH1N1, demonstrating a high level of knowledge of the policy even if it may not have been consistently followed in practice. We did not assess awareness of the Cal/OSHA ATD standard; thus it is not possible to determine whether or not having an applicable new state regulation was a key factor in promoting the implementation of these policies in California. In contrast, a survey of medical students and residents at a Washington, DC, hospital (November-December 2009) showed that only 13% of medical students and 21% of residents would wear an N95 respirator when caring for a patient with influenza symptoms. 15 Another study conducted at a New York City hospital identified 277 unprotected health care worker exposures related to 44 patients with pH1N1 infection (May-July 2009), explained by suboptimal adherence to PPE recommendations in addition to other factors. 16 In general, the basic elements required with respirator use (eg, medical clearance, fit testing, and employee training) were in place in all hospitals, as demonstrated by consistent responses across health care workers, unit managers, and hospital managers. Because onsite evaluation visits were conducted in January-February 2010, we are unable to report on the extent of N95 respirator readiness in these facilities at the start of the pandemic. Jaeger et al 14 found that 52% of health care workers exposed to the earliest California patients with pH1N1 infections after admission to the hospital were ""N95 ready,"" defined as having been fit tested within the past year and knowing the appropriate size and location of N95 respirators. Data collected from 22 states on 48 health care workers with clinical care duties who had been infected with pH1N1 showed that 69% had ever been fit tested, another assessment of respirator readiness. 17 A National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health survey of internal medicine residents and fellows at 4 Utah hospitals conducted August-September 2009 showed a lower level of training on N95 respirator use (43%) and lower level of fit testing (22% between the beginning of their training and June 2009) than found among this California health care worker sample. 18 Interviewed health care workers overwhelmingly (94%) believed that N95 respirators would be more effective than surgical/medical masks at protecting them from pH1N1 infection. Given that clearly understanding the differences in protection and appropriate use between respirators versus surgical/facemasks had been cited as a potential challenge for the health care field in pandemic influenza preparedness, 2 our results may reflect progress made in this area. In contrast, 24% of respondents in the Utah study believed that surgical masks and N95 respirators provided equal protection. 18 The heightened awareness among California health care workers about the role of respiratory protection against pH1N1 may have been due to publicity regarding the new ATD standard, and/or employer or union-based educational efforts. Thirty-five percent of health care workers reported experiencing no problems while wearing respirators, and of those who did experience problems, feeling uncomfortably warm was the most frequent issue mentioned (49%), followed by interference with eyeglasses (21%).",22.49610401225716,9.756181049957082

Similarly, those that prevent 99% and 99.97% of the particles from passing through the filter are given the designation of 99 and 100, respectively. 19 As part of the OSHA-required respiratory protection program (29 CFR 1910 .134), every health care worker who must use a respirator to control hazardous exposures in the workplace must be trained to properly use the respirator and pass a fit test before using it in the workplace. 20 Fit tests can be performed in a qualitative or quantitative manner. During a qualitative fit test, the taste or smell of the test aerosol is a sign of an improperly fitting respirator. It is a subjective test that is dependent on the sensitivity of the health care worker. Quantitative fit tests require the use of an instrument that permits a technician to monitor particles in the room air as well as particles inside the respirator while it is being worn by the health care worker. The ratio between the room count and the count inside the mask determines the health care worker's fit factor for that surgical N95 respirator. For a passing test, the fit factor must be greater than or equal to 100. 20 The fit test ensures that the health care worker is wearing a surgical N95 respirator that can provide a good facial seal and, therefore, expected levels of protection. One key aspect of determining the effectiveness of a surgical N95 respirator is performing a user seal check. Every time a person dons a N95 respirator, he or she should perform the manufacturer's recommended user seal check method to ensure that an adequate seal has been obtained. The surgical N95 respirator only provides protection when the respirator is adequately sealed to the wearer's face, and a user seal check aids the health care worker in determining whether the respirator is fitting properly.",17.298746051044603,9.258092275836038

The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-cov) outbreaks have recently raised concerns of airborne transmission in the healthcare settings [4] [5] [6] . The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended the use of particulate filtering facepiece respirators such as N95 filtering facepiece respirator (N95 respirator) or their equivalent when HCWs treat patients with airborne infectious diseases, but facepiece respirators only work properly when the face seal is tight [1] . Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a life-saving procedure that is frequently performed in the ED. Chest compressions, one of the main components of CPR, needs intense and dynamic movements. Previously published simulation studies showed that the N95 respirator did not provide adequate protection during chest compression [7] .",19.10455370149304,9.37833532760989

In Australia alone the cost of food waste to the economy is more than $8 billion each year. As a result of intensification of food production over the past 50 years there are now four major food safety challenges including: (i) emergence of new food pathogens, (ii) adulteration of food materials, (iii) unknown effects from long term consumption of genetically modified food and (iv) the presence of significant amounts of chemical contaminants/pollutants in our food (Yuan et al., 2015) . Numerous factors are contributing towards an increase in different food safety issues. These include the industrialization and mass production of agricultural products, the growing number of imported food products and variations in food consumption patterns due to changes in consumer lifestyle (Motarjemi, Stadler, Studer, & Damiano, 2008) . Moreover, consumers are leaning towards ready-to-eat meals and fast foods to save cost and time. As a result many new food borne pathogens have emerged or existing pathogens have re-emerged because of these new types (e.g. raw and fast food) of transmission vehicles. As a result, many foodborne outbreaks have occurred in the last 20 years by bacteria, viruses and protozoa, and many more pathogens are being introduced via food contamination every year (Maruši c, 2011).

The recommendation to routinely use N95 respirators during an influenza pandemic is complicated by several factors. First, N95 respirators require fit testing. Once tested, any individual must use only the brand and size of respirator for which they have been certified. During a pandemic, it is likely that supplies of respirators may be limited, and supply chains may become disrupted. Therefore, it will be difficult to provide the appropriate size of respirator for each HCW. Also, the large number of N95 respirators marketed will make the stockpiling of appropriate numbers and sizes of respirators logistically difficult. The reproducibility of fit testing over time has been questioned [23] , and prolonged use of N95 respirators has been shown to cause headaches [24] and facial discomfort [25] and may result in hypoxemia [26] .

Infection of HCWs during a pandemic is of public health concern not only because of the impact of infection and illness on the HCWs themselves but also because HCWs have frequent contact with patients who could be predisposed to serious illness if infected with influenza, and substantial rates of absenteeism among HCWs could have adverse effects on the healthcare system. 1 In 2009 the Institute of Medicine and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that all healthcare workers who would have contact with suspected or confirmed pH1N1 patients should use N95 respirators. Recommended practice in Hong Kong followed World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines under which surgical masks should be routinely worn by all healthcare workers, standard droplet precautions should be implemented during contact with influenza patients, and greater precautions including face shields and N95 respirators used when performing aerosol-generating procedures. 2 The first imported pH1N1 case arrived in Hong Kong on April 30 and, after sporadic imported cases through May, local transmission was identified in mid-June. 3 The first wave peaked in September and had subsided by November. 3, 4 pH1N1 was a notifiable condition throughout the first wave, and 36 000 laboratory-confirmed cases were notified including 1400 HCWs, from a local population of 7 million including 150 000 HCWs.

Currently, FDA clears only a small percentage of the total number of NIOSH-certified N95 FFR models under the Surgical N95 Respirators category.

N-95 respirators are masks designed to be 95% effective in filtering particles down to 0.3 m in size and are used in a variety of occupational settings. Facemasks must be replaced frequently because the accumulation of moisture from breathing will decrease the ability to block the penetration of microbes. 92 Use of facemasks and covering the mouth when sneezing may have helped reduce transmission of SARS. 93 Official recommendations for the use of respiratory protection are undergoing constant review. Recently, the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), an arm of the CDC, modified prior recommendations from 2004 and now advocates the use of N-95 respirators for workers engaged in activities with the high likelihood of generating infectious aerosols. 94 Other CDC guidance documents recommend the use of surgical masks in the event of a shortage of N-95 respirators. Surgical masks offer protection from larger aerosol droplets and are not as effective as the N-95 in protecting the wearer. If respiratory protection is worn, users must be trained in its proper use, including advice on proper fitting, maintenance and hygiene, re-use protocols and proper disposal of used respirators. 95 Despite recommendations for the use of respirators or surgical masks in caring for flu patients in the health care setting, the Department of Health and Human Services is stopping short of recommending their use by the general public unless they are caring for family members known to be ill from pandemic influenza. 96 The CDC's recommendations for airline flight crews encourage giving sick passengers surgical masks to reduce dissemination of aerosol particles to others in the aircraft cabin. 97 Still, the government has not strongly advocated their use elsewhere by sick individuals nor have they encouraged production and stockpiling of respirators or sur-gical masks for use during a pandemic. 98 In addition, there is a stigma in most Western countries about wearing surgical face masks and respirators in public, and this may prove to be a barrier to their use. 99 Hogg and Houston 89 have developed a simple mnemonic, MASKS, for basic precautions that can be taken in an outpatient setting:",24.077798910257037,11.296009003679837

Perceived risks associated with working in a particular ward or with dealing with particular patients were the primary factors influencing facemask use. The main factors reported as barriers to facemask use appeared to be social (ie, not wanting to offend patients or their family members) and attitudinal (ie, not wanting to frighten children). The literature indicates that HCWs' compliance with facemask use is influenced by individual (risk perception and presence of adverse events) and organizational factors (availability, education, and policies). 18, 19 Providing feedback on HCWs' adherence to precautions and regular communication has been identified as important factors in facilitating their compliance with infection control practices. 18 Ensuring the availability of facemasks and respirators is essential to maximizing compliance. Of the issues raised by participants, the availability of medical masks and respirators was the most frequently identified issue. Participants spoke of inadequate supplies of medical masks and respirators, resulting in staff having to reuse facemasks over 1 or more days. Finally, the use of cloth masks was also reported as routine practice, and in some settings as the sole type provided by the hospital. In some hospitals, reportedly only 3 or 4 new cloth masks are provided to staff each year and it is the HCWs' responsibility to maintain their own supply of facemasks. This situation is of concern, given that previous studies have identified an association between adherence to respiratory protection and the availability of facemasks in hospital settings. 18 The need for HCWs to purchase their own facemasks from local stores was another issue of concern identified by our participants. Generally, facemasks are bought from local stalls or shops that surround the hospital and are manufactured locally. These products may be of inferior quality and may provide a false sense of protection. The ability of facemasks to filter particles varies significantly depending on the materials used for facemask construction. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversees the sale and marketing of medical devices, including medical masks, and recommends that ""manufacturers demonstrate medical mask performance in 4 areas: fluid resistance, filter efficiency, differential pressure, and flammability"". 20 At present, there are no data on the performance of locally purchased facemasks in these 4 areas.

On the basis of surveillance reports 153 (76%) infections were acquired in a health care facility. Hence, stringent control measures were instituted for health care workers at all health care facilities in Singapore by 9 April. These included the mandatory use of personal protection equipment such as gloves, gowns and N95 masks or equivalent respirators when attending to patients with febrile illness and suspected or probable SARS, as well as temperature checks for fever twice daily [5] .",24.34777044510391,12.023621651922081

Our observation is consistent with previous studies that have been unable to show that N95 masks were superior to surgical masks for preventing influenza infection in health care workers (5) .

However, surgical masks were not adequate to remove submicrometer-size bioaerosols. 23, 24 The measurement of filtration efficiencies of different respirators against Mycobacterium chelonae another surrogate bacteria of M tuberculosis, showed that DMF and a HEPA were more effective than the DM and single-use submicron surgical mask under a constant flow of 46 L/min. 25 Mean percentage efficiencies for viable M chelonae ranged from 97% for the DM and the surgical mask to more than 99.99% for the HEPA respirator. 25 Further studies also confirmed that filters such as the HEPA and N95 were more efficient than the DM and DMF filters. A comparison of unloaded N95 particulate respirators with that of DM and DFM respirators against Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus megatherium and inert test particles were performed. 26 The penetration of both B subtilis and B megatherium was comparatively more with DM and DFM respirators than with N95 respirators at a flow rate of 85 L/min. 26 In another study, the penetration of Mycobacterium abscessus aerosol through 16 respirator filters and 5 surgical masks were determined at 2 different flow rates and at a different relative humidity. 27 The median penetration of M abscessus was 2%, 0.4%, and 0.02% for DM, DFM, and HEPA filters, respectively, at 45 L/min.

Respiratory Protection. The subject of respiratory protection as it applies to preventing transmission of airborne infectious agents, including the need for and frequency of fit testing is under scientific review and was the subject of a 2004 CDC workshop. 762 Respiratory protection currently requires the use of a respirator with N95 or higher-level filtration to prevent inhalation of infectious particles. Information about respirators and respiratory protection programs is summarized in the Guideline for Preventing Transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Health Care Settings. 12 Respiratory protection is broadly regulated by OSHA under the general industry standard for respiratory protection (29 CFR 1910 .134), 763 which requires that US employers in all employment settings implement a program to protect employees from inhalation of toxic materials. OSHA program components include medical clearance to wear a respirator; provision and use of appropriate respirators, including fit-tested NIOSH-certified N95 and higher-level particulate filtering respirators; education on respirator use, and periodic reevaluation of the respiratory protection program. When selecting particulate respirators, models with inherently good fit characteristics (ie, those expected to provide protection factors of $ 10% to 95% of wearers) are preferred and theoretically could preclude the need for fit testing. 764, 765 Issues pertaining to respiratory protection remain the subject of ongoing debate. Information on various types of respirators is available at http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ npptl/respirators/respsars.html and in several previously published studies. 764, 766, 767 A user-seal check (formerly called a ''fit check'') should be performed by the wearer of a respirator each time that the respirator is donned, to minimize air leakage around the face piece. 768 The optimal frequency of fit testing has not been determined; retesting may be indicated if there is a change in wearer's facial features, onset of a medical condition that would affect respiratory function in the wearer, or a change in the model or size of the respirator that was initially assigned. 12 Respiratory protection was first recommended for protection of US HCWs from exposure to M tuberculosis in 1989. That recommendation has been maintained in 2 successive revisions of the Guidelines for Prevention of Transmission of Tuberculosis in Hospitals and Other Health Care Settings. 12, 126 The incremental benefit from respirator use, in addition to administrative and engineering controls (ie, AIIRs, early recognition of patients likely to have tuberculosis and prompt placement in an AIIR, and maintenance of a patient with suspected tuberculosis in an AIIR until no longer infectious), for preventing transmission of airborne infectious agents (eg, M tuberculosis) remains undetermined. Although some studies have demonstrated effective prevention of M tuberculosis transmission in hospitals in which surgical masks instead of respirators were used in conjunction with other administrative and engineering controls. 636, 769, 770 the CDC currently recommends N95 or higher-level respirators for personnel exposed to patients with suspected or confirmed tuberculosis. Currently, this recommendation also holds for other diseases that could be transmitted through the airborne route, including SARS 261 and smallpox, 108,129,771 until inhalational transmission is better defined or health care-specific PPE more suitable for preventing infection is developed. Wearing of respirators is also currently recommended during the performance of aerosol-generating procedures (eg, intubation, bronchoscopy, suctioning) in patients with SARS-CoV infection, avian influenza, and pandemic influenza (see Appendix A).",17.90274091821614,9.014166866656105

The FDA regulates the manufacture and labeling of medical devices. (96) Medical devices are cleared by the FDA under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act based upon data submitted by the manufacturer to support the claimed intended use of the product. Under 21 CFR 878.4040, FDA classifies surgical N95 respirators as a type of surgical apparel, intended to be worn by operating room personnel during surgical procedures to protect both the surgical patient and the operating room personnel from transfer of microorganisms, body fluids, and particulate material. As part of the labeling requirement, FDA recommends that manufacturers state whether a device is intended to be a reusable device or a single-use disposable device. (9) Some surgical N95 respirator models are cleared by the FDA with claims of being a singleuse device, while other manufacturers do not make such claims. (10) For surgical N95 respirators labeled as ""single use only,"" extended use or limited reuse could be considered as an ""off label"" use of these products. FDA has specific requirements for reuse (""reprocessing"") of single-use medical devices. (97) Unfortunately, as discussed earlier in this manuscript, some hospital use practices for these types of medical devices such as limited FFR reuse were first recommended (4) (5) (6) (7) and put into practice prior to FDA's involvement. There is also a general lack of awareness among infection control professionals and safety/ employee health administrators in understanding FDA's role in regulating surgical N95 respirators. (98) These factors contribute to the prevalence of ""industrial N95 FFRs"" used in health care settings. These industrial N95 FFRs are NIOSH-certified FFRs, but have not been cleared by the FDA as medical devices. Several of these industrial N95 FFRs were stockpiled by the CDC in the Strategic National Stockpile. (99) In the future the different regulatory and policy perspectives will need to be factored into FFR extended use and limited reuse recommendations. For example, recommendations for operating rooms, where soiling and potential contamination from blood borne pathogens will likely occur, might be different. In those situations, limited reuse should only be considered after consultation with the surgical N95 respirator manufacturer and local hospital infection professionals. benefits (e.g., cost savings, ability to extend existing supplies, reducing the ""burn rate,"" and so on) of FFR extended use and limited reuse.",17.35734002088789,8.93521141115178

It has been reported that drug-resistant strains have already appeared, and the proportion of resistant endemic strains has reached 18% in Japan; 23 such resistance has also happened for a pandemic strain. 24 In any case, both the development and stockpiling of vaccines or drugs entail political and financial difficulties. When severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was in the news in 2003, various face masks, particularly N95 masks, were in urgent demand. As the N95 masks physically filter viruses out by fitting tightly over the mouth and nose, users have to breathe hard and so are unable to wear the masks for extended periods. Therefore, the N95 mask is not practical except in situations such as when healthcare workers or patients' family members are in close contact with patients in an emergency room or a ward. Based on experience with the SARS corona virus, Seto et al. 25 pointed out that cheaper polypropylene surgical masks were quite effective to prevent transmission among healthcare workers, and the masks were crucial for protection from droplet transmission. Kariwa et al. 26 studied the efficacy of several povidone-iodine (PVP-I) products for inactivating the SARS corona virus. 26 Here, I have compared the antiviral activity of GV with 0.5% PVP-I diluted from Isodine (Meiji Seika, Tokyo, Japan), which contained 10% PVP-I, corresponding to 1% effective I 2 . As shown in Fig. 2 , 0.0063% GV had a much greater killing effect than 0.5% PVP-I on the H1N1 virus. Certainly, PVP-I is a good disinfectant and it has been used for disinfection against various bacteria and viruses, but it seems to be difficult to dye cloth using I 2 products. On the other hand, using GV, we can dye cloth and retain the capacity to kill influenza viruses (Fig. 4) . When a reassortment has occurred, the unexpected variant influenza virus aquires new antigenicity, which voids the effectiveness of vaccines now in use. Even if this happens, however, GV may destroy not only the envelopes of H1N1 but also those of H5N1 and those of new variant strains. This is because the envelopes of influenza viruses, like cellular membranes which are easily damaged by GV, are essential and are made up of universal membrane components, i.e., lipid bilayers and proteins. Very recently, we have been given a warning of the increasing threat of an avian influenza A virus (H5N1) pandemic, issued by the writing Committee of the WHO. 27 Moreover, in articles in Science 28 and Nature 29 , it has been reported that the virulent 1918 influenza virus has been resurrected, and this constructed virus could be useful for preventing another pandemic. If the dyed cloth described here is made use of in cheaper masks, which easily become wet with exhalation and saliva, they might be able to capture respiration droplets. Consequently, I believe that a next influenza pandemic could be reduced if such GV masks (called Flu Mask) were used not only by health professionals but also by the general public worldwide. Moreover, GV seems to attack the envelope of influenza viruses (Fig. 3B) , so GV and GV-dyed cloth might be effective in preventing infections with other respiratory enveloped-viruses, such as the SARS corona virus.",22.294968981043233,9.89480319070171

Further, the SARS-CoV has been shown to survive for up to 2 days on fomites (much longer than the influenza virus or HIV) and, contact with SARS-CoV particles-laden organic or inorganic debris is considered a significant mode of transmission of SARS-CoV. 13, [52] [53] [54] The established practices of universal/ standard precautions already include protocols that effectively deal with this issue. The following points are highlighted for the prevention of SARS-CoV infections: • Thorough hand washing should be done frequently and after treatment, contact with patient or fomites and before or after handling protective gear. It is a critical measure in controlling the spread of infection 55 A note on personal protection equipment (PPE) • Masks have been shown to be useful against nosocomial transmissions of SARS. 54 As the most penetrating particulate size is 0.3 µm, a mask with a specification of PFE (particle filtration efficiency) 99% (or above) at 0.1 µm may be more useful although it is uncomfortable to wear for a prolonged period. • HPA recommends the use of USA standard N-95 respirator or the European standard EN149:2001 FFP2 for routine airborne isolation precautions. Use of higher levels of respiratory protection may be considered for certain aerosolgenerating procedures when treating confirmed or highly suspected SARS cases. • Masks or respirators must be changed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Furthermore, the filtering efficiency of a mask is only as good as its fit or the moisture content. Therefore masks and respirators should be fit checked and always discarded if moist/ wet. • Eye protection and face shields are also recommended when there is a potential for splattering or spraying respiratory secretions. 40 • Long cover gowns should be worn and sleeves secured under the gloves to prevent exposure of any part of the forearm. Re-usable garments should be changed when visibly soiled or penetrated by fluids and placed in marked containers after use. Contaminated garment should be laundered using a normal laundry cycle. 57",14.932096153888079,8.955820934611102

Such inoculations can provide immunity from certain highly transmissible diseases, enabling staff to care for these patients without inordinate risk. For example, health care workers not immune to chicken pox should not be required to care for patients with chicken pox. 109 Because of the specialization of staff in the EP laboratory, it can be difficult to provide adequate staffing if multiple concessions have to be made for noncompliant staff. The interval for regular testing of staff for tuberculosis is defined by every institution.

Low scores for compliance and ease of implementation of using NPV rooms and N95 respirators were particularly evident at LGH. The former reflected the state of renovations at the time of the survey. Reported differences between VGH and LGH regarding N95 respirator use likely reflect a difference in organizational culture rather than resource availability; the algorithms had been in place for approximately 1 year at LGH compared with 5 years at VGH, and a previous audit documented that respirators were accessible at all sites. 5 The challenge of adhering to guidelines regarding commode use as it pertains to the GI algorithm was illustrated in the following statement and reflected inadequate resources. ''Sometimes it is difficult to have a designated commode at the bedside due to not having enough commodes at the bedside. Often times we have to wipe down commodes aggressively so the next patient can have a disinfected commode.'' Compared with other HCWs, physicians reported lower compliance with the respiratory algorithm and scored lower on their perception that the algorithms protected either staff or patients. This contrasts with results from a survey conducted by Virginia Commonwealth University, in which physicians reported significantly better compliance with hand hygiene, contact precautions, and airborne precautions compared with other occupations. 6 Results were explained by different motives for compliance: RNs were motivated by patient safety more than personal safety, whereas physicians reported personal safety as more of a motivating factor. 6 Our findings showed that personal and patient safety were both strong motivating factors for all occupations.",15.748774553282002,8.615245589345722

Implementation of standard and contact precautions is recommended from both guidelines. However, the CDC includes airborne transmission precautions whereas the WHO has recommended the use of surgical masks when caring for MERS patients and particulate respirators for aerosol-generating procedures (Table 1) [25, 26] . Although spread of MERS-CoV is more likely to occur via droplets and contact [28] , the CDC recommendations are based on an expert review that contends that maximum precautions are required due to the high case fatality rate associated with MERS [29] . This discordance in recommendations may lead to confusion among healthcare providers. Nonetheless, we may never be able to know what kind of protective gear against MERS-CoV is the best in practice because conducting any randomized control trial would be unethical [30] . BIDI has opted for implementation of the maximum precautions stipulated in CDC guidance due to the gaps of present knowledge about the potential for airborne transmission of the novel coronavirus. In our institute, rapid isolation was done upon receiving laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection. We placed the patients in an airborne infection isolation room, and precautions to prevent airborne and contact transmission were strictly implemented.

Many hospitals will enforce droplet precautions at the time of admission, for all patients presenting with ILI, until the cause can be established through appropriate diagnostic testing. During the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, infection control recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention included the use of N95 respirators for healthcare workers caring for patients with suspected pandemic influenza, in addition to contact and droplet precautions. Realistically, however, many institutions had difficulty complying with these enhanced isolation precautions, either due to unavailability of N95 respirators, poor tolerability, work flow concerns, or patient volume, among other reasons. In addition, to their impact on individual patient symptoms, antiviral agents have a role in the prevention of spread of influenza within a hospital unit. Prompt antiviral therapy with oseltamivir or zanamivir for children hospitalized with ILI or confirmed influenza virus infections has been shown to reduce nosocomial spread of influenza by reducing viral shedding in infected patients [24] .

HCWs are well versed in selfcontamination incidents that occurred during the severe acute respiratory syndrome and Ebola virus disease outbreaks and are concerned that extended use of FFRs may lead to self-infection. 13, 14 Although guidance for limited reuse and extended use of FFRs is currently available, implementation of FFR-DR strategies is a more complicated process. For reprocessed single-use medical devices, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires validation data regarding cleaning, sterilization, and functional performance. 15 Cleaning is generally performed before decontamination to ensure soiling materials do not interfere with the decontamination process. The common definition of a cleaned device-no visual contamination is present-differs from the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002, which states that the reprocessor must establish cleaning end points and rationale for their selection. 16 Cleaning FFRs is a difficult task because the N95 facepiece is an exposed filter and not compatible with standard laundering techniques. Additionally, research has been performed demonstrating that several FFR models cannot be effectively cleaned using various cleaning wipes. 17 According to the Institute of Medicine, any method decontaminating a disposable N95 FFR must remove the pathogen, be harmless to the user, and not compromise the integrity of the various parts of the respirator. 18 If the decontamination process can eliminate viable pathogens from the medical device in the presence of other organic material, the question arises of whether cleaning would still be required, especially during a public health emergency.",15.760366221001533,7.703045458501354

Methods: Twelve samples each of 15 N95 FFR models were contaminated with H1N1 influenza (facepiece and strap), then covered with a soiling agent-artificial saliva or artificial skin oil. For each soiling agent, 3 contaminated FFRs were treated with 1 J/cm 2 UVGI for approximately 1 minute, whereas 3 other contaminated FFRs remained untreated. All contaminated surfaces were cut out and virus extracted. Viable influenza was quantified using a median tissue culture infectious dose assay. Results: Significant reductions (≥3 log) in influenza viability for both soiling conditions were observed on facepieces from 12 of 15 FFR models and straps from 7 of 15 FFR models.

The N95 masks filter at least 95% of aerosols (<5 μm) and dropletsize (5 μm to 50 μm) particles and are not resistant to oil. Light-weight, no-hose, powered air-purifying respirators (PAPR) are a highly effective alternative to face masks.

For each parameter a multi-way analysis of variances was carried out to identify the statistical significance of the influences of the three variables: time, type of facemasks and nano-treatment, as well as their interactions. To save space, only the P values are used to show the statistical significance. A P>0.05 is considered as being not significant and is shown as a dash, and a P<0.0005 is considered as being significant and is shown as ''0.000''. Nine parameters, including heart rate, systolic blood pressure, absolute humidity (mask outer surface, face microclimate, left chest microclimate and right chest skin) and temperature (mask outer surface, face micro-climate and face skin) were significantly influenced by time. Other factors that had significant effect on the measured parameters were mask, interaction of mask and nano-treatment and nano-treatment on its own. Subjective ratings Figure 4 compares subjective ratings for thermal sensation and overall discomfort for the four types of facemasks. In general, the ratings for humidity, heat, breath facemasks the subject felt drier, cooler, more able to breathe easily and less uncomfortable than when wearing either of the N95 facemasks. The ratings for humidity, heat, breathing resistance and discomfort of facemasks treated with nano-functional materials appear lower than those for untreated facemasks but are not statistically significant. Figure 5 shows the subjective ratings for other sensations obtained while the subjects were wearing the facemasks. There are significant differences in the subjective perceptions feeling unfit (F=5.3, P<0.01), tight (F= 34.6, P<0.01), itchy (F=4.7, P<0.01), fatigued (F=2.7, P<0.05), odorous (F= 7.9, P<0.01) and salty (F=3.9, P<0.01). The ratings for those sensations were significantly lower when the subjects were wearing the surgical facemasks than when they were wearing either of the N95 facemasks, showing that the subjects felt less unfit, less tight, less itchy, less fatigued, less odorous and less salty with the surgical facemasks than with the N95 masks. Table 6 summarizes the result of ANOVA, which show the influences of time, facemask, nano-treatment, and their interactions on subjective ratings for individual sensations and overall discomfort. Again, for each sensation, we carried out a multi-way analysis of variances to identify the statistical significance of the influences of the three variables: time, type of facemasks and nanotreatment, as well as their interactions. To save space, only the P values are used to show the statistical significance. A P>0.05 is considered as being not significant and is shown as a dash, and a P<0.0005 is considered as being significant and is marked as ''0.000''. As shown in Table 6 , facemask type influences subjects' perception of all the nine individual sensations and overall discomfort significantly (P<0.05). On the other hand, all sensations were not significantly influenced by time and nano-treatment. There were no significant differences between ratings for tight, salty and odorous at different time periods. Figure 6 shows the preferences of subjects for the four kinds of facemasks. Subjective preference for the nano-treated surgical facemasks is the highest, followed by the untreated surgical masks, the nano-treated N95 and then the untreated N95 facemask. There is a significant difference in preference between the nano-treated and untreated surgical facemasks and between the surgical and N95 facemasks. There is no significant difference in subjective preference between nano-treated and untreated N95 facemasks.",19.950119879211158,8.634461227285673

But perhaps increased health insurance payouts are a proxy for higher prices and increased health spending. Health insurance may also release pent-up demand, particularly in poorer rural regions. These effects may predispose households toward more precaution. Initial effects of health insurance may differ from the long run, especially if insurance becomes more comprehensive in an environment of relatively stable prices. Positive correlation with residential housing expenditure was expected. The Chinese save for home purchases to better living standards and as a form of wealth creation.

After the SARS epidemic, the Taiwan CDC proposed “A Strategy Plan for PPE Minimum Stockpile” and established the 3-tier stockpiling framework—a central health authority (managed by the Taiwan CDC), local health authorities, and medical institutions—to effectively respond to emergent demands and spread the risk of stockpiling. We have also formulated a minimum stockpile for each tier, taking into consideration: (1) the protective properties of PPE; (2) the consumption of PPE during nonepidemic and epidemic periods; (3) the production capacity of the manufacturers; (4) potential alternatives; and (5) the lead time.

9 The magnitude of difference between cloth masks and medical masks in the current study, if explained by efficacy of medical masks alone, translates to an efficacy of 92% against ILI, which is possible, but not consistent with the lack of efficacy in the two previous RCTs.8
9 Further, we found no significant difference in rates of virus isolation in medical mask users between the three trials, suggesting that the results of this study could be interpreted as partly being explained by a detrimental effect of cloth masks. This is further supported by the fact that the rate of virus isolation in the no-mask control group in the first Chinese RCT was 3.1%, which was not significantly different to the rates of virus isolation in the medical mask arms in any of the three trials including this one. Unlike the previous RCTs, circulating influenza and RSV were almost completely absent during this study, with rhinoviruses comprising 85% of isolated pathogens, which means the measured efficacy is against a different range of circulating respiratory pathogens. Influenza and RSV predominantly transmit through droplet and contact routes, while Rhinovirus transmits through multiple routes, including airborne and droplet routes.32
33 The data also show that the clinical case definition of ILI is non-specific, and captures a range of pathogens other than influenza. The study suggests medical masks may be protective, but the magnitude of difference raises the possibility that cloth masks cause an increase in infection risk in HCWs. Further, the filtration of the medical mask used in this trial was poor, making extremely high efficacy of medical masks unlikely, particularly given the predominant pathogen was rhinovirus, which spreads by the airborne route.

As N can be large in practice, we aimed to reduce runtime by limiting computation to the portions of intermediate pmfs that affect the final P-value. In particular, it is easy to show that Prn(X=k)=0 for k>n and that entries for n>N − K, k<K − N + n do not affect the final P-value. Also, for a given threshold (t) on the P-value, if ∑k≥K Prn(X=k)>t for any n, then the P-value will also be greater than t (as shown below) allowing for computation to terminate prematurely for most columns in an alignment (the non-variant columns). Finally, a key refinement in LoFreq is based on the following recursion:
(2)
where Sn = ∑k≥K Prn(X = k). This recursion can be derived directly from Equation (1) and allows LoFreq to only compute the pmf for k < K, in addition to keeping track of Sn using Equation (2).

Following up on their initial findings [58], research led by Mamoru Watanabe demonstrated that NS4B inhibits IFN-β production and IRF-3 phosphorylation stimulated by poly(dA:dT) treatment, or STING, MAVS or ΔRIG-I over-expression [10]. Ding et al. independently made similar observations, and also showed that NS4B blocks type III IFN induction during SeV infection [13]. NS4B did not inhibit IFN-β production stimulated by over-expression of IRF-3 or NF-κB, suggesting that NS4B acts upstream of IRF-3 [13]. The NS3/4A protease complex did not block STING-mediated IFN-β induction or IRF-3 phosphorylation [10], confirming that NS3/4A and NS4B antagonise IFN production by distinct mechanisms. In addition, NS4B, but not NS3/4A, inhibited IFN production induced by over-expression of a MAVS construct that mimics the product of NS3/4A-mediated MAVS cleavage [10], [13]. This MAVS cleavage product loses its ability to dimerise and localise to the mitochondrial membrane [59], [60], [61], but residual levels of IFN-β induction are still detectable [10], [13], [59]. Therefore, HCV has evolved distinct and additive mechanisms involving NS4B and the NS3/4A protease for blocking IFN induction via RIG-I and STING.",5.781500307801286,3.601858056415143

Medical grade liquid 72 silicone rubber (LSR) was identified as an optimal material for mask fabrication due to its 73 conformable capacity, sterilizability through multiple methods and compatibility with injection 74 molding for fabrication scalability.

And for how many times?,"While the exact mode SARS-CoV-2's viral transmission is not known, a primary mode in viruses such as SARS and influenza is known to be through short-range aerosols and droplets 13, 14 . When a person infected with a virus breathes, speaks, sings, coughs, or sneezes micron sized aerosols containing the virus are released into the air. Data gathered from influenza patients suggest that these aerosols are typically fine (<5 μm, at times <1 μm) or coarse (>5 μm) [14] [15] [16] . For these coarse particles, they can typically settle due to gravity within an hour. However, fine particles, especially smaller than 1 μm can essentially stay nearly indefinitely in the air. As particles >10 μm settle very rapidly, these droplets are not typically deposited in the respiratory tract through means of aerosol inhalation. Particles >5 μm typically will only reach the upper respiratory tract, and fine particles <5 μm are critically able to reach the lower respiratory tract, similar to harmful particulate matter pollution ( Figure 1 ). While it is commonly believed that coughing and sneezing provide the most likely airborne vector, the size distribution and number of particles emitted during in normal speech serve as a significant viral transmitter 15 . Singing has been found to be comparable to continuous coughing in the transmission of airborne pathogens 17 . Anecdotal support of this finding was unfortunately demonstrated during a choir practice on March 10, 2020 in Washington State. Although the choir members did not touch each other or share music during the rehearsal, 45 out of the 60 members of the Skagit Valley Choir were diagnosed with the virus three weeks later, and two have deceased. For dangerous airborne particulates, including viral aerosols during the current COVID-19 pandemic, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the usage of N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFR) as personal protective equipment for healthcare professionals [18] [19] [20] . The N95 grade is determined by the CDC's National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) (document 42 CFR Part 84) which designates a minimum filtration efficiency of 95% for 0.3 μm (aerodynamic mass median diameter) of sodium chloride aerosols. In addition to N95, there are N99 and N100 which correspond to filtration efficiencies of 99% and 99.97%, respectively. For oil-based aerosols (DOP), NIOSH also has created grades R and P (with filtration efficiencies 95-99.97%). Elsewhere around the globe, the equivalent filtration grades to N95 are FFP2 (European Union), KN95 (China), DS/DL2 (Japan), and KF94 (South Korea). While the actual SARS-CoV-2 virus is around 150 nm 21 , commonly found N95 respirators can offer protection against particles as small as 80 nm 22 with 95% filtration efficiency (initial testing, not loaded). With the actual viral aerosols in the ~1 μm range, the N95 FFRs' filtration efficiency should be sufficient for personal protection.",13.819127271224358,9.12501784004495

The current shortage of N95 FFRs during this time of rapidly spreading infection may be mitigated by methods that will allow the safe reuse. We have tested methods which may be suitable for the re-use of particulate respirators, and hope our results will be useful in helping hospitals and other health care facilities in formulating safe standard operating procedures (SOPs) so that virus inactivation is assured while not compromising mask protection. While we reiterate that these methods have not been tested on SARS-CoV-2 directly for inactivation, these methods use precedents set by either SARS-CoV or general disinfection strategies. We found that of commonly deployable methods, heating (dry or in the presence humidity) <100 °C can preserve the filtration characteristics of a pristine N95 respirator. The UVGI (254 nm, 17 mW/cm 2 ) sterilizer cabinet used in these tests does not have enough dose to damage the respirators within a reasonable number of treatment cycles and may be considered for disinfection, with doses smaller than 1000 J/cm 2 . Using steam to disinfect requires caution, as the treatments may seem to be suitable, but prolonged treatment may leave the user with unsuitable protection. Finally, we advise against using certain liquid contact, such as alcohol solutions, chlorine-based solutions, or soaps to clean the respirator, as this will lead to a degradation in the static charge that is necessary for the FFR to meet the N95 standard.",15.698859764936511,8.951681270034145

As the incidence of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is increasing exponentially in the United States and worldwide, healthcare provider demand for these necessities is currently outpacing supply. As such, strategies to safely expand the lifespan of the supply of medical equipment are critically important. In the recent days, weeks, and months, in the midst of the current pandemic, there has been a concerted effort to identify viable ways to conserve Personal Protective Equipment, including sterilization after use. Some hospitals have already begun using UV-C light to sterilize N95 respirators, but many lack the space or equipment to implement existing protocols. In this study, we outline a procedure by which N95 respirators may be sterilized using ultraviolet (UV) radiation in biosafety cabinets (BSCs), a common element of many academic, public health, and hospital laboratories. The primary obstacle to this approach is the possibility the UV radiation levels vary within BSCs. To account for this potential variation in dosing across the base of the BSC, we tested the UV-C radiation in two randomly chosen idle BSCs in our research institute and observed a maximum ratio between the minimum and maximum recorded intensities within a given BSC to be 1.98. Based on these values, we calculated that an N95 mask placed within a BSC with a manufacturer's reported fluence of 100 µW cm −2 should be effectively sanitized for reuse after approximately 15-20 minutes per side. Our results provide support to healthcare organizations looking for alternative methods to extend their reserves of PPE. It is our hope that with an easily implemented strategy, as we have presented here, idle BSCs can be utilized to alleviate the PPE shortage by providing a way to sterilize PPE to allow safe daily re-use. This should be tested on a larger scale, and confirmed in a virology laboratory before adoption, though we contend that in extremis, this method would be preferred compared to re-use without sterilization.",17.283781990616788,7.977983809335275

If temporally separate exposures independently tap into the same gene regulatory mechanisms, then the genome can be viewed as a mosaic, in which some loci retain more of a long-term signature of social history than others. This perspective is consistent with studies of organism-level traits. For example, in nonhuman primate models of social stress, behavioral signatures of status are highly plastic with changes in dominance rank, whereas the development of coronary artery plaques are explained by the combination of present and past social status (59, 60) . A key contribution of genomic approaches rests in their ability to compare levels of plasticity across thousands of traits simultaneously. Such studies promise to reveal which pathways are more important for encoding memory versus sensing the current environment-an important step towards understanding the molecular mechanisms that affect resilience and recovery.",7.83948274520229,7.01261918369449

We prioritize epitopes with maximal dissimilarity from the human proteome, however, many other SARS-CoV-2 peptides show identical or nearly identical peptides presented on MHC derived from normal proteins, suggesting their use in vaccination could result in an autoimmune response. The 65 epitopes presented here can be expressed in a ~6.3kb construct and coupled with the safe and rapid production of synthetic DNA, mRNA, and peptide vaccines. As SARS-CoV-2 has precipitated the need to develop novel approaches to rapidly deploy vaccines in pandemic situations (Lurie, Saville, Hatchett, & Halton, 2020) , we suggest that this comprehensive analysis can be incorporated into a process that can be rapidly deployed when future novel viral pathogens emerge. author/funder.

For the experimental density maps we have to make sure that the voxel size equals one, meaning that every voxel measures 1Å. Furthermore, we need to adjust the dimensions of the map to the 64 # input dimensions of the model as seen in Fig 2. This is done by splitting the maps into several 64 # big cubes. In order to avoid errors at the borders of the cubes we overlay them partly such that we only use the 50 # center voxels of each cube to reconstruct the output maps to the original dimensions of the density map. By splitting the 411 density maps that we collected in this manner, we retrieve 16,070 training examples. To create the labels that the model can be trained on, we use the solved structure to create masks by filtering out the corresponding atoms and setting all voxels within a certain distance to those atoms to one. For the Cα mask we filter only the Cα atoms of the protein structure and set all directly neighboring voxels around them to one. The backbone mask is created similarly except that we use all Cα, C, and N atoms. To generate the secondary structure masks, we filter out all atoms for each structural element and set all voxels within a distance of two around each filtered atom to one. Finally, to create the amino acid type masks we filter out all atoms for each amino acid type and set all neighboring voxels to one for each atom. In total this gives us 25 different masks for each training example (Cα mask, backbone mask, three secondary structure masks, and 20 amino acid type masks).",12.019066169216634,5.71707514427507
