Two patients were immune-compromised. The A(H1N1)pdm09 genome was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on nasopharyngeal specimen swabs prior to administration of IV zanamivir at a dose of 600 mg twice daily. Weekly qualitative PCR analysis was done to monitor viral clearance, with zanamivir treatment being discontinued upon receipt of negative results. In addition, the patients were managed for concomitant multidrug-resistant bacterial infections, with infection resolution confirmed with blood cultures.

In Iran, the first cases of COVID-19 were officially announced between February 19 and 23, 2020 and it soon became clear that Iran is one of the countries that is worst-hit by COVID-19 outbreak (1, 2) . It is now evident that most cases of COVID-19 disease develop mild respiratory and constitutional symptoms (3), while some cases are asymptomatic (3, 4) . Involvement of other organs, including liver and kidneys has been reported in patients with COVID-19 (5). Many questions remain unanswered about associations and presentations of COVID-19. Shohada-e-Tajrish Hospital, a university hospital located in Tehran, Iran, was designated as one of the main centers providing diagnostic and healthcare services for patients suspected to be infected with the new virus. Here, we share our experience regarding computed tomography (CT) findings suggestive of COVID-19 disease among patients who underwent radiologic investigation due to traumatic injuries. Several trauma patients had findings on their chest and/or abdominal CT scans, which were suggestive or highly suggestive of COVID-19 (1). The findings were noted in the lung bases that were visible on an abdominal CT scan or on a clinically indicated spiral CT scan of the chest. The most frequent mechanisms of injury were fall and car accident. Conscious patients did not report dizziness or loss of consciousness before the trauma and most of them did not have any symptoms related to COVID-19 (e.g., fever, shortness of breath). To our knowledge, there is no study or report about the possible association between COVID-19 and trauma in the lit-erature. So, the mentioned observations could be just a coincidence, but this association could still be proposed as a research objective. The importance of this finding is that CT characteristics of COVID-19 could be seen in patients who were admitted to the hospitals not due to COVID-19 related symptoms, but because of chest and abdominal trauma. This issue should be considered by health care workers serving trauma patients and it should be kept in mind that during an outbreak of respiratory infections, in particular COVID-19 disease, every attempt should be made to protect the health and safety of the staff even when providing care for trauma patients.",35.74038824942685,15.836546066676

For example, an in vitro study showed that Shuang Huang Lian Oral Liquid had the inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 [78]. However, its clinical efficacy and safety for the treatment of COVID-19 patients has not been evaluated. We noticed that this TCM product was not recommended by HNC's Guideline [89] . Same as SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 uses receptor ACE2 for the cellular entrance [8] . Theoretically, blockade of ACE2 can prevent the infection of SARS-CoV-2. Chen and Du thus performed the molecular docking study and they found that TCM-derived compounds, including as baicalin, scutellarin, hesperetin, glycyrrhizin and nicotianamine could interact with ACE2 [107].

This may be partially related to the epidemiology of increased disease transmission in healthcare settings rather than a true host risk factor. Laboratory findings have been nonspecific and consistent with other viral infections. Thrombocytopenia (75 %) and lymphopenia (58 %) have been commonly described in these patients [7, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] 15] . Forty three percent had acute kidney injury [7, [11] [12] [13] 17] and 76-100 % had CXR abnormalities with bibasilar infiltrates as the most common finding [8-13, 15, 18] . The outcomes in these more severely ill patients remain poor. Between 50-90 % required ICU care [10, 11, 13, 15] and 67-100 % in the ICU setting required invasive ventilation for a median of 7-16 days [8, 10, 12] . In addition to mechanical ventilation, several patients have received extracorpeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to support ventilation.

COVID-19 is a self-limiting disease in more than 80% of patients. Severe pneumonia occurred in about 15% of cases as revealed in studies with large cohorts of patients. The gross case fatality is 3.4% worldwide as of February 25, 2020. This rate is 4.4% for patients in Wuhan, 4.0% for patients in Hubei and 0.92% for patients outside of Hubei. The exceedingly high fatality in Wuhan might be explained by the collapse of hospitals, a large number of undiagnosed patients, suboptimal treatment or a combination of these. Up to date, we still do not have any specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents but an anti-Ebola drug, remdesivir, may hold the promise. As a nucleotide analog, remdesivir was shown to be effective in preventing MERS-CoV replication in monkeys. Severity of disease, viral replication, and lung damage were reduced when the drug was administered either before or after infection with MERS-CoV [10] . These results provide the basis for a rapid test of the beneficial effects of remdesivir in COVID-19. Other antiviral agents worthy of further clinical investigations include ribavirin, protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir, interferon α2b, interferon β, chloroquine phosphate, and Arbidol. However, we should also bear in mind the side effects of these antiviral agents. For example, type I interferons including interferon α2b and interferon β are well known for their antiviral activity. Their beneficial effects at an early phase of infection are well expected. However, administration at a later stage carries the risk that they might worsen the cytokine storm and exacerbate inflammation. Notably, steroids have been experimentally used widely in the treatment of SARS and are still preferred by some Chinese physicians in the treatment of COVID-19. It is said to be capable of stopping the cytokine storm and preventing lung fibrosis. However, the window in which steroids might be beneficial to patients with COVID-19 is very narrow. In other words, steroids can only be used when SARS-CoV-2 has already been eliminated by human immune response. Otherwise, SARS-CoV-2 replication will be boosted leading to exacerbation of symptoms, substantial virus shedding, as well as increased risk for nosocomial transmission and secondary infection. In this regard, it will be of interest to determine whether the report of fungal infection in the lungs of some patients in Wuhan might be linked to misuse of steroids. Nevertheless, the screening of new pharmaceuticals, smallmolecule compounds and other agents that have potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects will successfully derive new and better lead compounds and agents that might prove useful in the treatment of COVID-19.",30.505699310442644,13.536149525452943

Seven days after treatment initiation, the general condition improved, but the patient experienced bilateral deafness as well as severe disequilibrium, documented by pure tone audiometry and vestibular investigations (posturography, videonystagmography and video head impulse test -HIT). These permanent sensorial deficits have a huge negative impact on quality of lifepatient cannot communicate anymore, walk alone or perform daily activities. Together with appropriate new antibiotic treatment for Granulicatella infection, hearing aid and vestibular rehabilitation program were recommended. Very few cases of Granulicatella meningitis are reported and none with hearing and equilibrium deficit secondary to this infection. We consider this case as a cochleo-vestibular bilateral deficit secondary to meningitis more than to ototoxic treatment, since in the majority of adult cases with ototoxic lesions, aminoglycosides affects only one of the sensorial structures from the inner earhearing sensory epithelium or vestibular one, but not both.",27.762944618730497,11.626938255582315

This is an excellent example of how a high-quality clinical study can make a major difference in policy setting. Several important clinical features of COVID-19 have also been documented in this study. First, an attack rate of 83% within the family context is alarmingly high, indicating the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. Second, the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in this family range from mild to moderate, with more systematic symptoms and more severe radiological abnormalities seen in older patients. Generally, COVID-19 appears to be less severe than SARS. Third, an asymptomatic child was found to have ground-glass opacities in his lung and SARS-CoV-2 RNA in his sputum sample. This finding of asymptomatic virus shedding raises the possibility for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from asymptomatic carriers to others, which is later confirmed by others [2] . Finally, the presentation of diarrhea in two young adults from the same family also suggests the possibility for gastrointestinal involvement in SARS-CoV-2 infection and fecal-oral transmission. The study has set the stage for the control and management of COVID-19 [1] .

A large number of patients present to clinics and health centers with mild common cold symptoms such as dry cough, sore throat, low-grade fever or body aches. Patients usually go to the emergency departments if the symptoms of the clinical manifestations worsen after a few days. Because of the wide spectrum of clinical symptoms, research on biomarkers and clinical criteria predicting prognosis is of high priority to enable differentiating cases that require further interventions in the early phase of the disease (10) . No approved drug regimen has been introduced to treat infected cases so far, antiviral treatments are used to alleviate the disease symptoms. Studies on Remedesevir, as an antiviral agent, revealed its in vitro activity against the COVID-19 virus and its safety was proven in Ebola trials. Another proposed treatment is Chloroquine, an old drug for treatment of malaria, with apparent effectiveness and acceptable safety against COVID-19 associated pneumonia (48, 49) . Evaluating the efficacy of anti-influenza drugs such as Umifenovir and Oseltamivir against COVID-19 virus is interesting but lacks any biological plausibility. Using monoclonal antibodies has been suggested as an attractive choice among inactive prophylactic methods; however, its effectiveness has not been proven in other viral respiratory diseases and influenza, yet (50, 51) . Steroids and methylprednisolone seem to be widely used in the recent pandemic. However, in case of MERS, it has been shown that the drug prolongs the presence of the virus and WHO does not recommend its use for COVID-19, except for patients with acute respiratory distress syn-drome (ARDS) (52, 53) . The effectiveness of other medicines and regimens such as Chloroquine, Vitamin C, and Chinese medicine, as well as Lopinavir/Ritonavir combination therapy and Remedesevir are being evaluated in China. Even though randomized clinical trials are important for improving prognosis and interrupting transmission of disease, researchers and healthcare providers should concentrate on alleviation of the disease among subgroups of patients and in different phases of the disease (54) . In addition, since the emerging virus has become a serious global concern, there is a need for rapid development of a vaccine. There are a few vaccine candidates developed in response to outbreak. However, an effective anti-viral medication or a vaccine that has been evaluated for safety and efficacy against COVID-19 is not available yet, and most vaccines are still in the preclinical testing stage (55, 56, 57) .",31.892275055926806,14.289275251069286

ARDS: CLINICAL STUDIES A1 Identification of distinct endophenotypes in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome by unbiased cluster analysis, and their association with mortality","Introduction: Albeit practical implementation remains a concern, indirect calorimetry (IC) is the first choice technique for estimating energy requirements in critically ill patients. Methods: In our adult mainly surgical intensive care unit (ICU) we retrospectively assessed in 25 patients the utility and practical aspects of estimating the daily energy requirements. We determined energy requirements by IC (Quark, COSMED) and compared the estimates with those calculated by measuring VCO 2 alone using a ventilator (Evita XL; Draeger) or using formulas based on body mass of body mass index. Results: Our study population was found to have an average body mass of 69.7 kg and according to IC and energy requirement of 1987 kcal/day on average. No correlation (R 2 = 6E-05) was found when estimates of IC were compared to estimates based on body mass alone. However using an adjusted mass (based on hight and an assumed body mass index of 23) correlation improved (R 2 = 0.3358). VCO 2 based estimation of energy requirement only weakly correlated with IC (R 2 = 0.414). Weak correlation is explained by assuming a fixed respiratory coefficient for ventilator based energy estimates as well as by imperfect correlation of VCO 2 estimates reported by calorimeter and ventilator (R 2 = 0.6189) Conclusions: Body parameters such as hight or mass aren't suited to predict the patient's energy needs. Albeit promising and simple, estimation of energy requirement based on ventilator derived VCO 2 also fails precision. Whether technical improvements on how ventilators calculate VCO2 can render them more suited in daily praxis will have to be determined in future studies. Introduction: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is an advanced treatment to support the critically ill patients with cardiac and/or with severe respiratory failure. It is suggested that ECMO patients are at risk of splanchnic ischemia and thus, enteral feeding is poorly tolerated needing nasojejunal feeding and is potentially unsafe. This study aims to investigate the nutritional adequacy of this patient group. criteria were: patients with H1N1 confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction who were ≥18 years of age. Exclusion criteria were: unconfirmed cases, patients not seen in the hospital and with missing case notes. Differences in clinical parameters between patients discharged within 24 hours of medical assessment and those admitted to hospital were analysed. A chest X-ray scoring system was also employed to assess the ability of radiographic findings to predict likelihood of discharge. Results: Eighty-six patients were eligible for the study. 17 patients were discharged early and 69 patients were admitted to hospital. P/F ratio and CRP predicted discharge with area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of 0.788 (CI 0.681-0.894) and 0.763 (CI 0.6377-0.889) respectively, which was higher than triage and bedside tools. The chest radiograph scoring tool did not predict patient discharge (p = 0.191-0.999), but demonstrated very good inter-rater reliability (Cohen's kappa statistic >0.8).",28.480584064485537,13.96642525968618

Particularly, respiratory support including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was recommended for critically ill patients. TCM therapy was also recommended as a second-line treatment for H7N9 infection. Previous studies have demonstrated that TCMs may have beneficial effects on patients with avian influenza [11, 12] . Our univariate logistic regression analysis indicated that the duration of TCM therapy could be partially associated with the prognosis in H7N9-infected patients. However, TCM therapy was not considered for four critically ill patients with ARDS, which might have accounted for the short duration of TCM therapy in the critically ill group. Consequently, the therapeutic value of TCM therapy in critically ill patients might have been underestimated. Further studies including randomized controlled trials are needed to fully evaluate TCM therapy in this patient population. Nine patients were also treated with intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG).

Although a 30-bed ward in an infectious disease hospital in Wuhan was established for psychiatric patients on 3 February 2020, the rapidly escalating number of cases has led to a severe shortage of hospital beds. As an alternative, isolation wards have been established in psychiatric hospitals for psychiatric patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19, but this option could increase the risk of hospital-acquired infection especially if there is inadequate capacity for infection control in these hospitals [1] . Another option is to establish specific quarantine facilities for clinically stable psychiatric patients with mild-moderate symptoms of COVID-19 infection.

Patients classified as priority one and two and most of those classified as priority three were admitted to our ICU or full critical care services were mobilized and provided for in the isolation ward until a bed was available in the ICU. Priority four patients were not admitted to the ICU and remained in the isolation ward. General ward patients with MERS-CoV infection were transferred to the ICU if their condition deteriorated or organ failure developed. The infection control precautions recommended by the Saudi Ministry of Health guidelines were strictly implemented to prevent possible transmission of MERS-CoV to other patients or to the healthcare staff [23] . Supportive treatment was provided according to our standard operating procedures and in accordance with the surviving sepsis campaign guidelines [24, 25] . Antiviral therapies, such as oseltamivir, and ribavirin/interferon alfa-2a, were prescribed at the discretion of the attending physician. Protective lung ventilation was applied in mechanically ventilated patients. Prone positioning was considered in some patients with severe refractory hypoxemia.

Prevalence of Underlying Diseases in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19: a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Introduction: In the beginning of 2020, an unexpected outbreak due to a new corona virus made the headlines all over the world. Exponential growth in the number of those affected makes this virus such a threat. The current meta-analysis aimed to estimate the prevalence of underlying disorders in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods: A comprehensive systematic search was performed on PubMed, Scopus, Web of science, and Google scholar, to find articles published until 15 February 2020. All relevant articles that reported clinical characteristics and epidemiological information of hospitalized COVID-19 patients were included in the analysis. Results: The data of 76993 patients presented in 10 articles were included in this study. According to the metaanalysis, the pooled prevalence of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, smoking history and diabetes in people infected with SARS-CoV-2 were estimated as 16.37% (95%CI: 10.15%-23.65%), 12.11% (95%CI 4.40%-22.75%), 7.63% (95%CI 3.83%-12.43%) and 7.87% (95%CI 6.57%-9.28%), respectively. Conclusion: According to the findings of the present study, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), malignancy, and chronic kidney disease were among the most prevalent underlying diseases among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, respectively.",35.76819645731284,15.897985295246261

During an outbreak, clinical engineering should have expedient plans to convert standard rooms. Retrofitting the rooms with externally exhausted HEPA filters may be a solution [16] . Outbreaks can lead to significant increase in the need for ICU beds, but may simultaneously reduce the available beds. The SARS outbreak in Toronto led to 10-day closures of 35 ICU beds, which represented 38 % of the tertiary-care university medical-surgical ICU beds in Toronto [16] . Hence, hospitals should always have plans to augment ICU bed capacity, such as by transforming general wards. The ability of any hospital to deal with an infectious outbreak is decided by the availability of ICU beds [23] . Caring for MERS patients represents a substantial exposure risk for ICU staff because of three reasons: high exposure dose, long daily contact hours and prolonged ICU stay with viral shedding. MERS-CoV patients requiring ICU admission have higher viral load than other MERS patients [24] . Aerosol-generating procedures, such as noninvasive ventilation, suctioning and bronchoscopy, add to the exposure and transmission risk [25] . Extended bedside care is needed for MERS patients due to the requirement of organ support such as mechanical ventilation, vasopressor therapy, continuous renal replacement therapy, prone positioning and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [2, 3] . In this study, we observed an increase in the nurse-to-patient ratio from 1:1.2 to approximately 1:0.8 during the outbreak.

About a quarter of all require ventilation while 75% require oxygen support only. The variation in severity rates probably reflects the outcomes in an overwhelmed health system. Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) is potentially of benefit and we will know more particularly when cities with higher technology health systems become affected and ECMO is truly tested in the most severely ill.

Early clinical trials of ECMO employed primarily an arterial-venous strategy with larger bore catheters for patients with intractable hypoxemia [71] . More modern investigations have used a safer venous-venous access approach [72, 73] . A recent UK prospective, randomized, clinical trial (CESAR) showed a survival advantage in the ECMO group (63% for ECMO versus 47% for controls). Nevertheless, the study was criticized as there was no standardized protocol management for the control group and some patients in the ECMO arm did not receive the proposed treatment [74] . The authors of CESAR trial also recommended transferring adult patients with severe but potentially reversible respiratory failure and a pH less than 7.20 on optimal conventional management, to a center with an ECMO-based management protocol to significantly improve survival without severe disability. The authors demonstrated that this strategy is also likely to be cost effective in settings with similar services to those in the United Kingdom [74] . Another recent approach for application of extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal new devices (ECMO-R) in ARDS patients is the demonstration that in severe ARDS even the low tidal volume ventilation with 6 mL/Kg of predicted body weight can cause tidal hyperdistension in the nondependent regions of the lungs accompanied by plateau airway pressures greater than 28 cmH 2 O and elevated plasma markers of inflammation. In this group application of ECMO-R could allow the authors to decrease the tidal volume to less than 6 mL/kg with a consequent plateau pressure less than 25 cmH 2 O that was associated with a lower radiographic index of lung injury and lower levels of lung-derived inflammatory cytokines. However, prognostic implication of this new ECMO-R devices application in clinical practice is still under investigation [75] . Pumpless interventional lung assist (iLA) is also used in patients with ARDS and is aimed at improving extracorporeal gas exchange with a membrane integrated in a passive arteriovenous shunt. iLA serves as an extracorporeal assist to support mechanical ventilation by enabling low tidal volume and a reduced inspiratory plateau pressure in extremely severe ARDS patients. Zimmermann and colleagues used iLA in 51 severe ARDS patients and observed a decrease in PaCO 2 allowing the decrease in tidal volume and plateau pressure (ultraprotective ventilation) with a hospital mortality rate of 49% [76] .",46.92657302247001,16.964881535363986

They can be found in a variety of neurologic diseases. The pattern of distribution can lead to the underlying pathomechanism [1] . Survivors of high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE) showed multiple MH, predominantly in the splenium of the corpus callosum. Mountaineers with a lack of acclimatization to high altitudes tend to suff er from HACE. Hypoxemia in great heights is discussed to be the main trigger of HACE [2] . Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ADRS) is characterized by oxygenation failure in mechanically ventilated patients. The severity is classifi ed by the ratio of arterial oxygen tension to fraction of inspired oxygen [3] . In some patients suff ering from severe ARDS, refractory to conventional therapy, venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy is the therapeutic option to ensure oxygenation. Methods Retrospectively, we examined 20 patients with cerebral MRI (including SWI) who had suff ered from severe ARDS and received ECMO therapy. The MRI slides were anonymized and analyzed by two experienced neuroradiologists. Based on the distribution pattern and characteristic, a modifi ed HACE score (mHCS) was surveyed [2] .

A recent nationwide analysis in China demonstrated that, of 1590 COVID-19 cases from 575 hospitals, 18 had a history of cancer (1 vs 0.29% of cancer incidence in the overall Chinese population, respectively), with lung cancer as the most frequent diagnosis [5] .

CRS is characterized by elevated levels of IL-6, IFN-γ and other cytokines, provoking consequences and symptoms related to immune activation, ranging from fever, malaise and myalgias to severe organ toxicity, lung failure and death. In parallel, one of the most important mechanism underlying the deterioration of disease in COVID-19 is represented by the cytokine storm, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome or even multiple organ failure [16] . The cytometric analyses of COVID-19 patients showed reduced counts of peripheral CD4 and CD8 T cells, while their status was hyperactivated. In addition, an increased concentration of highly proinflammatory CCR6+ Th17 in CD4 T cells has been reported, and CD8 T cells were found to harbor high concentrations of cytotoxic granules, suggesting that overactivation of T cells tends to contribute to the severe immune injury of the disease [17] .

Furthermore, the limited cancer patient population described in this first report from the literature, was curiously characterized by the lack of individuals receiving anticancer immunotherapy. Indeed, only chemotherapy and surgery were cited among treatments received by patients in the month prior to developing COVID-19. Maybe, this could simply be due to the casualty of a small sample, or otherwise, it could suggest that cancer patients receiving immunotherapy are less prone to develop COVID-19 or to be admitted in hospital due to severe coronavirus symptoms. Currently, we are aware of the probably higher incidence of misdiagnosed coronavirus infections compared with that reported and updated every day; it is likely that a great portion of healthy and young population develop COVID-19 with mild symptoms, not requiring hospital admittance and thus escaping the laboratory confirmation of the disease [7] .

It was demonstrated in mice models that IL-6 is essential for preventing virus-induced neutrophil cell death and H1N1associated mortality, limiting influenza-induced cytokine storm and protecting against fatal lung pathology [25] . Furthermore, IL-6 is crucial in secondary infections to recall virus-specific memory CD4 T cells, favoring virus clearance and host survival, as supported by the inability of IL-6 deficient mice to control influenza viral titers in the lung [25] . Such preclinical evidence suggests that, despite probably being harmful in the ARDS phase, IL-6 role could be crucial, in the early phase of the viral infection, to defuse the pathogenesis of severe and lethal forms of influenza.

Evidence illustrating its clinical use for pancreatitis is suggested in animal models, illustrating that NM decreases the mortality of rats in an experimental acute pancreatitis model in a dose-dependent manner (Infusion at doses of 0.5-50 mg/kg/min) (6) . In aspects of anticoagulation, a retrospective study indicated that NM could substitute for heparin in application of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a novel rescue measure for circulatory and/or respiratory failure. Results showed that NM reduces anticoagulation values of patient to safe levels with an infused rate of 0.2-0.5 mg/kg per hour (52) . In patients with acute kidney injury who received continuous renal replacement (CRRT) therapy, a single-center randomized study was performed and found that mean filter lifespan, a representation of treatment efficacy, was significantly longer in patients receiving NM than in those without NM, and no adverse events associated with NM administration were noted (53) . For hematological malignancies patients diagnosed as DIC, the DIC resolution rates are 40.3 and 56.3% on days 7 and 14 after treatment of NM (0.06-0.20 mg/kg/day) (7) . While compared to protease inhibitor gabexate mesylate (GM), there was no significant difference of DIC resolution rates between these two inhibitors. With respect to cancer therapy, three studies have been conducted to explore the possibility of NM's clinical application in pancreatic tumors treated with a combination of NM and gemcitabine chemotherapy. A phase I study was performed with 12 patients enrolled, and the regimen contained administration of gemcitabine at a fixed dose of 1,000 mg/m 2 for 30 min on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle, accompanied by administration of NM starting via a port-catheter system for 24 h before infusion of gemcitabine. The starting dose of NM was 2.4 mg/kg with increments of 1.2 mg/kg until 4.8 mg/kg, and no patients experienced dose-limiting toxic effects at any level of incremental dose. In that case, the recommended dose of NM in combination with full-dose gemcitabine is 4.8 mg/kg (54) . Next, based on the recommended dosage in a phase I trial, a single-arm phase II study occurred in a single center to evaluate treatment efficacy of 35 patients with unresectable and metastatic pancreatic cancer. The overall response rate was 17.1%, and 25% of patients who required opioids for cancer-related pain decreased their intake.

Numerous studies have been published, establishing evidence and opinion-based guides for emergency physicians, who are at the front line. Although many have established pathways for dealing with patient screening, testing, prognosis and disposition, I would like to discuss the management of the crashing patients in need of ventilation who we ought to be prepared for the most. As of now, it is essential to contain a crashing suspected/confirmed COVID-19 patient within the confines of a negative isolation chamber due to a high risk of aerosolization, with strict adherence to personal protective equipment (PPE), exclusively comprising of N95 or preferably a powered air purifying respirator (PAPR) (1). Most experienced staff should look after the patient, in order to minimize contamination to few personnel only. Since conventional methods of Non-invasive mechanical ventilation (CPAP/BiPAP) are inadvisable due to aerosol generation, it is suggested to secure a definitive airway with extreme precaution (2) . Pre-oxygenation can be performed with a Bag Valve Mask device with positive end expiratory valve and a viral filter, if available. It is recommended to form a good facemask seal with both hands, while making sure not to deliver any positive breaths (2) . Induction and relaxant medications should be administered at a maximum dose in order to prevent cough or gag reflex during the procedure (3). A video laryngoscope should be used so as to avoid having the operator position their face close to the patient. The most senior physician should at-tempt maintaining the airway, in order to maximally ensure first pass intubation success; however, in a failed airway scenario, attempts should be made to establish a surgical airway immediately. The endotracheal tube (ETT) should be positioned at a predetermined depth and secured properly. Avoid auscultation attempts to prevent instrument contamination, and look for bilateral chest rise or end tidal capnography waveform. If available, a viral filter should be connected to the adapter of the ETT, and another should be placed at the exhalation port of the ventilator (2) . A plastic transparent sheet can be placed over the patientâȂŹs head and chest to prevent droplet spread (4). All contaminated instruments should be placed in a transparent bag for immediate disposal and/or decontamination. The ARDSnet (acute respiratory distress syndrome network) protocol should be followed for patient ventilation. In case of poor PaO2/FiO2(PF) ratio (<150), place the patient in prone position (5) . Allow for permissive hypercapnia (pH > 7.2), if hemodynamics remain stable (6, 7) . Do not give fluid boluses and maintain the patient in negative balance (8) . If needed, place a central venous access line in femoral site for administering vasopressors to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure. Following intubation and initial ventilation, immediately proceed to transfer the patient to intensive care unit, after which, perform decontamination of the initial zone and the equipment used. Consider meticulous removal of PPE and debrief.",29.809683716572493,11.98339192042451

Reference Introduction The usefulness of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is being rediscovered in the wake of the pandemic of H1N1 infl uenza. However, it has been reported that patients who received ECMO often developed virus-associated hemophagocytic syndrome (VAHS), compared with those without ECMO support. Although there is ample evidence that extensive cytokine activation is a key factor in VAHS, ECMO itself could be a potential trigger to exacerbate the pathology by amplifying cytokine activation. In this study, we investigated whether mediators such as cytokines may be produced by ECMO. Methods Patients with severe respiratory failure who were placed on ECMO were enrolled between June and July 2012. This study was approved by the ethics committee. Blood specimens were drawn from the blood circuit at the inlet of the centrifugal pump (before) and outlet of the hollow fi ber oxygenator (after) at a frequency of three to four times per day. Blood IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12(p70), IL-13, IL-17, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IFNγ, MCP-1, MIP-1β, and TNFα were measured globally using a multiplex cytokine bead array system (Bio-Plex; Bio-Rad, Tokyo, Japan). HMGB1 was measured using an ELISA kit (Shino-Test, Tokyo, Japan). Results Two patients with interstitial pneumonia were studied. The ECMO system consisted of a Rotafl ow Centrifugal Pump (Maquet Japan, Tokyo, Japan), a Biocube TNC coating 6000 (NIPRO, Osaka, Japan), and a percutaneous cardiopulmonary support system (Capiox EBS; Terumo, Tokyo, Japan). The blood fl ow rate was 2.0 ± 4.0 l/minute. A total of 34 blood sets were collected. In most cases, blood levels of IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-12(p70), IL-13, IL-17, GM-CSF, IFNγ, and TNFα were below the detection limit and did not increase during ECMO.

Invasive mechanical ventilation could worsen lung hyperinfl ation and produce a vicious circle. We investigated whether increasing extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO 2 Cl) could reduce the respiratory rate (RR), so prolonging time for lung emptying and allowing resolution of hyperinfl ation. Methods Six patients with COPD exacerbation with respiratory acidosis (PaCO 2 83 ± 27 mmHg, pH 7.19 ± 0.1) and tachypnea (RR 39 ± 5) despite maximal non-invasive ventilation underwent venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO).

Chen et al., found that LDH had significantly increased in most patients, while albumin had decreased, but ALT and AST showed no significant changes (11) . The mentioned val- ues were also reported for patients with MERS-CoV, where elevated ALT, AST and LDH was observed (6) . Another study indicated that 2-11% of patients with COVID-19 had liver co-morbidities and 14-53% of cases had abnormal ALT and AST levels during progression of COVID-19 disease (12) . Furthermore, Shi et al. studied patients whose COVID-19 diagno- sis was confirmed by computed tomography (CT) scan while in the subclinical phase and found that incidence of AST abnormality among these patients was significantly lower than those diagnosed after the onset of symptoms (13) . Therefore, liver injury is more prevalent in severe cases compared to mild cases of COVID-19. In another report, Yang et al. found no difference in the incidence of abnormal liver function between survivors (30%) and non-survivors (28%) (9) . Liver damage in mild cases of COVID-19 is often transient and can return to normal without any special treatment (12) . We have found that the number and percentage of WBC, LYM and NEU were significantly different between positive and negative RT-PCR cases for COVID-19/or SARS-CoV-2. In comparison to the normal range, we found low WBC and LYM counts in patients with positive RT-PCR COVID-19, whereas NEU counts were higher in these patients. In previous reports, low LYM and WBC counts were found in most patients, which is in line with our study (14) . Laboratory studies showed leucopenia with leukocyte counts of 2.91 ÃŮ 109 cells/L, 70.0% of which were NEU (15) . Therefore, our result suggests that NEU might not be affected with SARS-CoV-2 in the initial phase of the disease. It also suggests that SARS-CoV-2 might mainly act on lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes, as does SARS-CoV. Virus particles spread through the respiratory tract and infect other cells, inducing series of immune responses, and causing changes in number of peripheral white blood cells such as lymphocytes (11) . Some studies suggest that a substantial decrease in the total number of lymphocytes indicates that coronavirus affects many immune cells and inhibits cellular immune function (11) . Tsui and others reported that high neutrophil count on admission of COVID-19 patients, and elevated LDH level were independent predictors of an adverse clinical outcome (16) . In the present study, ROC curve was used to analyze the specificity and sensitivity of different variables in suspected COVID-19 patients. The AUC of laboratory parameters such as ALT, CRP, AST, LDH, and NEU indicated that they could be used to predict the presence of COVID-19 disease, while those of albumin and WBC were below the reference line of ROC curve, indicating that they were poor predictors of the disease. The data is in line with results reported by Wang et al. (17) and Gao et al. (4) . In the current study, the AUC of CRP, ALT, LDH, urea and NEU were above 0.80; thus, they are effective and have very good predictive value for predicting COVID-19. It seems that, some blood laboratory parameters could be used in screening cases with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19. Considering the significant difference in laboratory parameters evaluated in this study between the 2 groups, one can hope to model or predict the results of coronavirus testing based on routine laboratory tests.",38.302746000651375,14.802767700917869

COVID-19 is now rapidly spreading worldwide, and this letter is written as the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a global emergency on January 31st amid concerns about a growing outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. Most of the published articles on COVID-19 have highlighted lungs as the main organ involved in the disease, while few articles have reported SARS-CoV-2 involvement in other organs, including liver and kidneys, which can impair the metabolism and excretion of the medications taken to treat the disease. According to Zhang et al. the incidence of hepatic abnormalities significantly increases after infection with COVID-19 and during the course of the disease, which may indicate the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the liver or side effects of the medications used by patients (1) . Also, Xu et al. have reported steatosis and liver injury in the liver biopsy of a patient with COVID-19 (2) . In addition to liver injuries, some articles have also reported an increased incidence of acute renal injury following COVID-19, which could be due to the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the inflammation induced by the disease, or a synergistic effect of both on kidneys (3, 4) . Additionally, Cheng et al. have reported that patients with acute renal injury have a higher mortality rate compared to other patients (3) .

Medicines currently prescribed to treat COVID-19 include Oseltamivir, Lopinavir / Ritonavir, Ribavirin, and Chloroquine Phosphate or Hydroxy Chloroquine Sulfate. All of these medicines are metabolized in the liver. Most of the metabolites derived from Oseltamivir, Ribavirin and some of the metabolites of Lopinavir / Ritonavir, Chloroquine Phosphate and Hydroxy Chloroquine Sulfate are found in the urine due to renal excretion. Therefore, injury to the liver and kidneys can impair metabolism, excretion, dosing and expected concentrations of the medications, which can increase the risk of toxicity using the aforementioned medications. According to the reports, liver and kidneys can be damaged in patients with COVID-19, which may make reaching the therapeutic dose of the medicines difficult and increase the risk of adverse drug reactions in patients. As a result, frequent and careful monitoring of liver and kidney functions in patients with COVID-19 can lead to early diagnosis of liver and kidney disorders, and also help in achieving the optimal therapeutic concentrations and reducing the risk of adverse drug reactions.",33.19387358070635,13.756163485590896

This viral infection involves the upper respiratory tract and could lead to severe pneumonia with respiratory distress or even death. Certain studies have found higher initial plasma levels of most pro-inflammatory cytokines during the course of the infection. In this context, both in vitro and in vivo studies have revealed that metronidazole could decrease the levels of several cytokines, which are known to increase during the COVID-19 infection, including interleukin (IL)8, IL6, IL1B, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, IL12, IL1α, and interferon (IFN)γ, as well as the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophil count. Furthermore, the drug could decrease neutrophil-generated reactive oxygen species during inflammation. Metronidazole could counteract majority of the immunopathological manifestations of the COVID-19 infection. Therefore, studies with a large sample size are required to determine the efficacy of metronidazole in the treatment of COVID-19 infection.",24.898807370756387,10.502002071771036

Our study is aimed to investigate the current application, efficacy and safety of ECMO in for severe H7N9 pneumonia-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the Chinese population. Methods: A multicentre retrospective cohort study was conducted at 20 hospitals that admitted patients with avian influenza A (H7N9) viral pneumonia patients' admission from 9 provinces in China between October 1, 2016, and March 1, 2017. Data from the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China, including general conditions, outcomes and ECMO management, were analysed. Then, successfully weaned and unsuccessfully weaned groups were compared. Results: A total of 35 patients, aged 57 ± 1 years, were analysed; 65.7% of patients were male with 63% mortality. All patients underwent invasive positive pressure ventilation (IPPV), and rescue ventilation strategies were implemented for 23 cases (65.7%) with an average IPPV duration of 5 ± 1 d, PaO 2 /FiO 2 of 78 ± 23 mmHg, tidal volume (VT) of 439 ± 61 ml and plateau pressure (P plat ) of 29 ± 8 cmH 2 O pre-ECMO.

A specific reference was made to data from South Korea where 30% of the 2,000 tested patients reported symptoms or anosmia or ageusia. The article states that doctors are advising patients to self-isolate if they experience these symptoms as it could be an early indication of infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19. This is particularly pertinent since current governmental guidelines in the United Kingdom (UK) state that if you have either a temperature or a dry cough then to self-isolate. Should anosmia emerge as a symptom of COVID-19, this could encourage more people to self-isolate, even in absence of other symptoms, to prevent further spread of the virus. Therefore, more information surrounding this possible symptom is crucial. However, whilst it is possible that anosmia and ageusia are in fact symptoms of COVID-19, to our knowledge there is currently no published evidence or case reports noting anosmia and/or ageusia/dysgeusia in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, testing is not yet widespread in the UK and is mainly occurring only in patients hospitalised with the disease. It seems reasonable at this stage of the pandemic that new anosmia or ageusia in people who are otherwise well should be a trigger for testing where available. Otherwise, the onset of such symptoms could be considered as a criterion to self-isolate, particularly when occurring alongside other less common symptoms such as myalgia, diarrhoea or fatigue.",35.90392870615581,15.696557843871224

To provide stable cardiac output in the VA mode and adequate oxygenation in the VV mode, adequate blood flow should be maintained. Therefore, clinicians raise the ECMO pump speed as much as possible to maintain adequate blood flow. The blood flow rate that was applied to 90% of our patients was less than 4.1 L/min. A high blood flow extracorporeal circuit that pumped up to 7 L/min [26] did not apply to our patients; however, 43.8% (141/321) of our patients were treated with a pump speed higher than the cut-off value of 2.19 x 10 3 rpm. For these reasons, we speculate that pump speed, but not a blood flow, is a predictor of death in this study. We compared the clinical characteristics of patients from the VA and VV ECMO modes. Patients with the VV mode had higher levels of CRP, showed higher mortality, and had longer stays in the hospital compared with those with the VA mode; however, the mortality within 2 weeks after ECMO insertion was higher in patients with the VA mode. We speculated that the patients with the VA mode deteriorated rapidly but recovered soon if they were not severe enough for death. In contrast, patients with the VV mode seemed to show slower but poorer outcomes than those with the VA mode. The different disease process of the patients treated with the VA and VV ECMO modes [27] might be related to these findings.

The new virus is thought to have originated from an animal-to-human spillover event linked to seafood and live-animal markets. The infection has spread locally in Wuhan and elsewhere in China, despite strict intervention measures implemented in the region where the infection originated on Jan 23, 2020. More than 500 patients infected with COVID-19 outside of mainland China have been reported between Jan 1 and Feb 14, 2020. Although laboratory testing for COVID-19 quickly ramped up in China and elsewhere, information on individual patients remains scarce and official datasets have not been made publicly available. Patient-level information is important to estimate key time-to-delay events (such as the incubation period and interval between symptom onset and visit to a hospital), analyse the age profile of infected patients, reconstruct epidemic curves by onset dates, and infer transmission parameters.

The average percentage of the increase over the forecasted period is 10%, the highest percentage is 12% on 28/2/2020, and the lowest percentage is 8.7% on 19/2/2020. From the previous results, it can be concluded that the proposed FPASSA-ANFIS has a high ability to forecast the COVID-19 dataset. These results avoid the limitations of traditional ANFIS because of the combination with the modified FPA method. Moreover, the operators of SSA are combined with the local strategy of FPA to enhance their exploitation ability. However, the time computational of the proposed FPASSA method still requires more improvements.",35.11965217788989,13.712751503387999

Answering this question requires accurate forecasting the spread of confirmed cases as well as analysis of the number of deaths and recoveries. Forecasting, however, requires ample historical data. At the same time, no prediction is certain as the future rarely repeats itself in the same way as the past. Moreover, forecasts are influenced by the reliability of the data, vested interests, and what variables are being predicted. Also, psychological factors play a significant role in how people perceive and react to the danger from the disease and the fear that it may affect them personally. This paper introduces an objective approach to predicting the continuation of the COVID-19 using a simple, but powerful method to do so. Assuming that the data used is reliable and that the future will continue to follow the past pattern of the disease, our forecasts suggest a continuing increase in the confirmed COVID-19 cases with sizable associated uncertainty. The risks are far from symmetric as underestimating its spread like a pandemic and not doing enough to contain it is much more severe than overspending and being over careful when it will not be needed.

It is necessary to provide increased oxygen levels, often with respiratory assistance via mechanical ventilation (Hermansen and Lorah, 2007) . For immature lungs, it is now possible to provide exogenous surfactant intratracheally, a measure that is extremely helpful in allowing a minimization of the degree and time of mechanical ventilation assistance. Minimizing mechanical ventilation can help avoid potential problems, including barotrauma, oxygen toxicity, nosocomial pneumonia, tracheal stenosis, and deconditioning of respiratory muscles.

Team structure and patient pathways A typical patient receiving team is changing as new specialities emerge. When multiple cases arrive simultaneously, leadership and trained personal working with that leadership are vital. Currently in most trusts a consultant in emergency medicine (EM) and/or orthopaedics and trauma will be the team leader. They will be assisted by an anaesthetist, primary and secondary circulating nurse and a radiology technician. In England now all EM doctors are trained in airway control, basic ultrasound and trauma care. Pre-hospital emergency medicine (PHEM) is a subspeciality of anaesthesia, intensive care, EM and acute internal medicine, with the first doctors completing this training in 2015.

Surfactant treatment did not affect mortality but it helped in weaning from ECMO. alveolar recruitment mainly in dependent, juxtadiaphragmatic lung regions, resulting in end-expiratory aeration. It also led to a redistribution of tidal ventilation to dependent lung zones in oleic acid induced lung injury. Spontaneous breathing with airway pressure release ventilation countered the undesirable cyclic alveolar collapse in dependent lung regions, which can contribute to ventilator-associated lung injury, but no indices of lung injury were assessed.

This was achieved through the collaboration of various Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) entities (critical care, cardiothoracic surgery, vascular surgery, and ambulance services). The service was commissioned by the Ministry of Public Health in October 2013 in response to the emerging MERS-Corona outbreak and its associated high mortality. After extensive team building and training, the service treated its first patient in June 2014. The key result has been an improvement in survival rate from 19 to 68%. The service is ranked among the best in the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) outcomes benchmark of worldwide SRF services. The provision of the highest quality care to patients with high predicted mortality has given a new hope in improving clinical outcomes and their reintegration into community. Background: In 2013, a novel virus (MERS Corona virus) was identified in Saudi Arabia, with subsequent cases in other gulf states including Qatar. 1 The MERS virus was associated with rapid onset of severe respiratory and renal failure, resulting in a very high mortality rate (.50%) in the early days of the infection. 2 The need to establish a SRF center with mobile ECMO retrieval capabilities was identified by the HMC senior leadership in order to anticipate and proactively deal with the situation. The program became a matter of utmost importance due to the inevitable social, political, and geographical factors, which united the people of the GCC. Strategically speaking, regulating the travel norms or bringing in a quarantine on travelers arriving from the countries affected by the MERS Corona virus were not a feasible alternative. 3 Furthermore, the high mortality rate, failure of conventional ICU care, and the high cost of transporting and hospitalizing these patients in other countries with advanced respiratory support capability highlighted the need for the development of a severe respiratory failure and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (SRF-ECMO) service program in Qatar. Evidence: The value of a SRF-ECMO service had previously been demonstrated during the international outbreak of H1N1 virus, when survival of patients with significant respiratory failure would have been left to chance or luck if no such advanced program had been in place. The SRF-ECMO services were achieving global survival rates of 60-70% in patients with otherwise very high mortality rates. 4 Additionally, treatment of SRF in the SRF-ECMO Center decreased mortality rates. 5 The vision of the leadership in promoting interdepartmental collaboration along with the support from the management at various levels was the highlight in the development of this program which now is recognized internationally for its clinical excellence and well known for its best practices, teaching, and mentorship programs. Program implementation and team training: The idea of a SRF-ECMO service in the State of Qatar had to be planned immaculately due to the fact that this was the first project of its kind in the country and there is always a sense of anticipation and enigma surrounding such a cutting-edge technology being made available with the help of the government itself. As a result of various fruitful deliberations, a steering committee was created which identified all the potential services that would be involved in the program along with the identification of the potential stakeholders in its successful implementation. The Guys and St Thomas (GSTT) Hospital team in London (UK) was identified as the potential partner for the implementation of the SRF-ECMO in Qatar and hence an official mission consisting of leaders from various services involved went on a field visit to get a firsthand experience about the program. Various discussions with the GSTT team took place in order to understand the processes and the actual difficulties they faced when they started their own SRF-ECMO service.",48.010887662031855,17.047532980452488

Several abnormalities also have been observed including cellular immune deficiency, coagulation activation, myocardia injury, hepatic and kidney injury, and secondary bacterial infection. 16 In the majority of cases of severe disease and death, lymphopenia and sustained inflammation have been recorded. Notably, these observations in COVID-19 patients are similar to those who suffered from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during the 2003 epidemic. There may be a biological mechanism behind this epidemiological anomaly. 17 Several kinds of vaccines and antiviral drugs that are based on S protein have been previously evaluated. Du et al. showed vaccines can be based on the S protein include full-length S protein, viral vector, DNA, recombinant S protein and recombinant RBD protein. Considering that, in the in vitro study, antiviral therapies are design based on S protein include RBDeACE2 blockers, S cleavage inhibitors, fusion core blockers, neutralizing antibodies, protease inhibitors, S protein inhibitors, and small interfering RNAs. 18 There are some recombinant compounds such as IFN with ribaverin which has only limited effects against COVID-19 infection. 1 The receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 has a higher affinity for ACE2, while it is a lower affinity for SARS-CoV. 1, 19 Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and its homologue ACE2, belongs to the ACE family of dipeptidylcarboxy dipeptidase. However, their physiological functions are varied. On the other hand, ACE2 serves as the binding site for COVID-19. Based on this information, Gurwitz suggested using available angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1R) blockers, such as losartan, as therapeutics for reducing the severity of COVID-19 infections. 20 At present therapy is based on identifying and developing monoclonal antibodies that are specific and effective against COVID-19 combines with remdesivir as a novel nucleotide analog prodrug that was used for the treatment of the Ebola virus disease. 17, 21 To understand the rate of virus spread among people, it is crucial to figure out whether COVID-19 is mutating to improve its binding to human receptors for infection considering its high mutation rate. Any adaptation in the COVID-19 sequence that might make it more efficient at transmitting among people might also boost its virulence. 22 The COVID-19 is expected to become less virulent through human to human transmissions due to genetic bottlenecks for RNA viruses often occur during respiratory droplet transmissions. 3",31.456541116378904,14.501974017788738

In order for the virus to complete entry into the cell following this initial process, the spike protein has to be primed by an enzyme called a protease. Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) uses a protease called TMPRSS2 to complete this process. 10, 11 In order to attach virus receptor (spike protein) to its cellular ligand (ACE2), activation by TMPRSS2 as a protease is needed (Fig. 4) . 10 After the virus enters the host cell and uncoats, the genome is transcribed and then translated. Coronavirus genome replication and transcription takes place at cytoplasmic membranes and involve coordinated processes of both continuous and discontinuous RNA synthesis that are mediated by the viral replicate, a huge protein complex encoded by the 20-kb replicase gene. 12 The replicase complex is believed to be comprised of up to 16 viral subunits and a number of cellular proteins. Besides RNAdependent RNA polymerase, RNA helicase, and protease activities, which are common to RNA viruses, the coronavirus replicase was recently predicted to employ a variety of RNA processing enzymes that are not (or extremely rarely) found in other RNA viruses and include putative sequence-specific endoribonuclease, 3 0 -to-5 0 exoribonuclease, 2 0 -O-ribose methyltransferase, ADP ribose 1 0 -phosphatase and, in a subset of group 2 coronaviruses, cyclic Genotype and phenotype of COVID- 19 3 phosphodiesterase activities. 13, 14 The proteins are assembled at the cell membrane and genomic RNA is incorporated as the mature particle forms by budding from the internal cell membranes. 15",27.68798560082034,12.447424695518517

Radiotherapy is delivered to nearly 50% of cancer patients, a particularly vulnerable group given their older age, frequent comorbidities, and underlying cancer diagnosis. 2 Prostate cancer is frequently treated with radiation and the most common solid tumor in men; it is a heterogeneous disease where timely therapy is indicated for some cases, and where watchful waiting, active surveillance, or deferral of treatment could be acceptable for others. 3, 4 Given the current epidemic crisis, delaying radiotherapy treatment (which requires multiple visits to healthcare facilities) for prostate cancer patients may potentially reduce the risk of iatrogenic exposure to COVID-19. At the healthcare system level, when clinically appropriate, reducing visits conserves limited hospital resources (e.g. personal protective equipment (PPE)) for use by health-care workers who will have to care for the potentially vast number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The decision to delay life-saving cancer treatment in a time of a resource-intensive pandemic represents a clinical conundrum without modern precedent. In these exigent circumstances, guidelines as to how to manage patients who present with prostate cancer would be valuable for the practicing clinician.

Rapid discharge of patients with primary NSTEMI following revascularization will likely be important in terms of maximizing bed availability and reducing patient exposure within the hospital. Follow-up through telehealth venues could be satisfactory in most cases. It has been suggested that in appropriately selected cases of patients with known COVID-19 and NSTEMI, (e.g., particularly for patients with type 2 MI) conservative therapy may be sufficient based on the patient's risk.

For instance, age is the strongest risk factor for CVD and the effect of aging on immune function may be equally important for COVID-19 suceptibility and severity. Exemplary of this, the effect of age on the immune system is exemplified by low protective titers among 50% of adults older than 65 who receive the influenza vaccine (30, 31) . Other traditional CVD risk factors such as diabetes and hyperlipidemia impact immune function, and conversely, dysregulated immunologic status corresponds with elevated risk of incident CVD (32) (33) (34) (35) . Thus, prevalent CVD may be a marker of accelerated immunologic aging/dysregulation and relate indirectly to COVID-19 prognosis. An increased frequency of adverse CVD events post COVID-19 infection might also play a role in prognosis, similar to other viral infections such as influenza with mechanistic underpinnings which are complex, multi-factorial, and bi-directional (36, 37) . In addition, COVID-19 infection may trigger pathways unique to this pathogen which contribute to outcomes in CVD patients. For instance, higher expression of ACE2 in patients with hypertension and CVD has been postulated to enhance susceptibility to SARS-CoV2, although the data are conflicting and without clear suggestion for treatment ( Figure 1 ) (5) .

Another possible reason is that the patient's bowel movements were not listed as the focus of observation. In general, diarrhea is not a common symptom in patients with COVID-19. More attention is needed because diarrhea is a reminder that SARS-COV-2 invades the intestine. In autopsy reports of patients with COVID-19, staged narrowing and expansion of the small intestine may be a more intuitive warning [9] . Future research should focus on how long SARS-COV-2 persists in the feces of COVID-19 patients with diarrhea. This helps to better manage discharged patients and to properly dispose of the patients' feces, thereby avoiding potential sources of SARS-COV-2. Clinicians, especially digestive physicians, should pay close attention to the atypical symptoms of COVID-19 and take personal protection against the feces of patients. When discharged from home, patients with COVID-19 should pay special attention to hand hygiene and avoid sharing toilets with family members. In addition, we remind the public not to panic, but to prevent it scientifically.",40.32277187005199,15.693543185824462

Clinically, patients with COVID-19 present with respiratory symptoms, which is very similar to the presentation of other respiratory virus infections. Radiologically, COVID-19 is characterised by multifocal ground-glass opacities, even for patients with mild disease. 3 Knowledge of virus dynamics and host response are essential for formulating strategies for antiviral treatment, vaccination, and epidemiological control of COVID-19. However, a systematic study on these aspects has not been done. In The Lancet Infectious Diseases, Kelvin To and colleagues 4 report the viral load and antibody profiles of a cohort of 23 patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. In these patients, the viral load peaked during the first week of illness then gradually declined over the second week. Viral load was also shown to correlate with age. Furthermore, both IgG and IgM antibodies started to increase on around day 10 after symptom onset, and most patients had seroconversion within the first 3 weeks. Finally, the IgG and IgM antibody level against the SARS-CoV-2 internal nucleoprotein and the surface spike receptor binding domain correlated with neutralising activity.",36.022667724911074,14.460962716398928

It is important to mention here that although the cerebral damage may complicate a COVID-19 infection, it appears that it is the widespread dysregulation of homeostasis caused by pulmonary, renal, cardiac, and circulatory damage that proves fatal in COIVD-19 patients. With that being said, a dominant cerebral involvement alone with the potential of causing cerebral edema in COVID-19 can take a lead in causing death long before systemic homeostatic dysregulation sets in. Access of the COVID-19 virus to the brain via the transcribrial route, as described previously for other CNS targeting pathogens, 7 could have been the case in a recently reported patient with hyposmia and the cases of acute respiratory failure in COVID-19, 5 which needs to be further elucidated by isolating the SARS-CoV-2 virus from the zones that are in proximity to the olfactory bulb. It is expected that the differences in the sequence of spike proteins between COVID-19 virus and SARS-CoV ( Figure 2A ) will enable scientists to identify epitopes in COVID-19 virus for the development of monoclonal antibodies against this virus. With the recent COVID-19 outbreak, there is an urgent need to understand the neurotropic potential of the COVID-19 virus in order to prioritize and individualize the treatment protocols based on the severity of the disease and predominant organ involvement.

However, it has recently been questioned if such numbers reflect the real burden of severe COVID-19 disease in children [14] . Using the ratio of COVID-19 to influenza cases identified in an early retrospective surveillance study in China [3], it was estimated that the actual number of severe pediatric cases and mildly infected children may have been significantly larger (by a factor of several hundreds and several thousands, respectively) compared to what had been registered suggesting that the force of infection from children may have been grossly underestimated [14] . In regards of clinical impact, the available 4 data suggest that the proportion of severe and critical cases seems to be inversely related to age suggesting that young children, and in particular infants and pre-school children, could be more vulnerable to COVID-19 related morbidity [10] . Thus, clinicians caring for children should be wary of subgroups of children who can be at an increased risk for more significant illness, as particularly younger age, underlying pulmonary pathology, and many immunocompromising conditions have also been associated with more severe outcomes with other coronavirus infections in children [15] .",32.0379569938168,13.5365020298595

Most of the evidence of ACE2 expression in the brain ( Figure 1 ) comes from literature and mammalian tissue expression databases, 2 which prompted us to investigate neurotropic effects of SARS-CoV-2 and its contribution toward the morbidity and mortality of patients with COVID-19. 3.1. Evidence of the Distribution of ACE2 in the Human Brain. The brain has been reported to express ACE2 receptors ( Figure 1A , C) that have been detected over glial cells and neurons, which makes them a potential target of COVID-19. Previous studies have shown the ability of SARS-CoV to cause neuronal death in mice by invading the brain via the nose close to the olfactory epithelium. 3 The contribution of the neurotropic potential of SARS-CoV-2 in patients reported in the recent outbreak of COVID-19 remains to be established. In the SARS-CoV infections that were reported in the past, autopsy findings of the patients have shown strong evidence of the presence of SARS-CoV by electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and real-time reverse transcription-PCR 3 . Patients with acute SARS-CoV illness have also demonstrated the presence of the virus in cerebrospinal fluid. The role of the blood-brain barrier in containing the virus and preventing it from gaining access to the neural tissues needs to be further explored in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Recently, a study posted in medRxiv 4 has reported neurological manifestations in COVID-19 in the current outbreak that involved 214 patients, of which 78 (36.4%) patients had neurologic manifestations, which affirms our rationale of the neurotropic potential in the COVID-19 virus. Also, a finding published on a patient who had loss of involuntary control over breathing 5 during the recent outbreak with several other patients suffering acute respiratory failure implores healthcare professionals and clinicians to segregate COVID-19 patients into neurologically affected cases and those who are devoid of neurological deficits.",34.5246952288504,13.079802520037138

Efforts to achieve these goals have been the subject of many clinical trials. More recent approaches advocate lowering airway pressures, which offers the dual benefit of minimizing over distension of the aerated areas and mitigating trauma from repeated opening and closing of the alveoli. The American Thoracic Society (ATS), the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM), and the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) met in 2013-2014 to analyze evidence regarding the use of ventilatory strategies established by the ARDSNET trial. Key recommendations that emerged from these meetings included lowering of targets for tidal volumes (4-8 ml/kg predicted body weight) and inspiratory pressures to maintain plateau pressures of <30 mm H20. Low tidal volume strategies have been associated with a 22% relative reduction in mortality when tidal volumes are maintained at 6 mL/kg PBW compared with 12 mL/kg [96] . However, this strategy is limited by subsequent hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis as ARDS progresses. In addition, attendant low lung volumes and atelectasis contribute to increased pulmonary vascular resistance. The utility of an extracorporeal carbon dioxide gas exchanger device or the veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV ECMO) for removal of carbon dioxide has been studied with promising results, although this strategy remains experimental [113] [114] [115] . Investigations probing the utility of ECMO and VV ECMO systematically excluded cancer patients with less than a 5-year life expectancy from many of the larger clinical trials.

This contact induces a sequence of events involving protein adsorption; inflammatory reactions, including activation of the complement and coagulation systems; and adhesion of immunocompetent cells to the exposed surfaces. These events result in serious thromboinflammatory incompatibility reactions targeting the implanted materials [1, 2] . For example, for hemodialysis patients, the risk of myocardial infarction is 5e10 times higher than for healthy individuals. Chronic whole-body inflammation triggered by hemodialysis likely contributes to arteriosclerosis in uremic patients and is associated with a significantly decreased life expectancy. Also, CPB and ECMO procedures, which have increased over the past decade as a result of vascular bypass surgery and long-lasting infections affecting the lungs (e.g., swine influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS), are associated with side effects related to contact between blood and material surfaces that result in cellular and humoral defense reactions known as the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).

The high levels of PM pollution in China may increase the susceptibility of the population to more serious symptoms and respiratory complications of the disease. In addition, oxidant pollutants in air can impair the immune function and attenuate the efficiency of the lung to clear the virus in lungs. The simultaneous inhalation of chemical pollutants in PM alongside COVID-19 virus may also exacerbate the level of COVID-19 infection. Pro-inflammation, injury, and fibrosis from inhaled PM combined with an immune response or cytokine storm induced by COVID-19 infection could enhance the infection severity.

Nevertheless, based on the assumption that viral RNA load correlates with high levels of viral replication, 5 there are important insights to be gained from this time-course analysis. Currently, our understanding of the relationship between viral RNA load kinetics and disease severity in patients with COVID-19 remains fragmented. Zou and colleagues reported that patients with COVID-19 with more severe disease requiring intensive care unit admission had high viral RNA loads at 10 days and beyond, after symptom onset. 4 Unfortunately, it is unknown when in the course of their disease these patients deteriorated. By contrast, Lescure and colleagues report the viral RNA kinetics of two patients who developed late respiratory deterioration despite the disappearance of nasopharyngeal viral RNA. It would be interesting to know whether viral RNA load in lung tissue, or a surrogate sample such as tracheal aspirate, mirrors the decline in nasopharyngeal shedding. Nevertheless, this observation suggests that these late, severe manifestations might be immunologically mediated and has obvious implications for the potential to use immune-modulatory therapies for this subset of patients. This finding is consistent with recent reports that corticosteroids were beneficial for acute respiratory distress syndrome, 6 and possibly those with COVID-19. 7 With more detailed data such as those provided by Lescure and colleagues, the use of viral RNA load to suggest potential clinical strategies to treat COVID-19 could be exploited.",26.74943280573158,10.389537299915292

In this study, we could obtain exact clinical information including day of symptom onset, and figured it out that seroconversion status by the third week of illness (by 21 dpoi) can serve as a prognostic marker. Another important point is that MERS-CoV-infected patients in the present analysis died later than previous reports, probably owing to antiviral therapy or aggressive critical care including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The median interval from symptom onset to death was 27 days in the present study, which is much longer than 11.5 days in previous reports (Zumla et al., 2015) .

We use TOE as our preferred monitoring equipment before, during and after establishing ECMO. We sought to investigate how often information gained from TOE imaging had a major impact on management decisions. Methods A single-centre observational study at a tertiary referral institution. All patients supported with V-A or V-V ECMO during an 18-month period were included.

Results Twenty patients were supported with either V-A (all peripheral) or V-V ECMO during the observation period. In 12 patients (60%) TOE was instrumental in diagnosing potentially fatal complications or altered clinical management.

There are already reports highlighting delays in delivering acute cardiac care due to extra precautions that need to be observed in view of COVID-19 [14],0.2842623128287597,1.2389717102050781,1.3534561395645142,2daa754c-4e85-49cc-9dc1-c5cb56173724,custom_license/Original Article,"The overall management principles for patients presenting with COVID-19 who develop CV complications or who have pre-existing CVD are same as for any other patient without COVID-19. However, there are a few important points that need consideration-1. As caregivers, it is our utmost responsibility to protect ourselves from getting infected while managing these patients. Therefore, all heathcare personnel engaged in the care of COVID-19 patients must observe necessary precautions at all times. All of them should be trained in donning, usage, and doffing of the personal protective equipment in accordance with the existing practice guidelines. 2. The hospital systems need to ensure preparedness for dealing with large volume of COVID-19 patients, many of whom would need ICU care and/or acute cardiac care. Appropriate protocols for rapid diagnosis, triage, isolation, and management of COVID-19 patients with CV complications should be developed and well-rehearsed. Rapid triaging and management of these patients is crucial, not only to allow efficient utilization of healthcare resources but also to minimize exposure to caregivers. There are already reports highlighting delays in delivering acute cardiac care due to extra precautions that need to be observed in view of COVID-19 [14] . Efforts should be made to minimize such delays. 3. Strong emphasis should be placed on avoiding unwarranted diagnostic tests (e.g. cardiac troponin, echocardiography, etc.) in these patients. This is required to minimize unwarranted downstream diagnostic/therapeutic procedures which would further strain the already stretched healthcare resources and would also subject caregivers to added risk of exposure to the infection. The American College of Cardiology has released an advisory discouraging random measurement of cardiac biomarkers such as troponins and natriuretic peptides [15] . It urges all the clinicians to reserve these assays for circumstances in which they would actually meaningfully add to the management of the patients with COVID-19. The American Society of Echocardiography has also issued a similar advisory regarding the use of echocardiography in these patients [16] . 4. The individual hospitals may also have to reconsider risk-benefit ratio of primary percutaneous intervention vs fibrinolysis in patients with COVID-19 who present with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. 5. There has been a concern regarding the safety of ACE inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. These agents upregulate expression of ACE2 in various tissues, including on cardiomyocytes [17] . Since SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 to gain entry into human cells, there is a potentially increased risk of developing COVID-19 or developing more severe disease in patients who are already on background treatment with ACEi/ARB. However, to date, no experimental or clinical data have emerged to support these concerns. At the same time, the risks of discontinuing these therapies are well known. Therefore, several leading professional societies have strongly urged to not discontinue clinically-indicated ACEi/ARB therapy in the event the patient develops COVID-19 [18, 19] . 6. Clinicians caring for these patients also need to be fully aware of the potential CV side-effects of various therapies used for treating the viral infection. Additionally, various anti-retroviral drugs have significant interactions with cardiac drugs, which need to be considered and appropriate dose modification done. More recently, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and azathioprine have been proposed as potential therapeutic options, based on preliminary evidence [20] . Both these drugs are known to prolong QT interval and due caution must be exercised when prescribing these agents. Their combination is best avoided and even when using chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine alone, daily electrocardiogram for monitoring QT interval is warranted, esp. in patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction and in those receiving another drug with potential to prolong QT interval.",36.53993826616067,14.474056495506469

The SARS-CoV-2 virus shares 79.5% of the genetic sequence of SARS and has 96.2% homology to bat coronavirus. 4 The intermediate animal vector between bats and humans for SARS-CoV-2 is currently unknown but has been linked epidemiologically to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. 5 Although initially a zoonotic virus, SARS-CoV-2 is now spread human-to-human with higher infectivity than MERS and SARS but a lower fatality rate. 3 The clinical presentation of COVID-19 can range from mild non-specific respiratory symptoms to severe organ dysfunction such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that can lead to death. 1,6,7 Most cases of COVID-19 appear to be mild with the most common symptoms being fever (83-98%), cough (46-82%), myalgia/fatigue (11-44%) , and shortness of breath (31%). 7 Risk factors for more severe illness requiring hospitalization appear to be older age and having underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, lung disease and cardiovascular disease. 7 Early reports suggest that for more severe cases the median time from first symptom onset to the development of shortness of breath and/or need for hospitalization ranged from 5 to 8 days. 6-8 Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, it is reported that 5 to 26.1% have required admission to the intensive care unit. 6, 8 The reported fatality rate for hospitalized COVID-19 patients has ranged from 1.4 to 15%. [6] [7] [8] The incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 appears to average 5.2 days but may range from 2 to 14 days and potential asymptomatic infection has been reported. 7, 9 Of note for gastroenterologists, patients may complain of gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea or diarrhea. 7 In the prior SARS coronavirus outbreak, diarrhea was reported in up to 25% of patients. 11 Interestingly, the cell entry receptor ACE2 appears to mediate entry of SARS-CoV-2 (similar to SARS) and has been demonstrated to be highly expressed in small intestinal enterocytes. 11 ACE2 is important in controlling intestinal inflammation and its disruption may lead to diarrhea. 11 The reported frequency of diarrhea among COVID-19 patients has varied from 2 to 33% and was one of the prominent symptoms reported by the first case in the United States. 11,12 SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the stool of COVID-19 patients. 12, 13 So while COVID-19 appears to primarily spread through respiratory droplets and secretions, the gastrointestinal tract may be another potential route of infection, highlighting importance of personal protective equipment during endoscopy. Further, some of the more common laboratory findings described in COVID-19 patients include liver function test abnormalities. In addition to leukopenia (reported in 9-25% of cases) or leukocytosis (24-30%), elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase have been seen in up to 37% of cases. [7] [8] [9] More recent descriptions of patients in China also noted around 10% of patients were also noted to have elevated total bilirubin levels. 8 Gastroenterologists should be aware of these potential gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19.",35.29563536140526,14.395954210188206

General measures to prevent SARS-CoV-2 exposure and infection will be of utmost importance for these patients. Depending on the local infrastructure, implementation of COVID-19-clean wards or hospitals is warranted.

As these institutions may not be able to provide specialised hepatology-care, similar to our recommendations on outpatient care, we recommend that specialised centres provide easily accessible contact information to facilitate immediate hepatology consultations. However, due to the contagiousness of the virus, patients with underlying liver disease will become infected and will subsequently require inpatient care for COVID-19.

The impaired oxygenation caused by COVID-19 brings great challenge to the cardiopulmonary function, especially for the elderly. Comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease and COPD could greatly increase the vulnerability of elderly patients when faced with this disease. It is reasonable that these factors could predict poor outcomes. ARDS, the fundamental pathophysiology of severe viral pneumonia, could be a marker of rapid progress of the disease.

This contact induces a sequence of events involving protein adsorption; inflammatory reactions, including activation of the complement and coagulation systems; and adhesion of immunocompetent cells to the exposed surfaces. These events result in serious thromboinflammatory incompatibility reactions targeting the implanted materials [1, 2] . For example, for hemodialysis patients, the risk of myocardial infarction is 5-10 times higher than for healthy individuals. Chronic whole-body inflammation triggered by hemodialysis likely contributes to arteriosclerosis in uremic patients and is associated with a significantly decreased life expectancy. Also, CPB and ECMO procedures, which have increased over the past decade as a result of vascular bypass surgery and long-lasting infections affecting the lungs (e.g., swine influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS), are associated with side effects related to contact between blood and material surfaces that result in cellular and humoral defence reactions known as the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).

Methods A prospective analysis was performed on 11 patients admitted to the ICU of a tertiary referral center (Careggi Teaching Hospital, Florence, Italy). All patients underwent daily RT-PCR monitoring on pharyngeal swab, subglottic aspiration, and bronchoalveolar lavage. All patients were treated with oral administration of oseltamivir (75 mg twice daily) and inhaled zanamivir (10 mg twice daily) since ICU admission. Six patients were treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) due to their critical respiratory conditions. Two of them resulted co-infected by legionella pneumophila. Results As shown in Figure 1 , RT-PCR from pharyngeal swab at ICU admission failed to demonstrate the viral infection in four patients, whereas RT-PCR from bronchoalveolar lavage had a sensibility of 100%. Similarly, the time course showed that RT-PCR from pharyngeal swab resulted negative in an average time of 3 days after therapy start, while RT-PCRs from bronchoalveolar lavage continued to permit infection monitoring and therapy regimen conduction. None of RT-PCRs on subglottic aspiration samples resulted positive. All patients recovered and were discharged alive from ICU in spontaneous breathing.",31.707107072452168,14.0936512727368

Anti-rheumatic drugs as possible therapies: antimalarials, anti-IL6, anti-IL1 and baricitinib Some drugs usually used in rheumatologic field and targeting the host and its immune response seem to have the potential to interfere with CoViD-19 infection and their potential benefit is being studied in patients (Fig. 1) . The pathogenesis of CoViD-19 remains unclear, but modelling assays revealed a high degree of homology in the receptor binding domains between SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV. All coronaviruses express a surface glycoprotein termed a ""spike"" which bind to the host receptor for viral entry that has been identified as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors (ACE2r) [1] , expressed by mature lung epithelial cells, enterocytes, kidney proximal tubular cells and endothelial cells [6] . After receptor binding, lysosomal proteases cleave the spike protein releasing the signal peptide that facilitates viral entry into the cell [7] . These mechanisms may be targeted and interrupted by therapies such as chloroquine, an antimalarial drug, and preliminary data demonstrate that it may have clinical benefit in the management of CoViD-19 infected patients as determined by improved imaging and shortening of the diseases course [8] . We should note that hydroxychloroquine, which shares the same mechanism of action as chloroquine but has a better safety profile and is frequently used particularly in connective tissue disease, has a more potent anti-viral effect than chloroquine in vitro. From the results of physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models, a loading dose of 800 mg orally followed by 400 mg daily for four days reaches three times the potency of chloroquine and is therefore a promising drug for both the prevention and the treatment of CoViD-19, with low risk of toxicity [9] . These findings have led to several clinical trials that are ongoing to study the efficacy of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in CoViD-19 patients. Hydroxychloroquine is thus being used in Italy for the treatment of CoViD-19 patients despite the absence of efficacy data in the clinical setting. In light of these data, the recommendation for rheumatic patients chronically taking antimalarial drugs is to not discontinue them, considering the antiviral efficacy and the immunomodulatory rather than immunosuppressive effect.",32.62918446147193,12.220377466969811

All of the pregnant patients in one study and 66.7% of pregnant COVID-19 patients had C-section, moreover all the newborn survived [5, 6] . However, 4 of 9 (44%) pregnant COVID-19 patients had premature delivery [5] . In a previous study of MERS-CoV, there were 11 pregnant women [7] . A comparison between MERS-CoV and COVID-19 cases in pregnancy is shown in Table 1 . There was no difference in the age group of the patients, however, the gestational age was lower among MERS-CoV than COVID-19 patients. Of the MERS-CoV cases in pregnancy, 63.6% required intensive care unit admission and this is comparable to 50% of SARS pregnant women [8] . There was no mention about the death rate among pregnant women with COVID-19, however, the case fatality rate among MERS-pregnant patients was about 35% and was not statistically different when compared to the overall MERS case fatality rate [7] . In the MERS cases, 40% had C-section and this is much lower than 100% C-section rate in the case of COVID-19. This difference may reflect a variance in the practices between different countries. Another difference is the high fetal demise rate of 30% among pregnant women with MERS compared to 0% among COVID-19. The fetal demise rate among 12 pregnant women with SARS was 25% [8] . Thus, similar to the difference in the clinical presentation and course among SARS, MERS-CoV and COVID-19, there is also differences in the outcome and course of pregnant women with these coronaviruses' infection. Understanding the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy and outcome would guide healthcare authorities and public health on further risk mitigation and advise for pregnant women around the world.

Moderate to severe ARDS cases (PaO 2 :FiO 2 < 150 mmHg) are candidates for early prone positioning [33] and early neuromuscular blockade for 48 h [34] . Proning is recommended within 36 h of ARDS onset for at least 16 h, since this approach was associated with reduced mortality compared with managing patients in the supine position [33] . A 48-h infusion of intravenous cisatracurium within 48 h of ARDS onset has also been associated with reduced mortality compared with placebo [34] . Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is an option for patients with refractory hypoxemia [35, 36] , and has been successfully used in young patients with severe H1N1 influenza with refractory hypoxemia [36] as well as in MERS-CoV patients [11] . Systematic corticosteroids should generally be avoided unless indicated for other established reasons [30] . The effect of corticosteroids on the outcome of MERS-CoV patients is unknown; however, corticosteroid use has been associated with increased morbidity in patients with SARS-CoV and severe influenza [37, 38] . High-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and highfrequency oscillatory ventilation should probably be avoided or used with caution in MERS patients because of the potential to generate aerosols and lack of effectiveness in patients with ARDS [39] .

In this context, the promising findings of several studies have highlighted the growing role of chest computed tomography (CT) scan for identifying the typical findings of suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection.

More than 62% of patients (224 out of 359) had mixed pattern opacities in their CT, which was a combination of consolidation, ground glass opacities, and reticular opacities.

Mass Casualty Incident Planning","In late December 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) was announced in Wuhan, China 3 . Although rigorous attempts were made to confine the disease, this infection has continued to spread throughout the world. At the date of this publication, there are confirmed COVID-19 cases in 162 countries worldwide with growing concern that the infection will quickly reach pandemic proportions. As per Bruce Aylward, head of a World Health Organization (WHO) expert mission to China, the world is ""simply not ready"" to contain this outbreak. 4 China's extraordinary measure of instituting a quarantine in Wuhan and surrounding areas afforded the world a few months of lead time to prepare. However, according to the Dr. Tom Frieden who is the former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a coronavirus pandemic is inevitable. 5 The number of confirmed cases and patient deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have already exceeded those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS). 6 Healthcare systems worldwide should be prepared for an unusually high volume of patients in the next few months. This will include patients with COVID-19 in addition to patients requiring emergent care for other illnesses. Rapid diagnosis is essential for efficient patient triage. The RT-PCR test kits disseminated by the CDC are considered the gold of standard for COVID-19 diagnosis 7 , but several studies have shown that a negative initial PCR does not exclude COVID-19 infection 8, 9 . Additionally, it may take up to 48 hours to receive the final results, which limits the utility of this diagnostic test during initial triage of these patients in the emergency setting. In a recent study published in Radiology, based on a retrospective study of 1014 patients, the diagnostic sensitivity of chest CT for COVID-19 is significantly greater than that of RT-PCR (98% vs 59%), but the specificity is limited (25%) 7 . Proposed explanations for the decreased sensitivity of RT-PCR include low viral load, immature development of RT-PCR technology, and suboptimal clinical sampling. This study concluded that chest CT can be used as a screening tool for COVID-19 in cases with a high pretest probability, as evidenced by patients demonstrating clinical manifestations compatible with COVID-19 infection. Therefore, it is expected that there will be a significant interest in increasing in the number of imaging studies ordered for suspected cases of COVID-19 from both Emergency Medicine Department and Inpatient services. Given the low specificity of CT for diagnosing COVID-19, the American College of Radiology (ACR) does not recommend the use of CT for screening or as a first-line test for diagnosing COVID-19. 10",28.737128887850766,13.247105264661265

First, for patients admitted to the ICU, death might occur despite full intensive care support, including mechanical ventilation, ECMO, vasopressors, and renal replacement therapy. On modern ICUs, such deaths are expected to be infrequent; however, robust estimates of the number of deaths cannot be made from the mostly descriptive reports currently available. A second possible scenario for ICU and hospital patients is related to limitation of life-sustaining therapies because of poor predicted outcomes associated with old age, frailty, comorbidities, or profound disability, or because of effects of distributive limitations associated with lack of personnel, beds, or materials. A combination of these two factors often exists. A third scenario relates to patients admitted to the ICU or hospital whose deaths are not directly related to COVID-19. Especially in areas with high infection rates, patients might be admitted to the ICU with, for example, severe trauma or acute brain injury, test positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the ICU stay, and eventually die because of the initial injury; these deaths will still be attributed to COVID-19 and included in the statistics. Similarly, some patients might have SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the actual contribution of the virus to the patient's death might be minimal. For example, in a patient with metastatic cancer or terminal organ failure, is the viral infection or the patient's underlying condition the cause of death? The actual role of SARS-CoV-2 infection in such deaths is particularly difficult to evaluate in countries where only one cause can be reported on a death certificate.",38.341317122803076,13.915329359192729

It is mandatory, especially in a finite resource system, to balance the potential benefit of containment measures, such as postponing scheduled procedures, with negative health and social costs. Diverting the attention exclusively to the COVID-19 situation and overshadowing the everyday clinical practice may have substantial negative implications, especially for cancer patients. Re-allocating an excessive amount of health care personnel, both nurses and doctors, to the COVID-19 triage and management may stretch an already fragile system and potentially leave uncovered some vital activities, such as treatment administration, surgeries and inpatient assistance. It is well established that delayed oncologic surgery may lead to disease progressions and result in tumors no longer resectable, leading to worse survival outcomes. The same goes for neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy regimens administered with suboptimal timing. It should be emphasized that we are talking about patients potentially cured by oncologic treatments. Therefore, any delay of these fundamental procedures, either intentional or due to shortage of personnel, should be avoided. The same risk is present for the people who have scheduled screening activities (e.g. screening mammography for the early diagnosis of breast cancer). People should be advised to maintain their scheduled appointments, if the procedure is feasible safely, or at least to promptly reschedule their appointment when the epidemic is expected to slow its pace. For patients with advanced disease, as oncologists we know the enormous negative impact from disease progression in terms of both survival time and quality of life. The inability to deliver palliative care to patients unable to move from their homes and the management of treatment side-effects are other significant concerns from a forced quarantine. 5 Patients with advanced disease, and no suggestive symptoms of COVID-19, should keep receiving planned chemotherapy or radiotherapy treatment, without unnecessary delays. Moreover, although postponing follow-up and cancer prevention appointments is a strategy to be considered, an excessive accumulation of visits or examinations risks burdening the national public health system over the next few months.",29.849280251978783,11.937936230373015

The only way to control this disease is to cut-off the route of transmission. After the confirmation of human-to-human transmission, the Wuhan Municipal Government announced travel restrictions in Wuhan, and population migration in Hubei Province continues to be monitored. The entire country is actively trying to prevent the spread of the epidemic. At the beginning of the epidemic, there were insufficient hospital beds for the patients in Wuhan, and a large number of patients were required to self-isolate at home. However, patients with COVID-19 under home isolation will transmit the virus to other people in the house via human-to-human transmission.

In such a scenario, differentiating whether the cause of death is specifically due to COVID-19 or the result of treatment limitations can be difficult. Among patients who die before reaching the hospital, some will present too late in the course of the disease to be saved, whereas end-of-life care will be viewed as preferable for others because little chance of survival with a meaningful quality of life exists. In some patients, this decision might be influenced by known individual preferences. Similarly, not all critically ill patients in hospital will be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), because the chances of meaningful survival for some will be viewed as too low; 8 for these patients, non-invasive ventilation and perhaps even some vasopressor support could be provided in so-called middle care units, but in case of further deterioration, mechanical ventilation will not be considered and death will occur because of severe hypoxaemia. As noted by Phua and colleagues, 1 a quarter of patients who died early in the Wuhan, China, outbreak did not receive invasive ventilation. 9 Patients who deteriorate despite mechanical ventilation can be placed on resource-intensive ECMO systems (figure). 10 The decision not to use ECMO might be made because the support system is not available or because such care is considered to be disproportionate in the context of limited staff numbers. The same considerations might apply to patients who develop renal failure.

During the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic, inadequate surge capacity highlighted the need for intensive-care reserves and improved health-care resource planning at all levels. 17, 18 In an effort to improve ECMO preparedness 19 for an outbreak of an emerging infectious disease, we highlight the ten key components of an ECMO action plan (panel) based on these four categories, with practical recommendations for health centres to ensure appropriate training, capacity, and planning, depending on local priorities and resources. The focus is on building sustainable systems that ensure quality care for patients and their families and staff safety and wellbeing. Details on the organisation of ECMO programmes have been reported elsewhere. 20, 21 WHO interim guidelines recommend offering extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to eligible patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The number of patients with COVID-19 infection who might develop severe ARDS that is refractory to maximal medical management and require this level of support is currently unknown. Available evidence from similar patient populations suggests that carefully selected patients with severe ARDS who do not benefit from conventional treatment might be successfully supported with venovenous ECMO. The need for ECMO is relatively low and its use is mostly restricted to specialised centres globally. Providing complex therapies such as ECMO during outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases has unique challenges. Careful planning, judicious resource allocation, and training of personnel to provide complex therapeutic interventions while adhering to strict infection control measures are all crucial components of an ECMO action plan. ECMO can be initiated in specialist centres, or patients can receive ECMO during transportation from a centre that is not specialised for this procedure to an expert ECMO centre. Ensuring that systems enable safe and coordinated movement of critically ill patients, staff, and equipment is important to improve ECMO access. ECMO preparedness for the COVID-19 pandemic is important in view of the high transmission rate of the virus and respiratory-related mortality.",55.283103002824305,24.032453470231363

Such global outbreaks demand a strategic global response. Given the propensity of these emerging infections to rapidly cause severe respiratory failure in many patients and, in the case of COVID-19, the high transmission rate of the virus and unclear overall case-fatality rate, the critical care response should be part of a larger pandemic plan to reduce transmission and prevent deaths. These preparations for the COVID-19 outbreak should involve the provision of ECMO in sufficiently resourced settings. Careful patient selection for ECMO is needed because patient age and comorbidities appear to influence outcomes in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Moreover, several variables, such as reversibility of the pulmonary disease process, risk of secondary pulmonary infections, and the role of antiviral drugs and other disease-modifying factors, might affect outcomes with ECMO.

This procedure might avoid the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation because it provides high concentrations of humidified oxygen, low levels of positive endexpiratory pressure, and can facilitate the elimination of carbon dioxide. 4 WHO guidelines support the use of high-flow nasal oxygen in some patients, but they urge close monitoring for clinical deterioration that could result in the need for emergent intubations because such procedures might increase the risk of infection to health-care workers. 5 For patients with COVID-19 who require endotracheal intubation, use of low tidal volume (6 mL/kg per predicted bodyweight) with a plateau airway pressure of less than 30 cm H 2 O, and increasing the respiratory rate to 35 breaths per min as needed, is the mainstay of lungprotective ventilation. If the hypoxaemia progresses to a PaO 2 :FiO 2 ratio of less than 100-150 mm Hg, there are several therapeutic options. The level of positive endexpiratory pressure can be increased by 2-3 cm H 2 O every 15-30 min to improve oxygen saturation to 88-90%, with the goal of maintaining a plateau airway pressure of less than 30 cm H 2 O. Lower driving pressures (plateau airway pressure minus positive end-expiratory pressure) with a target of 13-15 cm H 2 O can also be used. If the patient is not responding to adjustment of the level of positive end-expiratory pressure, additional strategies might stabilise them. Recruitment manoeuvres probably have little value, 6 prone positioning should be instituted, unless there is a specific contraindication, and can be initiated along with the interventions already described. For persistent refractory hypoxaemia even with prone positioning, neuromuscular blockade, and efforts to optimise positive end-expiratory pressure therapy, there are additional options. Inhaled 5-20 ppm NO might improve oxygenation. Insertion of an oesophageal balloon to measure transpulmonary pressures to set an optimal positive end-expiratory pressure can be considered in patients with moderate-to-severe obesity, although a 2019 trial in patients with ARDS did not show the benefit of this procedure in most patients. 7 Fluid management is important to consider as a measure to reduce pulmonary oedema. 8 In the absence of shock, fluid conservative therapy is recommended to achieve a negative fluid balance of 0·5 to 1·0 L per day. In the presence of shock, fluid balance might be achieved with renal replacement therapy, especially if there is associated acute kidney injury and oliguria. Antibiotics should be considered since secondary bacterial infections have been reported in patients with COVID-19. 9 Glucocorticoids should be avoided in view of the evidence that they can be harmful in cases of viral pneumonia and ARDS from influenza. 10 Rescue therapy with high-dose vitamin C can also be considered. 11 Finally, ECMO should be considered using the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the EOLIA trial. 3 Since treatment of severe ARDS from COVID-19 is an ongoing challenge, it is important to learn from the patients who have been treated to gain an understanding of the disease's epidemiology, biological mechanisms, and the effects of new pharmacological interventions. Currently, there are some research groups working to coordinate and disseminate key information, including information on patients who have been treated with ECMO for COVID-19, although an accurate estimate of the number of such patients is not currently available.

Some studies suggest a high rate of AKI events upon COVID-19 infection, whereas a recent study from Wuhan, China, reported that AKI happened in <5% of the hospitalized patients with this viral infection. 11 As more studies are underway, it is prudent that during an active COVID-19 we ensure the mitigation of PEW risk and immediate correction of PEW in all patients with kidney diseases including transplant recipients. We encourage adequate protein and calorie intake, be it enterally or parenterally, so that any occurrence of hypokalemia or hypophosphatemia can be avoided and that PEW, sarcopenia and cachexia can be prevented or immediately corrected. 12 In the midst of this serious infection there is no role for delaying nutrition support or for low protein, low phosphorus, or low potassium regimens if the patient has COVID-19 infection. 13 Therefore, the need to supervise the nutrition regimens of patients with kidney diseases may be enhanced during this period and should not be ignored while focusing on other, seemingly more urgent, matters.

[3] Since 2002 there have been two other global outbreaks of highly-pathogenic coronaviruses: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). While SARS and MERS are not identical to SARS-CoV-2 in their genetic structures or clinical manifestations, the recent outbreaks of these viruses may provide insights on the effects of COVID-19 in the context of pregnancy. The literature on SARS and MERS in pregnancy are limited to a handful of case reports and series. [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] Many of these cases involved severe morbidity including the need for intensive care and cardiorespiratory support. Notably, there were cases of maternal mortality associated with SARS and MERS infection. The only published case-control study showed that pregnant women with SARS experienced worse outcomes than nonpregnant women of similar age. [10] Reports varied with respect to the effects of SARS and MERS on pregnancy outcomes. Spontaneous abortion has been reported among women infected with SARS and MERS in the first trimester.4 As well, stillbirth, intrauterine growth restriction, and preterm birth have been reported in pregnancies affected by SARS and MERS in the second and third trimesters. [4, 9] It is important to note, however, that a number of pregnancies had good outcomes despite maternal infection with SARS or MERS. [6, 7, 8] Broadly speaking, and drawing upon our knowledge of other respiratory illnesses in pregnancy, adverse It remains to be seen whether the effects of COVID-19 on pregnant women and their fetuses will be similar to those of SARS and MERS. To date, the reported case-fatality rate for the general population infected with COVID-19 is lower than that of either SARS or MERS (estimated at 1%-2% vs. 9%-10% and 35%-40%, respectively). Similarly, by now, there have been over 60 cases of pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 in China and the vast majority of these women have had mild to moderate pneumonia. [11, 12, 13, 14] To date here has been one case of severe maternal morbidity secondary to COVID-19 reported. [12] This 31-year-old woman was infected at 34 weeks gestation and went on to experience severe respiratory compromise and multi-organ dysfunction requiring extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The pregnancy outcomes of the reported cases have been largely good, [11, 12, 13] with spontaneous and iatrogenic preterm labour being the most commonly reported adverse pregnancy outcomes. One stillbirth has been reported and this occurred in the case of severe maternal illness reported by Liu et al. [12] Given the limited data, it is too early to determine if higher rates of adverse outcomes are expected in pregnant women infected with COVID-19. As with SARS and MERS, pregnancy outcomes are likely to be strongly correlated with degree of maternal illness. [12] There has been no evidence of vertical (mother-to-infant) transmission found in any cases of SARS, MERS, or COVID-19. Additionally, analyses of amniotic fluid, serum, placenta, and breastmilk from pregnant women confirmed to have SARS or COVID-19 infection have found no detectable viral RNA, [8, 13] further supporting that vertical transmission is unlikely. Importantly, maternal infection with SARS, MERS, or COVID-19 has not been associated with teratogenicity. However, because of the small number of reported cases of infection during the first trimester (when embryogenesis occurs), risk of congenital anomaly associated with COVID-19 cannot be completely excluded.",41.57577841364053,16.038487382818733

There was no evidence of new onset atrioventricular block in COVID-19 patients and no arrhythmic cardiac death during hospitalization. Nevertheless, a previous report in 138 COVID-19 patients showed that common complications included arrhythmias in 16.7% of cases and acute cardiac injury in 7.2% [2] . This was confirmed in another recent report in 187 patients with COVID-19 demonstrating malignant arrhythmias in 11.5% of patients with increased troponin [4] . In this study the upper reference limit of troponin I was 0.12 ng/mL. The same authors demonstrate that even if functional and morphological cardiac abnormalities were infrequent with increased troponin levels had a significant hazard ratio of 8.9 (95% confidence interval 1.9-40.6) for the risk of death, as reported by others [4, 5] . Of note, in accordance with a similar report, troponin I was not elevated at the beginning of the infection while in patients with severe clinical conditions tended to increase [10] . This finding suggests that troponin I is mainly a marker of multiorgan failure and pulmonary hypertension associated with ARDS more than a marker that identifies patients with acute myocarditis. Finally, the Authors conclude that elevation of troponin during hospitalization is an important marker of prognosis and should be seen as a warning sign even if not generally increased at the beginning of hospitalization. The observation that troponin levels at the beginning of hospitalization cannot differentiate between survivors and non-survivors is also in line with a previous publication [10] . The study by Deng et al. [9] does not support to perform routine echocardiogram in all patients with COVID-19, but it should be considered in those with raised troponin. Several reports suggest that increased troponin levels in the emergency department could identify patients at higher risk for acute myocarditis triggered by SARS-CoV-2 [7, 8] . Identification of these patients would be important clinically since they often present with atypical symptoms such as chest pain and minimal respiratory involvement [7, 8] . Acute myocarditis, in addition to acute coagulopathy, could explain cases of sudden cardiac death observed during quarantine among COVID-19 patients not admitted to hospital [4] .",35.02166774377234,13.371956839926565

However, it is important to emphasize that the number of COVID-19 patients experiencing diarrhea is significant and cannot be overlooked. We found high variability among published studies in the percentage of patients with diarrhea, ranging from 2% to 50% of cases. Our pooled analysis of the available data revealed an overall diarrhea rate of about 10% in COVID-19 patients. This value is lower than the percentage of diarrhea reported with other coronaviruses 40,44 , but it is very possible that the available data may underestimate the burden of diarrhea associated with COVID-19 61 It was estimated that around 86% of the infections were not documented and that patients with undocumented cases led to the contagion of most of the identified patients (79%) 65 . SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but it is transmitted faster than its predecessors and for this reason a rapid and optimal diagnostic approach is essential to contain the virus dissemination 66 . The evidence of SARS-CoV-2 in the stools and in gastrointestinal histological samples and its prolongedpersistence at the stool compared to nasopharyngeal swabs strongly suggests that orofecal transmission is possible, justifying the execution of fecal PCR in suspect patients 27 . The homology between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and the high capacity of these viruses to resist for long periods (even two weeks) at low temperatures and for a few days at temperatures between 20°C and 30 °C is a further confirmation of possible orofecal tranmission and requires an enhancement of preventive hygiene measures 67 .",33.945736573934774,14.317520086348132

One study showed that patients infected with COVID-19 who had underlying hypertension had increased odds of death (OR 3.05 [95% CI 1.57-5.92, p b .001]) compared to those without hypertension.

The symptom of dyspnea and pulmonary imaging (Supplementary Figure S1A ) developed and progressively worsened in the following 30 days of hospitalization. Finally, trachea intubation and vein-to-vein extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) were employed in order to maintain optimal PaO2. The ECMO was withdrawn five days later when the patient became stabilized. The patient's ECG revealed dynamic changes when her clinical state was unstable. The baseline ECG shows sinus rhythm with a first-degree atrioventricular block (AVB) (Fig. 1A) . On the day of the trachea intubation, the ECG recording showed sinus tachycardia with SITIIIQIII morphology (Fig. 1B) . A simultaneous echocardiogram revealed an enlarged right atrium and right ventricle accompanied by severe tricuspid regurgitation, which could result from the elevated pulmonary artery pressure. Mobitz type I second-degree AVB and atrioventricular junctional escape beat were recorded (Fig. 1C ) the same day. On the following day, temporary nearly complete AVB (or high-grade AVB) developed (Fig. 1D ). Soon after, the ECG showed a recovery to first-degree AVB, and the SITIIIQIII disappeared ( Fig 1F) . Case 2 A 70-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of COVID-19. He had a previous history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Despite of therapy, lesions in both lungs increased (see Supplementary Figure S1B ) and hypoxemia got worsen. On the fourteenth day of hospitalization, trachea intubation was required to maintain optimal oxygenation. The patient's first ECG recording showed basic rhythm of sinus tachycardia with an incomplete right bundle branch block (RBBB) ( Fig. 2A) . On the 34 th day of hospitalization, the patient developed severe hypoxia and VV-ECMO was employed. However, the patient's oxygenation had not significantly improved and severe hypotension ensued. Artery blood gas showed a critically low PaO2 level of 57.3 mmHg and lactic acidosis (Lac 10.8mmol/L). The day after VV-ECMO incubation, the patient's ECG demonstrated ST segment elevations in inferior and precordial leads (Fig 2B) and the amplitude of ST elevation was gradually increasing to form a triangular QRS-ST-T waveform (Fig. 2E) . During the evolution of ST elevation, two episodes of multifocal ventricular tachycardia developed (Figs. 2C and 2D) . Lidocaine was administered and sinus rhythm was restored. Simultaneous blood chemical tests showed positive cardiac troponin I (cTnI), elevated creatine kinase (CK) of 900.9U/L (normal range 10-190 U/L), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) of 72.6U/L (normal range 0-24 U/L), and significantly increase of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) up to 24245pg/ml (normal range<900). The echocardiogram revealed diffuse hypokinesis, especially in the anterior and inferior walls. The patient died within 24 hours of the occurrence of ventricular tachycardia and ST elevation. Discussion It is reported that acute cardiac injury is not uncommon in patients with COVID-19 1, 2 . The percentage of COVID-19 patients with myocardial injury has been reported variously at 12% 1 and 7.2% 2 , which is much higher in critically ill patients in these two study. As seen in our report, the abnormal ECG changes were recorded during the critical condition of these two cases. There were several possible mechanisms. Firstly, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as a functional receptor for coronaviruses 3 , which is highly expressed in the heart and lungs. Therefore, ACE2-related signaling pathways might have played a role in cardiac injury. Secondly, hypoxemia caused by COVID-19 may cause damage to myocardial cells. Thirdly, the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders may be important factors 4 .

Treatments to date consist of mechanical ventilation, surfactant therapy, inhaled NO, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) ECMO, and VEGF administration with variable success. A hypoplastic lung has reduced lung weight, fewer generations of airways resulting in fewer alveoli, poor epithelial cell differentiation and surfactant deficiency, along with hypoplasia of the corresponding pulmonary arteries. Hence, this represents an ideal environment to introduce stem cell therapy, albeit with the advantages and challenges as described by Dr. Polak. Dr. Finck summarized what is known of how the lung is derived from definitive endoderm and how attempts to devise a protocol to recapitulate the critical induction events of the early embryo (e.g., Wnt, TGFb, Activin-A) have been used to induce pluripotent cells to become definitive endoderm (530, 564) . In a comparison of seeding methods, it was shown that if ESCs are first allowed to become embryoid bodies (EBs) before seeding onto collagen IV coated plates, only cells that migrated away from the EBs expressed Gata4 whereas cells within the EBs retained expression of Oct4 (486) . In contrast, ESCs plated as disaggregated cells on collagen-IV coated plates expressed Gata4 uniformly and no Oct4 (i.e., more directed differentiation). To further direct differentiation of derived endoderm, the Finck lab developed and optimized a 2-step protocol (537) in which ESCs are first incubated in media containing Activin-A and Wnt3a (6 days, single-cell suspension on collage-IV coated plates) as was similarly shown for derivation of hepatic endoderm (564, 565) . Importantly for the lung, using 50 ng/ml Activin A with 1 ng/ml Wnt3a, which is important in migration of epiblast cells though the primitive streak in embryogenesis, gave rise to the highest number of cells expressing the definitive endoderm markers Sox17 and FoxA2 and lowered the expression of the visceral endoderm marker HNF4 (qRT-PCR). Increasing the dose of Activin above 50 ng/ml resulted in more cells but not a greater proportion of FoxA2 1 cells. Cells expressing E-cadherin and cytokeratin were seen by immunofluorescent staining after a 5-day induction with optimal concentrations of Activin A and Wnt3a.",32.106541855391335,11.150527089227998

They follow the regulations of local and national government, and provide prescription medications dispensing service and other pharmacy-related services. Retail pharmacies in China provide some prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, supplements, and health-related products and devices for sale. They are not considered part of the healthcare system as they practice follow different companies' regulations. The professional skills of pharmacy staff and pharmacists work in these retail pharmacies varies significantly, and are generally not considered as healthcare professionals. 4 Special needs of PC services during the COVID-19 pandemic During the COVID-19 pandemic, the need of PC services is beyond the scope of traditional practice of community pharmacists, which can be divided into two parts: the need of pandemic prevention and control and the need from patients of pharmacy-related issues. To promote the pandemic control, community patients need to be screened properly and suspected patients shall be referred to designated medical institutions in a timely manner. 5 The public also need to master effective personal protection skills to control the community transmission of COVID-19. 2,6,7 Patients on medical isolated observation or patients with mild COVID-19 on treatment at home are lacking guidance on home care strategies. 8 The pharmacy-related needs of community patients have similarities with the traditional patient population, but with different emphasis. For example, when providing consulting services to community patients, instead of focusing on medications as usual, their questions are mainly on the scientific prevention knowledge and basic information about COVID-19, such as mask selection and typical signs and symptoms of COVID-19. For chronic disease patients, especially those in communities under quarantine, drug supply and patients' compliance are facing a greater challenge, though the safety and effectiveness of treatment is also important for this patient population. Thus, community pharmacists shall learn to switch gears when needed from providing professional knowledge on medication use only to fulfilling community patients' various needs.",32.09394851880699,13.100255984515949

Nurses from other departments were required to go through three training stages before starting nursing duties for patients with COVID-19: pre-job training, adaptive training by nursing other patients in the infection department, and negative pressure ward training. This process occupied about one week. Nurses who entered the negative pressure ward would work for 0.5 -3 months before being transferred to other non-anti-epidemic positions. Because COVID-19 is a new disease and the medical system and culture of different countries varies, further research is needed on the psychological experience of frontline nurses fighting against COVID-19. Currently, published studies have highlighted the disease prevalence [17] , clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and treatment [2] . Some reports have paid attention to the severity of psychological problems in medical personnel [18] and the urgency of providing psychological care [19] .

Perspectives from Bergamo Neurosurgery Department,"We describe, with this report, the shocking effect of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak on the Department of Neurosurgery of Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital in Bergamo, which represents at the moment, the most affected city in the entire Italian territory (Figure 1 ). 1 This epidemic is challenging the Italian Government and the Healthcare System and is having a devastating impact on all the health activities, without excluding the neurosurgical reality. The first known contagion from SARS-CoV-2, causing Coronavirus Disease 2019 , was reported on February 21, in the small town of Codogno, in Lombardy. On the same day, the fist death from COVID-19 happened in Padua, and the second occurred on February 22 in Lombardy. 2 The consequent infection chain led the Italian Council of Ministers to publish a decree prohibiting the transit in and out of the outbreak areas (the so-called red areas), suspending all the public events, and introducing the quarantine for all the infected citizens, (Figure 2A ). The first cases in Bergamo were identified on February 23. Since then, the virus spread exponentially in Northern Italy, and afterwards throughout the state. Lombard hospitals were gradually overcrowded by patients with COVID-19. 3 On March 8, in an attempt to contain the epidemic, a decree of the Italian Prime Minister extended the red areas to the entire Lombardy and to other 14 Italian provinces ( Figure 2B ). This act was implemented the day after, when the whole of Italy became a red area ( Figure  2C ); 4 this was globally launched by the Government itself even in social networks, with the hashtag #iorestoacasa (#istayhome). In so doing, the movement of people throughout the country was reduced, all sports events were suspended, and teaching activities in schools and universities were stopped until April 3. By March 11, only basic shops were left open. Up to today (March 20), the total SARS-CoV-2 positive patients are 47.021, making Italy the second state with the most confirmed infections, after China. Italian death toll had recently surpassed China, becoming the country with the highest COVID-19-related mortality worldwide. 5 Bergamo is currently the most plagued Italian city and Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital is the largest health care center in the city. It comprises 1,080 beds, 83 of which are in critical care beds (53 of Intensive and 30 Subintensive Care beds). It is designed with a central area (which includes laboratories, diagnostic services, the Emergency Department, 32 operating rooms) and 7 towers all around it, each of which harbors different medical specialties. It also includes a 24-hour heliport and 280 outpatient clinics. The Hospital is home to one of the six highly specialized Trauma Centers identified by the Lombard Trauma Management Network in 2012. Moreover, it is the only Pediatric Trauma Center in the Region. The Department of Neurosurgery is one of the Hospital flagships. The neurosurgical catchment area covers nearly 1.200.000 citizens. Ten attending neurosurgeons and three residents work in the Department. There is a neurosurgeon on call 24-hours-a-day. Neurosurgical Ward includes 34 beds and another 16 beds in the dedicated Neurointensive care unit. Two operating theaters, offering 17 weekly surgical interventions, are available. In 2019, we completed 1360 surgical procedures (305 major cranial, 285 minor cranial, 191 major spinal, 483 minor spinal), including 260 urgencies, 70 pediatric procedures, and 3.630 outpatient visits were performed. 6 This solid infrastructure underwent important changes in the last two months, in accordance with the evolving COVID-19 pandemic Since the last days of February, there was a massive increase of COVID-19 cases in Bergamo, and a large number of patients overloaded the Emergency Room. Initially, they were kept in the Emergency Department or admitted to the Department of Infectious Diseases. When the situation worsened further, it was necessary to activate supplementary emergency responses, which resulted in a profound reorganization of all sectors, including Neurosurgery. Many wards were closed and many other were reconverted to COVID-facilities, according to the Hospital Health Direction. On February 24, all hospitalizations for elective surgical procedures were stopped. On March 6, the Gastroenterology Department was converted to a ""Gastro-COVID"" unit; after two days the ""Pneumo-COVID"" was created, and on March 10 the Department of Neurology became the ""Neuro-COVID"". Lastly, the Department of Hematology was transformed into the ""Hemato-COVID"" on March 17. New intensive care areas were created, taking mechanical ventilators from the dismissed operating rooms. Inside the so-called ""COVID-Towers"", 400 total beds have been established for COVID-19 patients, and 92 additional beds in the Intensive Care Units. All units are currently saturated. Four intensive positions are available for cardiac emergencies or pediatric trauma. In the Emergency Department, 42 beds are at disposal, and 4 others advanced stations are located in the Shock Room. In order to streamline the constant flow of people, the triage system was extended even in the parking space. The actual number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients stands to 538 (442 in hospital ward and 96 in intensive care units), which represent the 49.8% of the Hospital total capacity. At the moment, it is not possible to increase this quantity for the lack of workers, and the critical issues associated with COVID-19 infected hospital staff. Moreover, there exists a significant deficiency of personal protective equipment, medications (i.e. antiviral drugs, antibiotics), medical devices and even oxygen. The opening of these special areas required the recruitment of medical and nursing staff (even without specific skills) in treating pulmonary or infectious diseases, taken from both local medical and surgical Departments. 7 On March 6, 25% of the neurosurgical staff was assigned to COVID-towers; this percentage arose to 50% on March 13, and to 75% since March 20. This deficit was accompanied by a concomitant overall reduction of neurosurgical activities. Hospitalized patients were gradually discharged, and the Department of Neurosurgery was closed on March 12. On call duty 24/7 was also terminated, and our last patients were moved to a new temporary Ward of ten beds, in common with orthopedic surgeons and otolaryngologists. Outpatient visits were unaffected until March 6, at which time they were reduced to a weekly session for urgencies and another one for cerebral and spinal oncological cases. Surgical activity was regular with 17 intervention per week until March 1, when seven slots were withdrawn, and only ten surgical procedures were allowed. In the week from 9 to 15 March, only four urgent operations were performed; and following 15 March, no procedures were performed. In order to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, the Regional Health System adopted different urgent containment measures. 8 On March 8, with the Decree XI/2906, 9 the Lombard Health System was reorganized and the regional neurosurgical network was concentrated in 4 Hub Hospitals: three of them for cranial or spinal emergencies, and a fourth specialized for oncological pathologies (Figure 3) . Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital remained the reference point for pediatric trauma, while all the other Lombard Departments of Neurosurgery became the Spoke of a Spoke and Hub system. In this way, Hub Hospitals were free to deal with specific medical or surgical emergencies, while Spoke Hospitals focused on COVID-19 patients. Even if in Italy the national Health Care System is mainly public, Research Hospitals and accredited private Hospitals were included in this network. As of today, no pediatric traumatic emergencies were sent to our Institution. This is significatively below the expectations, 9 and likely has resulted from legitimate curfew instituted by the government to limit contagious spread of the virus, with the unexpected advantage associated with a reduced risk of traumatic injuries. The true efficacy of this system still needs to be clarified when further data, when such becomes available. The recent literature suggests that SARS-CoV-2 spreading is still expected to propagate exponentially. 10 Therefore, the readiness of foreign Health Systems will continue to be challenged worldwide. The Italian experience has demonstrated the priceless contribution of neurosurgeons and other not-specialized physicians dealing with COVID-19, where all the available resources are needed. The world is fighting a battle with an invisible common enemy, which must be won.",27.96062789712941,11.933273384214523

In recent decades, there has been increasing evidence suggesting that ""pyroptosis"" is a novel inflammatory form of programmed cell death. In 2019, Chen et al. found that SARS-CoV Viroporin 3a triggered the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the secretion of IL-1β in bone marrow-derived macrophages, suggesting SARS-CoV induced cell pyroptosis [89] . Studies have shown that patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have increased IL-1β in the serum [26] . As the rise of IL-1β is a downstream indicator of cell pyroptosis, this may suggest that cell pyroptotic activity is likely to be activated and involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 patients. Nevertheless, as both classical and nonclassical pyroptosis signaling can induce the release of IL-1β, it is unclear which pathway is involved in COVID-19. Based on existing data, SARS-CoV-2 is likely to cause cell pyroptosis, especially in lymphocytes, through the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. The pathways involved in the activation of the signaling between NLRP3m IL-1β, IL-18 and GSDMD are illustrated in Fig. 6 and are a subject of study in samples from SARS-CoV-2 patients [90] .",28.553831553053755,10.684694036550486

A Critical Care Team Leader must be designated within the Hospital Incident Command System. A threestage ICU Evacuation Timeline, including (1) no immediate threat, (2) evacuation threat, and (3) evacuation implementation, should be used. Detailed suggestions on ICU evacuation, including regional planning, evacuation drills, patient transport preparation and equipment, patient prioritization and distribution for evacuation, patient information and tracking, and federal and international evacuation assistance systems, are also provided.

The 1979 and 1994 trials 2,3 did not include a lung-protective ventilation strategy for patients in their control groups because they were done before publication of the US National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's ARDS Network-sponsored trial, 6 which was published in 2000 and showed a major reduction in mortality with a low tidal volume and plateau pressure limited ventilation strategy. Since then, CESAR, the venovenous ECMO trial 4 that was published in 2009, showed that patients who were transferred to a centre that could institute ECMO had significantly lower mortality and severe disability at 6 months than those who were not transferred to an ECMO centre. However, the result was not definitive because only some of the patients referred to the ECMO centre received ECMO, and there was no evidence that patients in the control group received lung-protective ventilation. In the most recent trial, EOLIA, 5 which was published in 2018, 60-day mortality was numerically lower in the venovenous ECMO group (35%) than in the control group (46%), in which patients received lung-protective ventilation, but Dr Barry Slaven/SPL this difference was not significant (p=0·09). For several secondary endpoints, however, ECMO was significantly better than the control group, including more days alive and free of the need for vasopressor therapy, renal replacement therapy, or prone positioning to treat their respiratory failure. 5 The decision to stop the EOLIA trial for futility after enrolment of 249 patients, before the planned enrolment of 331 patients, was based on methods that can decrease power for rejection of the null hypothesis, and might have led to a type 2 error. 7 The trial was powered for a 20% absolute reduction in mortality, which was probably an unrealistic goal.",44.61892695530165,18.314711375597795

It is important for clinicians to be certain they have instituted other therapies before considering ECMO, including optimal lung-protective ventilation, diuresis, and neuromuscular blockade with deep sedation, prone positioning, and possibly inhaled nitric oxide, recruitment manoeuvres, and renal replacement therapy. 11 If these therapies do not stabilise the patient, and there are no other exclusion criteria (as in the EOLIA trial), I believe that the balance of evidence favours use of ECMO in severe ARDS if available from a medical centre experienced in provision of ECMO. The EOLIA randomised controlled trial, 1 which was published in 2018, did not show a significant difference in its prespecified primary endpoint of 60-day mortality between the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) group and the control group, who received conventional mechanical ventilation. However, the large and clinically important effect size noted in the trial, 2 a post-hoc Bayesian analysis 3 of EOLIA data showing a high likelihood of survival benefit with ECMO even assuming a strongly sceptical prior distribution, and now a metaanalysis 4 published in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine by Laveena Munshi and colleagues, all suggest that ECMO is efficacious in some adult patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).",48.266595163749145,16.690045653365324

As previously reported by some Italian and Chinese colleague, many activities that are not related to COVID-19 had to be stopped in the midst of the epidemic. 8, 9 Despite this, medical staff in the ID department had to be doubled and then tripled night and day to cope with the increase of work and three teams were created: one to manage external calls, one to organise the testing of cases and one to take care of the infected patients. They first managed all the COVID-19 patients of the hospital but then had to let the other departments take care of their infected patients under the supervision of the IPC team.

Fangcang shelter hospitals leverage large-scale public venues, which, once they have been converted to serve hospital functions, result in a large increase in health-care capacity (figure 1). The built over a period of 3 weeks contained 13 000 hospitals beds (figure 4). By March 10, 2020, the 16 hospitals had provided care to about 12 000 patients. 34 In caring for and sheltering such a large number of patients who would otherwise have been confined to their homes, these shelter hospitals effectively supported China's COVID-19 policy of leaving no patient unattended or untreated. 35 The third characteristic is the low cost of building and running Fangcang shelter hospitals. Investment costs are low because converting public venues into health-care facilities avoids costly construction of new physical infrastructure. Equally, once the epidemic has subsided, the structures can be returned to their original purposes, avoiding long-term, inefficient use of space, which is a particularly important consideration in a densely populated city. Running costs are low because Fangcang shelter hospitals require fewer doctors and nurses than traditional hospitals. 36 The low health worker-to-patient ratio is for two reasons: first, all patients in the hospital share the same primary admission diagnosis, reducing the complexity of care, and second, all patients have only mild to moderate disease. 9,37 By isolating and treating only mild to moderate cases, Fangcang shelter hospitals in Wuhan freed up the scarce medical infra structure of higher-level hospitals, such as the inpatient units providing respiratory support and intensive care, for patients with severe to critical COVID-19 and other patients requiring critical or complex care. More than 90% of severe cases in Hubei province were in Wuhan, 38 and the bed vacancy rate in the traditional hospitals designated for the care of patients with COVID-19 increased from 4% on Feb 4, 2020 (before the first Fangcang shelter hospitals had opened) to 16% on Feb 22, when 16 Fangcang shelter hospitals had started admitting patients. 38 The Fangcang shelter hospitals improved the distribution of patients with COVID-19 according to the severity of their symptoms, increasing the overall efficiency of care. Figure 3 summarises the functions of Fangcang shelter hospitals. The first essential function is isolation. Before the construction of the hospitals, thousands of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 in Wuhan had to be sent home for isolation. Patients with mild to moderate symptoms are generally more active than the severely ill and thus in greater contact with others, increasing the possibility of transmission and placing family and community members at risk. 39 The Fangcang shelter hospitals isolated COVID-19 patients more effectively from their communities than home isolation.",31.47025484359133,13.595458589797753

The Fangcang shelter hospitals, which can be rapidly established, 4, 5 can provide large numbers of hospital beds and appropriate care for patients who do not have severe or critical disease. 5, 6 Health workers at Fangcang shelter hospitals can transfer patients to higher-level hospitals for more complex treatment if their conditions worsen. 6 Fangcang shelter hospitals can also offer emotional and social support to help patients recover and thrive during an otherwise disruptive period in their lives. 6 In this report, we document the conception and dev elop ment of Fangcang shelter hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak in China, describe their key characteristics and essential functions, discuss critical issues for the success of Fangcang shelter hospitals, and consider applications of the concept as part of the COVID-19 public health response in other countries. on the city's medical system. 7 At the beginning of February, 2020, Wuhan had no beds available for COVID-19 patients in the hospitals designated for treating the virus. 8 Thousands of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 had to be sent home for isolation and observation. With a shortage of hospital beds, Wuhan needed an approach to rapidly and massively scale its capacity to isolate and care for patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. As the outbreak in Wuhan reached its most severe point, with thousands of new infections per day, the city opened three Fangcang shelter hospitals on Feb 5, 2020, by converting exhibition centres and stadiums. Over the following weeks, Wuhan opened an additional 13 Fangcang shelter hospitals. 9 Figure 1 shows the progression of bed capacity and occupancy of the Fangcang shelter hospitals over time. As the epidemic in Wuhan subsided and bed occupancy moved towards zero, the Fangcang shelter hospitals were successively suspended. The first hospital closed on March 1, 2020; by March 10, all Fangcang shelter hospitals had been suspended. 10, 11 Home isolation is an important alternative to hospital isolation, which requires behaviour change but no additional infrastructure investment. Chinese policy makers decided against home isolation of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 for a number of important reasons. 12, 13 First, home isolation puts patients' family members at risk. Early epidemiological evidence in China showed that more than half of all patients with COVID-19 had at least one family member with the disease, and 75-80% of all clustered infections were within families, suggesting high rates of intrafamily transmission. [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] Second, patients can find home isolation psychologically taxing, because they know that they are putting those they care about most at risk of contracting the disease. 19, 20 Third, home isolation is unlikely to be fully effective because it cannot be strictly enforced. Patients might break with the mandated behaviour to stay at home and go outside for errands, entertainment, or exercise. Lastly, it is difficult to organise medical care, frequent monitoring of disease progression, and timely referral to hospital care for thousands of patients in home isolation. 21 COVID-19 can deteriorate from mild or moderate to severe illness, requiring rapid referral to hospital care. [16] [17] [18] In home isolation in Wuhan, before the introduction of the Fangcang shelter hospitals, the time from onset of severe symptoms to admission to a tertiary hospital for intensive care was up to 10 days. 8, 22 The Fangcang shelter hospitals substantially reduced these delays.",30.014798822749302,13.322321812274083

It also assumes a small proportion of persons who are negative or have recovered from COVID-19; this may change with the availability of wider testing and the ability to test for past infection or immunity. Recent data from China, by Chang et al, revealed the greatest risk of COVID-19 exposure to health care workers during early stages of the pandemic when testing was not yet widely available. 61 In a JAMA report published from Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan, 29.3% (40 of 138) of COVID-19 infected patients were health care workers who presumably had hospital-acquired infections. 27 Among 493 health care workers caring for hospitalized patients, 10/493 health care workers became infected with COVID-19; all 10 were unprotected health care workers (no mask) caring for patients on medical wards with a low risk of exposure (no known or suspected COVID-19 patients). In contrast, none of the 278 protected health care workers (N95 mask) caring for high risk patients (known or suspected COVID-19) became infected (aOR 464.82; 95% CI: 97.73 to infinite). 62 One study, evaluating health care worker exposure in the care of one COVID-19 positive patient, revealed that none of 41 health care workers (surgical masks only) developed infection despite absence of N95 mask, although studies evaluating health care workers in context of larger cohorts of COVID-19 positive patients are not yet available. 63 The decision to extend the recommendation to lower GI procedures is based on evidence of possible aerosolization during colonoscopy especially during the insertion and removal of instruments through the biopsy channel. 53 and the uncertain risks associated with evidence of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in fecal samples. These data provided indirect evidence to extend the recommendation to lower GI procedures pending more definitive evidence. 33 Limited resource settings Recommendation 4: In extreme resource-constrained settings involving health care workers performing any GI procedures, regardless of COVID-19 status, the AGA suggests extended use/re-use of N95 masks over surgical masks, as part of appropriate personal protective equipment.

ECMO is being used more frequently as a treatment for severe ARDS, and the need for ECMO in transit has increased [2]. In particular, during the recent outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome in South Korea, ECMO interhospital transport played a significant role in patients requiring transfer to an ECMO center for ARDS treatment. However, South Korea still lacks a well-established ECMO interhospital transport system due to limited resources. Recent advances in ECMO have suggested that ECMO can function as an alternative to a ventilator for oxygenation. ECMO without mechanical ventilation has been used in a number of ARDS patients. In view of this, we have greatly simplified our ECMO transport system and have been operating our ECMO interhospital transport program without the use of mechanical ventilation [3]. During the planning stage of our ECMO transport program, our goal was to maximize the utilization of hospital staff and facilities and to develop an ECMO transport system using the public emergency medical services (EMS) systems. Our system was specifically designed to address the medical circumstances in South Korea and can be appropriately applied to other hospitals in South Korea.

A study by Kim et al [5] described how risk assessment worked for an evolving epidemic. The authors of this article are members of the division of risk assessment in Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), which were established in 2016 after the MERS-CoV outbreak in 2015. The team conducted a series of risk assessments following the report of “unknown causes” of pneumonia clusters in Wuhan, China. Their risk assessments included the likelihood of the virus being carried into the country and the impact of transmission of the disease in Korea. The evolution of risk showed how and when to use risk assessments for this kind of emerging infectious disease.

However, survival rate was higher in NIMV than invasive ventilation. We used full-face mask in all patients for NIMV. Noninvasive ventilation has been used an alternative therapy for patients with acute respiratory failure with hopes of obviating intubation and mechanical ventilation. The results of NIMV in hypoxemic respiratory failure have been conflicting, and the etiology of hypoxemia appears to be an important determinant of its success. Ferrer et al. 22 compared NIMV to conventional venture oxygen delivery in patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure and found that NIMV decreased the need for intubation. This benefit was observed in the subgroup of patients with pneumonia, but not in those with ARDS, in which the intubation rates were high in both groups. A meta-analysis suggests that NIMV does not decrease the need for intubation, so there is not enough evidence to support its use in ARDS 23. Of all patients, 56 (91 %) were mechanically ventilated on the first day of ICU admission; 14 (23 %) invasively and 42 (68.8 %) noninvasively. Fifteen patients (24.5%) who received noninvasive ventilation ultimately required invasive ventilation. Dominguez-Cherit et al. 24 reported that invasively ventilation was used in 82.7% of patients. In Kumar's study 18, invasive ventilation was used in 81% of patients with swine flu associated respiratory failure. In our study, we used noninvasive ventilation in 68.8% of critically patients with 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) on admission ICU. In critically ill patients with 2009 influenza A (H1N1) infection, high levels of PEEP were often used to achieve adequate oxygenation. In our study, patients with ARDS were often had PEEP refractory hypoxemia. It was also noted that once patients improved and the weaning process was started, oxygenation was sensitive to small decrements in PEEP. We used high PEEP levels up to 20-25 cmH2O in some patients.",9.340012738600304,4.666568252765363

Post-LT 3-month survival of recipients is about 80–90% and much higher than that anticipated if patients were not transplanted.[29], [50], [87], [98], [115], [116], [117] Indeed, in the CANONIC study, patients transplanted with an ACLF grade 2 and 3 between day 3 and day 7 (n = 21) had a better 6-month survival than the non-transplanted patients (80.9 vs. 10%, p < 0.001).29 Similarly, in our reported experience, the 73 patients transplanted with ACLF grade 3 at the time of LT had better 1-year survival than matched controls (83.9 vs. 7.9%, p < 0.0001).98 In a very large cohort study from the UNOS, performed in more than 11,000 patients transplanted with 1 or more OFs, a good 1-year survival ranging from 88% (1 OF) to 80% (5/6 OFs) was reported. Moreover, recipient’s long-term survival (5-year) was acceptable, ranging from 65% to 74% with similar results for liver graft survival.116 Regarding the impact of the type of OFs on post-LT outcomes, there was a lower post-LT survival among intubated patients or patients with circulatory failure than for other types of OF (1-year patient survival 79–81% vs. 84–87%).116 Levesque et al. recently reported a worse outcome following LT for patients with ACLF grade 3 compared to our cohort (43.3% survival at 1 year).87 The main difference in patient characteristics between this study and our collaborative work was the incidence of respiratory failure between the 2 groups of patients with ALCF grade 3 (76.7 vs. 15.8%).98 Together, these data suggest that severe and uncontrolled respiratory failure may be viewed as a contraindication for LT. This is in line with a recent report that identified severe acute respiratory distress syndrome as an independent factor associated with post-transplant mortality.118 Improvement or stabilization in OFs in the immediate pretransplant period has been associated with favourable post-LT outcomes in patients with ACLF, suggesting that the evolution of OFs should at least be controlled, if not improved, before considering an LT.[98], [115]",9.136040435434191,4.602288724154515

These modalities aim to replace the functions of the failing liver, allowing hepatic recovery or stabilizing clinical state to enable transplantation.[55], [59] The key concepts of such therapies are to remove harmful toxins, support the liver for spontaneous regeneration and to reduce the ongoing inflammatory injury.59 Based on albumin dialysis, the molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS®) and plasma separation and absorption system (Prometheus®) are the most studied devices. MARS therapy has been reported to improve bilirubin levels, hepatic encephalopathy, haemodynamic parameters and kidney function in patients with decompensated cirrhosis[125], [126] without improving survival. In the RELIEF trial, including patients with ACLF, no improvement in transplant-free survival at 28 and 90 days was observed.127 In the Helios study, despite a well-tolerated treatment, Prometheus therapy was not reported to improve short-term survival in patients with ACLF.128 Of note, these results have to be interpreted with caution due to the heterogeneous population of patients with decompensated cirrhosis associated with different degrees of OFs and different definitions of ACLF.58 Results of a large prospective multicentre study evaluating a bioartificial device (extracorporeal cellular therapy) in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis showed that it conferred no overall survival benefit compared to standard of care. However, among other limitations, patients were not stratified according to response to medical treatment and definitive conclusions on the efficacy of this device cannot, as of this date, be drawn.129 A second study in younger patients with lower MELD scores is therefore ongoing (NCT02612428).",9.416799517789133,4.173832554058757

To halt injury to organs and promote recovery, the clinical team needs rapid, actionable clinical information within the short treatment window of any ICU. That information needs to include simultaneously the etiology, i.e., was it infectious or non-infectious, and the extent of homeostatic disruption. Bacterial cultures take at least 24 hours to grow and 72 hours to speciate. Viral panels only check for common viruses, requiring insights of what to test. Both viral and bacterial analyses are often only ordered when the phenotype is suspected of matching, meaning unique responses are often missed for proper diagnosis. At the same time, the treating physicians are often unsure of the patient's clinical state, such as whether the patient is immunosuppressed or experiencing an overwhelming immune and inflammatory response (1) (2) (3) . We are seeing that even in epidemics from an infectious agent like COVID-19, there are differing clinical phenotypes that lead to MODS, requiring changes in therapeutic course (4, 5) . In any critically ill patient with MODS, the first 48 hours are spent by the clinical team supporting organ function with little ability to make effective changes to the clinical course. At present, our perception of organ damage is limited to a few organs that have validated, but imperfect means of measurement such as the heart, lung, kidney, liver, and brain, missing markers for many other tissues. The transcriptome is an attractive tool, offering a snapshot of the interaction between affecting pathology and patients' biology. Thus, transcriptomics is a practical, real-time approach to diagnosis and management, which with decreasing time of processing and improved computational capacity to provide insight, could be a powerful tool to predict disease etiology and clinical course. Doing so reduces diagnostic odyssey in a population that can ill afford delay, providing an agnostic guide to patient-specific disease. The individual responses seen in each MODS patient make this group a prime cohort for personalized/precision medicine strategy development (6), as we lay forth below.",25.94413446047714,11.026640172109838

This study described acute kidney injury (AKI) at early stage of COVID-19 and its clinical significance. Three-hundred and fifty-five COVID-19 patients with were recruited and clinical data were collected from electronic medical records. Patient's prognosis was tracked and risk factors of AKI was analyzed. Of 355 COVID-19 patients, common, severe and critical ill cases accounted for 63.1%, 16.9% and 20.0%, respectively. On admission, 56 (15.8%) patients were with AKI. Although AKI was more common in critical ill patients with COVID-19, there was no significant association between oxygenation index and renal functional indices among COVID-19 patients with AKI. By multivariate logistic regression, male, older age and comorbidity with diabetes were three important independent risk factors predicting AKI among COVID-19 patients. Among 56 COVID-19 patients with AKI, 33.9% were died on mean 10.9 day after hospitalization. Fatality rate was obviously higher among COVID-+19 patients with AKI than those without AKI (RR=7.08, P<0.001). In conclusion, male elderly COVID-19 patients with diabetes are more susceptible to AKI. AKI at early stage may be a negative prognostic indicator for COVID-19.",24.074702789263014,9.96552762335204
