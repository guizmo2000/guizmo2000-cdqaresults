Yet, these data confirm that people do not view seasonal influenza with the same level of concern as pandemic strains of influenza. While it is encouraging that respondents appear to differentiate between seasonal influenza and the common cold, the questions in this survey presumed a physician diagnosis. Large numbers of people do not seek medical care for mild to moderate respiratory illness, and it is not practical to expect lay people to reliably differentiate between a common cold and influenza.

Because of their commitment to care for the sick and injured, individual physicians have an obligation to provide urgent medical care during disasters.

Since the median income of each cluster has almost no relationship with population density (i.e., correlation coefficient = 0.03), the empirical results reveal an interesting phenomenon: the public hospitals that serve in a richer district, has a relatively lower efficiency in HK, since people with higher degree of education and income prefer to accepting higher quality service from the private hospitals. Secondly, the proportion of population aged over 65 and HA hospital efficiency has a negative correlation, because the elderly are more likely to suffer from life-threatening diseases. Many elderly patients are physically too weak to see the doctors. Moreover, one out of three elderly HK residents lives under poverty or disabilities, so they are usually unable to take good care of themselves once in sick.

A model based on these parameters was then used to calculate the effects of interventions including voluntary household quarantine, voluntary individual isolation in a facility outside the home, and contact tracing (that is, asking infectious individuals to identify people whom they may have infected and then warning those people) on the spread of pandemic influenza through the population. The model also took into account the anti-viral treatment of exposed, asymptomatic household members and of individuals in isolation, and assumed that all intervention strategies were put into place before the arrival of individuals infected with the pandemic virus.",17.667450466320723,11.353321625290347

At that time, the number of people isolated at home reached 3,000 nationwide, and there was a trend increasing by 200 to 300 people per day. With the rapid spread of MERS into Korean society, it is likely that people who were to be isolated had fears of infection and anxiety over MERS which had over a 20% mortality rate, concern over social isolation, and anxiety over the possibility of spreading infection to family members if isolated at home. Since community health care center staff members were monitoring the state of isolation to prevent MERS spreading further, it is likely that those isolated had high levels of anxiety over the fear of their isolation becoming a stigma among their neighbors. During the MERS epidemic, 80.2% of the general public reported fear of being infected, and 46% reported emotional distress. Risk factors associated with increased rates of fear were the following: concern about public transportation use, difficulty going outside, perception that the state is not protecting the people, helplessness in situations that cannot be controlled, and fear of infection [10] .",24.22518653876217,13.689988155388047

To mitigate the super-spreading of the MERS among people in homes and in communities, home care for patients with mild symptoms should be provided under close medical observation, after patients and family caregivers must have received appropriate training on personal hygiene, basic infection prevention, and control measures. However, patients with worsening conditions should seek prompt medical attention following a monitor of their health status for 14 days after the exposure event 41, 42 . Secondly, our analysis reveals that relatively large tertiary hospitals have higher rates of MERS transmission than small community hospitals, because, in addition to poor disease control facilities, they typically have large numbers of patients and visitors who are engaged in doctor shopping 43, 44 . Therefore, it is necessary to put effective quarantine and adequate facility ventilation on the agenda. Furthermore, to improve the response activities of hospital staff in infection prevention and control, timely education and training must be provided 43 . It is also necessary that, regardless of the diagnosis, healthcare facilities should always share essential information in a timely manner with other facilities at the early stage of the outbreak.

Young people with high dispositional optimism are confident about eventual success by continuous attempt even despite the challenges. By contrast, people who are doubtful try to escape the adversity by wishful thinking. They are drawn into temporary distractions that do not help solve the problem and sometimes even stop trying. Scheier et al. assessed attentional-cognitive strategies as ways of dealing with experiences [4] . More optimists than pessimists make plans for their future and set goals for themselves. Optimists also focus insignificantly on the negative aspects of experiences, such as distress and adversity. Compared with pessimists, optimists gather information about a certain event in the months ahead. Optimists also report the feeling they had benefited from an experience, such as by becoming closer to their spouse.",21.155353077194718,9.418166437526116

This is driven by two critical components: the rate of contact and probability of transmission given a contact. It also depends on the number of infectious individuals in the population. In general, precise measurements of pathogen transmission are challenging to establish because of the considerable difficulties associated with identifying the nature of a potential contact and the probability of infection (McCallum, Barlow, & Hone, 2001) . Additionally, heterogeneities in transmission can arise, for example due to age-or sex-specific differences among individuals, or in different geographic locations.

If people experience MERS-like symptoms, such as fever, cough, or sputum, they generally want to determine whether they have MERS; therefore, they used a web search engine, such as Google. Thus, the correlation coefficient of ""MERS symptoms (in Korean)"" in the quarantined cases was highest in the results from the Google search because those people may be searching ""what are MERS symptoms?"" However, in using Twitter, people may be attempting to deliver this information to other people.

It must be noted that the proportion of pneumonia caused by unknown pathogens is higher among elderly people. This category most likely represents multifactorial conditions. Therefore, in coming decades, the pneumonia burden will likely increase, and its etiology will become more diverse. In this situation, the current etiologyspecific approach (i.e., vaccinations for pneumococcus and influenza, guidelines for appropriate antibiotics use) must have only a limited impact.

During the incubation stage, we assume that no infected people enter the ED. Non-infected people that enter the ED for other chest problems are part of the background data. During the prodromal and fulminant stages we assume a simple Markov model of utilization: each infected subject is a Bernoulli event, independent across days. At the prodromal stage people enter the ED with probability P d on a weekday and P w on weekends. At the fulminant stage the probability of entering the ED, P f say, is larger than the probabilities in the prodromal stage. The reason is that at the fulminant stage, the anthrax symptoms are similar to those of a heart attack and therefore people enter the ED with higher probability. The differentiation between weekday and weekend is irrelevant at this stage. We suppose that a small percentage of people in the prodromal or fulminant stages are misdiagnosed and thus need to re-enter the system. Also, we assume that people can potentially be misdiagnosed a maximum of two times during the same attack (10% in the first visit and 5% in the second visit). The probabilities of entering the ED after being misdiagnosed are increased by an additive factor, C, for every additional entry. Our model allows for a small probability of drop-out, to account for other ways of leaving the system (e.g., pharmacy visit). The health-utilization model could easily be extended to include, e.g., varying probabilities of entering the ED by stage/time, and/or more advanced ways to exit the system.",21.030732579303162,11.155266135479343

While EVD-infected expatriate health personnel were flown to their countries for treatment, local EVD-infected health personnel were not accorded such treatment. This attitude was motivated by the failure to recognize the similarity between citizens in rich and poor countries which emerging health threats has exposed us to in our increasingly interconnected interdependent world. It further reflects the discrepancy that existed in international health in the past which does not longer hold today. This calls for a paradigm shift from the charity-based approach to a solidaristic one (West-Oram and Bux 2016, 7) . An approach that acknowledges our global interdependence and shared vulnerability to global health threats such as EIDs; and recognizes that if a neighbour's home is on fire, efforts must be made by all to put off the fire, otherwise it may spread and consume more homes (including ours) that may even be further away from the initial home on fire! In fact, the WHO has proposed solidarity as one of the key ethical principles in the management of infectious disease outbreaks globally (WHO 2016) . This principle justifies engagement in collective action in the face of common threats such as EIDs, while supporting efforts to overcome inequalities that undermine the well-being of minorities and groups suffering from discrimination. One potential application of this principle globally is the provision of financial, technical, and scientific assistance by high income and developed countries to low-income and impoverished countries to boost their capacities to prevent and manage ongoing and future EIDs. This is in fact one of the obligations of governments and the international community in the WHO 'Guidance for managing ethical issues in infectious disease outbreaks' (WHO 2016) .",19.311729966146103,10.737610777705731

In the scenario pertaining to the participant falling ill, participants were asked if they would stay home and if someone would be able to take care of them. In the scenario pertaining to a family member falling ill, participants were asked if they would stay home and take care of that person. If participants answered affirmatively, they were asked if they could continue to work. In the scenario that followed, participants were asked to imagine that the government has asked all people with influenza to stay home, that they have influenza symptoms, and that their employer nonetheless demands they come in to work. Participants that reported being willing to stay home despite their employer's demand were then confronted with a scenario in which the consequence of staying home would be a loss of income. Another scenario described a situation in which companies were advised to close their doors and subsequently did not pay their employees. For the previous two scenarios, participants were asked how likely that scenario would be and how long it would take before their household would encounter serious financial difficulties. Participants with children younger than 12 were also given a scenario in which all schools and child care facilities were closed for a month. Participants were asked if they would be in a position to care for their children themselves or if they could arrange alternative child care arrangements. Participants with children younger than 18 were also given the following scenario: ""Imagine all schools and child care facilities close for three months in order to protect children from influenza infection. Health professionals have advised you to keep your child(ren) away from public places such as shopping centres and public transportation for three months. Children should also discontinue social contact with other children. Would you be able to keep your child from doing these things for three months?"" The final scenario pertained to antiviral drugs and was as follows: ""A vaccine for a new influenza virus can only be developed after the outbreak. There are, however, antiviral drugs such as Tamiflu and Relenza that may prevent the virus from dispersing through the body and that can shorten the illness period. However, it is unclear whether these antiviral drugs actually work for the new influenza infection."" After having read the scenario, participants were asked if they would want to use the drug and if they would be agree with a policy that prioritizes the treatment of vulnerable groups, such as the elderly and professionals such as the police and fire fighters. If so, they were asked if they would attempt to obtain access to the drugs via other means. Table 1 displays demographic characteristics of the sample (n = 1099).

To this end, we considered a stochastic network game where individuals respond to the current risk of disease spread, and their responses together with the current state of the disease and the contact network structure stochastically determine the next stage of the disease. In particular the game is played among the healthy and the sick in an SIS infectious disease. In our scenario, the concern for disease contraction of a healthy individual increased with the number of sick contacts that are not taking any preemptive measures. Similarly, sick individuals had increased concerns for disease spread when there are more healthy contacts that do not take protective measures. This meant that the incentives for a healthy individual taking a measure decreased as more of individual's sick contacts took preemptive measures, e.g., staying at home. Similarly, the incentive for preemptive measures decreased for sick individuals as the healthy got more cautious. The consequences of these incentives are not trivial in a disease contact network setting where an individual cares about the behaviors of contacts who themselves care about their neighbors and so on.

Existing disease-surveillance systems don't always detect disease outbreaks, particularly in situations where there are shifts in the baseline patterns of health-care use. For example, during an epidemic, people might stay away from hospitals because of the fear of becoming infected, whereas after a suspected bioterrorist attack with an infectious agent, hospitals might be flooded with ''worried well'' (healthy people who think they have been exposed to the agent). Baseline shifts like these might prevent the detection of increased illness caused by the epidemic or the bioterrorist attack. Localized population surges associated with major public events (for example, the Olympics) are also likely to reduce the ability of existing surveillance systems to detect infectious disease outbreaks. In this study, the researchers developed a new class of surveillance systems called ''epidemiological network models.'' These systems aim to improve the detection of disease outbreaks by monitoring fluctuations in the relationships between information detailing the use of various health-care resources over time (data streams).",19.02045418285568,11.185989933333136

Such a large number would imply that about 2500 affected would require intensive care units. At the time, Lombardy had only about 500 such units in government/state facilities and another 160 in private health care facilities [20] . As early as the 24 th of February it was clear that there would be many deaths in Lombardy weeks later. With epidemics, everything goes awry because the infected get sick a week later, and some of the patients then die ten to twenty days later. This ""time delay"" is a critically important factor that needs to be taken into account. However, even then, the Italians did not declare a quarantine. They did not do so on the 29 th of February, either, when the total number of infected people rose from 888 to 1128. Those figures implied that in mere days they would be having about 15 000 newly infected people each day. They did not declare quarantine on the 4 th of March, either, when the number of infected people exceeded 3000, and when the world stock exchanges started to fall again. It had then become clear to most epidemiologists who have been advising global investors that an unexpected tragedy was about to unravel in Italy and this was now inevitable. At that point, Italy already had at least 30 000 infected people spreading the infection. The quarantine was declared for Lombardy on the 8 th of March [7] .

Surveys conducted in the United States (US) and Australia during the 2009 pandemic showed that more than 80% of people were willing to stay home from work or school [17, 18] , while 53-76% of people were willing to self-isolate [17, 19] .

Risk perception has been widely established as a significant predictor of engagement in preventive health behaviors, including SI [21] ; those who report being unfamiliar with the term ""pandemic influenza,"" male respondents, and employed people who are not able to work from home have been found to be less willing to comply [22] .

The fact that there is a significant portion of people who prefer visiting multiple places (any kind of medical specialists) implies that voluntary participation, rather than mandatory registration, could be an important manner to disseminate having a USC without resistance of the public in Korea.

Two additional domains relating to the economy and the way in which the country is being run were excluded due to not being present at critical waves of the study. All variables begin with the stem ""How happy are you with [DOMAIN]"" (see below for suffixes), with response scales varying from 1 (very happy) to 4 (very unhappy). To aid interpretation, these answer points were reverse scored such that higher scores reflected greater happiness. An additional response point was included representing ""can't say/don't know."" This choice was selected by less than 1% of the sample on average and never more than 4% for any question in any wave. This response was coded as missing for the purposes of the current study. Abbreviations will be used for the 12 wellbeing variables (exact item suffix in brackets) as follows: general (your life as a whole), living (your standard of living), home (your life at home), future (your future prospects), career (your career prospects), work (the work you do, at study, at home or in a job), money (the money you get each week), leisure (what you do in your spare time), location (where you live), social (your social life), people (how you get on with people in general), and independence (your independence; being able to do what you want).",18.607140019530885,11.446260853855005

Critical medical anthropology [104] has directed the attention towards the social and political determinants of ill health, disease distribution and access to health care. Recent approaches in health systems research understand health care systems not merely as structures of services, goods and personnel, but as knowledge economies [105] involving health markets that include formal and informal practitioners, with a range of factors influencing people's understandings of illness and health-seeking behaviour. These concepts should underpin the investigation of the extent to which bat virus spillover events are recognized by a range of groups and how diagnosis and public health responses are shaped by institutional factors and health care workers' practices. From socio-epidemiological perspectives, an investigation of how behavioural and socio-demographic factors can predispose people and their domestic animals to spillover infections would be very valuable. Relevant biomedical syndromes must be considered alongside enquiry regarding the extent to which zoonotic disease risk is recognized by local people and features in their concepts of illnesses and perceptions of relevant causes of morbidity and mortality. The detailed laboratory investigation and confirmation of specific infections in humans must follow the same detailed criteria as used for defining the specific infections in bat hosts.

The usual standard practice in primary care would be to give the dengue home care card to the patient with no verbal advice accompanying it, and it is up to the patient to read the card themselves. It is possible that reading out the dengue home care card became an active form of intervention in the control group, thus resulting in the control group participants to drink more fluids than they normally would had they received standard care. This could be a form of double intervention, and the difference in fluid intake between the two groups might be more pronounced if the dengue home care card was not read out to the participants, simulating the standard practice in primary care more closely. Thus, the true impact of the fluid chart on the fluid intake for suspected dengue patients might be underestimated in the current results. However, the intervention group seemed to have consistently maintained a higher mean fluid intake from day 1 to day 6 of the clinic consultations. Another possibility is that there might be other factors influencing the amount of fluid intake consumed by each participant, not just the fluid chart. However, this was not explored in this pilot study. The fluid chart is an intervention tool which was designed to measure and document accurately the patient's fluid intake which they should fill prospectively. By doing this, the patient's awareness of his or her own oral fluid intake should be increased. This increased awareness could be the catalyst for a behavioural change, motivating the patients to increase their oral fluid intake. The improved oral fluid intake could translate into a reduction in morbidity.

This partitioning of the cases into four categories allows combining the realistic description of the transmission dynamics with an easy calculation of the resources consumed during an outbreak. The degree and duration of contagiousness of a patient depend on the course of the disease; the latter furthermore depends on the age of the patient (Table 5) . Passing through the incubation and contagious period is modelled in several stages which allows for realistic distributions of the sojourn times ( Table 4 ). The last two stages of the incubation period are used as early infectious period during which the patient can already spread the disease. Infectiousness is highest after onset of symptoms and thereafter declines geometrically (Table 6 ). Clinically ill patients seek medical help on average one day after onset of symptoms. Very sick patients are advised to withdraw to their home until their disease is over, whereas extremely sick patients need to be hospitalized and may die from the disease (Table 4) .

More than half of the world's TB cases occur in five countries, 15 which have significant prevalence rates and total numbers of diabetes cases in adults aged 20-79 years as follows: China (10.9%, 114 million), India (8.8%, 73 million), Indonesia (6.2%, 10 million), Philippines (6.2%, 3.7 million) and Pakistan (6.9%, 7.5 million). 1 There is evidence that the presence of clinical TB disease drives stress hyperglycaemia, impacting on clinical outcomes and response to treatment. 16 As rates of diabetes continue to rise, and the TB epidemic continues, there is a pressing need for bidirectional screening in countries facing the double burden of TB and diabetes. Work in India has shown success at screening newly diagnosed TB cases for diabetes, 17 due to the availability of a simple screening blood test (HbA1c) and the use of existing systems established to screen TB cases for HIV. Screening people with diabetes for TB is more difficult due to the reliance on symptom questionnaires followed by chest xray. A blood test to diagnose TB in this setting is highly desirable, but current interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) do not have sufficient sensitivity and specificity for this purpose. Diabetes is also associated with higher rates of Mycobacterium leprae. 18, 19 The greatest increased risk for infection in people with diabetes is seen for the grossly under-recognised tropical disease melioidosis, which is caused by the Gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei. People with diabetes have a twelvefold increased risk of melioidosis, and over half of all cases of melioidosis have diabetes. 20 B. pseudomallei is an environmental saprophyte with a predilection for rice paddy fields, and melioidosis is typically seen in adults in middle age and above, often in rice-farming communities. A broad range of clinical presentations are seen, including pneumonia, acute sepsis with bacteraemia, abscess formation in any organ site, chronic subacute disease and latency. 21, 22 Transmission of the bacterium to humans occurs via three routes: inhalational, cutaneous via skin abrasions and ingestion of contaminated drinking water. 23 The disease is commonly diagnosed in Southeast Asia and Northern Australia, but is now known to be present in 45 countries across tropical regions, with an estimated annual 165 000 cases and 89 000 deaths. 24 If rates of diabetes continue to rise as predicted, coupled with an increased reliance on older people for rice farming due to exodus of the younger generation to urban areas, then the burden of melioidosis will also rise.",17.989123142397183,10.950955308300776

Further, our findings suggest that the degrees of quality of emotions, such as negativity and positivity, and the affective and cognitive constructs of emotion differ across cultures. An implication of this study is that the cognitive processes that arise from culture affect how people feel. This may stem from differences in thinking styles, such as dialectical and linear thinking (Peng and Nisbett, 1999; Ji et al., 2001; Nisbett, 2003) . Specifically, Easterners tend to be dialectical when thinking about a situation in a manner that balances the positives and negatives. When things are going well, Easterners might expect a change for the worse, and when things are going badly, they might expect things to get better. This may prepare Easterners for unexpected situations. However, Westerners tend to focus more on one pattern-things will tend to stay as they are, good or bad.

What is needed is a way to prevent SARS developing in healthy people who have been exposed to SARS-CoV and to treat sick people so that they are less infectious and can fight the virus. In this study, researchers have been investigating ''passive immunization'' as a way to limit SARS epidemics. In passive immunization, short-term protection against illness is achieved by injecting antibodies-proteins that recognize specific molecules (called antigens) on foreign organisms such as bacteria and viruses and prevent those organisms from causing disease. Antibodies for passive immunization can be isolated from blood taken from people who have had SARS, or they can be manufactured as so-called ''human monoclonal antibodies'' in a laboratory. One of these human monoclonal antibodies-CR3014-had been previously made and shown to prevent lung damage in ferrets infected with SARS-CoV and to stop the infected animals from infecting others. But for effective disease prevention in people, a single monoclonal antibody might not be enough. There are strains of SARS-CoV that CR3014 does not recognize and therefore cannot act against. Also, the virus can alter the antigen recognized by CR3014 when it is grown at a low antibody concentration, producing so-called escape variants; if this happens CR3014 can no longer prevent these escape variants from killing human cells.",28.51733754641217,16.009507019303644

As the epidemic is ongoing, it is important to prepare health care systems and the general public to be medically and psychologically ready if widespread transmission occurs outside China [32] . Our findings have clinical and policy implications. First, health authorities need to identify high-risk groups based on sociodemographic information for early psychological interventions. Our sociodemographic data suggest that females suffered a greater psychological impact of the outbreak as well as higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. This finding corresponds to previously extensive epidemiological studies which found that women were at higher risk of depression [33] . Students were also found to experience a psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. As the total number of people infected by COVID-19 currently surpasses those stricken by the 2003 SARS-CoV epidemic, major cities in China have shut down schools at all levels indefinitely. The uncertainty and potential negative impact on academic progression could have an adverse effect on the mental health of students. During the epidemic, education authorities need to develop online portals and web-based applications to deliver lectures or other teaching activities [34] . As young people are more receptive towards smartphone applications [35] , health authorities could consider providing online or smartphone-based psychoeducation and psychological interventions (e.g., cognitive behavior therapy, CBT) to reduce risk of virus transmission by face-to-face therapy. Online platforms could also provide a support network for those people spending most of their time at home during the epidemic. We found that the general public with no formal education had a greater likelihood of depression during the epidemic.

Under normal circumstances, distance and quality are believed to be two major determinants in a patient's choice for obstetrics care [4] [5] [6] [7] . In this study, we sought to estimate the influence of people's fears of SARS on people's choice of provider, mode of child delivery, and length of hospital stay before, during and after the delivery. The people's fears include fears of patients and fears of doctors as choice of mode of delivery and length of stay tend to be a joint decision. The fears of doctors to SARS may also reduce cesarean section rate and shorten the length of stay for lowering the possibility of acquiring SARS. Considering the fact that hospital levels [5, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] , (mode of delivery [16, 17] , and length of maternity stay [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] are significantly associated with postpartum maternal and neo-natal health status, the question whether the fears of SARS led patients to transfer from a more advanced hospital to a less advanced hospital becomes an important quality of care concern. Health consequences resulting from these behavioral changes due to people's fears of SARS should not be overlooked [26] [27] [28] [29] . The results could provide public health agencies an important reference when assessing the consequences of the SARS epidemic on quality of care.

The first was a visitor (ninth patient) who stood briefly (1-2 min) beside the bed of the index patient. None of the other 7 of the isolated people who had been in the GW at this time were infected. The other 2 MERS patients (tenth and eleventh patients) were identified among a group of people who were not initially isolated. One (tenth patient) had been admitted in the same ward area and the other (eleventh patient) had been admitted in another ward on the same floor (Fig. 3) . There was no contact or overlap of space between the two patients and the index patient. We checked the movements of these two patients and found no possible indirect transmission via contact with the virus-shedding environment before we cleaned the GW area. Both patients were admitted to the orthopaedic department, and they and the index patient had only one thing in common: they were cared for by the same nurse (tenth patient) or same resident and intern (tenth and eleventh patient). Further retrospective analysis verified the routine nurse's round for all patients in the same ward station and the routine rounds of the doctors who cared for orthopaedic patients on the same floor on the same evening. Before tenth and eleventh patients were isolated, they had walked freely around all areas of the hospital; therefore, numerous instances of contacts or possible viral shedding into the environment were suspected. To protect against further transmissions by infected patients, we closed the hospital over 1 month. During this period, a total of 1019 of people were isolated; (Hospital employees were 267) 69 were isolated at the hospital, 950 were isolated at home; 220 (Hospital employees were 65) were under active daily surveillance for 3 weeks. However, there was no subsequent MERS transmission in these people (Fig. 2) . Table 2 shows a comparison of variables between the ED and GW groups.

The concept of Information Diet was introduced by Clay Johnson for the first time. He believes consumers should take responsibility for the type of information they consume, likewise the rational consumption of food. He also argues that there must be a sustainable news movement, like a sustainable food movement that has already started in the US. In other words, people and even governments are not capable of dealing with the media to a great extent, but people can create their own information diets, like food diet. Therefore, information consumers are advised to consume information in a limited way. However, they must demand complete and credible news, not news that is based on emotional content and full of advertisements"" (4). In the present Coronavirus crisis, some people spend most of their time studying related information regarding Covid-19 in written and virtual media; Meanwhile, they are unwilling to spend time exercising at home, talking to their families, playing with their children or doing other useful tasks such as studying, watching movies and so on. To seriously address these problems in the Coronavirus crisis, not only people must have optimum consumption of appropriate information, but also consuming information should comply with specific terms and conditions. For example, children should not be exposed to the news related to the Coronavirus, because this information increases anxiety and causes other psychological problems among them. The elderly is also vulnerable to the spread of information, and should be provided with reliable and limited information, and they should not be given the ongoing news. On the other hand, individuals should be able to distinguish between high quality and poor quality information, since much of the information regarding Covid-19 is invalid and is produced and published for economic, political, social, and in general profitable purposes (disinformation). Nowadays, in-formation is being provided every day, and by contemplating on and reviewing the publication of statistics related to the Coronavirus crisis on websites, blogs, social media, television and satellite channels etc., it can be understood that the overload of information has already occurred. Hence, providing people with all kinds of health literature is the only option. Although people may not have the ability to control the production and supply of the information nowadays, each of them must control the extent and type of the information which they consume. Therefore, in order to achieve a comprehensive information diet in societies, people need to be equipped with the knowledge and skills of health information literacy, media health literacy, media literacy and health literacy. Currently these trainings can only be delivered through the mass media. Delivering these skills requires specific knowledge and skills which health information professionals (medical librarians) poses, and they can train other people in the society through mass media relying on their abilities.",19.537865393941704,13.616495332871661

Approximately 19% of people working in health services were infected by their patients. These professionals were able to obtain rapid treatment, which means that it was unlikely that they would contribute to SARS spread outside their areas of residence. Housewives and retired people are groups that were extremely susceptible to infection by their families. However, these population groups typically have no desire to move to distant places. The most probable suspects for disease spread were labourers and businessmen, but these groups constituted only ∼7% of total infection cases. The randomness of SARS spread among various cities is a characteristic that has been explained via the theory of super spreaders. The starting point of this theory is that the SARS virus always evolves and mutates. Most virus strings evolve slowly with similar infectivity, but a small fraction evolve into extremely infective virus types. People affected by such virus strings are so-called super spreaders. These individuals were comparatively very contagious, and they transmitted the virus to dozens of other people. For instance, five super spreaders in Singapore were found to have infected 103 people [28, 29] . The randomness of virus mutation to high infectivity indicates considerable randomness in the way people became infected. This randomness also extended to the relatively random directions in which the epidemic spread among cities.",19.378099055291024,12.710980208635611

[version 1; referees: 5 approved]","First, it is necessary to clearly state what we think we mean by the term ""immunosenescence"", which tends to mean different things to different people. It is often assumed, especially by nonimmunologists, that this term refers to the cell biological concept of ""replicative senescence"", whereby somatic human cells cease dividing at the ""Hayflick limit"" after a finite number of cell divisions owing to telomere attrition 4,5 . However, this is not what immunologists generally mean by ""immunosenescence"", as illustrated by reference 1 above. Moreover, in my view, this term should be reserved for a state defined by robust measures of immune parameters (biomarkers) that are different in younger and older individuals and which have been associated with a clearly detrimental clinical outcome (e.g. mortality, frailty, poor response to vaccination, etc.). Here it should be noted that many studies report differences between older and younger people without being able to associate these directly with clinical outcome. The associations that are made with clinical outcome most commonly distinguish between immune biomarkers in older populations of similar ages, which are also different from those in the young. Hence, they should not be referred to as age-associated changes but only as ageassociated differences because the comparisons between younger and older are mostly based on cross-sectional studies. It is an assumption that these differences represent changes that would occur in the younger population given sufficient time. This assumption is unlikely to be correct, given the markedly different circumstances of older people born in the early to middle 20 th century and young people born towards the end of that century. These differences are essentially impossible to control for and are likely to include genetic, nutritional, environmental, psychosocial, and educational factors as well as many others. What mostly remains possible in human studies is to perform longitudinal followup on people already advanced in years, as in cohorts such as the Leiden 85-Plus, which already initiated some immunological studies nearly 20 years ago 6 . At least in such selected populations, one can determine immune parameters at baseline, and their changes over time, that can be associated with clinical outcome within a feasible time-frame. These could then be tested for their applicability in younger subjects.",19.624966004153723,9.273861645193122

It is therefore important to determine the accuracy of non-health care workers at measuring body temperature. This study showed that the temperatures measured by parents with a tympanic ther-mometer often differ by a clinically significant amount from those measured by a nurse with a tympanic thermometer. There is not a consistent gradient or direction of the gradient between the two temperatures, which makes it difficult to interpret the temperatures reported by parents. There was a smaller gradient between the readings taken by a nurse with a tympanic thermometer designed for home use compared with those taken with a model of tympanic thermometer commonly used in hospitals, but there were still potentially clinically significant discrepancies 14% of the time. This makes it difficult to conclude if the poor performance of the parents relates entirely to human error, or if there is also an element of instrument error.

Others with no illness or known exposure may choose social distancing by not attending social functions, limiting time in crowds, and/or wearing protective face masks.

Simply stated, the goal of mass critical care is to provide a few key interventions (those with the highest impact and potential to save lives) to many people rather then providing very resource intense interventions to a few [40, 46, 47] . All processes and procedures are open to modification and must be considered from a new perspective including standards of care, staffing, equipment, and the allocation of resources. Although there certainly is a need to modify the standard of care during a pandemic, one must always keep in mind the primary objective of ensuring that the maximum number of people possible, survive. Thus, caution must be exercised when expanding clinical roles or modifying management to ensure that care is not compromised beyond the point where more harm is being done than good. For instance, it is of little use to move to a ventilation strategy such as long term manual ventilation with bag-valve-masks that may allow many more people to be ventilated but results in an increased number of deaths due to barotrauma than would have occurred if fewer patients were ventilated using a less harmful ventilation strategy. Striking an appropriate balance requires monitoring treatment outcomes during the response. In order to comply with medicolegal and ethical standards, plans to alter the standard of care during a pandemic should be publicly discussed and documented in advance with clear, objective criteria defined for the institution of mass critical care [44] .

Health as integral to human development has been universally recognized from ancient times in the Asia Pacific region, as noted in the Asoka Edicts (269-231 BC), reflecting the notion of a benevolent monarch safeguarding health of the people. This personal individualistic approach has expanded across Asian societies largely through communal perspectives, religious concepts, and charitable practices of dhana (Hinduism-Buddhism), zakat (Islam), and tithe in Christianity. The establishment of hospitals and clinics, such as the world's oldest hospital in Mihintale, Sri Lanka, 28 evolved out of that perspective: the highest value in that culture is the physician-king, embodying the state's responsibility for health and well-being of people. During the colonial era, missionaries expanded the caring traditions beyond national borders, taking care of the sick and those stigmatized by diseases such as leprosy (Hansen disease). Remnants of leprosy hospitals and settlements can be seen dotted across the coastline of Asia, including the one established by Father Damien in Kalaupapa, Hawaii. 29 The work of Mother Teresa and her order in India and more than 120 other countries is a striking reminder of the evolution of missionary health care in Asia. 30 Missionary zeal and altruism remain underlying values among global health practitioners, carrying that imprimatur of charity without the overt intent to proselytize. In the poorer countries adequate care is the luxury afforded to the upper strata of society. This observation is also true to a certain extent even in affluent countries such as the United States, where there are nearly 45 million uninsured people. 31 The dilemma of balancing human rights and cost of care polarizes politics, making health care reform a constant challenge. 31 Hence, health as a universal human right, although acknowledged in the constitution of WHO (1946) and in numerous international treaties, has been mostly symbolic for the needy urban and rural populations. Ideologies, values, practices, and prejudices, not merely the lack of resources, still maintain the disparities in health for significant segments of the global population. 32 In this dilemma one realizes that health equity is the central challenge for universities in global health.",20.426370440816108,9.69340429565641

The first idea is that people know what they can do to maintain health and prevent or cure illnesses, and they are capable of ranking the actions that can be taken. In other words, people are endowed with the abilities or preferences for ranking health services. The second idea is that the material means that people possess, such as income and assets, limit the type and intensity of the actions they can take to maintain or promote health. This limitation arises from the fact that health services, like other goods, have prices that consumers must pay directly or indirectly given limited incomes or assets. The third idea is that, faced with this limitation, people try to do the best for themselves. Expressed strongly, the idea says that people make choices and behave in ways that enable them to maximize the benefits from health-care consumption given their income or wealth. This maximization hypothesis is the cornerstone of much economic analysis, including demand analysis. Not surprisingly, the hypothesis is the subject of intense debate in the health-care demand literature. Since individuals and households possess limited information about health care, the assumption that this care is optimally used to confront illnesses is too strong. For example, the assumption is contradicted by consumption behaviors that harm health, such as smoking, drug abuse, and unhealthy eating habits. Economists have to date not been able to respond convincingly to the persistent criticism that people do not possess the ability and the information required to engage in optimizing behavior. However, in order to derive the strong prediction of demand theory, that people respond to price incentives, a view on optimization assumption is required. Economists generally assume that people behave as if their purpose in life is to do the best for themselves using their scarce resources. This assumption permits a straightforward derivation of policy relevant prediction of demand models that is generally in agreement with everyday experience. For example, the models predict that people will reduce consumption of health-care services if health-care prices are increased, provided that other factors such as income and the disease environment remain the same. Policy makers can use estimation results from these models to set appropriate prices for health-care services. Indeed, information on demand parameters is essential for evidence-based financing of health services.",22.88718644433404,15.00208389241114

When talking to a patient, she said, ""Understandably there are currently a lot of fear about the disease. Can you tell us from the perspective of a patient what it feels like to have this disease?"" By discussing fear with the patient, the target of the fear, Chai was including rather than excluding the patient in the construction of SARS discourses and also insisting that the humanity of the patient rather than the virality of the patient should be emphasized. The patient's subsequent description, which highlighted that this disease was not so different from other more common diseases in its identifiable pattern of development, serves to demystify the virus. In fact, this patient was so comfortable with sharing her feelings with Chai that she expressed that she felt for the nurses and doctors who took care of her. She said, ""They wore thirty layers of gauzed masks but they still got infected. They take care of us but then they cannot go home. This is really hard on them!"" That a patient infected with a deadly virus can feel empathy for her caregivers only shows how humans are deeply connected when facing their vulnerability. Throughout the report, Chai effortlessly created contexts for her interviewees to talk about their feelings. ""Can you go home after work?"" she asked a nurse this seemingly obvious question. As the interview went on, the audience learned what going home actually meant for the nurse: she and her fiancé had to postpone their wedding ceremony and had not seen each other for more than a month. This episode reminded people how life had been interrupted by the epidemic but it also emphasized how the epidemic had made people care even more for others. In another occasion, Chai asked a doctor, ""You knew the risk of working here, but why did you volunteer to stay?"" Visibly getting emotional in spite of the cover of insulating clothes and masks, the doctor recognized her own vulnerability but insisted that the virus only makes humans more connected. ""I could be one of them,"" she said plainly. This message about shared burden is all the more powerful because it comes from a quarantined hospital room, a space designated to separate people. At the end of the report, Chai asked a patient who almost died of the infection but was on her way to recovery, ""Have you ever thought what you want to do the most when you are discharged?"" The patient seemed shocked to face this question and stuttered, ""Ai-ya…I've thought too much [about this]…Life is really, really…I have a new understanding of life now."" Chai's ability to arouse feelings made her SARS report a heart-warming piece about humanity, community, and connectivity.

Due to the effectiveness of ART, the HIV population is steadily ageing over time, with the number of people older than 50 years who are living with HIV increasing by 36% between 2012 and 2016. 1 In 2016, subSaharan Africa was home to 3·7 million people (65 %) of the world's people living with HIV who are older than 50 years. 1 As people live longer with HIV and depend on ART for decades, the care of people living with HIV will increasingly focus on prevention and management of NCDs. People living with HIV have an increased risk of many ageassociated diseases, 133 including cardiovascular diseases, 134 neurocognitive disorders, 135 endstage renal disease, and nonAIDSdefining cancers. 136 NCD risks appear to be less pronounced for people who initiate HIV treatment at higher CD4 counts and, presumably, for those using modern ART regimens with fewer known negative sideeffects. 137 As diverse stakeholders coalesce to create a global movement to address NCDs, experiences in the HIV response (including its advocacy successes, community engagement, models of care, and innovation to ensure access to essential diagnostics and medicines) potentially hold important lessons for the NCD community. 138 Already, the global attention to NCDs has surged, as reflected in the creation of the NCD Alliance and the Lancet NCD Action Group, the upcoming Third High Level Meeting on NCDs at the UN's General Assembly in 2018, the WHOcommissioned Independent High Commission on NCDs, and grassroots movements to increase cancer awareness and funding for cancer research. However, much greater political commitment, and the willingness to stand up to entrenched financial interests such as the tobacco and food industries, 139 will be needed if NCDs are to receive the attention they warrant. 140 The NCD agenda has a clear potential to catalyse action to address the structural determinants of health. Structural approaches (ensuring smokefree environ ments, banning or restricting advertising for tobacco or alcohol products, using taxes to discourage use of tobacco or alcohol, reducing salt and sugar content in packaged foods and beverages, and replacing transfats with healthier alternatives) are pivotal to efforts to reduce NCDs. 141 Given the powerful degree to which socio economic status influences susceptibility to NCDs, 142 strategies to alleviate poverty also support prevention of NCDs. As structural action to address NCDs requires action in multiple domains (eg, social protection, trade, agriculture, taxation and finance, agriculture, manu facturing, labour), it is important that health routinely be taken into account in policy development processes. Toward the goals of more integrated and universally accessible health systems and sustainable health for all, policy development should prioritise structural approaches that generate health benefits for diverse populations and health conditions. As prevention of NCDs involve substantial shifts in social norms and practices (eg, smoking and alcohol consumption, diet, indoor cooking practices), engagement of communities is essential.",17.280801123084903,13.572007333234744

Instead of the full scale, which consists of six subscales each with four items, an eight-item version was used.

A person's score would derive from an aggregation of measurements including those of respiratory function, blood pressure, cardiac condition, neurological responses, organ failure, and age. Depending on the score, a patient would be placed in a category designated by color. Red category patients are the highest priority. These include sick individuals who are more likely to recover if they receive intensive care, though unlikely to recover without such care. Yellow signifies intermediate priority, for very sick patients who may or may not benefit from critical care. They could receive such care if resources are available, though not at the expense of the needs of people in the red category. People in the two remaining color categories would not receive critical care at all. Green covers persons well enough to be treated without intensive intervention. Blue signifies patients who are so ill they should not receive critical care, only palliative measures. 39 How effective this protocol would be in the event of a disease outbreak, whether of deliberate or natural origin, is uncertain. But the study underscores the need to reconfigure traditional understandings of ethics. The authors acknowledge that under normal circumstances, all patients should have a claim to the health care they need. But when faced with bioterrorism or other large-scale disaster, individual rights and needs may be restricted in the interest of the larger community. Certain terrorist acts may generate unique ethical challenges. For example, a terrorist who unintentionally survives a suicide bombing may be critically wounded, as are the people he targeted. Although some of his victims may be less severely injured than the terrorist, would treating them first be morally acceptable? If so, does this mean by extension that in a mass casualty event, some should receive priority treatment apart from severity of injury, but rather based on their age or perceived value to society? Existing ethical codes of healthcare organizations provide little guidance about such questions. The AMA and other health organizations should consider these matters and provide guidance to their constituents.",30.615260207415677,15.951681404626736

Risk of contamination with pathogenic bacteria increases with an increase in the time span of transport and lairage of cattle and poultry. All food processing includes the component of risk and it is difficult to fortify the risk control of food safety. The trend of eating food in restaurants or food in the streets is growing day by day. To measure the influence of foodborne diseases, it is necessary to know that some people, such as teenagers, old men, pregnant women, the immune deficient, those susceptible to serious illness, and those who go through chemical treatment, might be more susceptible to serious illness in contrast to normal people. Predictions show that the number of such type of people is increasing. The lifestyle of inhabitants in the developing world is noxiously evolving due to existing food safety issues. The most well-known definition of ""food security"" is ""access by all individuals at all times to enough and suitable food to give the vitality and supplements expected to keep up a dynamic and sound life."" ""Food biosecurity"" is the concept of food protection from biological hazards. Food security deals with the proactive precautionary measures against deliberate or accidental contamination of food that can cause harm and disruption. Eventually, it may lead to severe health care issues and to an economic outcry. Such events may be planned at different levels of the food chain by a violent group, a lone ""copycat"" person, or criminal activity. Such malicious activities can be focused on food items, production, and transportation processes. The aim of food and agricultural biosecurity is to alleviate the chances of introduction of exotic pests, pathogens, or their derived toxins in the food chain or in the environment.

Thus the only way to control the spread of these diseases is to prevent exposure and further transmission. Isolation and quarantine are two control measures that help block transmission by isolating the individuals who have, or may have, the contagious disease. ""Isolation"" describes separating sick individuals (symptomatic) from people who are not sick (naïve) while quarantine pertains to the practice of separating and restricting the movement of asymptomatic individuals who may have been exposed to the disease to see whether they become sick. These control measures aim to progressively reduce the number of new secondary infections until the disease is eradicated from the population. Formally, we can measure the effect of isolation and quarantine by taking a survey of new infected cases and deriving the basic reproduction number R of the infectious disease for each step of the outbreak. Without any intervention, R is expected to eventually decrease as the number of susceptible individuals decreases in a finite population without migration. However, by the time the rate decreases to R < 1, a large proportion of the population has already been infected with the disease. By ""removing"" potentially infected individuals from the population, isolation and quarantine can more rapidly decrease R below 1 by reducing the incidence of the disease, leading to fewer new infected cases capable of transmitting the infection.",18.924937359720076,12.371287814061205

Or consider the Ebola virus, which has a similar history. The disease first came to international attention in 1976, when it appeared around the Ebola River in what was then called Zaire. The virus infects people, gorillas, chimpanzees, and monkeys, causing severe internal and external hemorrhaging and leading to death in up to 90 percent of its human victims. Human infection spreads quickly, especially via caregivers and people who flee an area to escape the illness. Since the disease first appeared, succes-sive human outbreaks have been recorded in Côte d'Ivoire, Gabon, Sudan, and Uganda. But humans have not been the only victims; lowland gorillas and chimpanzees in Gabon and Congo and chimpanzees in western equatorial Africa have been decimated by the sickness. Other forest animals, such as duikers (small antelopes) and bush pigs may also be affected. When subsistence hunters discover a sick or dead animal in the forest, they view it as good fortune and bring it home to feed their families or trade with their neighbors. The Ebola virus then easily infects those handling the meat, and a chain of contacts and infections ensue. Each of the human outbreaks in central Africa during the late 1990s and the first years of this century was traced to humans handling infected great apes.",19.56023911023501,11.896972811068366

The Role of Wildlife in our Understanding of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza","Low pathogen avian influenza (LPAI) is endemic in wild migratory waterfowl populations. Best theories suggest that LPAI H5N1 moved from wild birds to domestic fowl, and in 1997, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 was first identified as a disease of domestic fowl that spread to people in close contact with them in Hong Kong. The resurgence of this disease in Southeast Asia in 2004 brought a new wave of poultry and human deaths. One must study the cultural and agricultural practices in Asia to understand how this disease might mutate to a highly pathogenic form in domestic fowl, how it might spread to humans, and how it might jump back to wild migratory waterfowl. Religious practices, such as merit bird releases, bring people and passerine birds into intimate contact. The popular practice of cockfighting results in people moving these birds across vast regions and caring for injured cocks, which then results in human contact with bird blood and body fluids. It is common practice for people in rural areas to live in close proximity with their domestic animals, often times sharing room in the home or nearby. It is a typical scene to see cattle, ducks, chickens, and pigs living in or very near a family dwelling. The methods in which ducks are raised can include providing access to recently harvested rice paddies, where mixing with wild birds is commonplace. The aquatic environment is an excellent media for the persistence of viable avian influenza virus.",18.10467064396196,11.515329629237241

Addressing this issue in decision making involves predicting to what extent the beneficiary of a decision will like or dislike attributes or outcomes of the decision. Because cultures differ in what they value, they will differ in their appraisals of how good or bad particular options are. For example, residents of former frontier regions in the United States are more likely to choose unique names for their babies, possibly because frontier environments fostered an ethos of independence which in turn may have led people to value uniqueness (Varnum & Kitayama, 2011) . U.S. residents in regions with higher pathogen prevalence tend to vote less for third-party candidates, possibly because higher pathogen prevalence seems to encourage value for conformity (Varnum, 2013) .

Therefore, the IEIP pneumonia surveillance system in Thailand was set up in 20 hospitals in two provinces that serve a population of 1.2 million people. In contrast, in rural Kenya, people with pneumonia do not often go to hospital and so communitybased surveillance is more appropriate. To accomplish this, surveillance officers collect data about approximately 62 000 individuals by visiting their households every 2 weeks. Building the necessary surveillance infrastructure requires training of surveillance personnel; creating systems and procedures for the collection, transmission, and storage of data; building epidemiological and laboratory capacity within the country; and developing high-quality reference laboratory testing.

Such problems have occurred as recently as last year, when outbreaks of typhus, hepatitis A, tuberculosis, trench fever, and Shigella bacteria were reported among people experiencing homelessness in US cities with large homeless populations. 7 There are some additional issues, which are unique to people experiencing homelessness, to consider with regards to COVID-19. Homeless populations might be more transient and geographically mobile than individuals in the general population, 8 making it difficult to track and prevent transmission and to treat those who need care. COVID-19 was recently found to be transmittable via the oral-faecal route. 9 Some major US cities with large homeless populations, like San Francisco, have experienced issues with public defecation, which might pose an additional transmission risk for people experiencing homelessness and other individuals. Together, the multitude of potential vulnerabilities and risks for people experiencing homelessness in becoming infected, needing care, and transmitting COVID-19 cannot be ignored and must be planned for. Some lessons can be learned from the response to severe acute respiratory syndrome among homeless service providers nearly two decades ago. 10 Testing kits and training on how to recognise COVID-19 should be widely disseminated to homeless service providers and deployed in shelters, encampments, and street outreach. Alternative spaces might be needed to quarantine and treat people experiencing homelessness.",20.7415560629165,8.886617257313782

From this perspective places can be seen as the effect of the folding of spaces, times, things, people and events (Hetherington, 1997, p. 197) through the arrangement and synthesis of diverse representations, artefacts, identities, language, memories, sensations and emotions (Doel, 1996; Massey, 1993) .

Consequently, people wore facemasks as a preventive measure against infection and, more importantly, to avoid, by adopting this behaviour, moral condemnation. The unfavourable experiences of being stigmatized as 'virus spreaders' and of being isolated throughout the treatment process during the SARS outbreak had a long-lasting impact on the participants. Because of such experience, the participants searched for all possible means to avoid similar moral blame in future epidemics, which motivated them to practise tai chi. The participants were not working merely towards protecting their own health by practising tai chi (or by wearing facemasks during the SARS outbreak); they were also working for the sake of the people in their social network.

In regular events like the Hajj, where prior permissions are granted on the basis of medical and security check-ups, administration may succeed to deny the entry to the infected people. But in non-regular events like rallies and processions, it is not feasible to scrutinise participants. Thus, the event managers must have a framework to deal with sick and infected people to safeguard the health of the participants. On the other hand, in some instances, medical reports can be compromised and infected people may succeed to secure a false certificate of health. These are calls for the organisers of recurring events like Kumbh and the Hajj should seriously revise their policies on sick people and progressively consider allowing them to perform the pilgrimage. For it to be accomplished, the organisers must make special arrangements to segregate the sick, infected and terminally ill people for performing their pilgrimages. In doing so, the sick and infected people will come forward to avail the special facilities instead of hiding in the crowds, as the case presently. One of the key elements for a successful organisations and management of crowded events is to know the kind of participants, and accordingly have definite plans for their management. Having basic knowledge about the health of all pilgrims is essential for a successful management of crowded events. Spread of a communicable disease in a crowded event may have devastating results. However, all of these considerations and concessions shouldn't apply in cases of diseases like EBOLA which are difficult to contain, until a satisfactory way of preventing their spread is discovered.

This has been the essence of free-trade postulation of capitalism in the past couple of hundred years. Everybody felt obliged to buy goods to use them. Hence, now we have a market for everything, and our houses are full of goods that are not frequently used. Thus, a plethora of garage or estate sales, which aim to get rid of these unneeded items, every single day. Everyone is trying to solve their own problem of excessive ownership of goods.

This is especially important since, in cases of unknown disease outbreaks or previously unforeseen catastrophes, people may turn to traditional explanations of disease. Communicators specializing in behaviour change communication and social mobilization have a variety of tools to deal with these issues and so they are often called on during outbreaks. It would be beneficial if these tools were incorporated into general outbreak communication principles. ■ Funding: This paper was funded by WHO.

However, this is no coincidence. Even though the original cryptography algorithm dates to the 1970s (Shiller 2019, 9) , it was not publicly accepted and embraced. The first common and publicly recognized digital money was introduced when people lost their confidence in the monetary system. Look at Barry Popik's case, for example (Zweig 2018) . In September 2008, he was left with $35.98 out of his initial investment of $25,000 in Lehman Brothers, when it went bankrupt. However, this did not happen to investors of several other companies that were bailed out. AIG received emergency liquidity; Merrill Lynch was acquired by Bank of America; and Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns were acquired by JP Morgan Chase, all with the help of the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve Bank. The investors of these financial institutions were lucky in being saved by the U.S. government, but Mr. Popik was not. Thousands of people lost their homes and investments, but other people did not because they received aid. Those were the days when several financial institutions received rescue funds from the government under different names, but Lehman did not. It filed for the largest bankruptcy in American history. Ben Bernanke defends letting Lehman fail in his latest book Firefighting: ""It was a loosely regulated, heavily overleveraged, deeply interconnected nonbank, with too much exposure to the real estate market and too much dangerously runnable short-term financing. What made the story of Lehman different was that it ended in a disaster"" (Bernanke et al. 2019, 59) . However, Americans were not convinced that these institutions deserved this. And Bernanke accepts that the Lehman collapse is ""probably least understood"" by the public. People were hearing the stories about Goldman Sachs, which received $10 billion from the government and paid $14 million in taxes for 2008 (compared with $6 billion in 2007) and paid out more than $11 billion in compensation to its employees (Reuters 2009 ). 9 Henry Paulson, who headed the U.S. Treasury until 2009, was criticized for his bailout plan because he was a Goldman Sachs employee in 2006. Critics saw this as a conflict of interest. As Wall Street Journal reporter Jason Zweig wrote: ""Bad things happened to good people, and good things happened to bad people."" Mr. Popik is still struggling in the courthouse to get his money back, suing over the wrongdoings of managers. However, as of 2018, no top manager is known to have been charged with any bad practices. After millions of people lost their jobs, governments worldwide handpicked the institutions they rescued. As Acemoglu and Robinson rightfully argue in their book: ""This feeling [that the economy is rigged and political system is complicit] was certainly strengthened by the financial crisis and its aftermath, which witnessed government bailouts of banks … while poor households facing bankruptcy received little help"" (Acemoglu and Robinson 2019, 483) .",21.53349714096705,9.235437242346126

While respiratory infections (RI) are very prevalent in humans, there is a striking lack of systematic knowledge on how it affects sleep. We recruited 100 people, among whom 28 became sick with an RI during the study period (fulfilling criteria for influenza-like illness, ILI, or acute respiratory infection, ARI). We measured sick participants' sleep at home, both objectively (actigraphy) and subjectively (diary ratings), for one week as well as four weeks later when healthy. During the week with RI, people spent objectively longer time in bed and had a longer total sleep time compared to the healthy week. During the infection, participants also had more awakenings, but no significant differences in sleep latency or sleep efficiency. While sick, people also reported increased difficulties falling asleep, worse sleep quality, more restless sleep and more shallow sleep, while they did not report sleep to be less sufficient. Most problems occurred at the beginning of the sickness week, when symptoms were strong, and showed signs of recovery thereafter (as indicated by interactions between condition and day/night of data collection for all the 10 sleep outcomes). The degree of symptoms of RI was related to a worse sleep quality and more restless sleep, but not to any of the objective sleep outcomes or the other subjective sleep variables. Having a higher body temperature was not significantly related to any of the sleep variables. This study suggests that having a respiratory infection is associated with spending more time in bed and sleeping longer, but also with more disturbed sleep, both objectively and subjectively. This novel study should be seen as being of pilot character. There is a need for larger studies which classify pathogen type and include baseline predictors, or that manipulate sleep, in order to understand whether the sleep alterations seen during infections are adaptive and whether sleep interventions could be used to improve recovery from respiratory infections.",22.73174751025516,14.888640863475477

How families would cope with the cascading effects from prolonged cancellation of school classes is a concern. Families could face the problem of serious income loss. Most respondents said that at least 1 employed person would have to stay home from work during a pandemic to care for children. Therefore, employers can identify employees who may need to stay home to care for children and determine in advance if those employees could work from home, work staggered shifts, or be trained to take on other responsibilities, or if other employees can be cross-trained to take on some of those job functions. Employers must be prepared for increased absenteeism related to childcare responsibilities.

The elderly Chinese prefer to receive home-based care rather than institutional care since they are accustomed to their current lifestyles, enjoying freedom, comfort, and convenience (Liu et al., 2015) . For physically active elders, staying with their children seems to be beneficial for improving the quality of life, enhancing self-satisfaction, and curtailing the incidence of psychological disorders of the elderly (Zeng, 2012; Zhang and Li, 2011) . For 'empty nest' elders, home care is most appropriate for the physically active individuals, and also desirable for elderly with minor challenges in their daily lives, for the latter who can derive support from their extended families and the local community, or hiring a housemaid (or hourly worker) (Liu et al., 2015) . Community care is cost-effective, with community participation and connectedness, and is needed for elderly with challenges in their daily living. However, in China, even in big cities, there is a lack of available social support services provided by the communities (Liu et al., 2015) .

Malaria has become increasingly an urban disease, as endemic countries lack the capacity to provide the infrastructure for water, sanitation, and dry waste disposal to meet the needs of rapidly expanding informal settlements on the periphery of cities (Utzinger and Keiser, 2006) . In African cities, for example, unplanned suburbs have developed along rivers and lakes; the waterways provide residents with both water for household use and the means to wash away human waste. Urban waterways also provide an ideal environment for vector breeding and a sufficiently dense human population to maintain the cycle of infections such as dengue and malaria. People lack the resources to pay for complete medication, and the partial exposure only of parasites to drugs has resulted in drug resistance and the need therefore to use more expensive second-and third-line drugs. Given that at least 1.2 million people die from malaria each year and that it is pervasive throughout Africa, with continued transmission also in much of Asia, it is not surprising that people have distinctive ideas of its etiology, diagnosis, and treatment. One common feature is that caregivers (primarily mothers) of children consider malaria to be an ordinary fever without serious implications, and accordingly use home-based and village treatment, and local herbalists and drug sellers compete with hospital clinics and pharmacies to sell antimalarials. Delays in treatment seeking, associated with ideas about the normality of fever, contribute to continued severe morbidity and mortality among infants and children from malaria.

One of these is exactly what we would now call isolation. The Old Testament evidences how individuals affected by diseases were separated from others, and people with leprosy, as Leviticus informs, had to live isolated all their lives. In the New Testament, too, leprosy continues to be considered a reason for social discrimination, and is represented as curable only through the phenomenon of a divine intervention. The isolation, temporary or otherwise, of sick people has thus always been extensively used as one of the approaches to limit the spread of disease. 3 Another strategy was the establishment of a time limit to the manifestation of diseases. In the V century B.C. Hippocratic teaching had established that an acute illness only manifested itself within forty days. The case of plague was representative with respect to this; since a disease manifesting itself after 40 days could not be acute, but chronic, it could not be plague. In the ancient past the term pestis (plague) was used in a broad way to indicate every epidemic characterised by high mortality, and magical practices were implemented to fight different diseases since the idea of preventive instruments (such as quarantine) was still not present. 4 With regard to the real plague (the disease caused by Yersinia pestis), one may remember the first great pandemic wave of the Greek -Roman period, and the recurrent epidemics throughout Europe in the VI and VII centuries A.D. Against acute, fatal diseases such as bubonic plague attempts were made by healthy communities to prevent entry of goods and people from infected communities. In the VII century A.D. armed guards were stationed between plague-stricken Provence and the diocese of Cahors. 5 Particularly virulent was the impact of the disease on the whole of Europe in the middle of the XIV century, when the plague spread from southern Europe to Germany and Russia, causing the death of more than 30% of the European population. 6 Medieval laws, Renaissance health achievements and XVI -XVIII centuries overview",25.034110042964297,13.80749086412808

However, during the period of the SARS epidemic in Taiwan, probably due to a lack of knowledge regarding SARS transmission, fear of the SARS outbreak, and pressure from family members, or the lack of adequate personal protective equipment provided by hospitals, many physicians and nurses resigned, resulting in a shortage of staff in many hospitals [8] . To increase health professionals' ability and willingness to provide quality care to SARS patients and affirm their ethical duty to care for the sick, it is important for health care administrators to develop and deploy procedures to maximize the safety of frontline nurses. Therefore, there is an urgent need to investigate the predictors of nurses' intention and volunteering to care for SARS patients, so that these can be applied to design sequential continuing education programs to improve nurses' confidence in caring for patients in future emerging infectious disease epidemics.",20.72734698235767,12.626554960041462

Ninety-eight percent of all homes were affected, 50% severely and 20% completely destroyed. 9 The Peace Corps brought in large numbers of prefabricated housing to replace all the destroyed homes. Although they were able to help a lot of people numerically, the homes they provided had two-sided pitched roofs instead of the typical Caribbean four-sided roofs that were better able to withstand tropical winds. They also did not have an interior design to allow for cross ventilation. The early recipients of the homes reported this finding to the Peace Corps, but the Peace Corps was unable to change the design.

This can be seen in the changes to the framing of responsibility that occurred when the disease seemed closer. The dominant Killer metaphor gave SARS an 'active' role. It was a free agent responsible for its actions; those it infects were passive, blameless victims. This pattern of responsibility differs from the emphasis on individual culpability apparent in the blame and stigma linked with AIDS, syphilis and some other diseases. However, where people infected with SARS threatened to bring the disease into the country an alternative metaphor system-DISEASE IS A POSSESSION-was often used, particularly in the tabloid press. In this metaphorical schema, people catch, carry, pick up, get, have, bring, acquire or contract disease, which is a burden they have got, and can give or pass on to others, unless they are relieved of it or have it taken away. It emphasises individual culpability in disease. In the SARS coverage, it blended with similarly valenced grammatical forms, in which the sick person became the active agent in their illness (person X becomes or falls ill; is or becomes infected with or by Y). A good example is The Daily Mail report on the 'First Briton to get 'flu' killer bug in the UK': a person who 'contracts' SARS, and 'becomes infected', although the virus remains a 'killer' (14/4/03). Other newspapers used headlines such as: 'Fifth Briton Brings Home Deadly Virus', and 'Nurses In Alert' ''Not Likely'' To Have SARS'. Thus, when SARS became an immediate threat the 'victim' became a 'carrier' or 'case': a danger, rather than an object of compassion.",23.96029960960095,12.562274091914105

This scepticism stems from several recent analyses of pandemic plans, which have demonstrated that, while ethical considerations and guidance have been incorporated into many pandemic plans, underlying ethical reasoning and justifications remain largely absent. Pandemic planning requires numerous assumptions to be made regarding, among other things, the severity of the pandemic, the supply and availability of health care resources, and the availability of information regarding who is at risk and who can benefit (Prehn and Vawter 2008) . Variations in these underlying assumptions can have profound implications for ethical reasoning and justification, which may ultimately affect the nature and scope of ethics guidance included in a plan. As such, it is not surprising that considerable variety exists among plans in the attention paid to guidance for ethical decision-making (Prehn and Vawter 2008; McDougall 2010) . Indeed, many pandemic plans do not contain any ethical guidance at all (Prehn and Vawter 2008) . Of course, this is problematic not only for ethics preparedness for infectious disease pandemics beyond influenza, but for influenza pandemics as well. And while numerous ethics guidance documents and a substantial scholarly literature exist that can be drawn upon in the event of a pandemic (e.g., University of Toronto Joint Centre for Bioethics 2005; Kinlaw and Levine 2007; National Ethics Advisory Committee 2007; World Health Organization 2007 , 2008b Jennings and Arras 2008) , this should not be seen as a replacement for the integration of robust ethics guidance within pandemic plans themselves, as many of the decisions governments and health practitioners will make in preparing for and responding to pandemics will ostensibly be derived from their own jurisdiction's pandemic plan and the ethical guidance therein.",21.319644615611075,10.4873819807631

The green line shows the results of the hospital group, and the purple line shows the results when all of the infected people stay home. (We assumed that infected people make a random decision during the infectious period.) The number of infected people is much lower in the scenario where most of the infected people decide to go to hospital. In the case of all infected people staying home (purple line), the infection spreads very quickly because many people have already spread the disease before they decide to stay home. In other words, the efficiency of transmission prevention is low if infected patients stay home, and no other measures such as work stoppages and school closures are taken during the early stage of the outbreak. The red line (case 6) shows the results when 90% of the infected patients stay home and the other 10% take no measures. The percentage of infected people increases to 57% of the population after 115 days if there are no other controls.

Its purpose is to provide conditions that stimulate and support salutogenesis and the inherent healing and wellness capacities of the participants. In short, it is a place that delivers HOPE (healing-oriented practices and environments) and integrates them into all aspects of care. OHE is an organizing concept or heuristic framework that is applicable to all health professionals, patients and their families and significant others, healthcare organizations, and healthcare systems. Consistent with its preventive, restorative, and palliative role, it is also adaptable to schools, worksites, and community locations. It is a way of connecting the core concept of salutogenesis to many models of healthcare and service deliveries that share similar goals and philosophies. Such models include relationship-centered care, patient-centered care, family-centered care, holistic care, integrative medical care, the medical home, and worksite wellness and optimal learning environments. 1 This updated version of OHE is grounded in what we now know are the core elements of human flourishing. Once people have the requirements of survival (what Maslow called the ""basic and physiological requirements"" of food, water, safety, and shelter), the next level for self-actualization and human flourishing involves an additional set of basic needs common to all people. These needs are psychological resilience, social cohesion, physical movement and rest, healthy exposure to substances in the diet and environment, and meaningful activity that contributes to society beyond oneself. We call these the pillars of human flourishing, and they create the framework for understanding an OHE 10 ( Figure 1 ). These pillars facilitate human flourishing via the emergence of the optimal level of human functioning under any circumstances.

Consequently, the persons they have been in close contact with, for example, families, colleagues or schoolmates may be isolated to avoid further possible spread of the disease. Such home isolation has serious social and psychological influences. In some cases, those who break home isolation may be punished by imposing a fine. People who were victims of SARS in 2003 were accused of hindering the prevention or treatment of sudden disease outbreaks if they broke such isolation. It is normal to expect that quarantine will cause fears, and people will lose their patience and self-restraint, but we should assume that all people were originally infected by others with a few recent exceptions infected by laboratory medical research.

All the people they blamed were just being human, but foreigners are convenient targets. The Chinese government was so concerned about the image of China that it is rumoured that persons were threatened by death in case they transmitted the disease to foreign countries. 10 If we view the work of medicine a sacred vocation, an inner calling to dedicate and care for the sick, it is contradictory to imagine some medical doctors may be accused of giving rise to a great loss of our society.

Medical notices will need to be distributed in multiple languages; people will need ways to communicate to loved ones and to describe symptoms to medical personnel in their own language. • Security personnel must be prepared to fight against a pandemic not only from the medical perspective, but also from the marketing/information perspective. Because the public may well panic it is important that the tourism industry be prepared to offer concrete and credible information. This information should be given to the public almost immediately. Every tourism office should have an information plan ready should a pandemic occur in its area. Develop creative Websites so that people can gain information any time of the day and without regard to where they may be located. • Security personnel must be prepared to counter negative publicity with an action program. For example, in areas that have been impacted by a disease, make sure to advise travelers to stay current with their vaccinations and create medical information sheets. It is essential that the public know where to go for information, as well as what is true versus what is false. For travelers who may not be up-to-date with current shots, offer lists of doctors and clinics willing to accept traveler's insurance. • An up-to-date first-aid kit and proper preventative procedures at hotels and other places of lodging. For example, make sure that employees use antibacterial hand wipes and encourage hotels to provide these for travelers. • Security personnel must be prepared to work with travel insurance companies. In case of a pandemic, travelers may not receive value for money and may desire to either cancel a trip or cut it short. The best way to maintain good will is by working with such organizations as the United States Travel Industry Association (in Canada, it is called Travel and Health Industry Association of Canada). Develop travel health programs with these organizations so that visitors feel financially protected. • Be prepared to work with the media. A pandemic is like any other tourism crisis and should be treated as such. Prepare for it before it strikes. If it should occur, set your action plan in place and make sure that you work 184 Tourism Security with the media. Finally, have a recovery plan set so that once the crisis has abated you can begin a financial recovery program. The bottom line is that air travel may not produce illnesses, but the transfer of large numbers of people from one place to the next may be a source of worry not only for medical authorities, but also for tourism security professionals.",24.842528914186893,13.095400759747363

Pandemics are different from seasonal outbreaks or epidemics of influenza. Seasonal outbreaks are caused by subtypes of influenza viruses that are already in existence among people, whereas pandemics are caused by new subtypes or by subtypes that have never circulated among people or that have not circulated among people for a long time. The subtypes differ based upon certain proteins on the surface of the virus (the hemagglutinin or the HA protein and the neuraminidase or the NA protein). The appearance of a new influenza A virus subtype is the first step toward a pandemic, but the new virus subtype must also have the ability to spread easily from person to person to cause a pandemic. 1 Many scientists believe it is only a matter of time until the next influenza pandemic occurs. 2 However, the timing and the severity of the next pandemic cannot be predicted. Modeling studies suggested that its effect in the United States could be severe. In the absence of any control measures (vaccination or drugs), a medium-level pandemic could cause 89 000 to 207 000 deaths, between 314 000 and 734 000 hospitalizations, 18 to 42 million outpatient visits, and another 20 to 47 million people being sick. Between 15% and 35% of the US population could be affected. 3 The numbers of health care workers (HCWs) and first responders available to work can be expected to be reduced; they will be at high risk of illness through exposure in the community and in the health care settings, and some may have to miss work to care for ill family members (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] .

The model includes immunization of susceptible people (S), quarantine (Q) of exposed people (E), isolation (J) of infectious people (I), a recovered population (R), and variation in population size due to natural births and deaths and deaths of infected people. It is shown analytically that the model has a disease-free equilibrium state which always exists and an endemic equilibrium state which exists if and only if the disease-free state is unstable. A simple formula is obtained for a generalized reproduction number R g where, for any given initial population, R g < 1 means that the initial population is locally asymptotically stable and R g > 1 means that the initial population is unstable. As special cases, simple formulas are given for the basic reproduction number R 0 , a disease-free reproduction number R d f , and an endemic reproduction number R en . Formulas are derived for the sensitivity indices for variations in model parameters of the disease-free reproduction number R d f and for the infected populations in the endemic equilibrium state. A simple formula in terms of the basic reproduction number R 0 is derived for the critical immunization level required to prevent the spread of disease in an initially disease-free population. Numerical simulations are carried out using the Matlab program for parameters corresponding to the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Beijing, Hong Kong, Canada and Singapore in 2002 and 2003 .

Some ferrets eat meat baby foods, especially liver and chicken, and most drink milk. Milk causes loose stool in normal ferrets and in those with colitis, but it is very palatable. If milk fat is increased to 10% to 20% with cream, it appears to be absorbed well and contributes to weight gain even though diarrhea continues.

Many ferrets like the human food supplements such as Ensure Plus (Abbott Laboratories, Ross Products Division, Columbus, OH), Boost Plus (formerly Sustacal; Bristol Myers, Evansville, IN), or Isocal HN (Mead Johnston, Evansville, IN), and they sometimes eat softened pellets mixed with one of these products when they refuse pellets alone. Alternatively, offer nutritional recovery foods such as Maximum-Calorie (The Iams Company, Dayton, OH) or Canine a/d (Hill's Pet Nutrition); most sick ferrets accept these foods readily. Nutritional recovery diets such as Max-Cal can be used as the sole source of nutrition for weeks at a time if necessary. When using these diets, calculate a minimum daily intake of 400 kcal per kilogram of body weight. Sick ferrets may not make the effort to get up and drink from a water bottle but do usually drink from a dish. Offer fresh food and water by hand several times daily during hospitalization and home care; ferrets often take a few mouthfuls of every new offering but never go back for more.

This data is consistent with previous studies that have found that older people who live in low-income neighborhoods in the Bronx and Brooklyn are more likely than older residents of other boroughs to report individual health problems and express concerns about their built and social environments. 21 It is important to update the SVI on a regular basis since the demographics and characteristics of the population are changing. Therefore, in this study, the statistics used for calculation of SVI were based on regularly available sources of official statistics, rather than from ad hoc surveys. These statistics are routinely collected, There are other factors that may affect the vulnerability of the older people. For example, the cluttered living environment or housings without escalator service may hinder the evacuation of older people from their own homes or institutions during emergencies or from seeking medical advice and care. However, these factors may not be quantified by regular official statistics, and they were excluded from the SVI. Moreover, the influence of some factors may change over time. For example, the low education level among the older people in Hong Kong may become irrelevant several decades from now because the future cohorts of older people may have benefited from the mandatory education policy implemented in the late 1970s. Meanwhile, with the rising number of new immigrants from South Asia and a variety of cities from China, who may not be proficient in Cantonese, Mandarin, or English, language isolation may be an emerging issue.

Most of these cases are chronically infected and 20% develop severe liver disease, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. A major obstacle in the treatment and control of HCV lies in the error-prone replicative machinery, which increases the genetic variability of HCV within an individual, resulting in quasispecies. Antiviral therapies have helped manage the disease; however, they have several disadvantages, including a low rate of response and toxicity. Similar to HIV, the correlates of protection against HCV are not well understood. There is, however, an appreciation of the need to induce neutralizing antibodies (nAb) and CD4þ and CD8þ T cells to multiple HCV antigens. However, for the humoral response, it remains largely unknown which epitopes are important for nAb to target leading to sterilizing immunity (Tellinghuisen et al., 2007; von Hahn et al., 2007) .",22.68487256631002,13.685196259147531

All patients underwent clinical and blood tests aimed at identifying the possible pathogen. All possible close contacts with sick people were asked to visit within 24 h of onset of symptoms: in detail, 'close contacts' were considered in those who had shared rooms and people visiting patients routinely. These people, if asymptomatic, were monitored daily at the clinic in the following 7 days. The prevention measures adopted by the IHF team were put in place at the time of detection of the third case of febrile syndrome. The implementation of the preventive measures such as air isolation, contact tracing, and active clinical surveillance of close contacts allowed to get evident decrease of the number of cases and rapid control of the outbreak within about two weeks. Interestingly, we believe that a key factor in the management of the epidemic has been the availability of an adequate ratio between the number of subjects evaluated and the size of the medical staff available. In fact, the total health workforce-to-population hosted ratio was 0.026 (17e653).

The subscript i represents the ith day after 23 January 2020, and T is the maximum value of i. What needs to be emphasized here is that F is a feedback function. The meanings of the five equations are explained as follows. As to the first equation, F is impacted by n R , n D and n I together. Here, we set n I + n D + n R = n T , where n T is the number of the total infections (cumulative infections). With the increase of the total number of infected people, we believe that the government will take more stringent measures to control the epidemic, and the people will have a deeper understanding of the epidemic. Therefore, with the growth of n T , F will decline, which represents that the infectious ability of disease in human society is gradually weakened. The second formula shows the law of population growth in the incubation period in unit time. Some people in the incubation period become confirmed patients (infections), and the ratio of this process is α. Some healthy people are still in the incubation period, which is directly affected by the infection index F . The third formula shows the increase in the number of diagnosed infections per unit of time. The proportion of people with a ratio of α changes from incubation period to confirmed patients.

How can the past assist in the real-time management of the crisis? What insights can be gleaned from the ongoing epidemic for future disease preparedness and prevention? Lurking in the background of these interrogatives is a more or less explicit accusation: why haven't past lessons been learned? The gist of some commentaries seems to be: ""there is almost nothing surprising about this pandemic"". 2 The history-as-lessons approach pivots on the assumption that epidemics are structurally comparable events, wherever and whenever they take place. The COVID-19 outbreak ""creates a sense of déjà vu"" with the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). 3 Citing early estimates of the disease's infectiousness, based on an analysis of the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan, 4 comparisons have been drawn with the 1918-19 influenza pandemic. 5 Although in some respects the outbreak of COVID-19 presents a compelling argument for why history matters, there are problems with analogical views of the past because they constrain our ability to grasp the complex place-and-time-specific variables that drive contemporary disease emergence. A lessons approach to epidemics produces what Kenneth Burke, borrowing from the economist and sociologist Thorstein Veblen, called ""trained incapacity""-""that state of affairs whereby one's very abilities can function as blindnesses"". 6 Habitual modes of thinking can diminish our capacity to make lateral connections. When the present is viewed through the lens of former disease outbreaks, we typically focus on similitudes and overlook important differences. In other words, analogies create blind spots. As Burke commented, ""a way of seeing is also a way of not seeing-a focus on object A involves a neglect of object B"". 6 A lessons approach to the past, which usually comes from outside the discipline of history, reinforces an idea of the past as a series of interlinked crises that offer instructive insights into cause and effect. 7 Historians need to push back against easy analogies and examine the specific contexts of outbreaks, asking, for example, in what ways SARS and COVID-19 are in fact comparable. The designation of the new virus as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by Over the past 7 years, China's President Xi Jinping has sought to extend Chinese influence abroad while tightening his grip on power at home. 10 Some would argue that this enhanced authority has enabled him to put in place draconian, Mao-style infectious dis ease containment measures including the lockdown of cities. 11 Bruce Aylward, a senior adviser to WHO's Director-General who co-led the WHO-China Joint Mission on COVID-19 in late February, 2020, praised China's efforts as ""probably the most ambitious, and I would say, agile and aggressive disease containment effort in history"". 12 Meanwhile, the protests in Hong Kong from June, 2019, have been a reaction to a perceived erosion of the territory's quasi-autonomy as a special administrative region. While ostensibly an anti-government protest against the introduction of an extradition bill, the Hong Kong protests could be viewed as an attempt to push back against Xi's expansion of central power. 13 Concurrently, a US-China trade war instigated by President Donald Trump's imposition of tariffs on China in 2018 is hitting the Chinese economy. 14 The COVID-19 outbreak is compounding this economic situation, holding out the potential for a global recession with major disruption to global supply chains. 15 Taken together, these entangled circumstances have created a unique setting in which the COVID-19 outbreak is evolving. In an interview with the Hong Kong newspaper Ming Pao, the physician Joseph Sung, who had a leading role in the fight to contain SARS in 2003, underscored the striking differences between Hong Kong society then and now. ""At that time, society was more united"", Sung said of the SARS era, ""whereas now people feel they have to rely on themselves for protection. They have less trust in the government"". 16 Analogies of COVID-19 are rarely extended to encompass these intermeshing social and political environments. The lessons approach skates over this history, even as history's expediency as a tool for instruction is flaunted. Historians need to contest false analogies that obscure, rather than elucidate, the social processes partly driving new infections. They need to challenge efforts to corral and straitjacket the past into summary lessons. By contrast, espousing an anti-lessons approach to history might prevent trained incapacity. Such an approach could help to ensure a strategic open-mindedness to emergent threats at a time when borders of many kinds are going up across the globe. I declare no competing interests. Recognition of the need for equitable health care for people with disabilities and the need to appropriately educate the health-care workforce has emerged over the past few decades. [1] [2] [3] Although people with disabilities experience the same general health-care needs as other people, they are more likely to experience health-care inequities due to the inadequate skills and knowledge of health-care providers and inaccessible healthcare facilities. 4 In 2009, an art of medicine essay in The Lancet by Tom Shakespeare and colleagues 5 posited that ""perhaps the most dramatic learning can come when it is a peer who is disabled, rather than a patient"". Medical schools are beginning to consider students with disabilities as a constituent part of their diversity, equity, and inclusion agenda, and several organisations and academic leaders from around the world are now offering formal guidance to medical schools, with the goal of fully realising the value that people with disabilities bring to medical education. [6] [7] [8] [9] We share The Lancet's commitment to promoting diversity in medicine 10, 11 and concerns about the structural biases that negatively impact patient care. Health-care disparities for patients with disabilities are universal, and while efforts towards inclusion of more health-care providers with disabilities have been made, there is a global under-representation of clinicians with disabilities (appendix). The barriers to health care for people with disabilities are ingrained. The United Nations 2018 Flagship Report on Disability and Development maintains that ""attitudinal barriers have compromised access to health services for persons with disabilities, as health professionals often have little experience interacting with or providing services to persons with severe and/or complex disabilities, or have negative, stigmatizing attitudes towards these patients"". 12 This segregation of patient and provider, healthy and disabled, has adverse impacts on the wellbeing of people with disabilities and constitutes a barrier to health-care services and education.",19.41543137447396,10.335213098880903

Some of the authors in this review have been closely involved in drafting the Five-year Plan (13th, 2016-2020) (the central government blueprint for China's long-term socioeconomical policies) which suggest that geriatric care should be provided by home care (80%), community care (15%), and institutional care (5%). The elderly Chinese prefer to receive home-based care rather than institutional care since they are accustomed to their current lifestyles, enjoying freedom, comfort, and convenience (Liu et al., 2015) . For physically active elders, staying with their children seems to be beneficial for improving the quality of life, enhancing self-satisfaction, and curtailing the incidence of psychological disorders of the elderly (Zeng, 2012; Zhang and Li, 2011) . For 'empty nest' elders, home care is most appropriate for the physically active individuals, and also desirable for elderly with minor challenges in their daily lives, for the latter who can derive support from their extended families and the local community, or hiring a housemaid (or hourly worker) (Liu et al., 2015) . Community care is cost-effective, with community participation and connectedness, and is needed for elderly with challenges in their daily living. However, in China, even in big cities, there is a lack of available social support services provided by the communities (Liu et al., 2015) . Recently, the 'aging-in-place', a home and community care combined concept has been suggested as a good way to meet the aging challenges in China (Liu et al., 2015; Wu, 2009) . To establish and expand this 'aging-in-place' system, we suggest that the government establishes an elderly-friendly community, including renovation of house facilities, recruitment of social work volunteers, establishing community medical service (family-doctor oriented primary care), and providing high-quality affordable home care services from both public and private sectors.",27.86786281912985,15.28832476682774

In China, family support is an old tradition and is the prevailing way to take care of old people, which is executed by their children with filial piety ["" (xiào)"" in Chinese]. In recent decades, the '4-2-1' (four grandparents, two parents, and one child) family structure emanated from the onechild policy leading to a series of challenges (Hongwei et al., 2008) . For people born in compliance with the one-child policy after 1980, it is likely that they have to care for two parents and four grandparents by themselves. The speedy economic growth in China over these years is rapidly inducing a series of socioeconomic changes, including the over 200 million rural-to-urban migrants who move to and temporarily live in cities with the intention to grasp better employment opportunities (Zou et al., 2014) . This urban migration combined with an expanding trend in young couples of living separately from their parents, giving rise to the 'empty nest' phenomenon, is common not only in rural areas but also in urban cities, with a prevalence rate of 31.8% in 2010 (Liu et al., 2015; Liu and Guo, 2008; Zou et al., 2014) .

Accordingly, it should be anticipated that the NHS (in common with all health systems around the world) will need to revert to emergency arrangements. These are laid out in further detail in Operational Guidance for Health Service Planners 4 , the UK Operational Framework for stockpiling, distributing and using antiviral drugs in the event of pandemic influenza 5 and in the Primary Care Operational Plan. With regard to the delivery of medical care for patients with influenza this is normally achieved through: • GP treatment of community patients 'well' enough to be managed in the community • hospital care in acute medicine for persons considered too ill to be managed at home. In the event of a pandemic, the following additional care settings may have to be considered as the threshold for hospital admission rises: • Treatment of patients in the community (who would normally receive care from a GP) by other health-care professionals (nurses, paramedics, pharmacists etc.) following treatment guidance laid out in this publication and using Prescription-only medicines according to Patient Group Directives (PGDs). • Treatment of patients in their own homes or in temporary intermediate care facilities by a GP, following treatment guidance laid out in this publication when, under normal circumstances, such patients would have been admitted for hospital care. • Treatment of severely ill patients in hospital by medical and nursing teams who do not normally manage patients with influenza or community-acquired pneumonia, in areas of the hospital not normally used for providing medical care (for example, surgical teams and bed space diverted from routine elective work towards pandemic response).",20.630612194834274,12.89298237274522

Logic dictates that this goal can be accomplished by mosquito proofing of dwellings. People who are immobilized by illness are more likely to be at home or in a hospital than people who do not feel ill; transmission from homes and hospitals therefore should tend to involve relatively virulent variants. When such dewllings are mosquito-proof, however, vectors cannot gain access to the severely ill people who are incapacitated inside these dewllings. The vectors will instead transmit pathogens from those infected people who feel healthy enough to get up out of bed and walk outdoors. These pathogens should tend to be relatively benign. The vector proofing of dwellings therefore should favor transmission of the benign strains from people in the outside environment instead of transmission of the more virulent strains that infect the bed-ridden. This favoring of benign strains through the mosquito proofing of dewllings would be manifested as an evolutionary decline in virulence.",20.127702867619487,12.652242500058115

Previous public health emergencies have created the need for compulsory enforcement of public health measures but also raise legal and ethical questions. Is it fair, for example, to require compulsory vaccinations? Some may argue that exposing a person to the risk of adverse effect of a hastily concocted vaccine in a pandemic situation is an unfair proposition. One publication speaks against exposing someone to the unknown because ""(d)ue to the preventive nature of vaccines, in contrast to therapeutic treatment of existing disease, it is difficult to determine with confidence if an unvaccinated person will in fact contract disease."" 137 Still, case law, such as Jacobson v. Massachusetts affirms the government's right to require people to be vaccinated depending on the circumstances of the day, and the courts generally have acted in deference to public health officials in determining when vaccinations are compulsory. 138 What has been articulated less clearly in the current environment is the ""duty to care"" of health care providers in the event of an outbreak that poses significant risk to the health and life of those providers. 122 In the face of this risk, the underlying principle of beneficence dictates that doctors have a duty to care for patients in time of need, even if doing so would endanger the doctor's own well-being. The CDC has declared that the issue of duty to care is of central importance in pandemic planning and response. 139 However, the historical and ethical obligation of health care providers to care for the sick must be balanced against the limited number of professionals available to treat patients now and in the future, the medical necessity of services rendered by particular specialties, and the individual doctor's rights to life and health. 140 Can an employee be forced to get a flu shot?",22.96754929795099,12.027455356528176

In the USA, about 3.5 million adults and children experience homelessness every year, and over 800,000 individuals are homeless at any one time. 1 About 82,000 people in Los Angeles County and more than 35,000 people in New York City live in shelters or on the street. 2, 3 In Canada, tens of thousands of people are homeless; in Toronto, Ontario, about 5,000 individuals are homeless on any given night. 4, 5 Facilities that provide services for homeless people, including shelters, drop-in centers, and soup kitchens, are at increased risk of disease outbreaks. This risk is due to factors such as crowding and inadequate ventilation; large numbers of transient clients, many with increased susceptibility to infection; and suboptimal access to health care. Previous studies of outbreaks among homeless people have focused on infections such as tuberculosis and seasonal influenza. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] The goal of outbreak response management is to mitigate the effects of the infectious disease on the affected and prevent its spread to others. International guidelines provide a roadmap for risk assessment, surveillance, and mobilization of services in response to an outbreak in the general population. 11 The outbreak control measures implemented in the general population of Toronto and Beijing during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak have been well-described. [12] [13] [14] However, the SARS outbreak also demonstrated that homeless people pose special challenges when an emerging outbreak occurs in the general population. The transmission of SARS to homeless individuals was a serious concern in Toronto. Agencies providing services for homeless people felt inadequately prepared to respond to the crisis and struggled to obtain guidance and assistance. Fortunately, no homeless person in Toronto contracted SARS. Nonetheless, service providers and public health officials subsequently recognized the need for a planning framework specific to the homeless population to guide future preparedness efforts. The goals of this paper are to identify the unique challenges related to homeless people that arose during the SARS outbreak and to outline lessons learned that could contribute to planning for future outbreaks.",19.69369229683798,10.729656060073102

As one participant noted, ''all the information that came out was basically for schools or acute care.'' Other participants stated that it was difficult to know how to manage novel H1N1 patients in this setting without guidance: One specific occupational health issue that focus group participants felt needs to be addressed is how to manage or prevent ill health care providers coming to work sick. As one participant stated, ''As much as you tell [health care workers] not to come to work sick, they still come.. We cannot allow employees to work sick, even with seasonal flu.'' Money may be one potential reason that employees may work when sick. As one participant explained it, ''Sometimes people will say, ÔI can't afford not to work.Õ '' Another focus group participant agreed and added, ''It's hard to keep people off work when they are sick.'' Focus group participants indicated that more administrative support and better human resource policies are needed related to furloughing staff and sick leave practices during pandemics.

Another participant agreed and added, ''Of course the hospitals don't want to hear that you're not going to let the staff work.'' One focus group member stated that her human resource department was hesitant to furlough employees due to novel H1N1 because it would cost the hospital money. She was told by human resources, ' compensation] would not cover occupational exposures to [novel H1N1] because it's also out in the community.'' There was also some confusion about and hesitancy to enforce the CDC-recommended 7-day furlough period for staff infected with novel H1N1. As one participant stated,''We had more people who wanted to come back sooner than 7 days.'' Occupational health issues were present in the community, as well. Companies were hesitant to allow employees to return to work without some reassurance from the medical community that the employee was no longer contagious. As one participant explained, ''We had employers calling up the emergency departments and saying, ÔI want this person tested, and they need to have a negative before we're going to allow them to come back to work.Õ '' This created a lot of extra and unnecessary work for hospitals and health care agencies.",35.86203805918025,17.17424164722447

In the 1980s and 1990s, the etiology of NHAP was considered to be similar to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). This belief was reflected in CAP guidelines until 2005 when the designation healthcare-associated pneumonia or HCAP was introduced and nursing home residents were included in the HCAP category. Patients in the HCAP group were thought to be at high risk for pneumonia because of multidrug resistant organisms and required empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy much like people with hospital-acquired infection. Subsequent studies of the etiology of NHAP using sophisticated diagnostic testing found limited evidence of resistant organisms such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or resistant gram-negative organisms or atypical organisms. In terms of management of NHAP in the nursing home there are several considerations that are discussed: hospitalization decision, initial oral or parenteral therapy, timing of switch to an oral regimen if parenteral therapy is initially prescribed, duration of therapy with an emphasis on shorter courses, and follow-up during therapy including the use of the ""antibiotic time out"" protocol. The oral and parenteral antibiotic regimens recommended for treatment of NHAP in this report are based on limited information because there are no randomized controlled trials to define the optimum regimen. In conclusion, most residents with pneumonia can be treated successfully in the nursing home.

Men were less often affected, it is conjectured, because they ate primarily other body parts. It has been postulated that the epidemic began when a member of the tribe died of a sporadic case of CJD, and the disease was then spread to others through cannibalism. Through the efforts of missionaries, cannibalism ceased many years ago and the disease has become progressively rarer.

A comparison of the ages at which people in Britain contracted sporadic CJD during the last 25 years with that of the ages of the first 21 cases of nvCJD is shown in Fig. 9 .13A. Sporadic CJD is primarily a disease of people in their 50s, 60s, and 70s, with a peak of occurrence in the early 60s. Cases in people under 40 are rare. Variant CJD to date has been a disease of young people, primarily people in their teens, 20s, and early 30s. Symptomology also differs. Sporadic CJD is characterized by dementia as an early symptom, whereas variant CJD Anderson et al.

Third, time to death averages somewhat longer in variant CJD than in sporadic CJD.

Also shown in this figure for comparison are the number of cases of sporadic CJD each year in Britain; the rise in the number of cases of sporadic CJD reported over this time frame is probably due to increased recognition of CJD disease, catalyzed in part by the nvCJD epidemic.

Some cities have free-care clinics or community health centers that provide ambulatory services for homeless persons as well as other low-income residents. In 161 U.S. cities, federally-funded Health Care for the Homeless Programs have established multidisciplinary teams of physicians, nurses, social workers, and outreach workers that provide care to homeless people on the street and in shelters.

This question raises a number of complex issues. Homeless people, especially those who are chronically homeless, tend to have poor health. However, homelessness is a temporary state, not a permanent trait. As many as 8 millions Americans experience homelessness over a five year period, but most of these episodes of homelessness are quite brief (Link, et al., 1994) . Thus, at any single point in time only a very small proportion of a city's population is without a home. Homeless people would therefore be expected to have a minimal impact on indicators of overall population health, such as health status or mortality rates. Of course, this assumption may be incorrect in urban centers in the developing world, where extremely large numbers of people often live on the street or in encampments. Some have suggested that homelessness may have an adverse effect on public health through the spread of infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis. Compared to the general population, homeless people are clearly at increased risk of developing latent tuberculosis, which is not infectious to others, as well as active tuberculosis, which can infect those who come in close contact with the individual. During tuberculosis outbreaks, shelter residents, shelter staff, and health care providers are at increased risk of becoming infected (Advisory Council for the Elimination of Tuberculosis, 1992a). To date, however, outbreaks of tuberculosis among homeless people have not spread widely within the general population. The threat of tuberculosis is therefore an important health problem for homeless people, but one that has demonstrated relatively limited potential to affect overall population health in urban areas.",19.1840522171067,7.970153582429129

[465] [466] [467] [468] [469] [470] However, data collection and calculation of infection rates have been done for central venous catheter-associated bloodstream infections in patients receiving home infusion therapy [469] [470] [471] [472] [473] and for the risk of blood contact through percutaneous or mucosal exposures, demonstrating that surveillance can be performed in this setting. 474 Draft definitions for home care-associated infections have been developed. 475 Transmission risks during home care are presumed to be minimal. The main transmission risks to home care patients are from an infectious home care provider or contaminated equipment; a provider also can be exposed to an infectious patient during home visits. Because home care involves patient care by a limited number of personnel in settings without multiple patients or shared equipment, the potential reservoir of pathogens is reduced. Infections of home care providers that could pose a risk to home care patients include infections transmitted by the airborne or droplet routes (eg, chickenpox, tuberculosis, influenza), skin infestations (eg, scabies 69 and lice), and infections transmitted by direct or indirect contact (eg, impetigo). There are no published data on indirect transmission of MDROs from one home care patient to another, although this is theoretically possible if contaminated equipment is transported from an infected or colonized patient and used on another patient. Of note, investigations of the first case of VISA in home care 186 and the first 2 reported cases of VRSA 178, 180, 181, 183 found no evidence of transmission of VISA or VRSA to other home care recipients. Home health care also may contribute to antimicrobial resistance; a review of outpatient vancomycin use found that 39% of recipients did not receive prescribed antibiotics according to recommended guidelines. 476 Although most home care agencies implement policies and procedures aimed at preventing transmission of organisms, the current approach is based on the adaptation of the 1996 Guideline for Isolation Precautions in Hospitals, 1 as well as other professional guidance. 477, 478 This issue has proven very challenging to the home care industry, and practice has been inconsistent and frequently not evidence-based. For example, many home health agencies continue to observe ''nursing bag technique,'' a practice that prescribes the use of barriers between the nursing bag and environmental surfaces in the home. 479 Although the home environment may not always appear clean, the use of barriers between 2 noncritical surfaces has been questioned. 480, 481 Opportunites exist to conduct research in home care related to infection transmission risks. 482 I.D.2.d. Other Sites of Health Care Delivery. Facilities that are not primarily health care settings but in which health care is delivered include clinics in correctional facilities and shelters. Both of these settings can have suboptimal features, such as crowded conditions and poor ventilation. Economically disadvantaged individuals who may have chronic illnesses and health care problems related to alcoholism, injected drug use, poor nutrition, and/or inadequate shelter often receive their primary health care at such sites. 483 Infectious diseases of special concern for transmission include tuberculosis, scabies, respiratory infections (eg, N meningitides, S pneumoniae), sexually transmitted and bloodborne diseases (eg, HIV, HBV, HCV, syphilis, gonorrhea), hepatitis A virus, diarrheal agents such as norovirus, and foodborne diseases. 285, [484] [485] [486] [487] A high index of suspicion for tuberculosis and CA-MRSA in these populations is needed; outbreaks in these settings or among the populations they serve have been reported. [488] [489] [490] [491] [492] [493] [494] [495] [496] Patient encounters in these types of facilities provide an opportunity to deliver recommended immunizations and screen for M tuberculosis infection, along with diagnosing and treating acute illnesses. 497 Recommended infection control measures in these nontraditional areas designated for health care delivery are the same as for other ambulatory care settings.

Anthropological literature exists, from previous outbreaks, documenting the cultural practices that affected the spread of Ebola (Hewlett and Hewlett, 2007) . The main concerns relate to how local practices may accelerate the spread of the virus and the need to address these in order to lower infection rates. Ebola is highly contagious, particularly from contamination by bodily fluids. In West Africa, many local customs exist around burial practices that clinicians believe heighten the risk to communities. Common characteristics of these are, the washing of bodies by family members, passing clothing belonging to the deceased to family and the touching of the body (Richards, 2016) . Another concern, as the crisis unfolded, was people attempting to provide home care to victims of the virus. The clinical response was to create isolation units or Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs) in which to assess and treat suspected cases (West & von Saint André-von Arnim, 2014) . Community based care centres were championed by the UK Government but their deployment came late and opinion was divided around their effectiveness. Clinicians regarded ETUs as an essential part of the response and wanted to educate people to discourage them from engaging in what they regarded as deeply unsafe practices, including home care (Walsh and Johnson, 2018) and (MSF, 2015) .",27.778072390132976,12.115069749564768

Hoping Hospital where the second SARS phase originated, was closed on 23 April 2003. Anyone in the hospital when it was closed, including patients, visitors, doctors and other staff members, was quarantined within the hospital for two weeks. Police were sent in to enforce this quarantine, however, after only one day, several health care workers and staff members broke quarantine, escaping by jumping out windows and climbing fences. Lacking faith in the government, scores of doctors and nurses resigned during the epidemic, including 160 in a single week. Despite efforts by Taiwan authorities to contain SARS through strong measures, the government encountered numerous incidents of disobedience and resistance. 21 With over 130,000 Taiwanese under home quarantine during the SARS epidemic, quarantine enforcement proved problematic. For example, after two people suspected of being infected with SARS were found in the Huachang Public Housing Complex, all of the project residents were placed under home quarantine. However, over 200 residents 'disappeared' and had to be asked to return home. During the epidemic, hundreds of people violated quarantine orders. In theory, they faced home video surveillance, fines of NT$60,000 -NT$300,000, or up to two years imprisonment. However, of the many violators, only 286 (0.2 percent) were punished. 22",21.22526425002201,10.35592903154457

Because of the still high importance of the second goal, the groups added that the first goal should be achieved using the minimum number of vaccine doses required to assure that function. This would allow the remaining doses to be used as soon as possible for those at highest risk of death or hospitalization. There was little support for other suggested goals to vaccinate young people first, to use a lottery system, or a first come first served approach as top priorities. (Public Engagement Pilot Program on Pandemic Influenza 2005, 7) Although the NC IOM/DPH Task Force learned much from the PEPPI report, it felt it had not learned enough. The Task Force wanted to establish ethical guidelines for a wide range of scarce medical resources. Vaccines would not be the only scarce medical resource in an influenza pandemic. So too would be antiviral medicines, ventilators, hospital and nursing home beds, masks, and health care professionals' time. Complicating the Task Force's allocation deliberations was the empirical fact that during an influenza pandemic priorities inevitably shift depending on whether prevention of disease (early stages) or treatment of disease (later stages) is central. Thus, the Task Force would need at least two sets of allocation guidelines: one for healthy people who needed vaccines and other preventive measures in order not to get sick; and another for sick people who needed treatment.",32.65740220769844,16.861902963703976

They also expressed willingness to keep their children home from school and to tend the sick in their own homes, provided their families' basic needs were met and they received adequate instructions and supplies for tending their infected loved ones and themselves. Once again, the NC IOM/DPH Task Force was sobered by the fact that during an influenza pandemic, so much would depend on society having well-developed systems to meet people's basic needs and on having adequate reservoirs of community goodwill and public service at hand. But did North Carolina have such systems and reservoirs? Was it realistic, for example, to expect family members to care for their infected relatives? Maybe. But studies indicate that many people would prefer their families not take care of them if they fall victim to an influenza pandemic. Should such studies prove to be true, who would take care of these people and where? Health care facilities would be without enough beds, and thoughts of housing infected people in Superdome-type quarters are frightening. Should people be housed in schools? In churches? In fitness centers? Who should staff these facilities? What about people for whom no one seems to care? As usual, I asked myself why is it that society creates task forces to meet all people's, but especially vulnerable people's, needs during an influenza pandemic or subsequent to a major natural disaster, when that same society ignores and/or neglects meeting vulnerable people's needs in relatively good times? Why is care reserved for moments of crisis? As much as I wanted to pose these fundamental questions to the Task Force, I knew they would serve only to sidetrack it.

Infectious disease outbreaks such as COVID-19, as well as other public health events, can cause emotional distress and anxiety. These feelings of distress and anxiety can occur even in people not at high risk of getting sick, in the face of a virus with which the common people may be unfamiliar. I read publications on ""Vicarious traumatization in the general public, members, and non-members of medical teams aiding in COVID-19 control"" and on ""Traumatization in medical staff helping with COVID-19 control"" with a great interest (Li et al., 2020; Joob and Wiwanitkit, 2020) . Li et al. reported how much people and medical staff suffer from vicarious traumatization and how this vicarious traumatization of non-front-line medical staff is more serious than that of front-line medical staff (Li et al., 2020) . As in South and Southeast Asia countries, also in Italy, there are similar problems in medical staff due to high workload and intermittent lack of protective devices. In addition, some slight form of racism is demonstrated against health care professionals who potentially have a higher risk of being infected and between non-front-line medical staff towards front-line medical staff. We don't have to forget the many doctors and nurses were infected and many of them died due to COVID-19 infection. Also in Italy, local people also have high levels of stress due to no firm estimate of how long pandemic will last and how long our lives will be disrupted or whether or not we or our loved ones will be infected. Previous research has revealed a profound and wide spectrum of psychological impact that outbreaks can inflict on people (Lima et al., 2020) . New psychiatric symptoms in people without mental illness can occur or aggravate the condition of those with pre-existing mental illness and cause distress to the caregivers of affected individuals (Kelvin and Rubino, 2020) . Most health professionals working in isolation units and hospitals very often do not receive any training for providing mental health care (Lima et al., 2020) . Barbisch et al.

Suicidal cases were reported in India (Goyal et al., 2020) but also in other countries, Italy included, where two infected Italian nurses committed suicide in a period of a few days probably due to fear of spreading COVID-19 to patients.

Beginning with pro-democracy protesters ahead of the twentieth anniversary of the handover shrouding the Golden Bauhinia statue in black cloth 1 -in other words, making the statue disappear-Sala and Wasserstrom trace other instances of appearance and disappearance in the city. These include the abduction between October and December 2015 of five booksellers associated with the Mighty Current publishing house, the closing-off of commercial distribution avenues in Hong Kong to the award-winning dystopian film Ten Years (2015), and the ""creeping appearance"" in the city of things chiefly linked to China (the increasing use of Mandarin and the higher profile assumed by personnel and material of the People's Liberation Army). There is also the defiantly persistent appearance of certain things in Hong Kong (the yearly vigil commemorating the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre, replicas of the Goddess of Democracy statue) and the appearance of the Hong Kong-Macau-Zhuhai Bridge off Lantau Island that ""has helped cause a literal disappearance-of the [region's] endangered pink dolphins."" Sala and Wasserstrom's article describes and documents Hongkongers' concerns over these appearances and disappearances. The trepidation about disappearance and loss, however, perhaps outweighs that about the appearance of things previously absent in the city.

Although personalized treatments can help save the lives of sick people, prevention applies to all. ""Precision prevention"" may be helpful in using both science and limited resources for targeting prevention strategies. For example, recent data suggest that knowing the speed with which people metabolize nicotine, based on genetic and other factors, could lead to personalized smoking-cessation interventions. Another approach to precision prevention is increased screening of people at greater risk for cancer. Family health history is an inexpensive tool for identifying individuals and families that require earlier and more intensive screening for breast and ovarian cancer. 5 Although whole genome sequencing in healthy populations will require more evidence for its utility, there is an emerging list of genomic applications that merit a targeted public health approach to find people with selected genetic conditions (e.g., hereditary breast/ovarian and colorectal cancers and familial hypercholesterolemia). Collectively, these conditions affect around 2 million people in the U.S., with evidence-based interventions that are poorly implemented in health care. 6 In addition, new biomarkers promise to improve the understanding of disease natural history. For example, epigenetics 7 is providing insights into the impact of the environment on gene expression throughout life with the possibility of targeted interventions. There is also strong suspicion that cumulative epigenetic changes due to environmental stressors may explain population health disparities in the burden of various diseases among disadvantaged populations. 8 Measuring neighborhood-specific epigenetic alterations can potentially be used to investigate causes for health disparities. However, although the field of epigenetics is promising for public health, much more work is needed in developing, validating, and using the right platforms in population studies. 8 Biomarkers are only one of many avenues for identifying high-risk populations for intervention. Public health programs already use targeted approaches, for example, by recommending screening for hepatitis C in people born from 1945 through 1965, and identifying people with prediabetes. Public health policies that will enhance lower sugar intake, weight control, and increased activity levels across the population could be accompanied, but not replaced, by more-targeted efforts to find people with prediabetes based on age, family history, and BMI. As technologies mature, there will be increasing opportunities for additional targeting for a wide variety of disease-prevention efforts.",25.146019149069975,14.545615660037345

In this vein, isolation and quarantine raise concerns about the acceptability of confining people and preventing them from engaging in some of the social activities they otherwise would have loved.

Pellegrino and Thomasma remark that medicine seeks to foster social flourishing as well as the medical good of society. 156 If this is true, and if the end of the communitarian moral lens is to ensure the survival of the society by promoting the interests of people over the selfish interests of individuals, then how can this approach help engage issues of uncertainty, vulnerability, human rights and justice? This can come through appropriate educational policies and approaches carried out prior to and during influenza outbreaks. It is not known when and in whom influenza therapeutic interventions such as antiviral drugs and vaccines may cause side-effects. It is also not known when an outbreak will occur or the attendant magnitude. Since public health disasters are classless in terms of who will and who may not be affected, the scenario of uncertainty affects every segment of people in the local communities and nation. Hence, health workers, government officials, the rich, the poor, the educated and illiterates and other possible stratification of society are potential victims. A communitarian ethos is useful in at least two ways in relation to dealing with the uncertainties associated with pandemic influenza. Generally, it can-with the right pre-disaster public education-help ensure that people understand the unavoidable scientific and knowledge-related gaps in preparedness policies and specific plans put together to engage a specific outbreak. This will help avoid or minimize blame, since scapegoating during disease outbreaks causes different shades of disruption and target important actors including health workers. 157 In fact, the better educated the public is about the challenges of stockpiling vaccines, the more cooperative they will likely be to the vaccine-supply challenges that arise during an outbreak.",24.544122355615883,14.069993078810498

We showed here how the intrinsic epidemics driven by an annual driving term and the injection of infected people into a patch can spread to other patches. The strength and timing of these subsequent epidemics depends on the strength and geometry of the migration between the patches and on the reproductive rate, R, of the disease. The most salient observation of the different conditions described here is that when R is close to 1, as is the case for SARS and bird flu, then the transients generated in the patches are of long duration and there are additional ""ancillary"" epidemics that are not due to further input of infected people, but rather are a manifestation of the fact that the previous epidemic has pushed the dynamical state of the patch far from its base dynamical state. These ancillary epidemics may have important implications for policy makers deciding how to respond to additional epidemics after an initial induced event. In this regime of R = 1.575 and periodic parameters, the initial epidemic is produced by injection of infected people. However, the subsequent ancillary epidemics do not correspond to the injection of additional infected people. That is, the ancillary epidemic represents a rebound of the system, rather than a second event of injected infected people. In addition we showed both analytically and numerically how the time to the first epidemic after the injection of infected people depends on the reproductive factor R.",20.709602061898234,10.762980501251175

The Ebola virus (EBOV) causes an acute viral syndrome that presents with fever and an ensuing bleeding diathesis that is marked by high mortality in human and nonhuman primate s. Fatality rates are higher than other viral diseases with rates of up to 90 % [ 18 ] . Ebola viral disease (EVD) affects the poorest people in the African continent. Due to movement of people across borders the disease could rapidly spread and infect any people globally. EBOV spreads through human-tohuman transmission via direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs, or other bodily fl uids of infected people and with surfaces and materials (e.g., bedding, clothing) contaminated with these fl uids. EBOV glycoprotein (GP1,2) and matrix protein (VP40) are both major components of EBOV. The hemorrhagic disease caused by EBOV is characterized by generalized fl uid distribution problems, hypotension, coagulation disorders, and a tendency to bleed, fi nally resulting in fulminant shock. Vascular instability and dysregulation are hallmarks of the pathogenesis in EBOV hemorrhagic fever (HF). Endothelial disturbances can be caused indirectly, by proinfl ammatory cytokines such as TNF-α released from EBOV-infected monocytes/macrophages, and directly, following virus infection of endothelial cells. In vitro studies demonstrated that EBOV viral proteins could activate endothelial cells and induce a decrease in blood vessel barrier function [ 19 ] .

Hence, there is an urgent need to develop a powerful vaccine which could provide robust protection against the viral pathogen . The EBOV and its high fatality are known since the 1970s. The disease only affects a small percentage of people annually in Africa; hence government agencies as well as International Organizations were not keen to invest in vaccines.

Rigorous model calibration methods, including maximum likelihood methods and the Bayesian inference based MCMC methods, already take into consideration uncertainties in data by allowing the data at each time point to follow a probability distribution with the mean given by the assumed model and the variance t given by the assumed probability distribution, where the variance may depend on the mean. The lack of data, as we will demonstrate, is a more serious concern for modellers. A key issue that can explain the variability in model predictions is understanding how the available data (confirmed cases) compares with model predictions. Confirmed cases are people with symptoms who made contact with a hospital, got tested, and whose infection of COVID-19 was confirmed by DNA or imaging tests. The infected compartment in by transmission models represents all people who are infected. These include people who may or may not have symptoms and contacts with a hospital, as well as people with confirmed laboratory tests and those who are misdiagnosed.

All the figures involved have to be very careful and standardized processes might be helpful.

We have established a ""double triage"" protocol; our goals were ensuring the continuity of care and to protect the health care professionals from the infection. The first triage is a telephone interview, performed by a dedicated nurse the day before the scheduled home visit. This step is obviously focused on identifying patients who might have even mild forms of COVID-19. The nurse ask to each patient if within the previous 48 hours: 1) he/she have experienced fever, breathlessness or cough; 2) he/she (or his/her relatives) have recently been to known outbreak areas; 3) he/she have had direct contact with people known to have COVID-19; 4) he/she have had direct contact with people currently in quarantine.

Surprisingly, none of the recent studies on pandemic influenza have incorporated the impact of this type of behavioral change.

This is implemented with a specification of start, peak, and end times with corresponding fractions of the population that will be isolating at those times, along with a minimum and maximum contiguous duration per individual. We assume that people who choose to stay home will only self-isolate for 7-14 days at a time. People isolate on an individual basis, not on a household basis, so there might be households in which some members of the family are isolating due to fear and others are going about their normal activities. Fear-based home isolation begins when a percentage of the population is symptomatic (e.g., 0.1%).

Here, we apply tools from social network epidemiology [35, 39, 43] to study how changes in behavior affect the contact network and, as a result, disease transmission. The social contact network emerges from the simulation as individuals move through their daily activities and come into and out of contact in rooms [11] . We extracted the degree distribution of the social contact structure in the absence of disease during a random day for the baseline, 100% school closure scenario, and at the peak of the 50% fear-based home isolation scenario. Figure 5 depicts the population distribution in Southern California under the three scenarios for a typical day. On average, each individual has 22.5, 19.9, and 8 contacts per day for the baseline, 100% school closure scenario, and 50% fear-based home isolation scenario, respectively. We observe that the average number of contacts per day decreased for the school closure and fear-based home isolation scenarios when compared to the baseline. Note that the average number of people contacted per person can provide an estimate of how many people can potentially acquire infection from one index case. Furthermore, we found that closing schools would be less effective in breaking the social contact network than fear-based home isolation.

Interventions to reduce the average number of secondary infections (typically denoted ℜ) most expeditiously are preferable, provided all else (including, e.g., compliance and cost) is equal. The impact of such interventions depends crucially on pathogen life cycles and host contact patterns. Thus, in some environments, with some infectious agents, certain interventions may reduce disease transmission, whereas in other environments, or with other agents, the same interventions may not, despite being applied with equal diligence. As will be apparent, the natural history of SARS readily explains why encouraging people with compatible prodromal symptoms to seek care (and ensuring that clinicians and hospital infection control personnel had the wherewithal to diagnose and isolate them effectively) was only marginally less effective than quarantine.

Koch35 and Barbisch et al36 argue that quarantine of whole communities could be ethically justified, particularly if the containment area included the entire area within which individuals from a community would usually travel. Koch35 describes this as a spatial focus for quarantine rather than one focused on a targeted population. It allows for better concentration on humanitarian medicine for the infected, as far greater concentration of resources would be available for a smaller pool of infected people. A call for “spatial” quarantine for EVD containment may be at odds with the “principle of least infringement”, an ethical principle applied in public health contexts to curtail the use of liberty-restricting interventions to the least restrictive action required to meet a public health goal. But when the public health goal is containment of an infectious disease to meet the dual goals of enabling the best possible care for the sick within the quarantine zone, as well as to reduce the spread of infection, such a measure could be ethically justified. Restrictions should therefore be done in a way that is relevant, legitimate, and necessary, and stakeholders should be fully informed about the risks and benefits, especially as they affects their health, well-being, and personal liberty.37 Those quarantined should also not suffer unfair economic penalties.37",23.072786784071948,11.028024295533427

First, our measure of EVD exposure, namely whether or not people reported knowing a close friend or family member with Ebola or knowing someone who died of Ebola is different from actual cases of EVD or other ways to define exposure. Plus, this simple measure of exposure lacks information on how many cases a person knew, or of cases that they would not define as close friends or family members. However, if we assume that there were approximately 25,000 cases of Ebola in the 2 countries with a combined population of approximately 13,000,000 people, then it would mean that 1 in 520 people in those countries were actually infected with EVD. Given that in our sample, roughly 40% of people knew a close friend or family member with Ebola, assuming random mixing, it means that on average people must have at least 200 people in their close circle of friends or family members, which is a plausible figure given estimates of network sizes that have been observed in different human populations (Dunbar, 1993). Given that cases of EVD likely clustered, we might be worried that this estimate would underestimate the number of close friends and colleagues each individual would have to have, since people who knew one case likely knew more than one, however, on the other hand given that many of the people who actually knew cases also died, this might bias the estimates in the other direction since people who died did not answer the survey. Second, we only have data from two of the most heavily affected countries and lack data from Guinea, and therefore we cannot speculate if our results would be consistent in that country. Third, we are comparing data from two countries with sub-national units of different sizes (counties vs. provinces and potentially also at the sampling unit).

can be drawn: first, the treatment cost of infectious diseases has a critical
influence on the evolution of infectious disease. Specifically, under the
condition of high cost and no government intervention (α=10,μ=0), even after 10 000 periods of time evolution, the proportion
of infected people still exceeds 50%, and the highest number of infected people
is close to 80%. At low cost, even without government intervention
(α=5,μ=0), the number of infected people will decrease rapidly over
time, but the maximum number of infected people will exceed 77%, and it will
take a very long period of time (1774 periods) to control the disease. In other
words, infectious will fall to zero or everyone is cured after 1774 periods.
Second, government intervention has an important impact on the evolution of
infectious diseases. If the government implements full subsidy for infectious
disease (without considering the impact of data costs under full subsidy), the
number of infected people will drop rapidly and will fall to zero in the eighth
period. Infectious diseases can be effectively controlled in a short period of
time.",18.457344380389763,9.132252884487201

Anticipated decision regret is an attitude of people which leads them to take actions that are directed at preventing possible future incidents. If I take this preventive measure now, it will mean that I do not have to blame myself (or get blamed by others) for not having done everything to prevent that incident from happening. This attitude also can be observed in health care. A growing number of preventive screening tests are offered that provide information of the chance of developing some kind of disease. It is often not taken in consideration that the chance of really getting this disease is very small. And it is possible that the measures that are taken to prevent the disease negatively influence lifestyles. The Dutch medical sociologist Tjeerd Tijmstra (2001) gives some—often hilarious—examples of anticipated decision regret: if a mother gets a screening test for her child offered for a disease for which the risk is 1 in 90,000, there is a great willingness to participate. And even if it is explained to people that the chance of having a car accident while driving to the clinic is about as much as that particular risk, still many people decide to go on. Their motivation seems to be: suppose our baby does develop that disease, then we should not forgive ourselves not to have done everything to prevent it. There are signals that this anticipated decision regret has become an attitude in security issues also. But in the field of security governments and other public agencies (such as scientific organizations) are bearers of the attitude more than individual citizens. After 9/11—let it be repeated again—security measures against possible terrorist attacks have been given an enormous priority. It looks as if governments are willing to invest a lot of energy in minimizing the chances of terrorist attacks. They do not want to take the risk that they have not done everything to prevent an assault. This attitude can be based on experience. Officials of the Dutch government were reproached for not having done enough to prevent the murder of film director Theo van Gogh (2004). These reproaches have led to decisions that are directed at minimizing the chance of new attacks. With—in general—societal and political support a good deal of money and a lot of energy are devoted to this topic.

Consider an asymptomatic carrier who remains exposed to society throughout. We assume that the number of asymptomatics is proportional to the total number of sick people exposed to society, i.e. we let the number of asymptomatics be μ1y where μ1 is a number between 0 and 1. After falling sick, an asymptomatic carrier can transmit the disease for 7-10 days, which is called the infection period [46] . Thus, new healthy people can be only be infected by those asymptomatic sick people who have fallen sick within the last 7-10 days, and not those who have fallen sick earlier.

This comes from the sick people who will eventually turn symptomatic and isolate themselves but are still transmissible, blissfully unaware of the fact.

In this sense, κ 0 = 1 reflects a total lockdown of the population which isolates the households from each other, thus constraining the transmission dynamics at the level of household rather than municipality. From the former assumptions, we compute the average number of contacts of agents belonging to each group g ∈ {Y, M, O} as",11.529302952042292,8.76459467914986
