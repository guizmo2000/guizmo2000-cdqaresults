Not only did the unusually high death toll during the West Africa Ebola outbreak result in expanded social and household economic impacts, but also in stifled growth rates, lost productivity and wages due to inability to work or contagion fear, increased poverty and food insecurity, lost jobs, and lost education [1] . The extent and type of household economic impacts is often (although not exclusively) related to the population cohort most affected. For Ebola, the age group of 15-44 years, those engaged in the labor force and parents of young children, accounted for 57% of all infections, explaining why the impact on economic activity, poverty and food security was so substantial [1] . Sixty to 70% of households reported their incomes dropped significantly during the outbreak; consumption by households decreased and the prevalence of undernutrition rose [1] . Further, approximately 16,000 children lost parents to Ebola, leaving them orphans needing long-term care by relatives or other means [43] . The closure of schools, resulting in over 33 weeks of lost education, was further believed to have exposed children to several types of child abuse (including sexual exploitation and violence against young girls) with long-term impacts such as emotional trauma, permanent removal from education system, and unwanted pregnancies [44] .

The level of reporting may also be influenced by the capacity of the local health systems, which can vary over time and space. During the West African Ebola epidemic, less than a third of cases were estimated to be reported [122] and severe cases were probably over-represented compared to mild cases. At the end of 2014, health-care capacity was exceeded in many parts of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone [14] , but new health-care facilities were subsequently built; hence the line-list of cases is likely to be more complete towards the end of the outbreak. Underreporting might also have been higher in this compared to previous Ebola outbreaks, during which the health-care systems were less overburdened.

Resilient infrastructure includes not only physical strength but also back-up for the systems. However, no standard has been endorsed or enforced to ensure that healthcare facilities can resist natural disasters. In addition, back-up systems (e.g. electricity, water, and communication) were not fully considered when many hospitals were being built. For example the health facilities in the earthquake-prone areas of western and rural China rarely comply with the standards of construction, nor are their back-up systems required to resist natural disasters (23) . The 2008 Sichuan earthquake caused the collapse of 67.5% of healthcare buildings in the worst affected areas (24) .

Sampling was carried out in two stages-first stage list of dental care facilities (Private, government military and university) in Riyadh city was prepared, second stage DHPs working in these facilities were then selected into the study. List of private hospitals and polyclinics providing dental care in Riyadh city was obtained by using health insurance provider network, and the list of universities providing dental care was obtained by visiting ministry of higher education website of Saudi Arabia. Similarly, list of government armed forces dental care facilities in Riyadh city was also prepared. From among the above mentioned dental care facilities few dental centers were selected randomly by applying lottery method. DHPs including clinical level dental students, interns, dental practitioners and dental auxiliaries working in these facilities were invited to participate in the study. A convenience sampling methodology was utilized to recruit DHPs based on ease of availability during survey period. Trained dental in-terns approached DHPs in their work place and distributed the questionnaires along with required instructions. Confidentiality of the data was assured to DHPs. All the participants were informed about the purpose and scope of the study and those who agreed to sign the consent form were considered in this study. Sample size was determined by using G* power statistical power analysis program 3.1.1 (8) . A sample size of 452 was determined by considering an alpha of 0.05, a power of 0.85, and effect size of ρ = 0.14 for a two-tailed Spearman correlation test -Questionnaire design: Instrument developed by Askerian et al. (9) and Jain et al. (10) in line with the CDC guidelines for evaluating awareness of droplet and airborne isolation precautions among dental students and faculty was slightly modified and validated in two steps. Firstly, the study instrument was sent to professionals from public health and dental public health background to give their expert opinion with regards to its ease, relativity and importance. Secondly, pretesting of the questionnaire was carried out by choosing a small sample of DHPs (n=20), who provided their views on making the questionnaire simpler and shorter. Amendments from the participants were considered and incorporated into the questionnaire. After in-depth discussion, questionnaire was finalized by the authors and subsequently a pilot study was conducted on a sample of 50 DHPs by using modified version of the questionnaire to ensuring comprehensibility and reliability. A Cronbach's alpha of 0.80 was obtained which was deemed satisfactory for conducting this study. Questionnaire was divided into four parts. The first part included demographic information of the respondents. Second, third and fourth parts evaluated Knowledge, attitude and practice of DHPs regarding the droplet and airborne isolation precautions by eliciting responses on 11 questions in each section. The knowledge was assessed at three different levels (yes, no, I do not know), and a score of 1 was allocated when the answers to questions were in agreement with the CDC guidelines. Therefore, the score for knowledge ranged between 0 (all wrong answers) to 11 (all correct answers). A cut off level of <7 were set for poor knowledge and ≥7 for good knowledge. Attitude was assessed at three possible levels (very strong, strong and null). The responses very strong and strong were assigned a score of 5 and null response was scored at 1 point. Thus, the aggregate score ranged between 11(all null score) to 55 (all questions responded as strong or very strong). A cut off level of <35 was set for negative attitude and ≥35 for positive attitude. In practice section, four levels of responses (always, often, sometimes and never) were utilized by assigning score of 1 for correct answer and a score of 0 for all other responses. Hence the total practice score ranged 0 to 11. Similarly, A cut off level of <7 were set for poor practice level and ≥7 for good practice.",27.117121590073683,12.975245557738862

A recent pooled meta-analysis of 60 studies across all ages and continents found the prevalence of respiratory viruses associated with asthma exacerbations was <15%, except hRV which was 42% [21] . Although hRV had the highest prevalence in both children and adults, there were some notable difference: children were more positive for RSV and hRV, whilst adults were more positive for influenza, coronavirus and parainfluenza. These age-related changes in viral detection rates was also evident during the yearly cycle, where children <3 month were mainly positive between the months of Jan-March, whilst those aged between 3-18 were positive in Sept-Nov [22] . Human rhinovirus also occurs in seasonal epidemics in our data, particularly in seasons where influenza and RSV epidemics are much lower. Previously 20% of all hospital admissions of school aged children in Canada were shown to occur in September, attributed predominantly to hRV [23, 24] . Importantly, hRV has recently also been linked with mortality in asthmatics, elderly and in those in long term care facilities [25] [26] [27] .

Many factors shown to adversely affect hand hygiene compliance, such as limited accessibility to handwashing facilities [9] , insufficient time [10] , and skin irritation [11] may be overcome by ABHR use. Various interventions have been attempted to enhance compliance including educational sessions [12] and performance feedback [13] . Educational interventions tend to have limited long-term effects on behavior, whereas performance feedback led to increased handwashing being sustained for some time after the intervention. However, it appears that pronounced and long-term improvements require an awareness intervention employing a multifaceted approach [14, 15] .

Compared with men, women lacked knowledge about TB symptoms and the pro-poor service policy. However, they were more likely than men to seek health-care after the onset of TB suspicious symptoms. As proved in several studies, deficient knowledge in women and patient's recognition of TB were statistically significant factors of diagnostic delay for TB [11, 21] . A study in rural Inner Mongolia of China also reported that women with less education tended to be less knowledgeable about TB and were less likely to seek care than men though gender difference was not statistically significant in the quantitative survey [22] . In our current study, lack of knowledge among women did not show negative impacts on their health-care seeking. This phenomenon could also be found in South India that despite facing greater stigma and inconvenience, women were more likely than men to access health services and adhere to treatment [23] . However, when we take a deep look on the data and further explore their health seeking experiences, it is not surprised to find that men and women have different preference on the health-care service. Men preferred to visit upper level health facilities -the hospitals, whereas women preferred to visit lower level health facilities such as village health stations. As proved by other studies, patients who chose the village clinic or private providers as their first health facility usually experienced a much longer health system delay than that of those choosing other formal heath facilities [16, 24] . Thus though women were more likely to seek health-care for TB suspicious symptoms, it might not help shorten the health system delay due to the weakness in diagnosis in non-formal health facilities. There are several explanations for this phenomenon. One might be the deficient knowledge on TB we discussed above. Another might be the special role of women in China. In rural areas of China, most work in the household is undertaken by women in addition to agricultural work, which may mean that they have less time seek health-care in a township health center or general hospital. Women may therefore prefer to visit facilities that are geographically accessible such as village health stations or private practitioners.",21.506774971886838,9.604623616239952

Results: 78 patients were included with a median age of 87 (range 85-96). 22 patients (28%) died during their ICU stay, and a further 12 (15%) died on the ward before discharge, giving a total of 34 (44%) hospital deaths. 6-and 24-month mortality were 54% and 60% respectively. Medical patients had the highest acuity scores and highest mortality at all end-points (Fig. 102) . High APACHE III scores (Fig. 103 ) and increasing numbers of organs supported correlated with shorter time from ICU admission to death (p < 0.0001 in both cases). Of those who required support of 4-5 organs (8 patients), none survived their hospital admission. Conclusions: Almost half of patients aged over 85 admitted to ICU died before discharge from hospital, but a large proportion of patients who survived 6 months were still alive at two years. High APA-CHE III scores and organ support were associated with higher mortality. These results suggest that intensive care is of benefit to selected patients aged over 85, and that acuity of illness is a useful indicator of long-term survival.

Other studies have also reported that hospital size is not important in predicting the amount of antibiotic use [18, 19] . Given these findings, regardless of bed size or medical school affiliation, all hospitals should be required to implement ASPs. However, the majority of Korean NAC hospitals still do not have these programs because of insufficient human, financial, and information technology resources as compared with large, academic medical centers. For example, a pharmacist should be involved in an ASP; however, most Korean NAC hospitals do not have a staff member with drug expertise as one of the core elements for a successful hospital ASP [20] . In addition, although NAC hospitals do implement ASPs, there are barriers to the success of these programs. First, a large proportion of patients in NAC hospitals come from long-term care facilities; therefore, they are likely to suffer from recurrent aspiration pneumonia or severe decubitus ulcers, which result in an increased chance of antibiotic use [21] .

A delicate and important challenge of implementing protocols, care bundles, and checklists into clinical practice in ICUs in resourcelimited settings is the lack of safety data. Different disease pathologies, as well as absent treatment options (e.g., airway protection and mechanical ventilation), could well explain why certain interventions that were shown to improve patient outcome in resource-rich settings increased morbidity and mortality in resource-limited settings [215, [245] [246] [247] .

Would it affect the quality of health services, treatment outcomes, and healthcare expenditure transfer? There have been numerous interventions aimed at shortening LOS, such as measures taken by Dutch hospitals. 44 Borghans and colleagues suggested that among 69 Dutch hospitals, if LOS of the 15th percentile hospital (5.7 days) were used as a benchmark, total hospitalisation days could be reduced by 14%. 38 During the study period, Hong Kong public hospitals recorded a larger decrease in LOS when compared to most the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. 45 Our performance was similar to the Netherlands . This suggests room for further decreases in LOS, and Hong Kong can benefit from experience of other countries. However, each healthcare system may have a different benchmark. There may exist an optimum length of hospital stay, but it will be affected by medical advancements (eg, outpatient clinics and day ward surgery) as well as local supply (eg, day-care, relevant community service, and public allowance support), and demand factors (eg, morbidity patterns and readmission). 35 A local evaluation study on the association between LOS and severity of illness may identify opportunities for reducing LOS. More importantly, we should not aimlessly reduce LOS without considering the possible impact on the quality of care and patient satisfaction. Measures for reducing LOS should only be taken if the same level of or even better quality of care and patient satisfaction can be assured. The extent to which further decreases in LOS associate with inpatient demand deserves more attention in Hong Kong. Apart from LOS, multiple initiatives should be developed to target discharge rates and readmissions simultaneously. For example, additional investment in disease prevention programmes, community care, and long-term care programmes to serve patients with chronic health conditions and long-term acute care needs, such as intravenous therapy in nursing homes, have potential to reduce avoidable hospitalisation. Kripalani et al 46 suggested interventions involving multiple components to reduce readmission rates for patients being discharged to home and post-acute care facilities.

Furthermore, these policies were implemented with enough authority and accountability to make professional delivery care accessible to all women. As China is on track to meet the Sustainable Development Goals, attention now needs to be paid to the unmet need of those not yet able to access care: the poor, less educated, and ethnic minority groups who live in remote areas in western China. Whether China's highly medicalised model of maternity care will be an answer for these populations is uncertain. A strategy modelled after the immunisation programme, whereby care is provided closer to the women's homes, might need to be explored, with township hospitals taking a more prominent role.",26.7540578001244,14.3620249334699

A limitation of our analysis is that the effect of the interventions on CRI rates in the patients or family members of HCWs could not be included due to the absence of data. The exclusion of these factors will make our results more conservative. HCWs are known to transmit various types of nosocomial infections to patients [34] and the literature indicates that there are likely to be substantial benefits if the number of patients with CRI is reduced [22] . For example, the benefits of preventing HCW infection transmission through vaccination have been observed in long-term care facilities that found an associated decrease in mortality in their elderly residents [35] [36] [37] . The difference in mean direct healthcare costs per HCW with CRI between the trials (i.e. US $5.45 [34 RMB] in Trial 1 and US $2.60 [16 RMB] in Trial 2) may partly reflect variation in the thoroughness of the sick follow-up data collection between the trials. Another potential limitation of this study is that stochastic uncertainty was not directly explored using the individual level data from the trials [21] . Instead, we adopted a decision-model based approach using clinical trial data to inform input parameter values and explored the uncertainty of these values in deterministic sensitivity analyses. This approach facilitated a focus on forms of uncertainty unrelated to sampling, such as the potential inter-year variation in the CRI attack rate. Finally, as data on quality of life were not collected in the trial we chose to focus the economic analysis on the primary trial outcome (CRI).

Our facility prophylactically treats all residents with oseltamivir at the onset of any confirmed case of influenza. During our study period, there were only three cases of influenza. However, this translated into all 137 residents receiving prophylaxis three times, thus resulting in high costs. The added costs of the other infection prevention and control activities we measured including diagnostic testing, physician consulting, and product usage, $644 per 1000 resident-days, were similar to that reported in the pediatric acute care setting during RSV seasons ($760 per 1000 patient-days). 6 Surprisingly, the costs related to hand hygiene were greater during the non-respiratory viral season as compared to the viral respiratory season. This may be due to an increase in gastrointestinal disease during the summer months (data not shown). While the cost effectiveness of oseltamivir has not been specifically evaluated in pLTCF, studies in the adult long-term care setting have demonstrated that influenza prophylaxis results in cost savings to facilities overall. 12 There are a few limitations to this study.

It is important to note that the technical approach used explains some discrepancies in rates of detection: primarily in their sensitivity and secondly in the number of targeted viruses. Alternatively differences in rates of detection could be due to true geographical differences in overall burden, differences in study populations (outpatients or hospitalized patients) and to the studies sample collection periods. Overall, the viral detection rate in the present study is very high as elderly people are often protected by pre-existing antibodies from previous illnesses, maybe illnesses suffered even decades back [18] [19] [20] . Indeed, because of pre-existing systemic and mucosal antibodies, elderly adults have been observed to have lower amounts of respiratory secretions and lower viral loads compared to children [10] .

Many long-term care facilities have difficulty in applying isolation of infected persons due to the limited availability of isolation rooms [5] and concern about the adverse effects of isolation and additional precautions may affect the compliance with related practices [78] . For the same reason, some studies in this review used minimal types of isolation like enteric isolation. If single rooms are not available, facilities should consider applying the cohort measure or bed curtains as another method of isolation. In regard to this challenge, a study by Dumyati et al. [73] suggested a shift towards enhanced standard precautions or risk-based application of transmission-based precautions to uphold the quality of life of residents by HCWs. Future research should identify the rationale for the safety and effectiveness of this strategy or other options. Additionally, one qualitative study found that misunderstanding of the key concepts and recommendations of IPC contributed to under-utilization of transmission-based precautions [78] .

Over the past several years, many countries have experienced serious economic and health consequences due to outbreaks of infectious diseases such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in 2015 and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in 2003. Long-term care facilities (LTCFs) are facing a great need for preparation for infection outbreaks because of an increase in the number of residents with global aging. LTCFs are exposed to the risk of outbreaks owing to several factors. First, older residents in LTCFs are susceptible to infectious diseases because of aging and health conditions [2] and are known to be dependent with regard to activities of daily living. Thus, among residents, self-hygiene is observed to be poor. Loss of independence in residents creates unique and frequent contact opportunities between healthcare workers (HCWs) and residents [3] . Second, HCWs in LTCFs tend to be poorly informed about infection prevention and control (IPC), and compliance with IPC is generally low [2, 4] . Third, the environment in LTCFs offers challenges for IPC, like the sharing of rooms, group living, and difficulty with the isolation of infected persons [5, 6] . Finally, LTCFs have limited resources and capacities for diagnosis of infection [7] . This leads to a delay in the detection of hidden carriers and infection. All these factors contribute to the onset and spread of outbreaks in LTCFs. Outbreaks in LTCFs threaten the life and health of both residents and HCWs, and thus, eliminating the risk of outbreaks is a matter of concern in such facilities. However, LTCFs vary in their individual capacities to respond to outbreaks [8] . The keys to outbreak control are as follows: identification of the transmission causes and minimization of the spread through early initiation of control measures. Therefore, it is essential to understand the causes of transmission and the applied measures to control outbreaks in LTCFs.",35.19870282008971,16.873017826459346

However, most of the LTCFs in this review requested advice from public health authorities and organizations for unexpected outbreaks instead of organizing a multidisciplinary team. This may imply that LTCFs do not have sufficient capacity and expertise to individually plan, implement, and evaluate the management of outbreaks.

The use of simple, standardized guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of LRI reduces complications and deaths. These guidelines should be made available to all care facilities including community health facilities and mobile units (Kronfol 2012; Takian et al. 2013) . Unfortunately, many EMR countries have not implemented such evidence-based guidelines. Although the required expertise and local data for developing guidelines are not available in the majority of EMR countries, adaptation of international guidelines can be used as an alternative method to increase quality of care (Rashidian 2008) . On the other hand, several countries in the region (such as Libya, Syria, and Yemen, as the most recent examples) have experienced considerable setbacks in access to health care because of war, social unrest, and mass displacement of populations (Dewachi et al. 2014; Burki 2015) .

In Indonesia, Lao PDR, and Cambodia, the availability of health facilities is quite limited as seen in the density of hospital beds which is at 1 per 1,000 or less. One indicator of health service access is the proportion of skilled birth attendance. The statistics in 2006 shows that the proportion was over 80% in Thailand and Viet Nam, around two-third in Indonesia, nearly 50% in Cambodia and less than 20% in Lao PDR in 2006.",27.733649755124468,14.29542171618489

These LTCFs house individuals in close quarters, an important consideration for contagious respiratory infections [10, 11] . The close proximity of residents in combination with advanced age, multimorbidity and frailty in LTCFs likely predisposes older adults to an even greater susceptibility to infections and their complications [12] . Furthermore, the clustering of frail older LTCF residents in close living quarters allows infections to spread more quickly.

The extent and type of household economic impacts is often (although not exclusively) related to the population cohort most affected. For Ebola, the age group of 15-44 years, those engaged in the labor force and parents of young children, accounted for 57% of all infections, explaining why the impact on economic activity, poverty and food security was so substantial [1] . Sixty to 70% of households reported their incomes dropped significantly during the outbreak; consumption by households decreased and the prevalence of undernutrition rose [1] . Further, approximately 16,000 children lost parents to Ebola, leaving them orphans needing long-term care by relatives or other means [43] . The closure of schools, resulting in over 33 weeks of lost education, was further believed to have exposed children to several types of child abuse (including sexual exploitation and violence against young girls) with long-term impacts such as emotional trauma, permanent removal from education system, and unwanted pregnancies [44] .

The previous analysis considered all types of hospitalisation together.

In ETUs, the observed proportion of non-funeral exposures from hospitalised cases occurring after hospitalisation was significantly lower than in non-ETU facilities (p < 0.001, see Figure n in S1 Text).

Investigations of the initial phase of this epidemic, as well as previous outbreaks, have highlighted the potential role of within-hospital transmission before or shortly after Ebola is identified as the causative agent [37, 38] . Here we found that hospitalisation, defined broadly as anything from visiting a clinic to admission to an ETU, reduced transmission risk, showing that prompt hospitalisation may be an effective intervention as long as appropriate control measures are applied. However, hospitalisation did not eliminate transmission risk, indicating that improvements in infection control are needed in many health care settings. It should be noted that the meaning of date of hospitalisation may be different among cases, depending on how many and which types of facilities they visited in the course of their disease, and furthermore that there is potential for misclassification in the recording or interpretation of information on hospitalisation. In particular, while the health care facility of first admission was commonly reported, patient transfers to other facilities may not have always been recorded. Thus, there may be ambiguity about the type of health care facility a case was in at a particular time. Such missing information reduces our ability to resolve differences between types of facilities in their effectiveness at implementing case isolation, which could lead to underestimation of differences between facility types in isolation effectiveness. However, our results are broadly consistent with analyses of the outbreak in Conakry [29] . Half of reported non-funeral exposures where the matched contact was eventually hospitalised occurred after the reported date of hospitalisation. These results underscore the importance of further improving infection control in all health care facilities, but particularly in non-ETUs. However, in contexts where hospital bed capacity is insufficient or infection control in health care settings is imperfect, greater consideration might be given to measures to reduce within-family exposure-for example, via education and/or providing a home protection kit with hand disinfectant, protective equipment, and clear guidance for those caring for sick family members.",30.269617407203334,13.076174468833422

Although most participants saw community partners as resources to support program delivery and evaluation, others saw them as competitors for limited resources. Interestingly, a few saw partners as drivers for PH implementation. As one manager explained: ""[Partners] are trying to leverage [resources]. [They tell you] 'your mandate says you should be doing this.'"" Dependence on municipal support services was another factor influencing implementation and was usually reported as a barrier. For example, reliance on municipal infrastructure for IT systems to support surveillance work. As noted by a senior manager: ""Where we want support of an IT department, we have to negotiate that with the City."" Another example of reliance on municipal structures was the use human resource departments, requiring health units to negotiate with them for services.",23.486497177425907,10.96872819543914

However, no ICU study has evaluated the impact of the ICU support on long-term and disease-free survival. 7) Recent studies suggest survival benefits from early admission to the ICU [11] . However, this has never been evaluated properly. Indeed, a randomized, clinical trial designed to admit selected patients with cancer at the earliest phase of the malignancy (before or within first few days of cancer chemotherapy) with only one organ dysfunction may be in order.

First, unlike most prior studies of trust in physicians, the concept of trust in this study is for physicians in general and not for patients' own physicians. In Korea, patients can freely visit physicians who practice in different types of health care facilities [24] , and the concept of ""my physician"" is practically absent. Hence, in the Korean context, it is difficult to measure trust in ""your"" physician. Our survey accordingly stipulated ""trust in physicians in general."" Second, although this study mainly concerns trust in physicians, the question concerning trust in physicians was a single question with the Likert scale. As a detailed description of trust was lacking, the interpretation of the results is likely to remain a general outline. However, what this study focused on was not a meticulous depiction of trust but the association between trust in physicians and patients' characteristics. For that purpose, a simple question could serve as a comprehensive measure for assessing trust. Third, as this study is a cross-sectional study based on the short-term survey data, it has limitations in providing an explicit, causal inference which should be based on the temporal relationships among the variables. This should be recognized in interpreting our study results. Fourth, this study was on the basis of the survey results, and therefore the range of our statistical investigation was limited to the variables and their descriptions as presented in the survey. Given the limitations of the study data, we interpreted the study results in a way that connects and extends our results to those of the previous studies and the situation in Korea. As studies about the attitudes toward the health care system or the negative perceptions among the Korean population are lacking, qualitative studies need to be performed to support our study results. Despite these limitations, this study has its own value in that it investigated the patients' factors for trust in physicians and elucidated that the factors were likely to be subjective ones based on perception rather than to be based on the objective measures or conditions. In addition, the social context presented in this study, concerning the general opinion toward the physicians in Korea, could have helped to understand the rather contradictory situations concerning the Korean health care system, which can be one explanation for the low trust in physicians in Korea.",21.26835178363131,10.33988554139666

Antibody is likely to participate in control, as well as initial clearance. Maintaining adequate levels of antibody in the CNS for continued control of virus replication requires either passage of antibody from the blood into the brain parenchyma or local production by resident antibody-secreting cells. The BBB restricts the entry of proteins from the blood into the CNS, and although this function is compromised during the acute phase of infection, it is quickly repaired. Under normal conditions, levels of antibody in the brain are sustained at 1% of plasma levels that are likely to be inadequate for long-term prevention of virus reactivation. Therefore, resident long-lived antibody-secreting cells that can continue to produce antiviral antibody for a lifetime are a feature of recovery from most CNS virus infections [29] .

However, in our additional analysis, which is not presented in the table, the recent health care experience was not a significant factor in the attitudes toward the health care system. In addition, as presented in Table 2 , the recent experience of outpatient visits or hospitalization was likely to increase trust in physicians. Furthermore, the experience of not being able to use health care facilities when necessary showed no significant relationship with trust in physicians. These findings strongly suggest that the low trust in physicians in Korea is less likely to result from their negative experiences concerning health care utilization. Our result is consistent with the result of a prior study that showed trust in physicians depended more on public opinion about the physicians and the generalized trust in a society than the individual experiences [2] .",23.56627937493561,7.956524332545633

Moreover, treatment facilities might be evaluated by the proportion of their patients who survive; here the relative CFR calculated would be for treatment in one facility versus treatment in another. There will be a temptation to conclude that treatment facilities with higher CFR are doing a worse job-that is, to apply a causal interpretation to observed differences in the CFR. Even in settings with more resources to measure covariates, methods of risk-adjustment of comparative outcomes to account for the mix of patients seen are complex and controversial [38] . In an emergency setting, with few covariates available to characterize the ""case mix"" of a health care provider, causal interpretation of differences in CFR would be particularly prone to error, potentially producing conclusions that mislead and thereby damage control efforts. For instance, if through confounding, larger referral treatment centers primarily receive patients who have survived infection for some time and are therefore less likely to die, independently of treatment, this may be erroneously interpreted as more effective treatment in these centers. Similarly, if certain treatment centers preferentially admit the most symptomatic patients, they may falsely appear to be less effective or even harmful to patient outcome. With at least five separate sources of bias in CFR or relative CFR estimates, and only imperfect solutions typically available for most due to lack of data, separating causal from non-causal factors in relative CFR estimation seems extremely risky. This is not to deny that data should be gathered or analyzed; on the contrary, the biases here suggest that more thorough data gathering is necessary before analyses of such quantities as relative CFR are relied upon for any decision.",18.000224218158152,10.511474872515478

The use of antiviral medications can also prevent cases in high-risk facilities such as long-term care or in welldefined regions such as military installations or school campuses. Strategies for use of antiviral medications for prevention and treatment may change during a pandemic. Early in the pandemic to a new region, it may be best to use antiviral medications to prevent infections. However, once influenza cases begin to spread across a community, priority antiviral allocation should be given to those with severe illness to improve their outcomes.",31.377667730645967,14.030640660682144

Several schools of nursing recognize the need for graduate education and to that end have created masters degree programs and postmasters certificates in emergency planning and disaster response [39] . The University of Rochester (New York) was the first school of nursing to create a masters program to educate nurses as leaders in disaster response and emergency preparedness [39] . The program focuses on the development of skills leaders need to design, implement, and evaluate programs dealing with emergency response and disaster management. Another trendsetter was the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing (JHUSON, Baltimore), which in fall 2005 inaugurated what is believed to be the first nursing graduate program geared toward the preparation of nurse leaders in emergency response and disaster management in health care facilities. The masters track was established on the belief that nurses always have held key positions in health care facilities, that they possess valuable insider knowledge of how health care facilities function during disasters, and that they hold pivotal roles in the formulation of institutional disaster management plans. Students are required to complete courses on health systems management, education, national/international humanitarian relief, emergency planning, and disaster response (a series of three). A 12 credit post-masters certificate is also available. Concurrent to the initiation of the JHUSON masters program, the University of Tennessee at Knoxville also launched a nursing masters degree and post-masters certificate option in homeland security nursing. Students may opt to focus their studies on management or on advanced practice/ clinical nurse specialist roles. The post-masters option requires completion of 24 credits.

Sectorisation interrupted the classical diffusion process proposed by Hagerstrand, so that the final phase of complete saturation predicted by his model did not occur. Instead, sectorisation introduces a new paradigm in psychiatric care, with a shift from large residential institutions to community-based services. In France, this process of deinstitutionalisation was initially planned on the basis of a territorial strategic framework. The 'psychiatric sector' was defined as a geodemographic area of around 70,000 inhabitants, for which a specialised team and a range of community-based services were dedicated. At this point the incentive to provide psychiatric hospital facilities was no longer driven by the aim of providing institutions for long term care, but by the need to convert and redevelop the service infrastructure to provide acute inpatient services as part of a deinstitutionalised model of care. To be able to implement this new policy, départements who had not yet followed the trend to build asylums had to create such acute facilities. The last départements to build inpatient psychiatric services often set up psychiatric hospitals or psychiatric wards in the multi-specialty hospitals serving the area, resulting in a more rapid period of growth in the number of psychiatric facilities after the 1960s. Arguably, these were part of a new phase of innovation in psychiatric care, rather than the last stages of the diffusion of asylums. However, they can also be seen as a continuation of psychiatric service infrastructure development that had been set in motion though the asylum development process, since in the French case the original asylums have often been retained and converted to the community care model.",36.07214055691391,13.984218510806365

In addition, new techniques for balancing the loads on health care facilities and resources have been proposed in the recent years.

IgM assays have generally not been useful. Serologic testing provides retrospective diagnosis when a у4-fold increase in a specific antibody is detected by complement fixation or EIA. Because rhinovirus has 1100 serotypes, serologic testing is impractical for diagnosis, whereas serologic tests for detection of hMPV and coronavirus are only available in research settings. Because of overlapping clinical syndromes, diagnosis of viral pneumonia requires laboratory confirmation. This is particularly important for influenza, because treatment is available and infection-control issues arise in hospitals and nursing homes (figure 1). Therefore, during the winter months, we recommend screening by rapid antigen tests for patients who are admitted to the hospital and residents of long-term care facilities who have suspicious clinical syndromes. Once influenza is active in the community, we recommend screening all patients with pneumonia with rapid tests, followed by influenza culture if the results of the rapid test are negative. Full respiratory viral cultures and RT-PCR are desirable to identify other viral pathogens, but if resources are limited, these tests may be restricted to immunocompromised or severely ill patients, for whom use of unproven therapies is sometimes attempted. Because of its retrospective nature, serologic testing is more useful for investigation of nursing home outbreaks of respiratory disease rather than for individual patient care.",36.35830932431133,15.570456387107063

The importance of this respiratory illness, particularly in older adults, is increasingly recognized; it was recently reported that RSV causes 10,000 excess deaths and is second only to the A/H3N2 strains of influenza as a cause of death due to viral respiratory illness in the age 65 and older population (Thompson et al. 2003; Mullooly et al. 2007 ). Although the virus is genetically stable over time (in contrast to influenza), repeat infections throughout adult life are common suggesting the immunity to this virus wanes over time. Those older adults with increased risk for severe disease are those with congestive heart failure and chronic lung disease, the severely immunocompromised, and those living in long-term care facilities (Falsey et al. 1992) . Estimates of RSV disease in this setting range from 5 to 10% of residents per year with pneumonia and death in 10-20% and 2-5% of cases, respectively.

Normally this risk is minimal. For small patient surges when a hospital is boarding critically ill patients in emergency departments (EDs) or postanesthesia care units, the patients may be at minimal-to-low risk of adverse events (eg, less frequent patient repositioning and increased risk for pressure ulcers). For events when hospitals are further overwhelmed, the staff may assess the risk as much higher. An example of a higher-risk situation is when the staff member believes that were a patient to become inadvertently disconnected from a mechanical ventilator, their current caregivers may be spread too thin to reliably uncover and respond to the disconnection in time to prevent severe harm to the patient. While these are subjective assessments, senior critical care staff (eg, medical director or nursing director of an ICU) should be able to assess the approximate risk to their patients. This assessment should be transmitted to hospital leadership through the line of communication delineated by the Hospital Incident Command System. 43 A hospitalapproved liaison should then communicate the assessment to the appropriate public health or healthcare coalition officials.",22.361045067328796,9.656738062388206

LTCF residents experience this high burden of respiratory infections, often with significant morbidity and mortality, owing to 3 attributes: high transmissibility of many respiratory viruses, close quartering of residents, and high morbidity and mortality in this population. 6 For example, influenza attack rates of 7.2% to 27% are common in LTCFs and have been associated with mortality rates of 4.4% to 5.2%.

Nursing staff-initiated testing 12 is triggered by the appearance of acute respiratory infection (ARI) symptoms and entails collection of a nasal swab specimen for on-site testing. The premise for this feasibility substudy is that nasal swab specimens, collected for point-of-care RIDT testing, in the intervention arm of the study, can be easily repurposed for respiratory virus surveillance within LCTFs. Such an approach would allow for onsite and near real-time diagnosis with RIDT, with the ability to use the residual specimen for broader surveillance efforts. Accordingly, we examined (1) the rate at which residual specimens are sent for expanded testing; (2) the rate of respiratory virus detection from residual specimens; and (3) whether resident characteristics contribute to the detection rate.",45.418372231194255,17.682168519610272

Beginning with the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology's Report on Combating Antibiotic Resistance and with the National Strategy for Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria and Presidential Executive Order issued in September 2014, the importance of this growing challenge was brought to the forefront [23] . Since then, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) published revised conditions of participation requirements for long-term-care facilities in October 2016 that specify that such facilities must establish and maintain an infection prevention and control program that includes an antimicrobial stewardship program with antibiotic use protocols and a system to monitor antibiotic use [24] . In June 2016, the CMS issued a proposed rule for acute-care hospital conditions of participation that, for a statutorily mandated 25-bed critical access hospital, would require the services of a physician (preferably an ID physician or a physician with training in antibiotic stewardship) a clinical pharmacist (preferably with training in ID or antibiotic stewardship), and a network data analyst at the following proportions of full-time employee salaries: 0.05, 0.10, and 0.025, respectively [25] . Effective 1 January 2017, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals approved a new antimicrobial stewardship standard that requires hospitals, critical access hospitals, and nursing centers to have a multidisciplinary antimicrobial stewardship team comprising an ID physician, infection preventionist(s), pharmacist(s), and practitioners [26] . These regulations clearly recognize that the problem of antimicrobial resistance is most appropriately addressed by teams that are led by individuals with the best training to address the problem: ID physicians. Joint evidenced-based guidelines published by the IDSA and Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America in 2016 provide an excellent roadmap for how to implement an effective antimicrobial stewardship program across multiple types of inpatient settings [27] . ID diagnostic methods and techniques are also a critical and rapidly evolving area where ID physicians play an important stewardship role. Healthcare systems can benefit from having ID physician expertise to assist in developing institutional or healthcare professional understanding of the novel technologies and their use/applicability in the day-to-day care of patients.",28.743648561047824,14.1051280014441

The antibiogram serves as a resource for clinicians choosing empiric antibiotic therapy. By tracking changes in the antibiogram year after year, the antibiogram helps stewardship programs to identify emerging resistance or to document improvements in susceptibility rates after targeted interventions. The microbiology director has traditionally been responsible for preparing and validating the data for the annual antibiogram according to the rules described in the CLSI M-39 document. 10 Stewardship personnel, including pharmacists, have a vested interest in the antibiogram because of its potential impact on antibiotic prescribing. For this reason, stewardship pharmacists often work with the microbiology laboratory to populate susceptibilities, validate the data, and format the antibiogram so it is user (clinician) friendly. Color coding can help designate certain antibiotics as preferred based on enhanced susceptibility. Some institutions also add relative antibiotic cost information to the antibiogram to further assist clinicians at the point of antibiotic prescribing. Modern health care systems are often challenged with standardizing antibiograms to serve many stakeholders within the system. The system's stakeholders include staff working in different settings, such as clinics, nursing homes, long-term care facilities, community hospitals, and tertiary care medical centers. Developing antibiograms that serve each of these settings is difficult. It is important to identify stewardship staff or liaisons at each location who can provide the local perspective about the patient populations served, the antibiotic formulary, the most common infections encountered, and any resistance concerns.",33.21978084425061,16.648235067357373

One explanation for this is that these quality measures have not received a great deal of attention in prevention of outbreaks, for example. Only recently have catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) garnered increased attention outside of the hospital setting through national quality improvement initiatives. This is now changing, however. The Department of Health and Human Services National Action Plan for the prevention of HAIs in long-term care settings intends the focus to increase on various infections and their associated metrics, such as facility enrollment in the National Healthcare Safety Network, urinary tract infections/ CAUTIs, Clostridium difficile infection, resident influenza and pneumococcal vaccination, and health care personnel influenza vaccination. 27 Whereas education and professional training has been regarded as one method of increasing infection prevention and control knowledge, 9 this study did not show a significant difference between those IPs who were specially trained to the IPs who were not when examining the quality measures for infections. It is possible that infection control training focuses more on the prevention, control, and epidemiology of resident care management and less on the quality improvement strategies methodology. The quality measures that reflect the long-term effects of IP basic training have not been elucidated. When the Department of Health and Human Services plan begins to be implemented however, IPs will be the individuals to gather the surveillance data and enter it into National Healthcare Safety Network and to initiate any prevention modalities to prevent and/or reduce these infections. The future, therefore, may find that having IPs who have received basic training in infection prevention and control programs will significantly impact current and future quality indicators. Whereas many NHs may have IPs functioning in multiple roles (such as that of the director of nursing, charge nurse, or in-service nurse), 9 we did not account for this in the analysis. In Maryland data, there were no IPs who performed their infection prevention and control job full-time.

The decision to place the ventilators with end users accomplished the goals of having the ventilators in the field where they would be readily available and maintained and could be utilized in day-to-day emergent interfacility and intrafacility transports. The supplemental oxygen component of the program provides low-flow oxygen within the community-based alternate care facilities that are supported by state legislation during mass casualty events and public health emergencies. Critical to this effort was state support and legislation as well as the effective use of sub-state public health regions to support planning and command and control response activities. Within the regions, coalitions supporting this effort included a core group of critical partners providing medical control and subject matter expertise and multiple supportive agencies and NGOs. Space included public schools, college facilities, community centers, and NGO facilities. Staff comprised community volunteer groups, the state Metropolitan Medical Response System (MMRS) team, hospitals, private practices, and other practitioners. Supplies included a combination of state-purchased equipment and supplies, with an emphasis on high-priority coordination with state and local vendors for oxygen equipment and supplies.

One study found an average of 15% of all NHs per year received a deficiency citation for infection control from 2000 to 2007. These deficiency citations were received while state surveyors conducted an inspection of the facility. Several staffing levels were also associated with receiving a deficiency citation for infection control. Furthermore, approximately 9% of all NHs per year receive a hand hygiene deficiency citation (ie, F-tag F-444). An upward trend is also evident, with the average yearly percentage of citations increasing from 7.37% (in 2000) to 11 .98% (in 2009). 7 One method of preventing and managing HAIs in NHs is through the facility's infection prevention and control program. The Nursing Home Reform Act mandated that NHs were to have a functioning infection control program in place. 8 These programs are to be multifactorial 9 in nature and include surveillance, outbreak investigations, isolation procedures, educational programs for both employees and residents, antibiotic stewardship, employee and resident health programs, hand hygiene approaches, and reporting procedures. 5 In summary, the research shows that infection control guidelines and infection definitions varied widely across NHs 10 ; NHs only spend an average of 8 hours per week on infection control; and few NHs have a full-time infection preventionist (IP) devoted to preventing infections and managing the infection control program. 11 Maryland is one state that had improved the quality of IPs in NHs. After finding in a statewide study that IP support in NHs was significantly less than in hospitals (in terms of number of IPs per beds and infection control training), 12 it was determined that NHs in this state could benefit from training and regulatory upgrades sponsored by the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH). The DHMH subsequently rolled out a combined approach to both revise the state regulations aimed at requiring at least 1 designated IP in each NH as well as providing a basic infection control training course for these designated IPs. This course would seek to train these long-term care IPs in 3 basic skills: (1) infection surveillance techniques, (2) isolation and multidrugresistant organism precautions, and (3) recognition and management of outbreaks. Additional information, such as hand hygiene, environmental infection control, tuberculosis prevention, microbiology, and immunization of health care workers, is also covered in the curriculum. This initiative resulted in an increased number of trained IPs in NHs; the NHs with trained IPs responded more quickly to an outbreak than NHs without trained IPs. 13 Whereas some research supports that IPs can result in improved outcomes (eg, reduced infections), 14 this link has not been studied in the NH setting. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the impact of NH IPs on NH quality measures. Specifically, we sought to understand better the relationships among the number of IP staff, IP training, and preventing and managing infections. We hypothesize that a higher number of IPs is associated with better quality in NH settings and whether the IPs' basic training in infection prevention and control is associated with better quality in NH settings.",29.146600700204118,12.98663158801654

The updated surveillance guidance includes revised definitions to standardize terminology regarding infections 29 and provide data for better surveillance of HAIs in NHs. Also, further discussion in how this reporting system can complement the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's common format for reporting HAIs 30 is also needed so that multiple forms of reporting do not hinder the reporting process. 31 However, without substantial infrastructure supports and government requirements in place, the implementation of such quality improvement programs may be futile. Previous research has cited that, whereas infections are extremely common, outbreaks are reported less often than less frequently occurring events such as abuse. 32 This study identified that NHs with greater FTE support of an IP resulted in better outcomes in some areas. Thus, further research in the role of reporting outbreaks and quality improvement strategies to prevent and track infections in NHs is critical, especially in NHs where minimal support is provided. For example, in the aftermath of severe acute respiratory syndrome, the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term Care provided funding to increase IPs in long-term care homes to prevent and better manage future outbreaks of HAIs. 33 Future research examining the cost of IPs and the effectiveness and proper staffing levels for the IP is needed for policy to further guide clinical care.",27.696022573481375,12.382488958219321

Some of the most common HAI's are bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections (UTIs), surgical site infections (SSIs), pneumonia, tuberculosis, Clostridium difficile infections, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections (MRSA), severe acute respiratory syndrome, gastroenteritis, pertussis, and ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP). HAIs impose tremendous direct (e.g. hospitalization, utilities, devices, medications, lab tests, etc.), indirect (e.g. mortality, lost/wages, etc.), and intangible (e.g. anxiety, disability, job loss, pain, etc.) costs [2] . In the United States, HAIs are estimated to result in ""direct annual costs of $35.7 -$45.0 billion for hospitals and healthcare facilities with combined medical costs of $20,549 -$25,903 per infection occurrence"" [2] . Many of the HAIs and related costs can be effectively prevented through proper surveillance and control plans. In most hospitals in Canada, infection control practitioners rely upon routine microbiology test results to flag patients with a possible HAI. Once a patient is flagged, staffs gather the patient's data from multiple sources to determine whether a HAI has occurred [3] . Automating this data gathering and integration is currently very challenging because the data in each of the source systems lack the contextual information necessary for automated integration and reasoning. Standardization and consistent integration of disparate biomedical data, however, would enable automated data integration and reasoning. This capacity could improve the decision-making process by allowing infection control staff to querying over several heterogeneous knowledge sources. In this context, a knowledge-based approach to surveillance of Healthcare-Associated Infections could advance data and knowledge integration, and thereby decrease the incidence of HAIs and facilitate effective resource allocation to improve patient care and enhance overall health systems performance.",29.451085076236083,11.692586932506337

The problem with this is that, as stated above, the hospitality industry often faces unexpected crises, which force hospitality managers (and ES units if there are any) to drop everything and devote their time and resources to tackling these new problems, rather than spending them on devising long-term plans. Therefore, ES activities cannot be just for long-term planning, but should be linked to current operations and problems. Concerning this, Engledow and Lenz (1985) stated that ES must engage the attention of current decision-makers and enter into current decisions. This requires careful blending of: line and staff participation, outside-in and inside-out perspectives; and present vs. prospective future strategies. This blending, in turn, requires an expert, politically savvy staff with strong top-level backing. (p. 102) Previous studies in the hospitality industry have not provided empirical evidence on whether ES activities are used for problem solving or long-term planning in hospitality firms. However, a number of studies in strategic management have found that a very high majority of the firms they studied did not use ES results in their long-term planning activities, claiming that data gained from ES were not very helpful (Brownlie, 1994; Fahey et al., 1981; Lenz and Engledow, 1986a) . For example, as noted earlier, the data and signals provided by the Novotel's ES system was not relevant and reliable and therefore in the process of undergoing a strategic organizational change the company decentralized ES activities, encouraged local initiatives and particularly focused on short-term problem-solving activities and this proved to be key in the company's strategic change process (Calori et al., 2000) . There is another issue worth mentioning here related to the carrying out of ES activities solely for long-term strategic planning. It has repeatedly been reported in the generic strategic management field (Mintzberg, 1994; Lorange, 1998; Pettigrew and Whipp, 1991; Whittington, 1993 ) that many organizations abandoned their strategic planning units and activities. Again, there is still limited knowledge in the hospitality literature on how far strategic planning is being undertaken by hospitality organizations. Considering the limited use of sophisticated management methods in hospitality organizations, one may question how ES activities can be linked to nonexistent planning practices in hospitality organizations.",22.797227294173254,7.8749045896771

Once exposed to a disaster scenario, patients require on-scene treatment and transportation to a facility capable of managing them. Unlike normal events, in which most survivors find their own conveyance to the closest hospital, obese patients will most likely not be able to do that, relying therefore on emergency medical services (EMS). Less critically ill patients may be taken to lower-acuity facilities or, in the setting of a slowly evolving event like pandemic flu, a community surge facility such as an acute care facility. For example, special accommodations may also be needed to get these patients immunized, because it is unlikely Geiling that they will be able to get to a community vaccine or medication point of distribution (POD). If hospitalization is required, these patients will need to be managed regionally as is done with pediatric or burn patients at present. Regional Medical Control Centers should monitor what facilities can manage these patients and ensure that proper transportation assets are available to assist in their movement. 8 In addition, community health planners need to be aware of these patients in their community, in the same way they should be aware of patients with home oxygen or medical devices. If these patients need evacuation because of a pending disaster or sudden event, then the local medical control should be proactive in seeking resources to move them to appropriate care or transportation hubs for moving them out of the region. 9 When disasters occur, the effect on the health care system depends on the nature of the event. In sudden-impact disasters such as transportation accidents, bombings, or fire, large numbers of patients tend to present to the closest facility over a short time span, typically within 3 hours. The hospital is mostly affected in the emergency department and, perhaps, the operating room. However, more protracted events such as pandemic flu would have a more prolonged effect on intensive care units (ICUs). These valuable resources may quickly become overburdened, requiring resources to surge to meet those needs. Ideally, hospitals discharge less critically ill patients to home, long-term care facilities, or even community disaster centers, leaving staffed ICU beds available for those needing this care. However, because those strategies also become overwhelmed, hospitals will need to expand their internal critical care capabilities with creative approaches to surging equipment, staff, and care space, that is, stuff, staff, and space. Because of the increased needs and comorbidities of obese patients, they pose additional challenges to this surge strategy. 10 Stuff Simple measures such as determining vital signs may be challenging in a disaster setting. In a review from France, prehospital management problems of morbidly obese patients included inability to measure blood pressure in 9%, inability to gain venous access in 13%, and difficulty in intubating 20% of the patients, often requiring advanced airways. 11 The routine use of noninvasive blood pressure cuffs may not be useful because of the inherent inaccuracies of the cuff's bladder size to arm circumference. 12 Normal emergency department and ICU procedures may also need additional support, including changed or decreased quality of electrocardiograms, poor radiographic or ultrasonographic imaging, increased reliance on invasive monitoring or procedures, such as diagnostic peritoneal lavage if the patient cannot fit the computed tomographic scanner, and advanced airway support due to oropharynx size or neck mobility limitations. 13 In 2008, the Task Force on Mass Critical Care reviewed the recommended ventilator characteristics for disaster settings as well as ancillary equipment. 14 Although review of that information reveals no specific recommendations for the needs of the obese patient, it does point to the requirement to ensure the equipment cached for disaster events do, indeed, fit these patients. The ventilator characteristics should meet such patients' needs, although if noninvasive ventilation is considered (which was not recommended by the Task Force), appropriately sized masks must be available. In addition, monitoring equipments such as blood pressure cuffs and pulse oximeters as well as central venous catheters and other tubes and lines must be of sufficient sensitivity and size to care for these patients.",28.75017097371522,16.129286120059056

If J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 5 we as a global society of practitioners are to minimize the long-term impact of COVID19, public health stakeholders need to develop a much wider and inclusive lens. To be effective, rehabilitative interventions must be considered during the planning and allocation of resources used to fight a disease outbreak. Otherwise, we will be playing, yet again, a tragic game of 'catch-up' in reducing disability-related outcomes of COVID19. [18] Over the last decades the emergence of SARS, H1N1, Influenza A, and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) illustrates the powerful threat of cross-species transmission events that have led to novel human disease with consequential global impact. While CIVOD19 currently occupies global attention and resources, in reality, a litany of other potential zoonotic diseases continue to reside in animal reservoirs around the world and only time and circumstances will determine the emergence of the next global pandemic. It is prudent to not only react to current challenges, but also to anticipate future ones. We believe that 'What's past is prologue', and that COVID19 is a powerful reminder to the global physiotherapy community what it can contribute, but that it must equally be prepared to scale-up for a rapidly changing reality.",23.742568536134964,10.343736323949042

HAI reduction strategies largely focus on endemic problems such as catheter-associated urinary tract infections, central-line-associated bloodstream infections, and surgical-site infections, all of which can fuel antimicrobial resistance. Investigations of HAI-related outbreaks can provide important information for improvements in infection control. 32 For example, infections due to unsafe injection practices, 33 including reuse of syringes and inappropriate use of single-use vials, have led to targeted educational campaigns for both patients and health-care providers. 34 Outbreaks have also occurred from contaminated products including those prepared in compounding pharmacies. In 2012-13, a large HAI outbreak in the USA-involving more than 14 000 patients who were potentially exposed and resulting in 751 reported cases of fungal infections, including 384 cases of meningitis and 64 deaths across 20 states 35 -was caused by injections of contaminated steroids produced by a single compounding facility. 36 In the early to mid-2000s, several large-scale US regional and state-wide projects showed substantial decreases for central-line-associated bloodstream infections in intensive care units through focused eff orts to increase adherence to a set of recommended practices for insertion and maintenance of intravascular catheters. 37, 38 Momentum from these and other successes [39] [40] [41] led to new federal, state, and local eff orts to prevent HAIs.

The results clearly indicate that Taiwan must identify the reason for the increase in tourists from all other nations. To minimize the impact of China's Open-door Policy on the number of tourists from all other nations (regions), the best strategy for Taiwan is to promote different factors to attract tourists from nations other than China. If the current preparation and arrangement of travel and tourism facilities is specifically designed or developed for China due to its large number of inbound tourists, then other nations have the opportunity to use them only incidentally. This makes other nations a spillover beneficiary of travel to Taiwan. This is not an effective way of developing the tourism industry for Taiwan in the long term. Because inbound tourists from different nations have different preferences and tastes for tourism facilities and installations, such as hotels, motels, and public transportation, the preparation of different types of hardware and software facilities suitable for tourists from different nations around the world is essential. Relying on a policy imposed by other nations to bring Taiwan an abundant number of tourists is an unwise and passive decision.

A character isation of healthcareseeking behaviour requires under standing the types of healthcare facilities available, the l evels of health-care facilities at which patients can present for care, referral and treatment patterns, and modes of transportation between homes and health care facilities. Investigators must understand the local context regarding available healthcare-seeking behaviours, as well as barriers to care. For example, caretakers might not bring a sick child to any healthcare facility because of insurance status or if they distrust, or if they have little confidence in, medical personnel. Children with severe disease might not make it to a referral hospital if they have insufficient funds or resources for further transportation from a health post or centre. Lastly, the cost of health care at the referral facility might impede the child from receiving appropriate care. As with any community-based trial, there is rarely a universal approach.

Background: Most of the residents in the LTCFs were survivors from acute medical conditions and frequently harbored multi-drug resistant organisms resulting from their previous treatment course. Therefore, infection or colonization with Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) have become an important issue. This study planned to investigate the antimicrobial agent susceptibility of and the molecular typing of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the residents and environments in six long-term care facilities (LTCFs) in Taiwan. Methods: We prospectively investigated the existence of MDROs, including MRSA, in residents of six LTCFs and their environments from January to December 2016. Active surveillance of colonization of MDROs was performed by culturing nasal and rectal swab samples every three months for the residents. If MSA was identified, then swab specimens from environmental sources were collected and cultured. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MICs) of common anti-microbial agents were tested. The SCCmec genotype and Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of selected MRSA isolates were further analyzed. Results: A total of 339 isolates of MRSA was identified during the study period. Among them, 135 isolates (39.8%) were identified from LTCF residents. Generally, the isolate numbers from LTCF residents in each surveillance culture correlated with the number of isolates from the environment. The predominant SCCmec genotypes were type IV and V. The predominant MLST types belonged to ST59 (42.3%, 60/152) and ST45 (19.7%, 28/142). The predominant MLST strains varied from facilities to facilities. However, the MLST typing from the environment cultures could correlate with the culture from the residents. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MICs) of 339 isolates of MRSA to various commonly used antibiotics were determined. All isolates were susceptible to vancomycin, nitrofurantoin, quinopristin-dalfoprestine, linezolid, mupirocin, and teicoplanin. Daptomycin (99.7%), rifampicin (97.9%), and fucidic acid (96.8%) also exerted excellent in vitro activities against these 339 isolates of MRSA. However, the MIC values of tetracycline, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, and ciprofloxacin were significantly lower in ST59 as compared to ST45. Conclusion: The MRSA widely distributed in some but not all the long-term care facilities in Taiwan. No single clonal expansion was found in different facilities. However, the MLST typing of the environmental stains highly correlated with the colonized strains in LTCF residents. An individualized environmental cleansing policy should be adopted to facilitate the LTCF to reduce the environmental colonization with MRSA. Commonly used antimicrobial agents against hospital-acquired strain of MRSA remained highly active against these isolates from LTCFs.",32.99763825332745,14.619470713322048

A section addressing the use of UVGI for environmental surfaces is also included. The germicidal susceptibility of biologic agents is addressed, but with emphasis on application in health care facilities. The balance of scientific evidence indicates that UVGI should be considered as a disinfection application in a health care setting only in conjunction with other well-established elements, such as appropriate heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems; dynamic removal of contaminants from the air; and preventive maintenance in combination with through cleaning of the care environment. We conclude that although UVGI is microbiocidal, it is not ''ready for prime time'' as a primary intervention to kill or inactivate infectious microorganisms; rather, it should be considered an adjunct. Other factors, such as careful design of the built environment, installation and effective operation of the HVAC system, and a high level of attention to traditional cleaning and disinfection, must be assessed before a health care facility can decide to rely solely on UVGI to meet indoor air quality requirements for health care facilities.

Third, we are only able to measure CDI cases that are either identified on admission or during a hospital stay. Clearly, many cases occur after a patient's stay. 33 Future work should explore alternative data sources with post-discharge information in an attempt to correctly attribute possible community cases to institutions and further investigate the role of a hospital's centrality as a risk factor for CDI. Fourth, network centrality is a risk factor for CDI primarily in only the more-connected hospitals. Finally, our modeling framework accommodates the heterogeneity among hospitals using fixed effects as opposed to random effects. Mixed effects models, based on the latter approach, were considered. However, mixed effects modelling requires the random effects be uncorrelated with the predictors. It is unlikely that the random effects are truly uncorrelated with the indegree of a hospital and, as such, mixed effects models would not accurately estimate the effect of indegree.

As a result, there are limited areas in which critical care can be provided on a routine basis outside of current critical care areas (ICU, postanesthesia care unit, ED). As with staffing, some hospitals face shortages of critical care spaces, 46,71-73 although occupancy varies across the United States. In Ontario in 2006, there were 1,789 critical care beds, 1,057 of which were capable of accommodating mechanical ventilation. 74 The occupancy rate for these beds approaches 90%. 50 Demands on critical care resources are expected to increase in both the United States and Canada as the populations age. 75 On a day-to-day basis, additional capacity can be created in the critical care system by expanding critical care to areas of the hospital such as the postanesthesia care unit. However, this expansion is still limited by the issues of stuff and staff discussed earlier. Therefore, even though the bed spaces may be available to use for critical care, if the hospital rents its ventilators and has no more on site, the ability to expand critical care remains limited unless specific advanced planning and preparation are undertaken. Finally, although it is possible to convert off-site locations 17, 53 (ie, hotels, gymnasiums, sports fields) into medical treatment facilities, the ability to convert such areas to critical care facilities on a large scale is curtailed because of the functional requirements and logistical challenges, such as large-volume portable oxygen supplies.",28.289997322684094,14.666098970337657

Reinforcement of nurses' positive attitudes could be easily achieved by verbal expression of approval and support from nursing administrators, or substantial rewards such as special compensation payments could be used to encourage and acknowledge nurses for their efforts. Third, improving nurses' access to resources provided by hospitals is a key point to increase nurses' intention. Nurse administrators need to ensure that staff nurses obtain sufficient resources and psychologic support, and have the capability and capacity to respond properly to care for SARS patients or any future public emergencies of this kind. Fourth, it is crucial for nursing administrators to serve as nurse advocates to reflect the frontline nurses' voices and concerns in the battle to contain diseases such as SARS, and build up direct communication channels between the hospital administration and staff nurses.",31.141708844985672,15.072825799316306

From 2016 to 2017, a large point prevalence survey of HAI and antimicrobial use was conducted in the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) including 310,755 patients from 1209 acute care hospitals in 28 countries and 117,138 residents from 2221 long-term care facilities in 23 countries.

The CDC has recommended a ""Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette Strategy for Healthcare Facilities,"" including specific ""Recommendations for Long-Term Care Facilities."" 2 My editorial mentions the lack of sensitive, real-time diagnostic tests to determine which organism is responsible for cough and fever in a resident with an acute change in status. Even the rapid influenza tests have problems with sensitivity. The editorial also mentions that familiar respiratory viruses such as influenza, parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), especially complicated by pneumonia, have mortality rates in nursing home residents greater than the 9% figure cited for SARS cases in the community. Because clinicians seldom know the precise etiology of an infectious respiratory syndrome, the CDC now recommends universal respiratory hygiene for all patients who present with an infectious respiratory syndrome, especially during periods of increased respiratory activity in the community (ie, evidence of ongoing transmission). The approach includes droplet secretion precautions. Given the fact that influenza, SARS-CoV, parainfluenza, and RSV are all transmissible and potentially lethal in nursing home residents, and could be clinically indistinguishable, it seems prudent to initially approach all residents with symptoms of acute respiratory infection with droplet secretion precautions modified to the reality of your facility.

Thirteen were discharged home, 16 were discharged to a long-term care facility and fi ve died. Two of these patients were comatose and their families requested withdrawal of care. The other three died from brain death. Eighteen patients (25%) had hypoperfusion and all 18 progressed to brain death. Twenty-one patients (29%) had vasospasm. Four of these patients were discharged home, 11 to a long-term care facility and six died. The vasospasm was detected on hospital day 1 in three patients, hospital day 2 in seven patients, hospital day 3 in four patients and hospital day 7 in seven patients. Nimodipine was administered in six patients and all six were discharged to a long-term care facility. However, in one patient, nimodipine caused hemodynamic instability and was discontinued.

Conclusions Most patients with normal measurements can be expected to survive. Patients with hypoperfusion have a poor prognosis. In patients with vasospasm, the use of nimodipine should be considered; however, further studies are needed to determine safety and effi cacy. TCD may be useful in determining early prognosis.

Enteric pathogens can induce intestinal injury with consequent diarrhea in three ways: (1) by producing enterotoxins that interact with receptors located on the gut epithelial cells and evoke anion secretion, such as V. cholera, EPEC, EAEC, STEC, C. dif®cile, and S. aureus (A); (2) by invading the gut epithelium and M cells, thus altering the cell cytoskeleton and activating intracellular pathways through virulence factors. Organisms that lead to diarrhea through these mechanisms include EIEC, Shigella, EPEC, Salmonella, and rotaviruses (B); (3) by invading mucosal macrophages and inducing in¯ammatory responses leading to intestinal epithelial damage and anion secretion. Campylobacter and Yersinia use this mechanism (B). outbreaks in long-term and short-term care facilities and Salmonella by itself accounts for more than 50% of cases and more than 80% of deaths in food-borne outbreaks in nursing homes.",32.33411383855798,14.197931376893921

Coalitions have existed prior to the development of the HPP. Coalitions developed with the CSEPP program, Metropolitan Medical Response System (MMRS), Metropolitan Strike Teams, and now with the hospital preparedness program. Coalitions are locally or regionally based. Membership within coalitions is defined at the local level (city, county, state, or region). Coalitions have established leaders who have specific roles and responsibilities as well as an organizational framework. Individual organizational support is identified through the development of an MOU or memorandum of agreement. Such agreements articulate roles and responsibilities, identify the process for distribution of funding sources, and facilitate the integration of the preparedness community. For example, some coalitions have used HPP grant dollars to purchase equipment, creating communications networks between facilities and first responder partners. They have purchased caches of supplies and established community-based emergency preparedness exercises. Coalitions exist as a result of established day-to-day relationships within a hospital and between hospitals and public health partners. Relationships develop that include levels of trust, familiarity, and dependability. Coalitions have expanded outside the hospital/public health boundaries to include skilled nursing facilities and long term care facilities, all of which are part of the fabric of health care providers in the community. Many coalitions share training schedules, offer joint educational or preparedness conferences, and act as mentors to other health care partners as they develop emergency preparedness plans for their organizations. In times of emergency, knowing one's coalition partners and how to reach them quickly can help keep health care services intact. The ability to bounce back in the face of disaster is the hallmark of resilience. 14 As of 2016, funding levels for both the HPP and PHEP program have been cut, forcing hospitals to determine whether participation in regional coalitions, planning efforts, and exercises is still worth their financial support.",65.21130433694967,26.15183943962809

Indeed, during a 3-year surveillance in facilities of Franche-Comté region, incidence of MRSA colonisations/infections was 0.09 and 0.9, respectively, in LTCF and acute care facilities. The objectives of this study were to establish the frequency of MRSA acquisition in a 250 beds-LTCF and to discuss the roles of screening for MRSA carriers, the type of isolation to be implemented and the efficiency of chemical decontamination. The combination of the prevalence of MRSA carriage and MRSA screening upon admission allowed us to evaluate the MRSA acquisition risk according to the characteristics of the patients and the inter-hospital transfers. The prevalence study showed that 15.2% of the patients were MRSA carriers. On the admission, 23.3% of the patients were positive with MRSA. Among MRSA-free patients on admission, without any transfer, 14% became positive for MRSA, all had lost their autonomy. Chemical decolonisation (nasal mupirocin + cutaneous chlorexidine) was efficient for 22 patients out of 25 (88%). In LTCF, the frequency of MRSA cross-transmission could not be evaluated on the basis of clinical samples. MRSA acquisition occurred exclusively among totally dependent patients. Thus, technical isolation rules should be respected when carrying out treatments, the efficacy of such isolation being unaffected by the mobility of patients and their ""resocialisation"". Chemical decolonisation was efficient and made it possible to reduce the number of days of technical isolation. Given the increase in morbidity associated with MRSA observed in numerous hospitals, the emergence of a community-based disease linked to these strains and the emergence of glycopeptide-resistant strains, the application of a voluntary strategy including screening, isolation and decolonization in R-CCF appears to be an urgent matter of priority.",34.70280438397537,13.621378891736006

A systematic review demonstrates that influenza vaccine effectively prevents pneumonia, hospitalization, and death [317, 318] . A recent large observational study of adults у65 years of age found that vaccination against influenza was associated with a reduction in the risk of hospitalization for cardiac disease (19% reduction), cerebrovascular disease (16%-23% reduction), and pneumonia or influenza (29%-32% reduction) and a reduction in the risk of death from all causes (48%-50% reduction) [319] . In longterm-care facilities, vaccination of health care workers with influenza vaccine is an important preventive health measure [318, 320, 321] . Because the main virulence factors of influenza virus, a neuraminidase and hemagglutinin, adapt quickly to selective pressures, new vaccine formulations are created each year on the basis of the strains expected to be circulating, and annual revaccination is needed for optimal protection. 43 Many people who should receive either influenza or pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine have not received them.

A healing organization adopts a philosophy of person-centered care and participatory teamwork and provides the technology, equipment, facilities, and supplies that support healing practices and regular monitoring, evaluation, and continuous improvement. 2 These types of clinical teams are shown to cut costs, improve clinical outcomes, reduce mortality, enhance staff morale, and improve patient satisfaction. 39, 40 ",24.859523930032424,11.763991911468684

During the outbreak, all hospitals and long-term care (LTC) facilities enacted quarantine measures and visitors were restricted entry. Privately paid 'companions' hired directly by families and estates to provide one-on-one care were not permitted on site because they were classified as visitors, not staff, even though the facility was their work site. Before the crisis, LTC management had not paid attention to how many companions worked directly for residents; however, companions became highly visible during the quarantine. At one facility companions were lined up outside the large atrium windows unable to get in, while the residents were seated in wheelchairs inside the atrium unable to get out. It was particularly remarkable because the size of the companion workforce rivalled the paid staff complement. According to a physician who worked at the LTC facility during the quarantine, nearly half of its 'workforce' had disappeared. At the time, this facility was atypical amongst peer organizations for its heavy reliance on companion labour as well as for the public way in which this shadow workforce was revealed. SARS pushed facility management to 'see' this otherwise invisible workforce. Management subsequently enacted policies, training, and quasi-staff-like requirements and hired a companion coordinator; yet despite these changes, the facility held no liability for companions' working conditions such as hours, rates of pay, and holiday time or their rights to workers' compensation in the case of illness or injury. Companions remained privately paid employees doing much of the same work as the care aides employed in this publicly funded and unionized facility, but without the same protections or benefits.",25.8417580037573,11.017153432790503

The decision to continue resuscitation efforts beyond 10 min of no heart rate is often complex and may be influenced by many factors such as the presumed aetiology of the arrest, the gestation of the baby, the presence or absence of complications. • Cord clamping should be delayed for at least 1 min in babies who do not require resuscitation.

Few surplus resources to accommodate these casualties exist in our current health care system. Plans for ''surge capacity'' must thus be made to accommodate a large number of patients. Surge planning should allow activation of multiple levels of capacity from the health care facility level to the federal level. Plans should be scalable and flexible to cope with the many types and varied timelines of disasters. Incident management systems and cooperative planning processes will facilitate maximal use of available resources. However, resource limitations may require implementation of triage strategies. Facility-based or ''surge in place'' solutions maximize health care facility capacity for patients during a disaster. When these resources are exceeded, community-based solutions, including the establishment of off-site hospital facilities, may be implemented. Selection criteria, logistics, and staffing of off-site care facilities is complex, and sample solutions from the United States, including use of local convention centers, prepackaged trailers, and state mental health and detention facilities, are reviewed. Proper pre-event planning and mechanisms for resource coordination are critical to the success of a response. The terrorist attacks of 2001 and the threat of large-scale infectious disease outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and pandemic influenza have revealed potentially large gaps in the ability of the health care system to find either the capacity or the special capabilities to cope with disasters that severely injure or infect a large number of victims. 1, 2 Although much current planning revolves around large-scale terrorist or epidemic events, the recent Rhode Island nightclub fire demonstrates that even a moderate-sized incident may generate large numbers of victims whose care requires supplemental staff and specialized resources and overwhelms local capabilities. 3 There is an urgent need for communities and regions, not just individual health care facilities, to develop tiered, scalable, and flexible surge capacity plans to provide care for a large volume of patients.

Short-course (3-day) therapy has been studied in the developing world, but the clinical, laboratory, and radiographic description of these study patients is less definitive than in developed countries, and documentation of a bacterial pathogen is infrequent [223] . Similar prospective, comparative studies of short-course therapy with intensive investigation for etiology of pneumonia have not been performed in the developed world. Although the total course of therapy is often 10 days, transition to oral therapy has been often used to allow discharge from an inpatient setting, providing decreased risks from intravenous administration of therapy and exposure to nosocomial pathogens. Although no data from prospective, controlled studies are available, retrospective reviews suggest that this practice is effective. Transition from intravenous to daily intramuscular therapy with long-acting antibiotics, particularly b-lactams such as ceftriaxone or ertapenem, may provide another option for hospital discharge for the child who no longer requires supplemental oxygen and skilled nursing care but may still require parenteral therapy. In areas with skilled pediatric outpatient nursing resources, for children who may require longer duration of parenteral therapy, outpatient intravenous therapy through an indwelling central catheter, with daily skilled pediatric home nursing visits, provides another option for out-of-hospital care [224] . The duration of parenteral therapy before transition to oral therapy is based on the severity of the initial presentation and the rapidity of improvement. Improvement in fever, cough, tachypnea, and supplemental oxygen dependency and increased activity and appetite, supported by a reduction in peripheral leukocyte counts and/or CRP or other acute-phase reactants, are used by many clinicians to aid in decisions regarding transition to oral therapy.

Public health laboratories in the Laboratory Response Network are authorized to perform the molecular screening test for EVD. 17 Risk assessment is a critical element of developing a laboratory plan for EVD testing, and the Association of Public Health Laboratories has developed a template for this process. 18 Laboratories use a combination of point-of-care testing and compact analyzers that fit into a biosafety cabinet, as well as large automated closed-tube analyzers in core testing facilities. 19 When preparing a laboratory to support the care of patients with EVD, a specialized and trained team should be assembled, and a safe space identified to perform the testing. A test menu should be established. The laboratory team should train together and use a buddy system to maintain safety while performing testing. The laboratorians should practice routine skills and run laboratory test controls in the space designated for EVD testing to develop muscle memory for the different skills and clinical challenges that they will face when working with specimens in PPE that is not used in everyday practice. Practicing these skills allows for problemsolving for unique challenges.

By typing strains causing infection among patients we can distinguish between a strain from the community and one circulating endemically or causing an outbreak within the hospital. The prevention and control strategies are different in each case, and thus it is important to distinguish between them. Screening new hospital patients for the presence of S. aureus and then intervening to prevent spread or self-inoculation can reduce introduction of new strains. For strains already circulating in the hospital, screening hospital personnel and retraining personnel on proper hygiene may be in order. In hospitals there are a variety of surfaces that may be contaminated with potential pathogens that might serve as a source of infection.

The main findings are that the increase in the NHS budget, while drawing away resources from its private counterpart and from other non-health related sectors, leads to an overall welfare gain through increased worker incomes and, more importantly, direct increases in population well-being. The presence of health care-specific skilled labour and capital reduces the overall welfare gain by about two thirds, as over half of the specified budget rise is absorbed by higher wages and rents. This suggests the importance of tackling short-term rigidities in the health sector. The shortage of highly skilled workers may in the short-term be addressed via the recruitment of highly skilled foreign doctors and nurses. This policy was found to yield the highest overall welfare gains, even if all foreign worker income is remitted abroad, since government transfers need to fall by less to finance the health care budget increase due to higher government tax revenues. It is, however, unlikely to be a desirable policy given that many migrant workers come from developing countries which need their own educated staff.

Each method of decontamination requires that the equipment be exposed for an extended period of time (h) to a highly reactive or corrosive chemical vapor for the destruction of microbial life. The same chemical exposure can also be very destructive to the electronic components and optics, and therefore, decontamination cycles should be kept to a minimum to avoid shortening the life of valuable equipment. Routine equipment maintenance is often performed by a factory-trained service professional, but many factory service professionals are barred (because of medical surveillance and biosecurity restrictions) or refuse to enter high-containment facilities, so equipment must be removed from high containment and decontaminated for maintenance or repair. This is a critical factor in the selection of equipment for use in a high-containment laboratory. Large devices that are difficult to move, complex instruments that need frequent service support, or equipment that must be installed by a service engineer are not suitable for use in containment laboratories. Small robust instruments that can be maintained and repaired by the operator are a better choice for this application. Physically moving the equipment to and from its site of operation also means that it must not require a service person to set it up for operation. To minimize equipment damage from decontamination while preserving the routine maintenance schedule for the facility and the HTS equipment, decontamination and maintenance of equipment are often coordinated with regulatory-required annual shutdowns of the BSL-3 or -4 facilities. This allows service personnel to safely enter the facility or for equipment to be removed from the facility for maintenance. In addition, training in advanced equipment maintenance should be given to high-containment laboratory staff who can troubleshoot and repair equipment as needed. Real-time cameras with a clear view of the equipment as well as the networking of instrument computers can assist more experienced technical personnel in directing troubleshooting operations from outside of containment, but for security reasons, there may be limitations on this type of access.",22.277544273405326,10.530478625212279

Matthews and colleagues [41] analyzed Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from 30 developing countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America to determine indicators of maternal health care among the urban poor, as compared with the rural population. Their purpose was to see if there was an ''urban advantage'' or ''urban penalty'' for women. The investigators recognized a gap between different urban populations and speculated that the urban poor in many countries were at a disadvantage from their previous rural neighbors who did not migrate to the city. They found massive inequality in both urban and rural areas but greater inequality between slum urbanites or nonslum urbanites. The inequalities arose from exclusion; the urban poor did not have access to health care services and in some cities the slum dwellers were treated as if they did not even exist. However, there was a vast difference in the service gap among different countries. In some, the exclusion was not limited to the poor; services were insufficient for all strata of wealth. In others, it was primarily the poor who were excluded. And in some countries the urban population was well served without wealth or class distinction; a goal to strive for! Even when governmental programs to provide public clinics are established in a country, few of these are constructed in slum areas because of their tenuous nature [42] . Health care access is minimal at best in urban slums and is often predominated by private for-profit clinics [43] . Government investment in health care infrastructure in slums is limited. A study in Nairobi slums indicated that of 503 clinics serving what is reportedly the largest slum community in all of sub-Saharan Africa, only 6 (1%) were public and 79 (16%) were private not-forprofit clinics. Nearly all of the private for-profit clinics 418 (83%) in Nairobi slums are of dubious quality [44, 45] . The more qualified practices are expensive, forcing the use of cheaper private facilities that are often not licensed and operate out of small shacks and maternity homes without complying with any standards of care. Despite the poor quality, it is the less expensive private facilities that are the ones most often used by the residents. Women residing in slum areas, as elsewhere, prefer to deliver their babies in health care facilities where access is easy and quality is perceived to be high [46] . Given the difficulties already illustrated in transportation, access to public and nonprofit clinics of higher quality outside the slum areas is problematic; however, a lack of health care facilities is not apparent in all slum areas. In Chennai, India, slum residents were satisfied with their access to health care facilities with a mix of both government and private clinics within close proximity to residents; however, government clinics here were also somewhat limited, and individuals preferred the private clinics, considering them to provide better services [47] .",28.35293124894182,12.476066901017806

It is estimated that approximately two-thirds of NH residents received antibiotics each year, and up to 75% of the treatment is inappropriate. NHs become the reservoirs for resistant bacteria within a community. 31 Although the present protocol cannot be implemented in NHs, it can be used among severe NH patients who are transferred to the ED. In a less severe outbreak, the nasopharyngeal samples of NH residents can be collected and sent to contracted laboratories for respiratory panel testing.

Most of the 717 residents in this study were nonambulatory, and most had 4 or more CCCs. More than half required feeding tubes, and nearly one-third had tracheostomies. The study population was also young, with a median age at enrollment of 2.6 years. Infections also had a substantial effect on acute care resources, as 7.0% of residents with infections were hospitalized. Although relatively few studies describe infections in pLTCFs, like the present study all found that RTIs were most common. 10, 17, 18 These data contrast with the types of infections reported among adults residing in long-term care facilities and children in acute care populations. Urinary tract infections are generally reported to be the most common infection in adult long-term care facilities, 19, 20 while pneumonia, surgical-site infections, and gastrointestinal infections (including Clostridium difficile) are the most commonly reported infections among hospitalized children. 21 In pLTCFs, there are numerous opportunities for exposure to and transmission of potential pathogens, particularly respiratory viruses. 10, 11, 22 Residents require numerous medical interventions, specialized equipment, and rehabilitative and recreational services provided by staff with specialized skills. 12, 22 The facilities' physical structure may also contribute to pathogen transmission because of multibed resident bedrooms, common eating areas, and on-site schools. Furthermore, social and physical interactions are valued; thus, residents are in close contact with other residents, staff, volunteers, and visitors of all ages. 23 Residents may exhibit behaviors that contribute to transmission, such as difficulty adhering to respiratory and hand hygiene regimens. 24, 25 Pathogens circulating in the community can infect residents and staff and evolve into clusters of cases or large outbreaks. 9 During the study period, 62 outbreaks were reported to the New York State Department of Health, affecting 819 residents. Most of these outbreaks were caused by respiratory viruses, which can be associated with more severe disease and potentially death in this vulnerable population. 9, 26 Despite high rates of resident and staff influenza vaccination (>90%), influenza species were associated costs associated with RTIs are typically 10-fold higher during the respiratory viral season. 27 Respiratory viruses were more common than bacteria, and many of the bacteria detected were consistent with community-acquired pathogens, such as group A streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. These findings contrast with the results of a survey conducted among staff at pLTCFs: 76% of respondents ranked multidrug-resistant bacteria as the infection control issue of greatest importance in their facility. Systematic surveys of antimicrobial susceptibility data from pLTCFs are lacking. 28 We found that younger children are at increased risk of respiratory viral infections likely because of both immunologic and behavioral characteristics. Many children with CCCs are at increased risk of RTIs because of the difficulty of handling their secretions and/or aspiration. Device use is associated with increased contact with staff and therefore an increased risk of transmission of pathogens. 22, 24 Feeding tubes could increase the risk of aspiration, although nasogastric tubes were not found to be a risk factor for RTIs. We speculate that this lack of effect reflects the shorter duration of use of nasogastric tubes, which are likely replaced by more permanent enteral feeding tubes. 29 None of the patient risk factors we found are likely modifiable in this population. However, infection rates varied among the sites, suggesting that other factors (eg, unmeasured patient factors and differences in site infrastructure, architecture, and/or infection prevention and control strategies) could be modifiable risk factors. One site demonstrated that sequential implementation of infection prevention and control policies directed at RTIs (including mandatory staff influenza vaccination) led to a significant decline in RTIs associated with outbreaks and influenza, although the overall RTI rate increased. 30 However, the optimal infection prevention and control practices are uncertain for the pLTCF population. 28 ",25.32733080171919,13.087541845283724

Although China has a policy of free tuberculosis services, in most places these are available only to permanent residents in a particular community. Urban migrants, who have relocated from poor rural areas to seek a better livelihood, are not eligible for such free services. These vulnerable, pre dominantly young migrants-now numbering more than 150 million-tend to live and work in crowded environments and are unlikely to seek medical care when they become ill. Such individuals contribute to the spread of tuberculosis, HIV infection, and other infectious diseases within urban centres. The growing epidemic of co-infection with tuberculosis and HIV if left unchecked will substantially increase the number of tuberculosis cases and deaths. 18 A further diffi culty is presented by the shortage of trained health-care workers for tuberculosis control. CDC facilities are being rebuilt across the country but many are staff ed inadequately or by poorly trained and unmotivated health-care workers.

Similarly, there is greater risk of contracting the disease in confined environments such as prisons, homeless shelters and long-term care facilities. 20 Studies on ventilation issues and transmission risk of tuberculosis in private houses have received little attention, in company with most other respiratory infections. 81 Statistics from the USA in 2002 put the healthcare costs of buildinginfluenced communicable respiratory infections, including tuberculosis, at US$10 billion. 78 ",36.840792328445005,16.03343849640564

Influenza attack rates often remain 110% among unvaccinated HCWs, even when there are excellent infection-control measures and behavioral compliance [29] . Viral shedding of influenza in adults can extend for 7 days after symptom onset and for weeks in infants and immunocompromised individuals. This makes environmental control of influenza even more difficult in health care facilities. Thus, the initial specific protection of HCWs will need to include available antiviral agents (e.g., oseltamivir and zanamivir) for chemoprophylaxis and treatment. A recently proposed university hospital-based preparedness plan has recommended the stockpiling of oseltamivir [29] . There are 4 potential strategies for using antiviral agents during an influenza outbreak [30, 31] : chemoprophylaxis for the entire influenza outbreak and season, postexposure chemoprophylaxis, treatment of ill patients, and a combination of chemoprophylaxis and treatment. Several studies support the use of prophylactic viral agents [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . Furthermore, a model of the 1957-1958 Asian influenza pandemic predicted that 8 weeks of antiviral prophylaxis for close contacts of index case patients would have reduced the attack rate from 33% to 2% [36] . Thus, targeted prophylaxis for HCWs and patients would likely mean administering 6-8 weeks of prophylaxis to all vulnerable groups. Although attractive, this strategy is prohibitively expensive for most hospitals and other health care facilities in both developed and developing countries. Furthermore, widespread, long-term use of antiviral prophylaxis could promote antiviral resistance. An alternative strategy that focuses on the treatment of ill HCWs, with some targeted prophylaxis of heavily exposed HCWs, would be more financially feasible. This strategy would provide for treatment of those HCWs directly caring for patients with influenza during a pandemic. Recent studies have reported that neuraminidase inhibitors administered within 48 h of symptom onset decrease the duration of illness and viral shedding, the incidence of hospitalization, antibiotic use, and mortality [35, 37, 38] . Health care workers should be tracked and monitored for influenza-like illness (e.g., myalgia and fever). It is likely that such monitoring would identify most of the ill HCWs and, thus, allow timely administration of antiviral therapy. Despite these recommendations, health care facilities in developing countries may find it difficult to imple- ment antiviral therapy because of the associated high cost.",28.98339157601245,14.147691196749772

Toronto would later be recognised as the site of North America's largest outbreak of this disease. 1 It took 4 months of substantial control measures at the local, national, and international levels to contain the epidemic. In the end, SARS affected over 8000 patients in 29 countries, with 774 deaths worldwide. Toronto had 251 probable cases with 43 deaths. 2 The province of Ontario was ill-prepared to deal with an infectious disease threat on such a scale. [3] [4] [5] In Canada, the provision of health care, including public health, is a provincial responsibility. However, the financial and operational responsibility for public health had increasingly been shifted to municipalities such that, at the time of the SARS outbreak, funding was shared equally between the two levels of government. This funding shift created a decentralised public-health system, with the province's 37 public-health units operating quite independently of each other. 3 Ontario is the only Canadian province that does not have a regionalised health-care system so that each Ontario hospital functions semi-autonomously as a private not-forprofit organisation.

Repeated or prolonged stress at this level results in either a shortterm (weeks) decay or, optimally, long-term solutions, such as increased staff, re-engineered space, etc. Close examination of these solutions provides important insight into potential solutions to a larger-scale, longerterm surge capacity situation. The incremental costs of re-engineering space to provide flexible utilization is much more cost-effective and allowable under most regulatory systems than is a fixed building or permanent assignment of space. The process involved in changing operations, such as surgery scheduling and staff shift flexibility, provides insight into the impact of long-term disaster services. For example, Rambam Medical Center in Haifa, Israel, can increase the number of burn victims it can handle from 15 to 136 by altering staff allocations and re-engineering space. 11 Larger-scale events, longer-term events, or those requiring specified care will place unique demands on a system, regardless of emergency operations preparedness. It should not be assumed that 100 times as many patients require 100 times the amount of response.

A disas-ter may quickly exhaust available supplies, including medications, or may prevent the further replenishment of supplies from outside of the affected area. It is important to conduct a needs assessment and have an ongoing materials management process to assess current and anticipated needs and acquisition and appropriation of supplies on hand. In many U.S. disasters, supply shortages have not occurred,but rather,excessive donations have created a different challenge (see Chapter 35). Unfortunately, the preevent purchase and stockpile of equipment can be costly and difficult to justify in the current economic environment and as healthcare facilities continue to shift to ""just in time"" inventories. Graded increases in par levels of supplies, regionally leveraged purchases, and rotation into stock can ease the financial burden of preparedness. Federal response systems anticipate this need and purchase, and strategic forward deployment has been under way at that level. However, depending on the nature of the incident, it is prudent to assume that facilities and agencies should plan on being self-sufficient for the first 48 to 72 hours after an event. This places an additional burden on planning for an event, such as an explosion or chemical event, which will require adequate resources within the first hours or sooner.

Nearly half of elderly people have non-communicable diseases and this trend is predicted to last into 2020. 169 Chronic respiratory disease, cerebrovascular disease, and ischaemic heart disease are the three largest contributors to the probability of death for people aged 50-75 years. 56 Diseases commonly associated with ageing are also prevalent. For example, according to a national survey done in 2008-09, the prevalence of dementia in individuals aged 65 years or older in urban areas was 4·4% (95% CI 3·9-4·9) compared with 6·2% (5·5-7·0) in rural areas. For Alzheimer's disease, prevalence was 2·4% (2·0-2·8) in urban areas and 4·4% (3·7-5·0) in rural areas. For vascular dementia, prevalence was 1·6% (1·3-1·7) in urban areas and 1·4% (1·0-1·6) in rural areas. 170 The self-reported health status of elderly urban residents decreased significantly in China between 2001 and 2013, with mean scores for self-reported physical health declining from 70·86 (SD 28·08) to 61·46 (23·16) and mental health scores declining from 75·63 (25·73) to 64·59 (21·76). 171 The increasing health needs of elderly people and dwindling resources are main contributing factors for declining health among elderly urban residents. According to 2010 census data, of people aged 65 years or older in urban areas, roughly 78% were classified as healthy, 18% were unhealthy but able to care for themselves, and 4% required assistance. Nationwide, the demand for health-care services increased by 15·2% in 2015 compared with a decade ago. Health expenditure on elderly people as a percentage of GDP increased from 2·1% in 1993 to 3·4% in 2013. 45 Notably, rising health costs have substantially burdened older people. For example, the average monthly pension for 79·74 million retired enterprise workers was ¥2200 ($354) in 2015. 172 In comparison, an analysis of national household survey data (2007-11) on medical spending on five major chronic diseases among urban residents, including those aged 65 years or older, found that the annual cost per capita for residents with cardiovascular disease was ¥8954 (about $1356), and ¥8914 (about $1350) for residents with diabetes. 173 Elderly people in urban China often rely on their families for financial support and care. Family support accounted for 24% of financial resources for people aged 65 years or older in 2010. However, increased life expectancy, the one-child policy, and changing cultural patterns have led to more elderly people to living alone than ever before. The 2010 census estimated that there were 6·32 million households of people aged 65 years or older who lived alone in urban areas. 45 The situation is more severe in large cities. In Beijing, 50% of empty-nest families and 80% of healthy retired urban residents live alone. 174 Elderly people who have lost their only child face the greatest challenges in meeting their care needs. As of 2015, an estimated 1·6 million families in China are in this situation, a number that is expected to increase to 4·5 million by 2050. 175 The shortage of family care has generated substantial pressure to develop a long-term care system, consisting of institutional and community care facilities in urban China. By the end of 2014, there were 16 549 nursing homes in urban areas, providing 2·65 million beds; 1·28 million people used these facilities. Compared with 1978, the number of nursing homes and people served increased by more than 22 times and the number of beds increased by more than 2654 times. 176 Despite substantial progress, the long-term care system in urban China still cannot meet the huge demand. The total number of people who used the system was less than 2% of the urban population aged 65 years or older, implying a huge gap between supply and demand. In addition to this shortage of facilities, affordability, efficacy, and regulatory oversight are major challenges. 177",34.38996352176237,15.754572795799659

Method: Questionnaires on job stress (Brief Job Stress Questionnaire; Shimomitsu et al., 1998) , eating behavior (Eating Behavior Scale; Sakata, 1997), self-efficacy in controlling situational appetite (Situational Appetite Measure; Shimai et al., 2000) , physical activity (Physical Activity Assessment Scale; Wakui & Suzuki, 1997) , and social skill (W-KiSS-16; Tanaka, 2007) were conducted with 254 part-timers aged 19-72 years (46.96±11.41 years) in a food industry in Japan. The relation between obesity, job stress, eating behavior, physical activity and social skills were analyzed between 52 obese subjects (BMI≥25.0 kg/m2), 185 normal range subjects (18.5 kg/m2≤BMI<25.0 kg/m2), and 17 underweight subjects (BMI<18.5 kg/m2). Statistical analyses included correlation analysis and multivariate regression analysis. Result: In Obese subjects, eating behavior was significantly associated with job stress response of physical stress response (β=.42, p<.001), self-efficacy in controlling situational appetite of reward (β=−.37, p<.01), relax (β=−.25, p<.05), and physical activity was significantly associated with job stress response of fatigue (β=−.46, p<.001). In normal range subjects, eating behavior was significantly associated with job stress response of physical stress response (β=.17, p<.01), self-efficacy in controlling situational appetite of negative feeling (β=−.23, p<.01), relax (β=−.30, p<.001), and physical activity was significantly associated with job stress factor of qualitative workload (β=.16, p<.05), family and friend support (β=−.19, p<.05).

Such practices and behaviors as congregation of children in play areas where toys and bodily secretions are easily shared and rooming-in of family members with pediatric patients can further increase the risk of transmission. Pathogenic bacteria have been recovered from toys used by hospitalized patients; 378 contaminated bath toys were implicated in an outbreak of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa on a pediatric oncology unit. 80 In addition, several patient factors increase the likelihood that infection will result from exposure to pathogens in health care settings (eg, immaturity of the neonatal immune system, lack of previous natural infection and resulting immunity, prevalence of patients with congenital or acquired immune deficiencies, congenital anatomic anomalies, and use of life-saving invasive devices in NICUs and PICUs). 63 There are theoretical concerns that infection risk will increase in association with innovative practices used in the NICU for the purpose of improving developmental outcomes, Such factors include cobedding 379 and kangaroo care, 380 which may increase opportunity for skin-to-skin exposure of multiple gestation infants to each other and to their mothers, respectively; although the risk of infection actually may be reduced among infants receiving kangaroo care. 381 Children who attend child care centers 382, 383 and pediatric rehabilitation units 384 may increase the overall burden of antimicrobial resistance by contributing to the reservoir of CA-MRSA.

In particular, a lack of material resources is reported to be correlated with a high level of burnout [22] . These findings suggest that, in preparation for the outbreak of an emerging infectious disease, hospitals should prepare facilities for preventing infection, establish systematic infection control guidelines, and continue discussions about preventive measures [13, 14] . What is more, support from family and friends experienced as more extensive social support, was found to be another influencing factor, as reported in previous studies [5, 9] . In the context of employment, typical sources of social support are coworkers, supervisors, and the organization in general. Social support from one's supervisor and colleagues is found to provide a buffering effect that directly or indirectly reduces job stress [5, 9, 12, 14] . Accordingly, it is suggested that the aspect of social support from an employee's supervisor and colleagues should be taken into consideration for further research in future studies.

Community isolation and treatment facilities may also be activated; a prototype for such a facility was developed by the CDC for SARS. In general, community facilities will likely house and treat patients with milder disease, with the public health department coordinating these procedures and venues. Community isolation facilities (eg, motels, hotels) should have rooms that are equipped with private bathrooms, as well as receptacles to dispose of soiled linen and contaminated waste. Personnel who work at the facility should also have N-95 respirators available, as well as disposable gowns and gloves. In general, patients at these facilities will be expected to care for themselves. 15 Other hospital infection-control procedures may involve cohorting potentially infectious patients (if isolation beds are not available), as well as rapidly discharging appropriate inpatients and canceling elective procedures to alleviate strain on hospital resources. Preemptive planning and knowledge of health care facility (and ED) resource availability are critical components of preparedness. Lack of resource planning was cited as a significant factor that contributed to the spread of SARS in Southeast Asia and Toronto. 16 Unfortunately, few recent data exist describing the availability of isolation facilities in US EDs. A 1995 study found that less than 20% of EDs had negativepressure isolation rooms. 17 In a recent press release from November 2005, American College of Emergency Physicians leaders warned that there is an urgent need for increased ED and hospital planning, specifically citing lack of adequate surge capacity, isolation facilities, and staff to treat the large increase in the number of patients that may result from an influenza pandemic. 18 Depending on the circumstances of the outbreak, public health officials may recommend keeping suspected noncritical infectious patients at home. The CDC's guidelines for home isolation for SARS and pandemic influenza serve as prototypes. 19, 20 Alternatively, specific health care facilities may be designated as referral centers for suspected cases. 15 Although the public health department will ultimately be responsible for coordinating implementation of these types of large-scale overcapacity plans, emergency physicians need to understand the types of options available.

Consequently, items where antimicrobial copper alloys might have been easily incorporated, e.g. grab bars, sinks, faucets, paper dispensers, shelves and towel racks were not present. The further evaluation of antimicrobial copper surfaces is warranted beyond the medical ICU to include, but not be limited to, the effect of inherently antimicrobial materials in Fig. 4 .4 EPA registered antimicrobial cooper alloys used in the fabrication or surfacing of high touch items. Items were fabricated from a variety of EPA registered antimicrobial copper alloys as listed. The criterion used to select an alloy was reflective of the ability of the antimicrobial alloy to be readily fabricated into that particular component and withstand the rigors of healthcare general wards where patients have greater interaction with other objects in the built environment. Similarly, investigations should also be conducted in emergency and recovery rooms, in hospital rehabilitation units, pediatric and neonatal units, dialysis centers, burn units, transplant units and cancer centers with immunecompromised patients. At issue is the central theme that antimicrobial copper surfaces continuously and passively limit the concentration of bacteria within the built environment.

What does this week mean for the future of infection prevention and patient safety in emerging health care systems? How will infection prevention professionals and organizations participate in shaping future health care systems? 3 Historically, IPC has provided a systematic, unbiased method for identifying infections and infectious risks for patients and health care workers. In 1986, the year of the first ''Infection Control Week,'' most acute care occurred in hospitals, and although hospital IPC programs included ''prevention'' as a function of the program, the emphasis was on surveillance, with most of the program resources devoted to this area. During the 1980s, most health care involving invasive procedures or devices was provided in acute care facilities, HAI rates were not shared with persons or agencies outside of the hospital, and in most cases IPC was performed by designated ICPs, not multidisciplinary teams. At that time, bioterrorism belonged in science fiction, AIDS was an ''emerging disease,'' methicillin-resistant Staphyloccocus aureus was starting to migrate from academic tertiary care centers to mainstream community hospitals, and health care workers practiced using information from specialized disciplines. 4 Health care was evolving from a reliance on structures and processes that were more appropriate for organizations with predictable, discreet knowledge areas to the use of processes for complex adaptive system in which services and departments built on separate and unique knowledge areas were integrated and interactive. This newer environment was also one in which performance improvement was mandated and cost reductions were expected. 5 In 2009, complex, invasive health care procedures and technologies are not limited to acute care facilities, but occur in a variety of settings, including long-term care, ambulatory care, and patient homes. There are also discussions about providing some types of postoperative care at hotels located near surgery centers. IPs are challenged to institute IPC programs in these new practice settings but often lack a sufficient evidence editorial base to support their recommendations. In many nonacute care settings, infection criteria are not established, infections are not investigated, antibiotics are prescribed empirically, and denominators are not standardized. In addition, IPC staff are expected to provide strategies to control emerging biological challenges, such as multidrug-resistant organisms, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and such infections as pandemic influenza. IPs are key leaders in the application of intervention bundles that when instituted with other multidisciplinary health care workers, synergistically produce unexpected and welcome improvements in outcomes for patients with a central vascular line or on a ventilator. Furthermore, today there is a growing awareness that although health care involves complex, sophisticated, highly technical processes and devices, the basics still count, and isolated independent actions can impact other processes and parts within health care systems. There is an appreciation of the fact that successful outcomes require synergy among elements of care, including the mechanical-physical, psychological, social, emotional, and spiritual aspects.",34.2309937089845,15.44736354783749

Investment in the development of rapid point-of-care testing for MERS-CoV would be of great value to the global public health community. The upsurge in the number of human MERS-CoV infections over the past few years in health-care facilities in the Middle East and South Korea was attributed to several preventable factors. Low health-care worker awareness of the possibility of MERS-CoV with consequential poor implementation of infection control procedures resulted in nosocomial outbreaks. These outbreaks involved transmission of the infection to existing hospital patients, outpatients, visitors, and health-care workers within health-care facilities.

This decrease occurred throughout the country, even in areas with no reported cases of Ebola virus disease. The decrease occurred despite health facilities generally remaining open, likely because of fi nancial incentives put in place by the National Ebola Coordination to encourage health-care workers to remain at health facilities. Although community members were not interviewed during this survey, data from interviews of the health-care workers and community health workers support the hypothesis that the decline in attendance is likely indicative of the population's fear of accessing the formal health sector. The decline in the number of patients receiving antimalarial drugs is only partly explained by reduced attendance at health facilities, pointing to subtle changes in health-care seeking and delivery that diff er signifi cantly between Ebola-aff ected and Ebola-unaff ected areas. Since the start of the Ebola-virus-disease epidemic, patients have been less likely to seek care at health facilities or report fever.

However, even with the scale-up of the availability of rapid diagnostic tests, rates of testing did not increase in Ebola-aff ected prefectures.

These were often operated by international organisations with independent supply chains, and usually had a smaller distinct area for isolation and testing of suspect patients. EHUs were isolation units established in existing health facilities that undertook screening, testing, and initial treatment; these were largely implemented and staffed by local healthcare workers (HCWs), with varying amounts of international support. Community Care Centres were mainly established in rural areas; these were smaller and usually standalone temporary units that also attempted wider community engagement and social mobilisation, again with varying degrees of international assistance.

In fact, multiple factors can affect results (Table 1), including the type of hand hygiene compliance audit tool used. Use of a standardized tool, such as the WHO 5 Moments tool, allows valid comparability between sites, although standardization of assessors and wards surveyed requires careful attention [37].

Using an attack rate ranging from 10 to 30% of the population with a hospital admission rate close to 1% and a case-fatality rate close to 0.14%, as in seasonal flu (an hypothesis supported by preliminary data [1]), the pandemic may have a major impact on health services and ICM in particular. Some models have predicted critical care demand at the peak surge of the pandemic to be well in excess of 100% of available facilities, even in the most developed countries [11]. This is of considerable concern to practicing Intensivists. Increasing intensive care support by a factor of two without additional skilled and trained specialists and without the usual range or technical facilities and support services may well force us to ventilate more patients than normal, but this would not be ‘quality critical care.’ If this increased surge was to occur, then the numbers of patients presenting would be well in excess of the available capacity to provide them with quality care. This will necessitate triage. The ethics of triage have been discussed several times [12–15], but the concerns as to whether the ethical or legal framework will ultimately support clinicians faced with these tribulations remain. Practicing for a greater good, rather than what is best for an individual patient, may be the pragmatic answer to the problem, but clinicians are rightly concerned that this may lead to future complaint and legal or professional censure.

All these new viruses are distributed throughout the globe and affect people of all ages, but data on these viruses and the elderly are scarce. These new viral infections can be diagnosed by sensitive PCR methods. The viruses may be detectable in the airways for varying periods of time also after the acute phase and this leads to a diagnosis of several concomitant viruses. The classical predisposing factors to viral infections include advanced age, chronic illnesses and poor immune responses. The elderly often have partial immunity and chronic illnesses; these circumstances modify their responses to viruses and thus respiratory viral infections may manifest themselves as atypical symptoms or as exacerbation of chronic illnesses. Serious outbreaks have been reported in long-term care facilities. Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent serious disease, but it is only available for the influenza virus. Virus-specific treatment is also available only for the influenza virus. Early identification of a viral pathogen through improved viral diagnostics is crucial for successful treatment of viral illnesses. Preventive measures are also important, such as vaccinations, hand-washing and isolation of the affected individuals in hospitals and long-term care facilities. The ultimate clinical significance of the new respiratory viruses is still poorly unknown in the elderly population but probably these infections are greatly underestimated.",38.377971963519265,16.314993813387595

The Chinese government has tried to leverage private hospital investment, use policy to promote physicians’ mobility, and change reimbursement policy, to overcome these barriers. However, the financial relations between large public hospitals and senior physicians still allow public hospitals to design mechanisms to maintain their dominating positions. A RBRVS system reimbursing senior physicians directly will be able to eliminate such financial ties. Separating senior physicians from public hospitals as “free-agents” will promote the current provider-side reform, even though this strategy may also create other issues, such as the need to more closely monitor and supervise physician behavior.

Considering the well-established research literature on the long-term unemployment scarring effect this has important long-term economic and welfare advantages. First, long-term unemployment (6 months or more) leads to human capital depreciation that in 1 turn reduces productivity, employability and wages (Krebs 2007; Edin and Gustavsson 2008; Davis and von Wachter 2011; Schmieder, von Wachter, and Bender 2016) . In instances of widespread unemployment, individual workers decline in productivity and could have an aggregate long-term depressing effect on productivity growth in the entire economy (Carlsson-Szlezak, Reeves, and Swartz 2020) . Long-term unemployment also exerts negative effects on social capital: in this context, the deterioration of social networks that help the unemployed to find appropriate employment opportunities (Machin and Manning 1998) . Adverse physical and mental effects are also associated with long-term unemployment (Nichols, Mitchell, and Lindner 2013) .",26.621281394306305,10.182870522270818

Comparing the two strategies shows that in the mid-term and long term, the start-stop strategy accumulates more cases due to resurges (Fig. 5) . This does not depend heavily on parameters: the fundamental reason is that start-stop uses feedback to keep average R near 1, with new cases arising during surges, whereas the cyclic strategy keeps average R below one, with exponentially decaying new cases. It thus prevents resurges. If desired, the cyclic strategy can also keep cases near a low constant rate, by adjusting k according to epidemiological measurements.",20.693531867703076,8.0178966246735

The long term goals are to obtain a sufficiently large fraction of the population that has become infected and to reach herd immunity which would lead to a less severe or even subcritical second outbreak wave. On the other hand, an extinction strategy would aim at introducing sufficient contact reductions to keep the epidemic subcritical and not lifting these restrictions until the disease becomes extinct.",14.109183112930506,10.016147544039228
