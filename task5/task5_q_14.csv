Investigations upon genetic susceptibility profile to systemic complications during severe infections are a field of increasing scientific interest. Particularly when adaptive immune system is compromised or immature, innate immunity plays a key role in the immediate defense against invasive pathogens. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a serum protein that recognizes a wide range of pathogenic microorganisms and activates complement cascade via the antibody-independent pathway. More than 30% of humans harbor mutations in MBL gene (MBL2) resulting in reduced plasmatic levels and activity. Increased risk of infection acquisition has been largely documented in MBL-deficient patients, but the real impact of this form of innate immunosuppression upon clinical outcome is not clear. In critically ill patients higher incidence and worse prognosis of severe sepsis/septic shock appear to be associated with low-producers haplotypes.

Finally, TG4010, another MVA vector vaccine, is being developed by Transgene (Strasbourg, France). It incorporates two expression cassettes: the first for the MUC1 antigen, the second for the cytokine interleukin-2 as an immune stimulant. The vaccine has been tested in breast, kidney, prostate and lung cancers with encouraging results in Phase II. For Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC), thirty-seven patients with progressive, MUC1-positive tumors received TG4010 10 8 pfu/injection weekly for 6 weeks, then every 3 weeks until progression, when TG4010 was continued in combination with interferon-Į2a and interleukin-2. Assessments included clinical response (primary endpoint), safety, time to treatment failure (TTF), OS, and immune response. No objective clinical responses occurred, but median OS was 19.3 months for all patients and 22.4 months for combination therapy recipients. MUC1-specific CD8 + T cell responses were associated with longer survival [43] .

Recent scientific efforts have resulted in promising CHIKV candidate vaccines, going from pre-clinical to phase I and II clinical trials; however, no vaccine has yet been licensed. There are multiple vaccines in development using a wide variety of approaches, including live-attenuated, protein subunit, viral-vectored, and nucleic acid-derived [4, 30] . Each approach has its benefits and drawbacks. The chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored approach used here combines an enhanced safety profile on par with inactivated vaccines (as evidenced by no significant weight loss in A129 mice directly following vaccination) and immunogenicity comparable to live-attenuated vaccines (as shown by lack of viremia and swelling as well as survival of the lethal challenge).

The FDA recommended in 2009 that investigators consider clinical response or failure as an endpoint in trials of pneumonia [3] . Radiologic progression is considered a component of clinical failure [4, 5] . However, while some studies of pneumonia have found that radiologic progression or delayed radiologic resolution may be associated with adverse outcomes [6] , other studies have failed to demonstrate this relationship [7, 8] . In other words, equipoise exists as to whether radiologic progression is clinically meaningful. The use of radiologic progression in clinical trials is limited by the fact that qualitative chest radiographic interpretations do not precisely capture degrees of change in radiologic severity [9, 10] . Moreover, qualitative chest radiograph interpretations have significant inter-observer variability (i.e., low reliability) [11, 12] . This lack of precision and reliability reduce statistical power and thereby reduce the effectiveness of qualitative interpretations of radiologic severity as an outcome measure in pneumonia trials. Currently, no validated scoring tool exists for assessing severity of radiographic infiltrates in pneumonia.",17.026401853791697,8.376233581385154

Therefore, at the steady state levels, these blood concentrations only in part overlap those at which a therapeutic effect is expected. For example, the EC 50 of chloroquine on PBMC proliferation upon activation is, in general, ≥10 µM [63] , and this value can explain the varying results obtained in the different clinical trials, with clearer effects associated with the higher drug dosages. Similarly, the pro-apoptotic effect of hydroxychloroquine on the memory T-cells is only moderate at the concentrations reachable in blood, especially in the lower range [45, 61] . The pro-apoptotic effect of chloroquine described by Li et al. on latently infected cells upon viral reactivation is instead more marked, although still partial, at the upper range of clinically achievable blood concentrations (5-10 µM) [50] . This effect could therefore be visible in vivo in terms of viral reservoir reduction, but only treating with high chloroquine dosages in the presence of suppressive ART. Moreover, to maximize the chances to obtain viral reservoir reduction in vivo, chloroquine treatment should be prolonged, as the events of virus reactivation from latency are rather rare (estimated as one event of transition from latency to productive infection every 10 mL of blood each day) [64] .",14.998907413863625,7.90533377565366

However, one main source of clinical concern is the persistence of immune hyperactivation in individuals under ART. Chronically enhanced levels of T-cell activation are associated with several deleterious effects which lead to faster disease progression and slower CD4 + T-cell recovery during ART. In this article, we discuss the rationale, and review the results, of the use of antimalarial quinolines, such as chloroquine and its derivative hydroxychloroquine, to counteract immune activation in HIV infection. Despite the promising results of several pilot trials, the most recent clinical data indicate that antimalarial quinolines are unlikely to exert a marked beneficial effect on immune activation. Alternative approaches will likely be required to reproducibly decrease immune activation in the setting of HIV infection.

It was not an internationally recognized outcome measurement but was commonly used in Chinese TCM trials. However, subtle differences existed in the criteria or cut point in different trials, which made it difficult to interpret the effects of CPMs. Moreover, this outcome measurement was susceptible to subjective bias when assessing the improvement of clinical symptoms. The included RCTs did not state that they have independent outcome assessors. We believed that the outcome assessors were the investigators themselves.

Our ICU recruits to national trials and serves an increasingly non-White British population (24% of population). We undertook this study to determine whether ethnicity aff ects ICU consent rates. Methods We performed a retrospective review of screening logs from three national UK trials (PROMISE, BALTI-P, GAiNS) and one local trial (Nociceptin in Sepsis). We analysed consent rates of eligible patients by ethnicity, age, sex, interventional or observational trial, and ethnicity of the researcher seeking consent. We performed chi-squared analysis, and entered signifi cant values into a logistic regression model using SPSS v22. Results We identifi ed 332 eligible patients across all trials, of whom 37 (11%) were not White British (nWB). Analysis demonstrated consent/assent refusal being signifi cantly associated with: nWB (14, 38%, P <0.001), interventional trial (21, 25%, P = 0.003) and diff erent researcher-patient ethnicities (P <0.001). Logistic regression analysis confi rmed these as independent factors (nWB OR = 4.5, 95% CI = 2.1 to 9.8, P <0.001; interventional trial OR = 2.7, 95% CI = 1.4 to 5.2, P = 0.003; data points missing for researcher-patient ethnicity so variable excluded). Conclusion This initial study suggests that ethnicity may aff ect assent/ consent to ICU research, with patients from diff erent ethnicities being four times less likely to be recruited. Whilst data are incomplete for researcher-patient ethnicity, our data suggest that this may be an important factor and may infl uence future consent processes. We believe that the role of ethnicity warrants further investigation, not only in clinical trials but also in areas such as organ donation. Introduction Decision tree analysis uses an algorithm to classify data items by recursively posing a series of questions about items within a dataset. Each question leads to another node and potentially more questions until a predefi ned end condition is reached or no more questions can be asked (Figure 1 ). We hypothesize that scores generated using the decision tree method will improve upon our existing Hamilton Early Warning Score (HEWS) for a composite endpoint of cardiac arrest, unplanned ICU admission or death. Methods A database of 156,642 electronically captured vital signs from 6,757 consecutively admitted patients to eight medical and surgical wards will be used to train and test the decision tree early warning score.

Multiple viruses are detected during a single ARI episode in approximately a quarter of all cases. The clinical relevance of these multiple detections is unclear, as is the role of the individual virus. We therefore investigated the correlation between clinical data and RT-PCR results in children with single-and multiple viral ARI. Methods: Data from children with ARI were prospectively collected during two winter seasons. RT-PCR testing for 15 viruses was performed in 560 ARI episodes. In the patients with a single-viral etiology, clinical data, laboratory findings, patient management-and outcome data were compared between the different viruses. With this information, we compared data from children of whom RT-PCR data were negative, with children with single-and multiple viral positive results. Results: The viral detection rate was 457/560 (81.6%) of which 331/560 (59.1%) were single infections and 126/560 (22.5%) were multiple infections. In single viral infections, some statistically significant differences in demographics, clinical findings, disease severity and outcome were found between children with different viral etiologies. However, no clinically recognizable pattern was established to be virus-specific. In a multivariate analysis, the only variables that were correlated with longer hospital stay were the use of oxygen and nebulizer therapy, irrespective of the viral pathogen. Children with RT-PCR positive test results had a significant higher disease severity, fever, length of hospital stay, days of extra oxygen supply, and days of antibiotic treatment than children with a negative RT-PCR test result. For children with single-versus children with multiple positive RT-PCR test results, these differences were not significant. Conclusions: Disease (severity), management and outcome in pediatric ARI are not associated with a specific virus. Single-and multiple viral ARI do not significantly differ with regard to clinical outcome and patient management. For general pediatrics, RT-PCR assays should be restricted to pathogens for which therapy is available or otherwise may have clinical consequences. Further research with an extended panel of RT-PCR assays and a larger number of inclusions is necessary to further validate our findings.",15.571892217790158,9.075438472229516

PsorBan ® is a cyclosporine-poly-arginine conjugate for the topical treatment of psoriasis [122] . Orally administrated cyclosporine A (CsA) is effective against a broad range of inflammatory skin diseases, including psoriasis. However systemic administration of this molecule has considerably side effects such as nephrotoxicity. Topical application of CsA would minimize side effects and would contribute to the treatment of these diseases. But topical application of CsA shows low effectiveness, due to a poor absorption. However, the conjugation of a CPP (heptaarginine) with CsA through a linker designed to release the active compound at tissue's pH enhances its topical absorption, inhibiting cutaneous inflammation [148] . PsorBan ® entered phase II trials in 2003 (CellGate, Inc.). Other CPP-based strategies for drug delivery are currently also undergoing clinical trials. For instance, KAI-9803 is being tested by Kai Pharmaceutical [183] as a TAT-protein kinase C inhibitor peptide modulator of protein kinase C for acute myocardial infarction and cerebral ischemia. In 2007, this peptide entered in phase II. Avi Biopharma is working on clinical development of CPPs for the in vivo steric block splicing correction using 6-aminohexanoic acid spaced oligoarginine [(R-Ahx-R) 4 ]. It consists on a Morpholino oligo conjugated to the mentioned CPP [(RXR) 4 XB CPP]. The goal of this construct is to prevent eventual blockage of a transplanted vein after cardiovascular bypass surgery [131, 184] . Several companies (e.g. Traversa Inc., and Panomics Inc.) are currently evaluating CPPs in preclinical and clinical trials [118] . In addition, there are a great number of molecules conjugated to CPPs which are already in pre-clinical phases, getting optimized for future clinical trials [118, 185] . In summary, CPPs are a reality for drug delivery. Inducing cell selectivity into CPPmediated strategies will be the next step to improve current drug delivery systems, in order to decrease side effects and the amount of drug required to achieve a given intracellular target. The innovative range of strategies described in this review may soon enter clinical trials, which may contribute to furthering the field of drug delivery.",15.57450690705699,7.019148192740408

One approach to mimic such CAPs is to exploit the properties of a hairpin-stabilizing template to generate macrocyclic PEMs with folded structures (Figure 3 ). The mimetics may contain sequences related to the b-hairpin CAPs, but without relying on the presence of constraining disulfide bridges for folding. The structural mimicry, coupled with the ease of synthesis (and therefore optimization), opened the way recently to the discovery of a new family of cyclic PEMs with a novel type of antimicrobial activity [33] . This family is represented by the cyclic peptide L27-11 ( Figure 3 ), which shows antimicrobial activity in the nanomolar range specifically against Gram-negative Pseudomonas sp. The lead compound, L27-11, does not cause lysis of bacterial cell membranes, and only one enantiomer of the molecule has antimicrobial activity (MIC 0.01 mg/ml against Pseudomonas aeruginosa); the enantiomeric form is essentially inactive (MIC ≥ 32 mg/ml). The amino acid sequence of L27-11 is unrelated to that of any known naturally occurring CAP, although like the CAPs, it does contain a mix of hydrophobic (aromatic) and cationic residues. Given the potent antimicrobial activity against the important human pathogen P. aeruginosa and its likely novel mechanism of action, efforts have been made to develop a lead for clinical development. A related molecule, called POL7001, has a much-improved stability towards proteolysis in human plasma, due to the replacement of multiple Lys/Arg residues by diaminobutyric acid residues [33] . These substitutions do not have a large effect on antimicrobial activity but remove cleavage sites for trypsin-like proteases. Another lead called POL7080 has optimized absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination, and toxicity properties and has recently completed successfully a human phase I clinical trial [43] . A new narrow-spectrum antibiotic targeting P. aeruginosa would be a welcome addition to the range of antibiotics currently available to treat serious hospital-acquired infections, as life-threatening difficult-to-treat drug-resistant strains are arising with increasing frequency both in hospitals and in the wider community [44] .",15.833326460731216,6.404325332377618

This study enrolled 16,492 patients with type 2 diabetes with a history of, or were at risk for, cardiovascular events and followed up for a median of 2.1 years (41) . The EXAMINE study evaluated alogliptin use in patients with type 2 diabetes after acute coronary syndromes showed that there was no increase in the rates of MACE-plus (42) . This randomized placebo-controlled trial involved 5,380 patients and had a median follow up of 18 months. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) independent advisory committee recently voted that the cardiovascular safety profile of these two drugs could be managed by updating the drugs' labels (43) . Recently, a large multicentre clinical trial TECOS (Sitagliptin on Cardiovascular Outcome Study) where 14,671 patients with established cardiovascular disease and Type 2 diabetes were randomized to receive either saxagliptin or placebo (in addition to their usual therapy) showed no increase in the risk of MACE-plus, hospitalization for heart failure, or other adverse events (44) . Another large multicentre trial with linagliptin CAROLINA (Cardiovascular Outcome Study of Linagliptin Versus Glimepiride in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes) is currently in progress (44) . As DPP4inh raise GLP-1, it is also important to take into account the cardiovascular profile of GLP-1 analogs. In a large retrospective analysis by Best et al., patients treated with the GLP1 analog exenatide were shown to have a 20% reduction in cardiovascular events in comparison with other glucose-lowering agents (45) . However, the studies that have demonstrated cardiovascular benefit using GLP1 or an analog do so using supra physiological doses.

The wealth of genomes, particularly the bacterial ones originally, has enabled a broader view and analysis of the components that are required, presumably being conserved within a family of genomes [15] . This has led to the concept of a ""pan-genome"" that comprises a ""core"" set and a ""dispensable"" set of genes. The dispensable set presumably allows a unique strain to occupy a specific niche. CoreGenes is an ""on-the-fly"" web-accessible software tool designed originally (2002) to survey a group of viruses for determining a core set of genes; recently it has been upgraded [16] to provide features desired for the display of an in silico proteome used for reclassifying the bacteriophage genomes [17] . Recently another version of this computational tool has been published, noting the division of the pan-genome into a ""core"" and an ""accessory"" set of genes. In this definition, the accessory set is believed to be a source of genetic variability allowing for niche adaptations, and is gained through lateral gene transfer [18] , which is essentially the definition of the ""dispensable"" gene set noted above [15] .

Herein, we report a facile approach to increase antigen size to achieve not only fast but also effective responses against the recombinant HA/H7N9 protein via a simple conjugation of the protein onto the surface of nanodiamond particles.",23.3687641235804,9.984680540801625

Yet, no inhibitory agents targeting cathepsin L have advanced to clinical trials. While inhibitors of cathepsin B and S are currently being evaluated in clinical trials, recent failure of Odanacatib, a cathepsin K inhibitor for osteoporosis, in late stage clinical trial has made pharmaceutical industries wary of targeting cathepsins. The key challenge remains gaining inhibitor selectivity with respect to the other members of cathepsins and directing them to the targeted cell types for selective functional perturbation. With its ubiquitous expression profile, the function of cathepsin L in individual cell types must be precisely defined first; this is especially important since several isoforms of cathepsin L have been reported in the distinct cellular locations, and their activity and functional profile in individual cell types still remain poorly documented. While recently developed cathepsin inhibitors and probes have significantly advanced our understanding of cathepsin L function in both normal and disease cells, more efforts are needed for the development of isoform-selective reagents for further advancement; perhaps new allosteric modules on cathepsin L enzyme can be explored and exploited for precision targeting. Fortunately, several structural coordinates for cathepsin L enzyme forms, some with a diverse set of complexing ligands and some without, are now available (Table 4 ). These could aid in the development of isoform-selective inhibitory probes that will enable researchers to assess the context-specific needs of targeting cathepsin L in different cellular states.",16.066127294536578,9.25804265537128

Human picornaviral pathogens cause illnesses, which vary from the common cold to poliomyelitis. The picornavirus virion consists of an icosahedral capsid structure surrounding an RNA genome ranging from approximately 7 to 9 kb in size. Poliovirus and rhinovirus remain two of the most extensively studied picornaviruses to date and have become model systems for the study of RNA virus biology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology. During the 1950's, extensive efforts began to develop and implement a polio vaccine in the hopes to eradicate the virus since no non-human primate reservoirs are known to exist in nature. The effectiveness of the inactivated (Salk) vaccine and live-attenuated (Sabin) vaccines led to increased efforts to develop and design vaccines for many other human pathogens. International vaccination efforts are aimed at eradicating the disease. The success and employed strategies for implementation of vaccines for poliovirus opened the door to evaluating new approaches and efforts to study and understand RNA virus biology. A major step occurred in 1981 when Racaniello and Baltimore introduced a full-length cDNA clone of poliovirus into a cell and recovered infectious virus [2] . Although initially the mechanism by which a cDNA clone in a plasmid could give rise to productive RNA virus infection was unknown, the cDNA platform approach used by Racaniello [30, 31] .

On the diagnostic level, studies are needed to identify the most appropriate diagnostic test and specimen from the upper and lower respiratory tracts. The detection of CARVs in peripheral blood has been associated with significant LRTID, disseminated disease, and poor outcome, but requires evaluation by specifically designed studies. There is interest to identify and confirm risk factors of severe disease and poor outcome and to evaluate laboratory markers of virus-specific immunity as surrogate markers of disease and recovery. The recent attempts to use RSV loads as a virological surrogate marker of antiviral treatment by small interfering RNA and/or clinical outcome may have a pacemaker role for other CARVs [89] . Importantly, the currently available treatments for CARV URTID and LRTID lack rigorous evaluation in appropriately sized, prospective randomized controlled trials. This is needed for comparing aerosolized ribavirin with systemic (oral) ribavirin; for evaluating the role of expensive IVIG preparations in combination with ribavirin; and for determining the use of intravenous monoclonal antibody specific for the RSV-F protein (palivizumab, motavizumab) as postexposure prophylaxis for high-risk patients as well as therapy for RSV URTID and LRTID.

[version 1; referees: 5 approved]","First, it is necessary to clearly state what we think we mean by the term ""immunosenescence"", which tends to mean different things to different people. It is often assumed, especially by nonimmunologists, that this term refers to the cell biological concept of ""replicative senescence"", whereby somatic human cells cease dividing at the ""Hayflick limit"" after a finite number of cell divisions owing to telomere attrition 4,5 . However, this is not what immunologists generally mean by ""immunosenescence"", as illustrated by reference 1 above. Moreover, in my view, this term should be reserved for a state defined by robust measures of immune parameters (biomarkers) that are different in younger and older individuals and which have been associated with a clearly detrimental clinical outcome (e.g. mortality, frailty, poor response to vaccination, etc.). Here it should be noted that many studies report differences between older and younger people without being able to associate these directly with clinical outcome. The associations that are made with clinical outcome most commonly distinguish between immune biomarkers in older populations of similar ages, which are also different from those in the young. Hence, they should not be referred to as age-associated changes but only as ageassociated differences because the comparisons between younger and older are mostly based on cross-sectional studies. It is an assumption that these differences represent changes that would occur in the younger population given sufficient time. This assumption is unlikely to be correct, given the markedly different circumstances of older people born in the early to middle 20 th century and young people born towards the end of that century. These differences are essentially impossible to control for and are likely to include genetic, nutritional, environmental, psychosocial, and educational factors as well as many others. What mostly remains possible in human studies is to perform longitudinal followup on people already advanced in years, as in cohorts such as the Leiden 85-Plus, which already initiated some immunological studies nearly 20 years ago 6 . At least in such selected populations, one can determine immune parameters at baseline, and their changes over time, that can be associated with clinical outcome within a feasible time-frame. These could then be tested for their applicability in younger subjects.",22.659182080960605,9.079914885280248

There are important roles for higher quality district hospital care within these systems. These hospitals are also sources of information of considerable importance to health systems, but this role, as with the wider roles of district hospitals, has been neglected. Key messages: As we make efforts to develop higher quality health systems in LMIC we highlight the critical importance of district hospitals focusing here on how data on hospital mortality offers value: i) in understanding disease burden; ii) as part of surveillance and impact monitoring; iii) as an entry point to exploring system failures; and iv) as a lens to examine variability in health system performance and possibly as a measure of health system quality in its own right. However, attention needs paying to improving data quality by addressing reporting gaps and cause of death reporting. Ideally enabling the collection of basic, standardised patient level data might support at least simple case-mix and case-severity adjustment helping us understand variation. Better mortality data could support impact evaluation, benchmarking, exploration of links between health system inputs and outcomes and critical scrutiny of geographic variation in quality and outcomes of care. Improved hospital information is a neglected but broadly valuable public good. Conclusion: Accurate, complete and timely hospital mortality reporting is a key attribute of a functioning health system. It can support countries' efforts to transition to higher quality health systems in LMIC enabling national and local advocacy, accountability and action.",16.317689155815696,8.567838290678987

The discussion section will draw on four competing international relations theories to put forth a more theoretically grounded understanding of Chilean GHD and place our findings in a theoretical context: realism, liberalism, constructivism, and cosmopolitan (ethical) theory. 1 Realists start from the assumption that foreign policy is predominantly driven by security interests in an anarchical international system in which states must guarantee their own survival [7] . A state's position (of power) within the international system will dictate policy choices which are externally imposed by systemic constrains and international factors. From this perspective, the integration of health concerns into foreign policy discussions and negotiations is primarily driven by security interests, in particular the threat of rapidly spreading diseases linked to globalization.",17.125161101316124,9.699975215855389

Attenuated canine distemper vaccines did not provide immunity to critically endangered black-footed ferrets, while the use of a live canine distemper virus vaccine resulted in clinical distemper arising in one of the few remaining populations [97] . Ideally, long-term clinical trials with suitable animal models might avert these problems. These trials should also be used to provide an a priori understanding of how vaccination might shape future evolutionary processes. In contrast to the ferret experience, efforts with the endangered Ethiopian wolf serve as an example of a successful vaccination program. Wolf populations were suffering severe mortality due to rabies and distemper acquired from the wild dogs that shared their home range [98] . On the basis of a spatially explicit individual-based model, which indicated rabies could be controlled in dogs given just over 60% coverage [99] , Knobel et al. executed an intensive vaccination plan [92] . Both the extent and duration of outbreaks in the treated areas were limited and, although monitoring and continued vaccination are required, the situation appeared to be under control in 2008 [92] .",16.194964863837708,9.688200191948148

This was combined with weekly discussing switch therapy during the microbiology-infectious disease multidisciplinary meeting. With this intervention we aimed to improve the rate of intravenous to oral antibiotic switching. Methods: Intervention was performed on all the internal medicine wards in a large teaching hospital. Daily an automated trigger tool selected patients eligible for switch based on data from the pharmaceutical and patient system. Patients were identified as eligible when parenteral antibiotics were used for 48-72 hours. Patients were ineligible for switch when CRP was rising, neutrophils were <0,5*109/ mL or leukocytes <1*109/mL, inability to receive oral therapy or when an antibiotic was prescribed for which nor oral option was available. Before daily rounds, per candidate for antibiotic switch, a form was generated and given to the resident caring for the patient. Information concerning the ability to switch and reasons which impeded the switch were recorded. Median iv days per iv prescription and number of iv prescriptions ‡72 hours in the intervention period were compared to a similar period the year preceding the intervention. Results: Of 156 forms generated in 603 iv antibiotic prescriptions, 92 (59%) were filled in and returned. In 52% of cases this form led to an iv-oral switch. Median number of IV days was reduced by 1 (3 vs. 2, p < 0.0001). Number of iv prescriptions longer than 72 hours was reduced by 45% (44% vs. 24%). Reasons for not switching antibiotic therapy were inability to receive oral therapy (36%), clinical instability (21%) and stopping antibiotic therapy in 16% of the patients. Conclusions: We designed an intervention which uses an computerized trigger to identify patients who are candidates for antibiotic switch therapy in combination with frequent but short term education of residents. This was effective in promoting antibiotic switch therapy and reducing number of IV days >72 hours. Objective: The outcome in patients with sepsis is better if the initial empirical antimicrobial treatment is adequate, and several studies have shown that adherence to guidelines on antibiotic use positively influences the clinical outcome. However, adequate empiric therapy is not the only relevant determinant of outcome. Quality indicators (QI) are measurable elements which can be used to assess the actual quality of care provided. They can be systematically derived from guidelines. Objective of the present study was to develop a valid set of QI which can accurately measure quality of antimicrobial treatment in hospitalized adults with sepsis. Such QI for sepsis are at present lacking. We derived the QI from the recently published, evidence-based Dutch guideline on antimicrobial treatment of adult patients with sepsis (www.swab.nl/guidelines). Methods: A RAND-modified, five step Delphi procedure was used. A multidisciplinary panel of 13 experts appraised and prioritized all graded recommendations retrieved from the Dutch consensus guideline for antimicrobial therapy on sepsis. The selection of the QI potentially relevant for clinical outcome, antimicrobial resistance and costs was done using two questionnaire mailings with a face-to-face consensus meeting between rounds, over a period of 3 months. Results: Forty recommendations were initially derived from the sepsis guideline. After appraising these recommendations in the first questionnaire, 31 potential QI remained. During the consensus meeting 17 potential QI were merged into four generic QI, leaving 20 potential QI. Prioritizing these by the experts resulted into a final set of five potential QI: take two blood cultures together with cultures from suspected sites of infection, prescribe empirical antibiotic therapy according to the national guideline, start antibiotics intravenously, start antibiotics as soon as possible (preferably within an hour) and streamline antibiotic therapy. Conclusion: With this systematic, stepwise method combining evidence and expert opinion, a new, concise and therefore measurable set of process QI for antimicrobial therapy in sepsis was obtained. These QI can give insight into the actual quality of the given care and could be used to determine for which aspects there is room for improvement. Testing the feasibility, reliability and case-mix sensitivity of these indicators in practice will be the next step before using them in quality improvement projects.",15.614060588345842,8.537516611499658

This fact, in combination with a growing number of humans, creates an arena where domestic animals, humans and finally zoonotic pathogens can interact. Influenza A virus is the ultimate actor in this play where some subtypes may change into highly pathogenic forms. These may be transmitted directly to man. Another worrying scenario is that an avian influenza virus will reassort with a circulating human influenza. A genetic trait might then readily go from the human to the bird virus so that avian influenza acquires the capacity to pass from person to person. With this risk in mind, it would advisable to consider any method to reduce the probability of this happening. Contingency planning should take into account the known evolutionary potential of animal viruses and other pathogens to adapt to the environment of humans and domestic animals. Candida. The use of fluconazole susceptibility profile as a surrogate marker for prediction of voriconazole susceptibility has also been proposed recently. In addition, based on the modifications of the CLSI M38-A reference method, new guidelines for in vitro susceptibility testing of antifungal agents against Aspergillus spp. have been developed by AFST-EUCAST. A standard assay for testing antifungal agents against dermatophytes is also under development. Further investigations address the applicability of other methods, which are more practical and/or require shorter incubation periods. Among these are Etest, colorimetric methods, flow cytometry, and ergosterol quantitation. Utility of flow cytometry for AFST of yeasts and moulds is being currently studied and appears promising. Assessment of metabolic activity by using XTT colorimetric assay is also being investigated as a novel approach, particularly for determination of quantitative endpoints for testing caspofungin against Aspergillus, and for susceptibility testing of Zygomycetes. Despite these progressions, utility of AFST in direction of antifungal therapy and prediction of clinical outcome is still limited. While in vitro triazole (particularly fluconazole) susceptibility results for Candida appear to be optimally correlated with clinical outcome, data are either limited and investigational or fail to demonstrate any significant in vitro-in vivo correlation for most of the remaining fungus-antifungal drug combinations. Importantly and conclusively, the results obtained by AFST constitute one of the several factors that influence clinical outcome. Optimisation of test methodologies and parameters for routine use and expanded in vitro-in vivo correlation studies may further enhance the role of AFST as an adjunct in direction of antifungal therapy.",18.09935852397267,7.998789199968917

While this vaccine is safe, efficacious, and also cheap, it has not been taken up by the international community due to the PHK cell substrate used in its preparation. It will be interesting to see if the government adopts a change in its JE vaccination policy, once IXIARO Ò becomes available in the Indian market. The most important factor that will affect the decision-making process will definitely be the cost, because the Intercell vaccine is likely to be much costlier than the Chinese vaccine. However, this is unlikely to be a hindrance for IXIARO Ò 's commercial viability as Intercell's primary target is the tourism market, since tourists from the West increasingly prefer to travel to exotic destinations that are inevitably JE endemic. Hence, efforts to develop safe and effective indigenous JE vaccines that are likely to be cheaper still continue. Our laboratory at the National Institute of Immunology has been engaged in this endeavor for the past several years. We have utilized conventional vaccine development strategies such as cell culture of virus followed by formalininactivation, as well as newer approaches involving recombinant DNA techniques.

(3) The area averaged low wind speed ratio (the K LWS value) of the two low wind speed (LWS) zones around 'lift-up' buildings are smaller than the K HWS value of a building 'lift-up' design. Moreover, the core area has a greater influence on generating smaller wind speeds in the upstream low wind speed (ULWS) zones than the 'lift-up' core height. The 'liftup' core height is effective in reducing the size of the ULWS areas of 'lift-up' buildings with larger cores areas (e.g. AP ¼ 49%). The increase of both height and area of the core decreases wind speeds in the downstream near-field low wind speed (DNLWS) zone. However, K LWS values in the DNLWS zone are slightly increased for the largest core size of AP ¼ 49% due to the expansion of the LWS area from the leeward side to the lateral sides of the core. (4) Appropriate lift-up dimensions can be determined by combining a wide range of wind speed data and meteorological wind data with a selection criterion, which depends on the required wind conditions so as to increase or decrease the wind speeds near lift-up buildings.

However, if a drug with 100% bacteriologic efficacy were to be used, the disease will theoretically resolve in all of the adult patients in the infected group and in 95% of all adult patients. Thus the theoretical disease resolution rates in the adults in this model, depending on efficacy of treatment, can vary from 46.6% (the rate from spontaneous resolution) to 100% (for patients treated with an antimicrobial with 100% bacterial efficacy). For the total adult group, these limits vary from 63% (untreated) to 95% (using agent with 100% efficacy). On the other hand, spontaneous resolution will occur in 49.6% of untreated children in the bacterially infected group and 64.8% of the untreated total pediatric patient group.

We take the view that the complexity of the immune system is an inevitable consequence of its evolution, and this complexity has frustrated reductionist efforts to develop host-directed therapies for infection. However, since hosts vary widely in susceptibility and tolerance to infection, host-directed therapies are likely to be effective, by altering the biology of a susceptible host to induce a response more similar to a host who survives. Such therapies should exert minimal selection pressure on organisms, thus greatly decreasing the probability of pathogen resistance developing. A systems medicine approach to infection has the potential to provide new solutions to old problems: to identify host traits that are potentially amenable to therapeutic intervention, and the host immune factors that could be targeted by hostdirected therapies. Furthermore, undiscovered sub-groups with different responses to treatment are almost certain to exist among patients presenting with life-threatening infection, since this population is markedly clinically heterogeneous. A major driving force behind high-throughput clinical phenotyping studies is the aspiration that these subgroups, hitherto opaque to observation, may be observed in the data generated by new technologies. Subgroups of patients are unlikely to be staticserial clinical and biological phenotyping may reveal different trajectories through the pathophysiology of disease, in which different therapeutic approaches are required. We suggest there are two major goals for systems biology in infection medicine: (1) to identify subgroups of patients that share treatable features; and, (2) to integrate high-throughput data from clinical and in vitro sources in order to predict tractable therapeutic targets with the potential to alter disease trajectories for individual patients.",15.552378459613912,7.5369337711180115

These genes, although not claimed to be a comprehensive list, have exemplified potential pathways of innate immunity in response to SARS-CoV or, more broadly, to other viral infections. It is imperative to proceed with functional studies to test whether these genes are indeed functionally active in signaling pathways to the direct suppression of virus replication or to the clearance of virally infected cells. Understanding how the interplay between the virus load during the early stage (!2 weeks of illness) and the later stage (12 weeks of illness) of host response might contribute to the clinical outcome of SARS should be helpful in the clinical management of patients with SARS.",20.09999519816558,11.35780460616978

Given the common perception of HCoV as a relatively benign pathogen based on limited data [5, 8] , our data are somewhat surprising. The adverse impact of oxygen requirement at the time of diagnosis on subsequent clinical outcome has been suggested [16, 24] . Once substantial acute lung injury occurs, clinical outcome can potentially be affected by inflammation rather than virus itself. Therefore, mortality rates by day 90 following LRTD caused by HCoV, RSV, influenza virus, and PIV were also compared according to oxygen requirement at the time of LRTD diagnosis; no statistically significant difference was found. These data combined suggest that HCoV LRTD is significantly associated with poor clinical outcome in this immunocompromised population. Previous studies, mainly in immunocompetent hosts, have not demonstrated a distinct association between particular HCoV strains in upper respiratory tract samples and disease severity in LRTD [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] .

SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), MERS Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the novel coronavirus, previously dubbed 2019-nCoV, and now officially named SARS-CoV-2, are the causative agents of the SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 disease outbreaks, respectively. Safe vaccines that rapidly induce potent and long-lasting virus-specific immune responses against these infectious agents are urgently needed. The coronavirus spike (S) protein, a characteristic structural component of the viral envelope, is considered a key target for vaccines for the prevention of coronavirus infection. Methods: We first generated codon optimized MERS-S1 subunit vaccines fused with a foldon trimerization domain to mimic the native viral structure. In variant constructs, we engineered immune stimulants (RS09 or flagellin, as TLR4 or TLR5 agonists, respectively) into this trimeric design. We comprehensively tested the pre-clinical immunogenicity of MERS-CoV vaccines in mice when delivered subcutaneously by traditional needle injection, or intracutaneously by dissolving microneedle arrays (MNAs) by evaluating virus specific IgG antibodies in the serum of vaccinated mice by ELISA and using virus neutralization assays. Driven by the urgent need for COVID-19 vaccines, we utilized this strategy to rapidly develop MNA SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines and tested their pre-clinical immunogenicity in vivo by exploiting our substantial experience with MNA MERS-CoV vaccines. Findings: Here we describe the development of MNA delivered MERS-CoV vaccines and their pre-clinical immunogenicity. Specifically, MNA delivered MERS-S1 subunit vaccines elicited strong and long-lasting antigen-specific antibody responses. Building on our ongoing efforts to develop MERS-CoV vaccines, promising immunogenicity of MNA-delivered MERS-CoV vaccines, and our experience with MNA fabrication and delivery, including clinical trials, we rapidly designed and produced clinically-translatable MNA SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines within 4 weeks of the identification of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 sequence. Most importantly, these MNA delivered SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines elicited potent antigen-specific antibody responses that were evident beginning 2 weeks after immunization. Interpretation: MNA delivery of coronaviruses-S1 subunit vaccines is a promising immunization strategy against coronavirus infection. Progressive scientific and technological efforts enable quicker responses to emerging pandemics. Our ongoing efforts to develop MNA-MERS-S1 subunit vaccines enabled us to rapidly design and produce MNA SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines capable of inducing potent virus-specific antibody responses. Collectively, our results support the clinical development of MNA delivered recombinant protein subunit vaccines against SARS, MERS, COVID-19, and other emerging infectious diseases.",15.462613802492367,8.652092003294737

Supervised learning is defined by identifying patterns that relate variables to measured outcomes and maximize accuracy when predicting those outcomes. For example, an automatically fitted regression model (including any form of generalized linear model) is a supervised learning technique. By contrast, unsupervised learning exploits innate properties of the input data set to detect trends and patterns without explicit designation of one column as the outcome of interest. For example, principal component analysis, which identifies underlying covariance structures in observed data, is unsupervised. Semisupervised learning, a sort of hybrid, is used in contexts where prediction is a goal but the majority of data points are missing outcome information (146). Semi-supervised and unsupervised methods are often used in the data-mining phase as precursors to supervised approaches intended for prediction or more rigorous statistical analyses in a follow-up.

Biomarkers related to pulmonary permeability or drug penetration could be incorportated as covariates into mathematical models to improve predictions of pulmonary drug exposures. New regimens of piperacillintazobactam may be required which optimise drug concentrations in the lung, at the site of infection. It is likely that a single regimen is not suitable for all individuals.

Studies of BTV in sheep offer unique perspectives for understanding the pathogenesis of arboviral diseases, as observations made in the naturally occurring disease can be effectively reproduced in a convenient experimental setting, using the same animal species (Caporale et al., 2014) . The clinical outcome of BTV infection in sheep is extremely variable, but similar to other arbovirus infections, in that a rapid onset of the antibody response correlates with a more favorable clinical outcome. BTV infection of its natural sheep host was used to examine a previously uncharacterized mechanism adopted by an arbovirus to manipulate host immunity at the early stages of infection. BTV is transported rapidly via the lymph to the peripheral lymph nodes, where it infects and disrupts follicular dendritic cells (FDC). These cells of stromal origin promote the formation and maintenance of the germinal centers in which B cells differentiate into memory cells and plasma cells, and are also responsible for supporting antibody class-switching and affinity maturation. This work showed that BTV hindered B-cell division in germinal centers, resulting in the delayed production of high-affinity and virus-neutralizing antibodies. Importantly, the humoral immune response to a second antigen is also hampered in infected sheep. Thus, an arbovirus can evade the host antiviral response by inducing an acute immunosuppression. Although transient, this immunosuppression occurs at the critical, early stage of infection, when a delayed host humoral immune response likely affects the systemic dissemination of the virus and the clinical outcome of disease (Melzi et al., 2016) .",17.376876063592817,7.224976551141992

Diffusion-perfusion weighted MRI and perfusion weighted CT scan are being used to demonstrate viable penumbra around the infarct core. Direct injection of thrombolytics (rTPA) provides recanalisation in 50-60% of cases treated with this technique. This is associated with a 9-10% rate of symptomatic parenchymal haemorrhage. Today, mechanical thrombectomy or thrombaspiration is the first choice of interventional treatment. Stent thrombectomy is capable of providing a recanalisation rate of 80-90% on the TICI scale and good clinical outcome (0-2 on the modified Rankin scale) in 45-60% of patients. Results might be improved applying the bridging technique, that is a combination of iv-thrombolysis and local thrombectomy.

Non-invasive imaging, such as MRI, CT and arthroscopic imaging, can be highly informative, but its use is often limited by cost and the need to show a clinical indication. Excellent V-RCTs are possible but require careful planning 223 . A further issue is the throughput of veterinary studies; a disease might be common, but unlike many human health-care providers such as the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK, the veterinary profession has historically been composed of many independent veterinarians, each of whom see a relatively small number of animals with a particular condition. However, the growth of multi-practice corporate ownership might promote uniformity in veterinary clinical approaches and increase the number of animals available for a study. Initiatives such as the UK National Veterinary Canine Hip Replacement Registry 224 and the Comparative Oncology Trials Consortium 10 are also seeking to improve the acquisition of animals with particular diseases, and more standardized clinical outcome assessments are slowly being adopted across veterinary groups 225 . As with human trials, loss to follow-up and mid-trial exclusions also make obtaining suitable numbers of patients for analysis challenging. The lack of any centralized funding is also an issue, and veterinary medical care is essentially privately funded, which complicates the development of new therapies or research avenues.

All patients showed a block in the precursor B-cell development, low B-and T-cell numbers, normal immunoglobulin gene use, limited B-and T-cell repertoires, and slightly impaired receptor editing. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that similar RAG mutations can result in similar immunobiological effects but different clinical phenotypes, indicating that the level of residual recombinase activity is not the only determinant for clinical outcome.

Several new lines of evidence demonstrate that bacterial isolation from sputum during acute exacerbation in many instances refl ects a cause-effect relationship. Placebo-controlled antibiotic trials in exacerbations of COPD demonstrate signifi cant clinical benefi ts of antibiotic treatment in moderate and severe episodes. However, in the multitude of antibiotic comparison trials, the choice of antibiotics does not appear to affect the clinical outcome, which can be explained by several methodological limitations of these trials. Recently, comparison trials with nontraditional end-points have shown differences among antibiotics in the treatment of exacerbations of COPD. Observational studies that have examined clinical outcome of exacerbations have repeatedly demonstrated certain clinical characteristics to be associated with treatment failure or early relapse. Optimal antibiotic selection for exacerbations has therefore incorporated quantifying the risk for a poor outcome of the exacerbation and choosing antibiotics differently for low risk and high risk patients, reserving the broader spectrum drugs for the high risk patients. Though improved outcomes in exacerbations with antibiotic choice based on such risk stratifi cation has not yet been demonstrated in prospective controlled trials, this approach takes into account concerns of disease heterogeneity, antibiotic resistance and judicious antibiotic use in exacerbations.",25.256759418744025,11.481647663110854

The GLOBE (Gemifl oxacin and Long term Outcome of Bronchitis Exacerbations) trial was a prospective, double blind, randomized trial that compared a fl uoroquinolone, gemifl oxacin, with a macrolide, clarithromycin (Wilson et al 2002) . End of therapy and long-term outcome assessments were made at the conventional 10-14 day and 28 day time intervals. In these assessments, in line with most antibiotic comparison trials, there was no statistically significant difference in the two arms in the clinical outcome, with clinical success rates of 85.4% and 84.6% for gemifl oxacin and clarithromycin respectively. Bacteriological success, Undetected bias in use of concurrent therapy measured as eradication and presumed eradication, was signifi cantly higher with gemifl oxacin (86.7%) compared to clarithromycin (73.1%). Patients who had a successful clinical outcome at 28 days were then offered enrollment in a follow up period for a total of 26 weeks of observation. In this time period, the primary outcomes were the rate of repeat exacerbations, hospitalizations for respiratory disease and health-related quality of life measures. Gemifl oxacin was associated with a signifi cantly lower rate of repeat exacerbations, with 71% of the gemifl oxacin-treated patients remaining exacerbation free at 26 weeks in comparison to 58.5% in the clarithromycin arm. The relative risk reduction for recurrence of exacerbation was 30%. The rate of hospitalization for respiratory tract illness in the 26 weeks was also lower in the gemifl oxacintreated patients than in the clarithromycin treated patients (2.3% vs. 6.3%, p = 0.059) (Wilson et al 2002) . Patients who had a recurrent exacerbation in the 26 week period had a lesser improvement in their health-related quality of life when compared to those who remained free of recurrence (Spencer and Jones 2003) . This trial clearly demonstrates the limitation of the conventional medium-term clinical outcomes to demonstrate differences among antibiotics in exacerbations. If the 26 week follow up period had not been instituted, signifi cant differences in clinically relevant outcomes of recurrence of exacerbations and respiratory related hospitalization would have been missed.",19.36976694617171,10.858202277061586

As most exacerbations nowadays are treated without obtaining sputum bacteriology, this initial empiric choice often becomes the only choice made for antibiotic use in exacerbations. Results of antibiotic comparison trials should guide the recommendations for appropriate empiric antibiotics in exacerbations. However, though a large number of such trials have been conducted, in the vast majority, antibiotic choice does not appear to affect the clinical outcome. Differences in bacteriological eradication rates are seen, with an apparent dissociation between clinical and bacteriological outcomes (Obaji and Sethi 2001) . This is contrary to expectations that antibiotics with better in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial effi cacy and better pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic characteristics should show superiority in clinical outcomes. This paradox is likely related to several short-comings in design of these trials (Table 5 ) (Sethi 2004b ).

For example, studies designed to demonstrate the efficacy of novel antibiotics frequently study subjects with acute symptoms combined with the presence of fluid in the maxillary sinuses as demonstrated on the basis of air-fluid levels on plain radiography or CT scanning. Given regulatory guidelines by which this class of drug is approved, this definition is understandable.

In general, most efforts to develop antibody-based therapies have focused on diseases where the humoral immune system was known to make a strong contribution to host defense. For these microbial diseases the efficacy of humoral immunity was implied from demonstration of passive antibody protection and/or correlation of specific antibody with resistance to disease. However, recent work has established that mAbs are effective even against microbes for which the standard studies do not clearly establish a role for humoral immunity [33] . For example, several mAbs have now been generated that are effective against intracellular pathogens and other microbes where natural Ab is not believed to have a primary role in host defense [33] . Overall, diseases which are currently not preventable by vaccination or that target populations with weak immune systems (for example, the very young or old, and immunosuppressed or immunocompromised patients) are the most valuable for which to develop mAb therapies. Here, both viral and bacterial toxin diseases that are the target of mAb development will be discussed, as well as potential targets based on need toward which efforts should be focused in the future.

There are reports of clinical disease related to ABV infection in canaries, geese, and other species, but those are seen rarely, are usually anecdotal descriptions and the significance is still unclear. In psittacines, infection can lead to a deadly outcome. In psittacine species conservation projects, ABV can have a major impact. As an example, during the early 2000s, about 10% of Spix's macaws in the breeding program, one of the most endangered birds in the world and currently extinct in the wild, died from PDD, the major clinical outcome of an ABV infection. ABV causes nonpurulent inflammation in nervous tissues with ensuing loss of function. Mainly lymphoplasmacytic infiltrations in ganglia are seen in histopathology. The most known clinical outcome of an ABV infection is PDD, as described above. However, other neurologic disorders should also be considered. 87 Especially, CNS signs seem to be more common than previously thought. CNS signs can range in severity from relatively minor signs, including slight tremor (e.g., of one toe), to epileptic convulsions and incoordination, loss of equilibrium, head shaking, opisthotonus, and so on. Fluck et al 107 examined CNS cases presented to avian practice and could clearly demonstrate a link to ABV infection, with more than half of those cases being ABV positive, by exclusion of other common potential causes. In the past, behavioral problems 70 and feather-damaging behaviors in psittacines had been associated with ABV, 113 but scientific proof for clear causality is still lacking. Fluck et al 107 included birds with feather-damaging behaviors in a study and found that about 50% of the examined birds were positive for ABV, but the amount of antibodies and viral RNA shed was comparable with those of ABV-positive birds in a control group, whereas it was significantly lower compared with a group of CNSdiseased birds. A link between ABV and feather-damaging behaviors cannot be ruled out, but current evidence suggests that it is not likely. This stands out in contrast when compared with what is seen with clinical signs of CNS disease in a considerable number of those birds very likely caused by ABV. This is also supported by experimental infection trials, where cockatiels developed a classic manifestation of PDD after experimental infection (GI tract signs), but some birds also developed clear CNS signs either on their own or in combination with PDD. 62, 98 Interestingly, some birds demonstrated only nonspecific clinical signs of ruffled feathers and diarrhea, and a few died suddenly without demonstrating any clinical signs prior to death.",18.130017135864303,9.50462758244478

Although our spatiotemporal strategy has shown similar promise to enhance infectious disease surveillance in high-and low-income settings, future studies are needed to assess the real-time performance of our approach in the context of prospective surveillance in a low-income setting [35] [36] [37] . Second, our viral detection strategy relied on upper respiratory tract samples that may reflect carriage and not lower respiratory tract infection. Third, we did not sequence samples from cases occurring outside of spatiotemporally defined clusters. Thus, we cannot compare the frequency and characteristics of viruses in nonclustered participants, which may be similar to those detected using our sampling approach. Fourth, our cluster detection strategy targeting noninfluenza associated SARI was limited by the parameters of our spatiotemporal modeling methods. As most clusters lacked a dominant circulating virus, our approach may have lacked specificity to detect clusters associated with a single circulating pathogen. It is also possible that increased SARI incidence within clusters may have been driven by environmental or epidemiologic factors independent of pathogen transmission. Further work is needed to identify alternative spatiotemporal surveillance strategies that may provide greater pathogen specificity, both for influenza and non-influenza respiratory viruses.

A lytic and lethal reaction takes hold in phagocytic cells infected with a large number of virulent chlamydial particles. Low concentrations of virulent strains are rapidly inactivated by polymorphonuclear and mononuclear phagocytes. If the macrophage is damaged, the chances of chlamydial survival are reduced. Low concentrations of a nonvirulent strain will not stimulate an adequate lytic reaction, producing macrophages that are transformed into epithelioid cells, which remain infected chronically. The average lifespan of these epithelioid cells should be the index to determine the duration of treatment, but little or nothing is known about the lifespan of these cells in birds. 10 Further, during mitosis in the bone marrow, it is very likely that the infected macrophages transfer the chlamydial inclusion bodies in the next generation of macrophages. 11 The partial removal and phagocytosis in new macrophages promotes the selection of strains with low virulence for the species in question. However, these chronic infections facilitate the diffusion of a large number of chlamydiae that can potentially be very virulent for other avian species. 10 ",12.206797497569974,8.046902418121507

This test has been advocated as useful when applied on endoscopically sampled biopsies if a diagnosis of intestinal lymphoma is suspected but not confirmed by conventional histopathology. In a study at the Royal Veterinary College, the author prospectively evaluated the accuracy of PARR for the diagnosis of intestinal lymphoma in biopsies obtained endoscopically from dogs in a comparison with the gold standard of histopathology and clinical outcome determined by follow-up information of at least 2 years. Samples from 39 dogs were included. PARR results indicated a clonal expansion in 7 of 36 dogs. However, these dogs were clinically healthy after dietary treatment 2 years after the endoscopy, so they clearly did not have lymphoma. The data from this study indicate a false-positive rate of almost 20% for PARR when performed on endoscopic biopsies. Another recent study has confirmed these findings, showing that in dogs with IBD, PARR results showed at least one oligoclonal pattern in 38% of dogs, and an immunoglobulin (7 of 47; 14.9%) or T-cell receptor (1 of 47: 2.1%) monoclonal pattern in 17% of dogs. 26 The conclusion that a positive PARR test on an endoscopic biopsy means a diagnosis of lymphoma must therefore be made cautiously in a clinical situation, and clinical signs, response to treatment, and immunohistochemistry must also be taken into account.",13.44890496262308,7.923369242697344

However, for a straightforward diagnosis, knowledge regarding ABV kinetics in the host and its interaction with the immune system (circumstances of antibody production) must be known, but this knowledge is incomplete. As a result, interpretation of diagnostic test results is challenging. The first problem is when and how to judge a bird to be ABV positive; second, a bird owner or veterinarian will often request a prognosis about the clinical outcome for the bird.

First, despite the multidisciplinary contributions from experts worldwide, focus groups, and a feasibility and acceptability study in 10 countries, the final psychometric evaluation occurred in only five English-speaking countries. Second, targeted efforts to recruit a diverse group of people were not entirely successful for particular subgroups (namely, secondary infertility, men). Indeed, more psychometric research on men is required to fully establish reliability and validity. Third, the major proportion of the final sample was recruited online, and differences between the online and clinical samples were observed. Although data generated online has been shown to be as valid as data collected through traditional methods (15, 16) , one would need to determine whether the differences observed warrant more in-depth analysis, for example, a different set of norms for clinical samples. We eliminated records coming from the same IP address, but it may be possible that the same person replied more than once to the survey. Finally, the subscales of the Core FertiQoL were not entirely orthogonal with cross-loadings on the social and mind/body domains.

For example, if a rapidly unfolding outbreak were taking place in Central America, it would make sense to anticipate higher need for public health resources focused on direct flights coming to the U.S. from high-volume contributors such as Managua and Guatemala City. Although other passengers from Central America may come to the U.S. via connecting flights, these travelers would be so low in number as to present minimal risk, and to expend resources to address them initially may divert from more effective efforts with the bulk of travelers arriving on direct flights at a few U.S. locations. Our analysis of 2009 flight data revealed that, by volume, the airports most affected by flights from Central This approach seems intuitive, but others have observed that this risk-based, targeted approach to bolstering surveillance and response capacities at key airports has been the exception rather than the norm, and that careful planning for public health response at key points of entry can be more effective than the usual first response of implementing travel restrictions. 13, 41, 47 In light of current global economic uncertainties and the overall decline of resources for public health in the U.S. and other countries, current planning and future point of entry interventions for global disease outbreaks must optimize the resources that are available, quickly and accurately assess risks and prioritize efforts to maximize impact of intervention efforts. 48 The ""node-to-node"" approach embodied in our model will allow public health officials to preserve resources for longer-term, community-based mitigation and prevention activities by targeting response to those points of entry likely to be affected earliest.",13.46169831529488,6.5649397210412275

Passive surveillance systems retrospectively gather information about cases from existing records. These systems are often less resource-intensive because of their reliance on pre-existing health infrastructure. However, the reliance on external health providers requires standardisation of methods for collecting data. Before selecting a passive surveillance approach, investigators must consider the quality of existing medical records (which might be scarce, incomplete, or easily lost due to disaster in resource-limited settings), as well as provider willingness to participate, their level of training, and availability to consistently participate in case reporting. 13 Conversely, in active surveillance systems, study personnel identify cases according to pre-set definitions by interacting with potential cases directly. 97 Although active surveillance is more resource-intensive and Review time-intensive, and can be more intrusive, it allows for more complete outcome ascertainment provided the study population is adequately captured. Unless extensive efforts are put in place to standardise passive surveillance, active surveillance also allows for more uniform data collection as study personnel are performing diagnoses. When conducting active surveillance, the frequency of assessment is important to consider. Infrequent followup can miss important events and might be affected by poor recall. For example, a community-based longitudinal study in Lima, Peru, found that visits done twice weekly resulted in lower documented prevalence of clinical symptoms than daily visits, demonstrating that symptom misplacement was more likely to occur as the recall period increased. 98 However, increased frequency of visits can also bias the result by capturing fewer severe cases. In clinical or field trials where surveillance might lead to referrals, early case detection can lead to earlier treatment, thereby reducing the number of severe cases that develop. In the example of the HAPIN trial, whereby severe pneumonia is a primary outcome, active surveillance would possibly reduce the primary outcome. Frequent visits can also be intrusive, leading to decreased compliance with study activities. One must balance these potential sources of bias when deciding frequency of follow-up.",18.1331881374269,7.2838759245030325

Such 14% excess of physiologic reference levels most likely carries biologic significance. Increase in serum LDH activity is postulated to be a result of massive tissue destruction related to immune hyperactivity during the acute phase of SARS-CoV infection [38] . Indeed, high LDH levels on admission has previously been shown to be an independent prognostic indicator of SARS infection which can help clinicians to predict adverse clinical outcome [2, 6, 7] . The patients who died of SARS were too few in our cohort for valid statistical analysis. As our patients were recruited from six different hospitals, differences in management preferences introduced confounding factors, which rendered clinical parameters inappropriate for use as adverse clinical outcome measures. In contrast, laboratory parameters can be easily standardized as a ratio of the upper limit of normal reference range.

However, data on RV types and the associations with clinical outcome in young children are limited. Here, we investigated the clinical, virological and epidemiological characteristics of RV infections in young children with mild or asymptomatic infection (non-hospitalised children) and in symptomatic young children admitted to the hospital. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate associations between different characteristics of RV infections and clinical outcome in young children. Study design: RV-infected children were retrospectively selected from a Dutch birth cohort (EUROPAstudy) and from hospitalised children admitted to the hospital because of respiratory symptoms. In total 120 RV-typed samples could be selected from 65 non-hospitalised and 49 hospitalised children between November 2009 and December 2012. Results: RV-A was the predominant species in both study populations, followed closely by RV-C. RV-B was observed only sporadically. The distribution of the RV species was comparable in non-hospitalised and hospitalised children. In children with respiratory distress who required ICU-admission the distribution of RV species did not differ significantly from the non-hospitalised children. No predominant RV type was present in non-hospitalised nor hospitalised children. However, hospitalised children were younger, had more often an underlying illness, a higher RV load and more frequently a bacterial co-infection. Conclusions: Clinical outcome of RV infected young children was not related to RV species or types, but may more likely be influenced by multiple (host-specific) factors.",18.918113425546494,11.247405882985158

Treatment options seem to be more optimistic for Gram-positive pathogens (including C. difficile), for which the pipeline is more promising; however, the recently launched anti-MRSA agents have not been extensively investigated in critically ill populations. In the field of Gram-negative MDR infections there is great concern about the therapeutic future, as only a handful of the upcoming agents will address the unmet medical needs. Associations of beta-lactams with beta-lactamase inhibitors seem promising against Gram-negative MDR pathogens, but their real clinical utility will be known only after results of large clinical trials are available. Currently, the most effective approach is the PK/PD optimization of the available antibiotics, particularly given the increasing awareness of the pharmacokinetic alterations that occur in the critically ill patient. Combination treatments seem to be important, at least in the empirical phase of treatment, to ensure adequate coverage of the patient and improve clinical outcome. However, randomized clinical trials are urgently needed to define the possible benefit from combinations in various settings. Most importantly, infection control measures and prompt diagnostics are the cornerstones to prevent further transmission of MDR and XDR pathogens in healthcare settings and to optimize early antimicrobial treatment.

For certain drug dosage forms that are not proposed to be absorbed systemically, BA may be measured based on selected PK measurements to reflect the rate and extent to which API becomes available to employ its desired therapeutic effect at the intended site of action.

For this, the immune system can be stimulated with either the weakened or killed pathogen or proteins/antigens from it, the so-called subunit vaccines (Fig. 1) . Subunit vaccines can be based on a single antigen or a mixture of antigens, which can be purified from the parasites or produced through recombinant DNA technology. The approach of producing a commercial vaccine straight from worm material is not applicable for most parasite species because it is practically difficult or even impossible to obtain large enough quantities of parasite material. For this reason, recombinant vaccines have been evaluated against a range of helminths. However, maintaining the correct conformation of target antigens in recombinant form is a major challenge, 3 and only a few recombinant vaccine antigens have been shown to be protective. The challenge for further development lies in delivering these promising subunit vaccines in a manner feasible for large-scale commercial production, testing their efficacy in more extensive field trials, and in making them fit for purpose for commercial and end-user uptake. 2 Despite strong efforts to develop antiparasitic vaccines, only 3 vaccines are currently on the market ( Table 1 for (Providean Hidatil EG95, Tecnovax) is available on the commercial market in parts of South America for the control of Echinococcus granulosus in sheep and goats.",17.122058801652425,7.217772403836748

This broad range of anti-infective activities is due to one common mode of action, i.e., the inhibition of type II topoisomerases, thus maintaining the selective toxicity of fluoroquinolones inhibiting microbial topoisomerases and eukaryotic topoisomerases of prokaryotic origin at low concentrations but mammalian topoisomerases at much higher concentrations. There is strong evidence that the broad range of anti-infective activities translates into the clinical arena. However, anti-infective activities other than antibacterial activities have never been evaluated systematically. This may be due to the strategy of both the pharmaceutical industry and regulatory authorities to develop an agent on the basis of its application, i.e., its use as an antibacterial agent. Therefore, the antiviral or antifungal activities of fluoroquinolones have, so far, not been exploited systematically; two controlled studies evaluating the antiviral effects of fluoroquinolones have been initiated recently. The clinical evaluation of their antifungal and antiparasitic effects is justifiable and would be opportune. Traditionally, clinical studies are designed on the basis of a monocausal microbe-outcome association, i.e., the presence of one bacterial species at the site of infection indicates pathogenicity. Consequently, an anti-infective agent is considered to be effective if this single species is eradicated from the focus of infection. However, infections may be polymicrobial or chronically ill patients may suffer from opportunistic infections; HIVpositive patients represent an extreme example for the acquisition of opportunistic infections caused in parallel by viruses, bacteria, and/or parasites. Such patients could, in theory, benefit from treatment with agents which exert a broad range of anti-infective activities. A multifactorial analysis of the outcome of infectious diseases would be necessary. The corresponding outcome measures are quantifiable and can be linked to pharmacokinetics and overall clinical efficacy. In summary, based on one common mode of action, fluoroquinolones being commercially available as antibacterial agents are active against viruses, fungi, and parasites too, so this class of agents is probably representative of broad-spectrum anti-infectives in its true sense.

Furthermore, there was a paucity of studies on the biology and immunology of ZIKV to provide guidance on how to effectively combat its spread, but evaluations of vaccines developed against the related YFV and DENV strongly suggested that antibodies against the envelope (E) antigen of ZIKV, by analogy, might be an important immune correlate of protection for a ZIKV vaccine.

Although efforts to develop small-molecule probes of DUBs to study their role in basic and disease biology have increased in recent years, these efforts have produced limited numbers of well-characterized and optimized inhibitors. The DUB enzyme USP7 is one of the most well-studied DUBs and is reported to regulate the abundance of proteins involved in DNA-damage repair, cell-cycle regulation, and epigenetic and transcription factor control of gene expression. Notably, USP7 has been implicated in a range of different cancer types, controlling some of the most important proliferative processes. To identify the most promising disease contexts in which to deploy USP7 drugs and to more accurately catalog the activities of USP7 as it pertains to both the promise and liabilities associated with blockade of USP7 activity, highly potent and well-characterized probe compounds have been sought after. Here, we present an inhibitor of USP7, XL188, with double-digit nanomolar potency toward USP7 and exquisite selectivity relative to the largest available panel of purified DUBs. We combined XL188 with a negative control compound, XL203C, to present a set of tools for interrogating USP7 biology. Thus, we confirmed USP7 as a key regulator of HDM2-p53-p21 signaling by showing that XL188, but not XL203C, promoted degradation of HDM2, resulting in increased levels of p53 and p21.",20.1075061930283,10.23286065564279

The global burden of numerous infectious diseases has been significantly reduced, and in some cases, effectively eradicated through the deployment of specific vaccines. However, efforts to develop effective new vaccines against infectious pathogens such as influenza, Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), dengue virus (DENV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Ebola virus, and Zika virus (ZIKV) have proven challenging. Zika virus is a mosquito-vectored flavivirus responsible for periodic outbreaks of disease in Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands dating back over 50 years. Over this period, ZIKV infections were subclinical in most infected individuals and resulted in mild cases of fever, arthralgia, and rash in others. Concerns about ZIKV changed over the past two years, however, as outbreaks in Brazil, Central American countries, and Caribbean islands revealed novel aspects of infection including vertical and sexual transmission modes. Cases have been reported showing dramatic neurological pathologies including microcephaly and other neurodevelopmental problems in babies born to ZIKV infected mothers, as well as an increased risk of Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults. These findings prompted the World Health Organization to declare ZIKV a public health emergency in 2016, which resulted in expanded efforts to develop ZIKV vaccines and immunotherapeutics. Several ZIKV vaccine candidates that are immunogenic and effective at blocking ZIKV infection in animal models have since been developed, with some of these now being evaluated in the clinic. Additional therapeutics under investigation include anti-ZIKV monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that have been shown to neutralize infection in vitro as well as protect against morbidity in mouse models of ZIKV infection.

Additional candidates using different vaccine platforms have also been developed with some of these now being evaluated clinically. ZIKV-targeting mAbs may be another important weapon for combating infection and disease especially in people who are not good candidates for vaccination, such as pregnant women. Although some mAbs have shown protective efficacy in animal models, much work remains to be done to advance these therapeutics into the clinic such as evaluating the protective dose(s) and assuring that they cannot mediate ADE of ZIKV, DENV, or other flaviviruses.

A subset of patients demonstrated an improved clinical outcome without diminished esophageal eosinophilic infiltration. These results may reflect an incomplete therapeutic response which requires close follow-up in order to detect an end of disease remission. Alternatively, these findings may be characteristic of a unique patient subset that merits further investigation. Infection by human immunodeficiency virus can involve several clinical manifestations affecting almost every organ or system in the body. Rheumatic manifestations may develop at any time of the clinical spectrum, but usually are seen in late stages, although sometimes they constitute the initial presentation of the viral illness. 46 patients (43 males, 3 females), with infection by HIV, from South Italy, were recruited for the study. HIV positivity was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and confirmed by Western Blot. Patients were asked to complete a questionnaire containing 10 questions pertaining to rheumatic diseases. The following data were collected: age, sex, duration of HIV infection, CD4 count. Rheumatologic manifestations were found on clinical evaluation by questionnaire administration and physical examination in 11 of 43 patients (23.9%).

To evaluate a positive and clinically meaningful effect of a treatment in hospitalized patients with influenza or severe acute respiratory infection (SARI), it is essential to consider how a patient feels, functions or survives. Such feedback may impact approval decisions by the FDA and can provide important information for labeling. These clinical outcome assessments (COAs) include different tools to collect subjective feedback, including a patient-reported outcome (PRO), a clinician-reported outcome (ClinRO), an observer-reported outcome (ObsRO), or a performance outcome (PerfRO). In addition to standardized forms, data from digital health technology can also be used to collect COAs. Regardless of the type of COA used, it should be appropriate for its intended use (patient population, study design); it should have fit-forpurpose concepts that can be reliably measured; are clinically important and valuable to the patients; and can be communicated in labeling in a way that is accurate, interpretable and well-defined. To assist in this process, the FDA published the Guidance for Industry When planning to use a COA in hospitalized patients with influenza or SARI, the selected endpoint should be considered, and a decision made as to whether a particular PRO is the best tool, or whether another COA should be selected. Additional considerations when choosing a COA include: Whether one COA can be used to measure recovery during and after discharge? Can the same COA be used across cultures and languages? Is it reproducible within and across raters? To assist in answering these questions, the FDA has developed several pathways for assessment, review and advice, whether the planned development program is for an individual drug; or for the development of novel COAs for use in multiple programs. One pathway is the Critical Path Innovation Meetings where, general non-binding advice can be sought on a specific methodology or technology in its early stages of development (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2018). In conclusion, the FDA supports the development and implementation of patient COAs in clinical trials to support drug approvals and labeling claims and encourages early communication with the agency to provide advice on the selection, modification or development of appropriate COAs.",17.41353321845195,8.44466887981893

During a growing epidemic, the final clinical outcome of most of the reported cases is typically unknown. Simply dividing the cumulative reported number of deaths by the cumulative number of reported cases will therefore underestimate the true case fatality ratio early in an epidemic.

Thus, many of the estimates of the case fatality ratio that have been obtained to date for COVID-19 correct for this effect.

Viruses, such as lentiviruses, retroviruses, adenoviruses, and herpesviruses, appear to be the first choices for miRNA or siRNA delivery, and they are extremely efficient in transferring RNA-encoding vectors into the nuclei of mammalian cells to ensure high expression of RNA. Almost 70% of gene therapy clinical trials have involved the application of viral vectors to deliver nucleic acids due to their high transduction efficiency . In addition, long-term expression can be achieved using viruses. However, the major limitations of viral vectors are biological safety issues, including possible carcinogenicity, high viral toxicity and verified immunogenicity (Wang et al., 2008) . Therefore, despite the inferior transfection efficiency of viral vectors, non-viral transfer systems with low acute toxicity, lower production cost, non-infection and non-immunogenicity are emerging as a desirable approach to deliver miRNAs or siRNAs in vivo (Castanotto et al., 2009) . Two major categories of non-viral DDSs used for miRNAs or siRNAs delivery in therapeutic applications are lipid-based and polymerbased systems. Apart from the advantages mentioned above (i.e., relatively favourable safety profiles and low production costs), nonviral vectors are highly versatile. They can be easily modified to promote their delivery efficiency, for example, to improve serum stability and to extend the circulation time by PEGylation (Buyens et al., 2012) , or to achieve site-specific delivery by incorporating targeting ligands (i.e., (AspSerSer) 6 and Asp 8 ) (Zhang et al., 2012a; Liang et al., 2015) . Despite efforts to develop suitable miRNA or siRNA delivery systems for clinical application, a poor correlation between in vitro and in vivo efficacies has also been observed, and it has often been reported that a delivery system functioned effectively in vitro but failed in vivo because of poor pharmacokinetic profiles, toxicity issues, immune responses or nonspecific uptake (Lv et al., 2006) . Therefore, the success of therapeutic miRNAs and siRNAs is highly dependent on the availability of an efficient and safe delivery system. Selected examples of viral and non-viral delivery systems that have been explored to deliver therapeutic miRNAs and siRNAs both in vivo and in vitro are summarized in Table 1 and Table 2 , respectively. For a better understanding of the nucleic acids and gene delivery, please refer to the chapter summarized by Akita et al. (2011) The first clinical trial of a miRNA therapy began in 2013, with the second one starting in early 2015. In contrast, the first clinical trial of a siRNA therapeutic was initiated in 2004 (Ozcan et al., 2015) . Through searching on ClinicalTrials.gov, to date, we found approximately 50 siRNA candidates that have reached various stages of clinical trials for the treatment of different diseases, and approximately 50% of these trials are focused on tumour-related targeting therapeutics. However, the clinical development of miR-NAs as therapeutics is lagging significantly, with only the two miRNA therapeutics mentioned above, both of which are indicated for the treatment of cancers. The relatively slow progress of miRNA therapeutics is mainly due to their uncertain mechanisms and complex roles of action and specificity during the early years of their discovery. In addition, the diverse potential applications (e.g., as drug targets and biomarkers) of miRNAs, which have been extensively discussed before, might also have detracted from their development as therapeutic agents. However, all of the therapeutic miRNAs or siRNAs in clinical trials are either for topical administration (i.e., ocular or dermal), or they systemically targeting the liver, where most injected RNAs end up non-specifically anyway. Unfortunately, there have been no clinical trials initiated for bonerelated disorders at the time of our writing. Therefore, many efforts still must be exerted for the improvement and better understanding of miRNA and siRNA therapeutics, which will be discussed latter.",15.51623186983666,9.429023334694907

The observational design limits our ability to exclude the effect of measured or unmeasured covariates in our analysis.

In using a broader definition of pulmonary exacerbation which includes children managed as outpatients, our sample may have included more patients with mild exacerbations than other studies. However, the proportion of hospitalized patients with viral infection in our study (64%) was similar to that of outpatients (58%). Likewise, there are no generally accepted severity scores for pulmonary exacerbations that apply to younger children, including the CFQ-R, a validated and widely used patient-reported outcome. Despite its validation against PFTs as the gold standard, the CFCS has been infrequently used in clinical trials. This highlights the need for further evaluation of its applicability in clinical studies. Our small sample size did not permit subgroup analyses according to individual viruses. Finally, we did not have data on viral infection status in CF children not experiencing an exacerbation as a comparator to strengthen the association between the exacerbation and viral infections.

However, in some cases vaccination against M. bovis has significantly exacerbated clinical disease [30, 31] . In addition, most experimental challenge studies have been performed in calves that are substantially older than the age at which natural colonization with M. bovis is typically first observed. Young calves are often colonized by M. bovis within the first few weeks of life [1, 2, 15, 16, 32] , during which time the immune system is undergoing rapid changes associated with maturation [33, 34] . Therefore, agespecific features of the immune system are likely to be important in determining the susceptibility of the young calf to mycoplasmal disease and the efficacy of particular vaccines.",18.712006983456263,8.369179244889851

AAV-HBV launches a persistent infection in mice, which recapitulates the T-cell exhaustion phenotype. In this model, TherVacB induced HbsAg loss, anti-HBs antibody production (anti-HBs seroconversion), and effector HBs-specific intrahepatic CD8 + cells in iM-ATEs. Interestingly, the formation of iMATES was also favored by an ""adjuvantation"" procedure, based on CpG agonists (TLR9 ligand). At a more subcellular level and with an in-depth mechanistic effort, Percy presented unpublished data showing that iMATEs were induced by a TNFα/TNFR1 signaling pathway, leading to ROS-mediated mitochondria reshaping. If further preclinical validation of the TherVacB strategy is needed, a clinical evaluation of this patented approach is soon David Durantel's lecture summarized current efforts to develop molecules targeting the assembly of the HBV nucleocapsid, thereby preventing the neosynthesis of viral DNA. The core (HBc) is a structural protein that assembles a capsid around the pregenomic RNA, and reverse transcription then takes place to generate relaxed circular DNA (rcDNA). Core assembly modulators (CAMs) inhibit this process and the neosynthesis of rcDNA, similar to the action of nucleoside analogues (NUC). The HBc protein also has other regulatory functions in infected cells. David reminded us that, in cells with high levels of HBV replication, HBc is in the nucleus, where it binds to cccDNA and may contribute to its transcriptional activity or stability. HBc also binds to host DNA and may regulate host gene expression. Finally, as HBc is mainly an RNA-binding protein, it could bind to viral RNAs and regulate their fate. Due to the multifunctional character of HBc, CAMs might do more than initially envisaged.",17.09905674539563,8.00499998598193

A research group was set up that included experts in respiratory and critical medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, evidence-based medicine, clinical pharmacology, and statistics, in addition to medical journal editors. Clinical trial registry websites (chictr.org.cn and clinicaltrials.gov) were searched to retrieve clinical trial protocols and outcomes in order to form an outcome pool. A total of 78 clinical trial protocols on COVID-19 were included and 259 outcomes were collected. After standardization, 132 outcomes were identified within seven different categories, of which 58 were selected to develop a preliminary outcome list for further consensus. After two rounds of Delphi survey and one consensus meeting, the most important outcomes for the different clinical classifications of COVID-19 were identified and determined to constitute the COS for clinical trials on COVID-19 (COS-COVID).

However, studies have found that the outcomes used in clinical research are frequently inconsistent, nonstandard, irrational, or inessential, weakening the scientific and practical nature of research results and leading to research waste [1] [2] [3] . In order to overcome these problems, experts in evidence-based medicine and clinical research methodology have put forward strategies to develop core outcome sets (COSs). A COS refers to an agreed-upon standard set of outcomes that should be measured and reported, as a minimum, in all clinical trials in specific areas of health or healthcare [4] . A COS is helpful to regularize outcomes adopted in clinical trials, so as to improve the practicability, comparability, and transparency of the results [4] . In 2010, the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) Initiative y was launched to promote research on COS by developing methodological guidelines.

While predicting bacteriologic outcomes in patients with bacterial infection may be ideal, the values obtained using the therapeutic outcomes model may be inconsistent with clinical experience. As mentioned previously, antibiotics should be reserved for patients with bacterial infection, with the primary goal of eradicating the pathogen from the site of infection. However, the limitations associated with differentiating bacterial from nonbacterial disease inevitably result in patients with nonbacterial disease receiving antibiotic therapy. Using antibiotics for patients with nonbacterial disease often dilutes or reduces the perceived bacteriologic efficacy of the antibiotic. This often is the case with bacteriologic findings from clinical trials that have methodologic limitations (eg, inclusion criteria, diagnostic criteria).",19.513548016036413,10.835089808523358

Development of colistin resistance in these strains means few or even no remaining active agents. However, patients who are affected by these bacteria are medically complex, heterogenous, and difficult to enroll into clinical trials for many reasons. Consequently, clinical data associating colistin resistance, antimicrobial therapy given and patient outcome are scarce and retrospective in nature for the most part. For K. pneumoniae, limited data suggest that mortality of infection from colistin-resistant strains may be lower when treated with gentamicin-containing regimens than those without gentamicin, but this approach is only applicable when the infecting strain is susceptible to this agent. Fortunately, the approval of ceftazidime-avibactam has ameliorated concerns over colistin resistance in K. pneumoniae at least for the time being, as therapy with ceftazidime-avibactam appears to improve clinical outcome of infected patients over those treated with colistin-based regimens. Interestingly, gastrointestinal decolonization with gentamicin may reduce infections and mortality in those known to be colonized with colistin-resistant K. pneumoniae, but the recent spread of mcr genes in humans brings into question the long-term viability of this approach. There are even less clinical data regarding the treatment of infections caused by colistin-resistant P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii. In vitro data variably support colistin-based combinations with partner agents including carbapenems, rifampicin, fosfomycin, and even gram-positive agents like vancomycin in the case of A. baumannii, but without accompanying robust clinical data. There are several novel agents with activity against colistin-resistant strains in late-stage clinical development. They include novel beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, a siderophore cephalosporin, an aminoglycoside and tetracyclines. Most of them target carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, while some are also active against P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii. These new agents are bound to change the paradigm for the treatment of infections caused by colistin-resistant Gram-negatives, but uncertainties are still likely to remain, including which agent to use, how to optimize dosing in to maximize efficacy and minimize toxicity as well as potential for development of resistance, and whether use of more than one agent would still be needed.",22.480831115710128,10.788325275226022

With natural in vivo FCoV infection, different clinical outcomes (besides resistance to FCoV) have been described: persistent carrier, transiently infection and development of FIP [2] . It is not clear what the viral and host factors are that determine the different clinical outcomes. Since in the inoculation study the same strain (FIPV-79-1146) was used and considering the fact that in the field cats are often infected with the same strain of FCoV, it is likely that genomic variation between cats contributes to a different clinical outcome. A genetic background was also suggested during a field study with pure-bred cats, in which it was shown that susceptibility to FIP is indeed inheritable [7] . A possible explanation for the different disease progression is the possibility of the cats to develop an efficient T-cell response [3] . However, it could also be that the susceptibility of the monocytes to FIPV plays a role, considering the results presented here.

Viral causes of gastroenteritis","The immense disease burden of viral gastroenteritis underscores the need for effective prevention strategies. Endemic rotavirus disease is clearly the most important target for prevention, and efforts to develop rotavirus vaccines were initiated many years ago when it became apparent that improvements in hygiene and sanitation were unlikely to interrupt viral transmission [Bresee, et al., 1999] , A vaccine against rotavirus was licensed for the first time in the United States in 1998 but was withdrawn a year later following strong suspicion and evidence of its association with intussusception [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1999; Murphy, et al., 2001; Offit et al., Section II, Chapter 13 of this book]. Despite this setback, efforts to develop other candidate vaccines are underway, and products currently in clinical trials may be available for use in the next few years. The role of other viruses, including caliciviruses, astroviruses, and adenoviruses in the etiology of severe endemic gastroenteritis needs to be better defined to determine whether these viruses should be targeted for prevention through vaccination. For the prevention of epidemic viral gastroenteritis, efforts clearly need to be focused on caliciviruses. The epidemic spread of caliciviruses is facilitated by the low infectious dose (<100 viral particles), ability of the virus to survive at relatively high levels of chlorine and temperatures from freezing to 60°C, great genetic diversity, and lack of lasting immunity [Kapikian, et al., 1996] . Efforts to prevent calicivirus outbreaks currently focus on identifying and eliminating sources of contamination of food and water. Person-to-person spread of caliciviruses can be reduced by good hygiene practices but is often difficult to interrupt; consequently, outbreaks spread by this mode in institutional settings (e.g., nursing homes) often run their natural course and terminate when susceptible persons are exhausted.",22.76171531823954,11.442851379431172

In addition, the risk for antibody-dependent enhancement of disease may interrupt the timeline for conducting human clinical trials of MERS CoV vaccines and immunotherapeutics. Researchers of all potential MERS-CoV medical countermeasures should have preclinical toxicology data available before initiating human clinical trials.

In addition to asthma symptoms, allergic rhinitis, rhinosinusitis and other related comorbidities are often apparent in patients with more severe disease making it difficult to treat. Despite guideline-consistent care, many patients still experience variability in asthma control signaling an unmet need within this population. Omalizumab (Xolair®) has recently demonstrated clinical efficacy and safety in treating asthma. Objective: The aim of this paper is to summarize the ARQL outcomes associated with omalizumab therapy in moderate-to-severe allergic asthma. Methods: We performed a systematic review of ARQL data from the Clinical Study Reports and published clinical trials on omalizumab. ARQL was measured by the Juniper-Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ). Results: Statistically significant results for ARQL endpoints consistently favored omalizumab over placebo. The magnitude of the changes in ARQL were consistently aligned with clinical endpoints. Moderate to large effect sizes in the omalizumab groups were maintained throughout the 28-week clinical trial program and during the 24-week double-blind extension phase. However, the placebo groups also experienced within-group improvements and moderate effect sizes. A meta-analysis indicated a 1.6 to 2.0 fold increase in large (>1.0 point) improvements in overall AQLQ scores in the omalizumab-treated group compared with placebo during the stabilization and steroid-reduction phases of the clinical trials. Conclusions: The consistently positive impact of omalizumab on ARQL outcomes during the clinical trial program provides evidence of its value as an adjunct therapy in patients with moderate-to-severe allergic asthma. Significant differences and large effect sizes were observed despite the fact that the control group received active, guideline-consistent treatment producing a substantial placebo effect. Improvements were observed in Overall, Symptom, Activity, Emotional and Environmental dimensions of the AQLQ indicating that omalizumab produced benefits in ARQL in patients with moderate-to-severe allergic asthma. Background: Omalizumab, a monoclonal anti-IgE antibody, significantly improves asthma-related quality of life (ARQL) for patients with moderatesevere allergic asthma who express symptoms despite moderate-high inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) doses. Mean scores can mask underlying variability in ARQL outcomes. This investigation examined variability in outcomes to elucidate the specific impact of omalizumab treatment. Methods: AQLQ data (n=948) from two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials were pooled to assess underlying variability in the mean scores and to identify key drivers of ARQL treatment-effect differences (Juniper-Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ)) between omalizumab and placebo (active control) patients. Results: Correlations between AQLQ and other clinical outcomes were low to moderate at best (r=0.14 to r=0.60). AQLQ assessment captures patient benefit that supplements clinical outcome measures. Across all component items of the AQLQ patients receiving omalizumab improved more than patients receiving placebo (active control) (p<0.05). Omalizumab patients reported the greatest improvement for reducing waking with symptoms in the morning (Symptoms domain: 2.06 vs. 1.50; p<0.001), limitations in all activities done (Activities domain: 1.18 vs. 0.68; p<0.001), the fear of not having medication available (Emotions domain: 0.99 vs. 0.60; p<0.01), and symptoms from being exposed to dust (Environment domain: 1.31 vs. 0.88; p<0.001), compared to placebo (active control) patients. Conclusion: ARQL assessment provides complementary and non-overlapping information on clinical benefit that is distinct from other clinical outcome measures. Examination of underlying variability in AQLQ mean scores and item-level response extend previously published results on omalizumab treatment effect by showing that aggregate ARQL improvements for omalizumab patients are strongly influenced by symptom and activity improvement.",15.620389172148016,8.613627493430135

We further set out to investigate the structural features of HKU9-RBD via crystallography. The protein was successfully crystallized; a 2.1 Å data set was collected (Table 1) , and the structure was determined by using the single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) method. The determined structure, with an R work of 0.1700 and an R free of 0.2006, contains a single molecule in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. Clear electron densities were traced for 176 consecutive HKU9-RBD residues, extending from S355 to A520. These amino acids fold into a compact structure, which can be further divided into two subdomains as shown schematically in the other RBD structures. 35, 38, 39 The core subdomain comprises eight β-strands and six helices (α or 3 10 ). Five long strands (βc1−βc5) are arranged in an antiparallel manner, forming the scaffold center of the core (core-center). This core-center sheet is further wrapped by the surface helices and loops. It is notable that the six helices (H1− H6) are sporadically distributed on the two sheet faces, thereby leading to an overall globular fold for the core subdomain. On one lateral side of the core-center sheet, the external subdomain covers the core like a hat, while on the distal opposite side, three small strands (βp1−βp3) constitute a parallel peripheral sheet (core-peripheral), ensuring that the N-and C-termini of HKU9-RBD are in the proximity. As expected, the characteristic cysteine residues ( Figure 1B ) form three disulfide bonds in the core subdomain, further stabilizing the core structure from the interior. Of these, two (C357−C381 and C411−C517) are located in core-peripheral, contributing to the orientation of the RBD termini; one (C399/C452) resides in the core-center, linking strands βc2 and βc4 (Figure 3) . Overall, the residue boundaries of the core subdomain observed in the structure are quite consistent with those deduced from the results of sequence alignment ( Figure 1B) . The external subdomain of HKU9-RBD consists of 42 residues from L458 to V499 ( Figure 1C ). These amino acids extend out of strand βc4 of the core-center sheet, first orient as a loop along the core subdomain like a clamp, then fold back to form a solvent-exposed α-helix (H1′), and finally proceed into core strand βc5 (Figure 3 ). This observed structure differs dramatically from those of SARS-RBD and MERS-RBD, which are shown to be devoid of any helical components in the external region. 38, 39 The unique external fold of HKU9-RBD could well explain its inability to bind either ACE2 or CD26.",15.39568359051326,10.484728787719833

Some would be very useful for mass vaccination, such as DNA vaccines transported by Salmonella typhimurium, in ovo or IN vaccination. However, despite the substantial efforts made since 1993, no vaccine has reached the industrial development stage. This may be due to the fact that the vast majority of vaccines were injected intramuscularly and needed at least two injections, which is not feasible in the field. Furthermore, the assays were mainly performed with SPF birds. In real life, young birds may harbor passive maternal antibodies against the pathogen of interest that have been shown to hinder, at least partially, the induction of immunity.

The first phase is preparation and design. This includes identifying and funding the appropriate members needed to develop the technical components i.e. game developers, GHS content subject matter experts, and users. A development schedule to include frequent meeting should be agreed upon. The second component in this phase is a subject matter concepts transfer. The SMEs demonstrate how to perform tasks, allowing game developers to ask questions and take notes and photographs for reference. One of the key challenges in game development is difficulty conveying expert concepts to nonexpert developers. Concepts transfer helps orient the game developers to the information to be shared or used in the game. Content production, including any necessary physiological modeling incorporating existing evidence, guidelines, and expert derived algorithms is completed during this phase with storyboards describing the flow and required functionality of the game. The second phase is development of wireframes, which are illustrations of proposed game components and assist in visual communication design of the structure, functionality, and learner interface.

In controversial areas of research, such as xenotransplantation, the health ministry has simply postponed decisions, or in effect delegated them to Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), knowing that university IRBs are incapable of handling a complex regulatory decision such as the safety of xenotransplantation. The outcome has been that, while not forbidden, clinical trials with xenotransplantation seem highly unlikely in Japan until the ministry drafts some sort of safety guidelines. A negligent approach to bioethics rules can backfire too, and the introduction of the principle of informed consent is a typical example 20 . It was only after the international harmonization of pharmaceutical approval procedures that informed consent practices became enforced in Japan, in 1996. The effects were predictable. During the 1990s, enrolment in clinical trials in Japan declined steadily. In fact, in areas where regulation remains unclear, such as the harvesting of human cells and tissues for research use, the result has often been paralysis rather than 'anything goes' 21 .",15.561650718997738,7.88298496605236

The lack of randomization is the main criticism for these observational studies. However, sometimes the observational studies could give qualified information, if they could be well designed [101] . But, the researchers should be aware of the potential confounders. While performing the clinical outcome studies on ribavirin use in CCHF, there are significant confounders; 1. Severity of the infection might differ. There are mild and severe forms of the disease, because of several reasons. (see also Chapter 16). 2. Number of days from onset might differ. Some patients could get the ribavirin at an earlier, prehemorrhagic phase of the infection, whereas some patients could get the ribavirin at a later phase, hemorrhagic phase of the infection. 3. The severity of the gastrointestinal symptoms might differ. Some patients cannot get drug via oral route, because of severe hematemesis. This parameter is important in pharmacological effectivity. If the ribavirin was saved for the severe cases, an observational comparative study between the ribavirin given and not given group would have a misclassification bias in favor of not using ribavirin. The patients who would not receive ribavirin would be usually the mild cases.

First, if important generic questions are incorporated into a very simple protocol, sufficient numbers of physicians are still willing and able to collaborate at little or no reimbursement. Second, the ""merger"" of CREATE and ECLA was possible because of long-standing previous collaboration between the investigators from the 2 groups, and a mutual commitment to sharing credit.

Third, the bureaucratic hurdles for conducting this trial in India and China were formidable and took between 9 -18 months to overcome, chiefly through the tenacity, determination and dedication of the National Coordinators in Beijing and Bangalore. Fourth, even in a very simple trial, some streamlined and sensible (""helpful and supportive"" as opposed to ""policing"") monitoring could help in improving study quality, especially when centers had not previously participated in trials. Fifth, much of the increasing regulatory bureaucracy imposed by guidelines such as the ""Good Clinical Practice"" guidelines may not enhance the quality of the study or improve patient safety more than careful attention to a few key aspects of study design, conduct (such as proper randomization and complete and unbiased outcome ascertainment), and periodic review of the data by an independent DSMB.

The journal ""Science"" has been the forum for a series of letters from prestigious scientists criticizing investment strategy in the development of an aids vaccine and the initiation of phase III clinical trials 58, 59 . The strict scientific position defends that there are no consistent data on the efficacy of current vaccine prototypes to carry out phase III clinical trials. Consequently, such investment should be concentrated in basic research in order to get a better understanding on the mechanisms of protective immune responses and to develop new relevant animal models. Faced with this stance, a more humanist position bases the start of phase III trials on the catastrophic situation in developing countries and on the counterargument that, if there are no adequate animal models, it will be anyway necessary to carry out all the phases of the studies, including phase III, in humans to obtain a definitive response. Despite the reticence and pessimism of a large part of the scientific community, the general impression is that phase III trials will be carried out. It is important to remember the cost and effort involved in these trials, which require the follow-up of 10,000 patients for at least five years to obtain conclusive results. Therefore, with regard to aids vaccines, we are living in difficult times in which a huge economic investment will be necessary so that the scientific community can generate, develop and evaluate all the vaccine prototypes imaginable in animal models in order to find the Holy Grail of vaccines. As a reference, in case the European Union decided to start a program of phase I and II clinical trials with a reduced number of vaccine prototypes already generated in European laboratories an investment of 1.2 billions euros in the following 10 years should be required. With this objective in mind, the development of vaccine research centers has been proposed 68 . These centers would combine: (i) a critical mass of investigators, (ii) their sole dedication to the development of prototype HIV vaccines, (iii) a long-term commitment by academic, governmental and private institutions, (iv) sufficient resources and (v) continuous exchange of information and collaboration with the private sector. As a consequence of this policy the main leader organizations (NIH, IAVI, ANRS, EU, Gates Foundation...) should finance vaccine development centers and would coordinate their work. The prototypes considered interesting would be prepared under the conditions of Good Manufacturing Practice for use in humans and would enter a previously defined process of pre-clinical studies and phase I, II and III clinical trials. All the prototypes would meet the minimum requirements for clinical application, which would mean not only defining these criteria but also involving the regulatory authorities (FDA, EMEA) in their development. The evaluation of prototypes also requires the definition of those immunological markers which must be used to evaluate their potential efficacy. This in turn would mean developing standardized and reproducible trials to evaluate the humoral and cellular responses to HIV and the approval of laboratories which would carry out these immunological determinations. Lastly, the necessary healthcare structures should be set up to carry out the trials in clinical phases in developing countries, and the ethical criteria to be fulfilled in these trials should be defined. Given the large number of current prototypes (table 2), the application of homogeneous evaluation criteria is the only way to reach consistent conclusions which can be extrapolated to all situations.",16.694126369185494,9.365319431393878

However, since miR-155 can be expressed by both tumor cells and immune cells in the TME, elucidating the cellular origins of the miR-155 transcript in bulk RNAseq is challenging. Deconvolution approaches that aim to distinguish gene signatures of cancer and immune cells in RNAseq data can potentially be employed to address this issue and reveal detailed immunobiological characteristics of miR-155-high and -low tumors (44, 45) . Our data showing a strong positive correlation between the expression levels of miR-155 and various immune-associated genes suggest that the miR-155 transcript in bulk tumor RNAseq originates from the immune component. This is further supported by the results of PCA that revealed a consistent immune gene signature within miR-155high tumor subsets, and by the results of GSEA, which showed a significant enrichment of several inflammatory pathways upon high expression of miR-155. Moreover, miR-155-high tumor subsets were characterized by a more predominant immune cell infiltration at the histological level in SKCM. Observing similar trends in both molecular and histological analyses of miR-155-high tumor subsets is intriguing because, while gene expression profiling requires extraction of RNA from a considerably sized tumor tissue, a histological preparation only samples a few micrometers of the tumor. Despite the caveat of subsampling, histological assessment of immune infiltration is a common clinical practice in human melanoma where studies have revealed a positive correlation between intratumoral lymphocyte levels and the clinical prognosis (46) . Our findings suggest that the enhanced immune signature marked by higher expression of miR-155 did not always correlate with an improved clinical outcome across TCGA data sets, suggesting that tumor-specific features can play an important role in shaping the antitumor immune response and tumor prognosis. Two tumor types from TCGA data set in which miR-155 expression was associated with a better clinical outcome were SKCM and LUSC, which are characterized by the highest mutational burden among TCGA cohorts.

The viral polyprotein is cleaved at three unique sites by PLpro and 11 unique sites by 3CLpro. Initial reports of 3CLpro inhibitors in the literature focused on peptidomimetics, often four to five residues in length, bearing a reactive 'warhead' group, such as an aldehyde, halo-methyl ketone, or Michael acceptor at the terminus with several demonstrating a covalent interaction with the active site Cys-145 residue. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] Until recently, the majority of efforts to develop nonpeptidic 3CLpro inhibitors also relied on 'warhead' based design strategies (Fig. 1, 1-5) 17-21 and a number of these nonpeptidic inhibitors achieved sub-micromolar activity. In the case of pyridyl ester 4, 20 this potent nanomolar mechanism-based enzyme inactivator led to cell based inhibition below 10 lM in SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells. Recently, we reported N-(tert-butyl)-2-(N-arylamido)-2-(pyridin-3-yl) acetamide 6 ( Fig. 1, ML188 ) and its X-ray complex with 3CLpro (PDB: 3V3M) as a rare example of a noncovalent SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitor of moderate molecular weight with good enzyme and antiviral inhibitory activity. 22 Herein, we describe the continuation of efforts to develop potent, noncovalent SARS-3CLpro inhibitors based upon a second chemical class of triazoles from our MLPCN screening campaign (7, Fig. 2 ) and progression of this lead series to a second generation probe ML300 (16e, Fig. 1 ) and beyond to arrive at sub-100 nM inhibitors. We propose from crystallography data that ML300 and related triazoles in this series inhibit 3CLpro via a novel mechanism of action and provide a new direction for additional noncovalent inhibitor design and refinement.",17.571924975846095,10.09975132342861

In general, most efforts to develop antibody-based therapies have focused on diseases where the humoral immune system was known to make a strong contribution to host defense. For these microbial diseases the efficacy of humoral immunity was implied from demonstration of passive antibody protection and/or correlation of specific antibody with resistance to disease. However, recent work has established that mAbs are effective even against microbes for which the standard studies do not clearly establish a role for humoral immunity [33] . For example, several mAbs have now been generated that are effective against intracellular pathogens and other microbes where natural Ab is not believed to have a primary role in host defense [33] . Overall, diseases which are currently not preventable by vaccination or that target populations with weak immune systems (for example, the very young or old, and immunosuppressed or immunocompromised patients) are the most valuable for which to develop mAb therapies. Here, both viral and bacterial toxin diseases that are the target of mAb development will be discussed, as well as potential targets based on need toward which efforts should be focused in the future.

In general, during this period of life it is very difficult to identify any infection, especially in the case of new infectious agents, if a specific investigation is not carried out. In our hospital we are performing a prospective study of respiratory infections in hospitalised children for more than 10 years, and this may be helpful in assigning an etiologic role and define a viral infection in our both individual patients. However, these two patients did not show any specific clinical symptoms of infection by HBoV or any analytical data that could set them apart from other pre-term newborns with respiratory complications. The first patient required increased oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation and had a radiological image compatible with atelectasis.

Our knowledge of immune cell signaling, particularly in cells of the innate immune system, has been informed to a considerable extent by the mechanisms used by pathogens, especially those with type III secretion systems, to disrupt key signaling pathways and establish infection. Since pathogens often express relatively few proteins for direct interaction with the host proteome, global screens to determine host protein binding partners for pathogenic proteins have been and will continue to be highly informative in efforts to develop models of host-pathogen interactions. Since viruses are dependent on interactions within host cells for their survival and pathogenicity, elucidation of virus-host interactomes as well as intraviral interactions are of particular interest. Again, due to its amenability to high-throughput studies, Y2H has been employed much more than the other techniques described above. Intraviral Y2H screens have been carried out for numerous viruses, especially herpesviruses (VZV, KSHV, HSV-1, mCMV and EBV) due to their larger genomes providing more ORFs (70 to 170) for screening (220) (221) (222) (223) . Analysis of the intraviral network in this family has suggested a high degree of conservation of core interactions that support the viral life cycle, such as the involvement of the HSV-1 UL33, UL31 and UL34 orthologs across all herpesviruses (regardless of sequence conservation) in capsid envelopment and nuclear egress (224) .",15.21537101322903,7.2773149134623285

Once transported to the cytoplasm, pre-miRNA are further cleavage by Dicer into 21-22 nt RNA duplexes that are then incorporated in RISC. In contrast to siRNAs that direct mRNA cleavage through perfect guide strand/mRNA complementarity, mature miRNA incorporated into RISC will induce translational repression by partial annealing to the mRNA 3′ untranslated region (UTR).

For example, therapeutic intervention may aim to regulate miRNA activity through miRNA inhibitors termed Antagomirs [16, 17] as a way to inhibit tumor progression [18, 19] or to restore the expression of miRNA that exhibit antitumoral activities. Despite these exciting posibilities with the miRNA pathway, the majority of efforts to develop RNAi therapeutics have been focused on engaging the ""exogenous"" RNAi pathway with siRNAs. These effector molecules are normally delivered directly to the cellular cytoplasm requiring, in the case of the so-called Dicer substrates [18, 19] , or not for shorter 21-22 siRNA, enzymatic cleavage before RISC incorporation. Alternatively, these triggers can be translated intracellularly from plasmid or viral rectors [20, 21] as pri-or pre-miRNA-like structures that would then, in analogy to the endogenous miRNA, become processed and loaded into RISC.",15.13539240115167,9.735815039015296

Case B shows when a result falls within it. Case C depicts six tests whose results are widely dispersed while Case D illustrates six test results that are closely clustered (more precise). Case E shows that while the results in Case D are precise, they are not accurate, and therefore, are considered to be biased. Experimentally, bias can be caused by a number of factors, such as an undetected error in an calibration of load or some other applied variable that skews test results. Even if a digital read-out or a data output is highly precise (many decimal places), its accuracy can be incorrect. Case F shows both high precision and high accuracy.

They must be conducted according to GCPs (as discussed in section XII) to maximize human subject protection and data validity. They must also be designed with appropriate, relevant endpoints that either reflect clinical outcomes or are acceptable surrogate endpoints. Surrogate endpoints are laboratory or other measurements not directly indicating clinical benefit but that are expected to correlate with or predict clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints are usually easier to measure than clinical endpoints and occur earlier in the course of the disease, allowing for shorter, smaller, and, thus, less expensive studies. Their major disadvantage is the uncertainty surrounding whether and to what extent the surrogate reflects the true clinical benefit. Thus, if FDA bases important regulatory decisions regarding product licensure on a surrogate and the medical community bases practice decisions on data generated from trials using surrogates, it is critical that the surrogate be valid for the particular treatment and disease. Once a surrogate is validated for one treatment and disease using a particular product, the extent to which that validation applies to other products in the same class and across product classes could become important, particularly as one might define a product class in the context of adenoviral-containing products. In earlier phases of clinical testing, use of surrogate endpoints may serve useful and potentially less problematic roles. For instance, during product development, a surrogate may be used to assess dose-response and thus provide the rationale for dose selection for later trials, or they may be used as initial proof-of-concept to base decisions about further clinical development. Several excellent papers provide more in-depth discussions about surrogates and validation of surrogates [28, 29] .",18.001482729395057,8.561778356132844

Supervised learning is defined by identifying patterns that relate variables to measured outcomes and maximize accuracy when predicting those outcomes. For example, an automatically fitted regression model (including any form of generalized linear model) is a supervised learning technique. By contrast, unsupervised learning exploits innate properties of the input data set to detect trends and patterns without explicit designation of one column as the outcome of interest. For example, principal component analysis, which identifies underlying covariance structures in observed data, is unsupervised. Semisupervised learning, a sort of hybrid, is used in contexts where prediction is a goal but the majority of data points are missing outcome information (146). Semi-supervised and unsupervised methods are often used in the data-mining phase as precursors to supervised approaches intended for prediction or more rigorous statistical analyses in a follow-up.

Since the majority of these are conformationally dependent, it is expected that peptide immunogens are less likely to achieve this.

This limited attention is understandable from both economic and technical perspectives. Technically speaking, much remains unknown about the biology and pathogenesis of EVD.87 For instance, there seems to be no validated surrogate marker or immunological correlate of protection that can guide product evaluation in clinical trials. As such, trials may require clinical endpoints such as severe disease outcomes (e.g. death) or endpoints, which may be challenging to measure. From an economic perspective, the epidemiology of the disease, rare and sporadic outbreaks that occur in regions with very weak purchasing power, offers comparatively little or no market incentives for industries to invest millions of dollars to develop products against EVD. This economic obstacle, however, has changed in recent years owing to the risk of importation of the virus, potential misuse of the virus in bioterrorism, frequent outbreaks and the need to protect specific risk groups including health professionals, aid workers and military personnel amongst others. These interests have led to the evaluation of several clinically approved drugs in animal models. For instance, activated protein C88 and inhibitors of factor VIIa89 have shown some promising results in controlling coagulation disorders in animal models. Similarly, an RNA-based treatment strategy, namely, the use of antisense oligonucleotides, has been shown to interfere with transcription and thus viral replication.90 In contrast ribavirin, a broad spectrum anti-viral agent against many hemorrhagic viruses, was shown to have no effect on EVD.91 Although some of these strategies are promising, there are still substantial scientific and pragmatic issues that require elucidation.",14.59617658123482,7.900122985072812

However, crude case fatality ratios (CFRs) obtained from dividing deaths by cases can be misleading 9,10 . Firstly, there can be a period of two to three weeks between a case developing symptoms, subsequently being detected and reported and observing the final clinical outcome. During a growing epidemic the final clinical outcome of most of the reported cases is typically unknown. Simply dividing the cumulative reported number of deaths by the cumulative number of reported cases will therefore underestimate the true CFR early in an epidemic 9-11 . This effect was observed in past epidemics of respiratory pathogensincluding SARS 12 and H1N1 9 influenza -and as such is widely recognised. Thus, many of the estimates of the CFR that have been obtained to date for COVID-19 correct for this effect [13] [14] [15] [16] . Additionally, however, during the exponentially growing phase of an epidemic, the observed time-lags between the onset of symptoms and outcome (recovery or death) are censored and naïve estimates of the observed times from symptoms onset to outcome provide biased estimates of the actual distributions. Ignoring this effect tends to bias the estimated CFR downwards during the early growth phase of an epidemic.",16.2014411198203,5.7118651412413985

Of particular value in testing and refining the model will be randomized controlled interventional trials in general or specific populations. As of March, 30 2020, there were 119 trials registered at clinicaltrial.gov under the search term ""COVID-19+Drug"". Within this 119, there are multiple interventions at different points of the pathophysiology, including, but not limited to: hyperimmune plasma, IL-6 Antibody (e.g. Tocilizumab), protease inhibitors (e.g. Lopinavir/ritonavir), cloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, and Janus Kinases inhibitors (e.g. Baricitinib). As this platform develops, we anticipate predicting the responses to such therapies and refining the model with emerging data such that the range of clinical responses are captured with adequate fidelity. Additionally, data collected from patients or animals during infection, including the presence of various immune cell subsets in lung tissue and systemic markers of inflammation, will serve to differentiate responses to SARS-CoV-2. These data will be similarly integrated to calibrate and validate the model to ensure accurate predictions of therapeutic outcomes based on clinical characteristics.",15.964319588657464,6.936745671104079

However, when combining k-mer candidates to form pairs, we need location informationbecause k-mers need to refer to the same reference and have to be in an offset range of [τ min : τ max ] nt. We use two data structures per reference -a list to store the set of TKMerIDs in order of occurrence and a compact data structure in form of a bit vector B in the length of the last k-mer occurrence. A set bit indicates the presence of a TKMerID. I.e., the i-th set bit in B corresponds to the i-th TKMerID in the KMerIDs list. The compact data structure is augmented with rank 1 and select 1 support, which have O(1) runtime for queries 10 .
