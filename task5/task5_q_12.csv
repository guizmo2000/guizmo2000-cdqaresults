The hospital in SC appeared to have more patient-centered care, while the hospital from GN appeared to be more profit-oriented. It is suggested that these differences in mentality were due to differences in resource allocation systems, and security of funding. Following the financial decentralization, performance-based payment systems have been prevalent in Chinese public hospitals, which may have encouraged gaming within the health system to raise additional funds by charging from patients [32] . This approach is not encouraged in the TB clinics, however it is entrenched within practice as operational costs are not fully met by the government. Loss of income due to free TB treatment policy may be a universal concern [11] . Hospital providers may thus comprise the standardised TB treatment through unnecessary prescription of drugs, tests and admissions for general TB patients. These distorted incentives constrain the patient-orientated care provision and can negatively impact on the care of patients. While government funding has largely improved for public health facilities such as CDC, there is an urgent need to increase funding to subsidize the newly integrated public-health services in the hospital. The resource allocation mechanisms in TB control seemed to favor the CDC, and so hospitals may suffer from a ""reallocation"" of the TB control budget from the CDC. Integration requires transfer of funds for care from the CDC to the hospital. An appropriate budgeting mechanism needs to be explored to ensure equitable allocation of resources and successful integration as in the case of SC. Different practices of hospitalizing TB patients in SC and GN could also reflect the conflicts between the clinical and public health perspectives of TB care delivery. Clinicians in the hospital should be educated to improve the public health awareness, and specifically implement an outpatient-based systematic public health TB approach. Both sites presented the challenges of retaining qualified TB personnel. To ensure that TB services are sustainable and maintain a high quality of care, fair pay should be provided to attract and stabilize a motivated and skilled workforce.",40.17410378546983,18.644804387410627

Improved stakeholder engagement with the MOH should be able to address this challenge in the long run. Funding also has some challenges: although PHFP is currently funded by the USA Government, for full integration and institutionalization within the Uganda MoH system there must be domestic resource allocation to support this program. Recognizing this need, MoH has made PHFP a key component of the proposed Uganda National Institute of Public Health (UNIPH) by designating it as a unique directorate [25] . Once the UNIPH is formally established by the Ugandan Parliament, it will become an integrated disease control centre in the country and have diversified funding sources from the government, philanthropists, and the private sector, as well as grants and cooperative agreements from international organisations and foreign governments.

Dissemination of tools like this checklist may help local ME/Cs develop high quality planning. MFI plans, operational capabilities and resource sharing agreements should be reviewed by ME/Cs annually and updated as needed. The development and upkeep of plans should be a transparent process, and information should be distributed effectively throughout the organization. The fact that many respondents did not know how often their plans were updated indicates that this is not currently the reality for most ME/Cs. Contact information, including chain of command (local and state level) contacts should always be kept up-to-date. 3.

Although a 30-bed ward in an infectious disease hospital in Wuhan was established for psychiatric patients on 3 February 2020, the rapidly escalating number of cases has led to a severe shortage of hospital beds. As an alternative, isolation wards have been established in psychiatric hospitals for psychiatric patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19, but this option could increase the risk of hospital-acquired infection especially if there is inadequate capacity for infection control in these hospitals [1] . Another option is to establish specific quarantine facilities for clinically stable psychiatric patients with mild-moderate symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Gymnasiums, exhibition centers and sports centers have been converted into 'Fang Cang' (temporary quarantine hospital facilities) for infected patients with mild symptoms [14] (Figure 1 ). In conclusion, the COVID-19 outbreak has raised numerous challenges for psychiatric hospitals in China to safely manage patients' major psychiatric disorders in addition to preventing and treating COVID-19. In addressing these challenges, future community mental health system reform is necessary to re-balance the system by re-distributing resources from hospital-centric services to community-based and primary care services.

For example, areas requiring coordination across both of these core capacities, such as case management or infection control, were not well-documented. Taking a holistic approach to IHR (2005) core capacity development could avoid these issues. 26, 45, 52 Moreover, there were cases in which it was difficult to implement national IHR (2005) policies. For example, in the United Republic of Tanzania protocols for isolating patients with certain diseases were developed, but due to shortages of public-sector health facilities private sector hospitals had to be used during epidemics. 27 This highlights the need to adapt global core capacities requirements to locally appropriate policies and solutions. 3 .

Assistance can include financial help, knowledge exchange in the form of research and educational partnerships, and capacity building in operations and implementation science. From a practical point of view, supporting resource-limited settings is also important given that inter-related economies, Caring for critically ill patients is challenging in resource-limited settings, where the burden of disease and mortality from potentially treatable illnesses is higher than in resource-rich areas. Barriers to delivering quality critical care in these settings include lack of epidemiologic data and context-specific evidence for medical decision-making, deficiencies in health systems organization and resources, and institutional obstacles to implementation of life-saving interventions. Potential solutions include the development of common definitions for intensive care unit (ICU), intensivist, and intensive care to create a universal ICU organization framework; development of educational programs for capacity building of health care professionals working in resource-limited settings; global prioritization of epidemiologic and clinical research in resource-limited settings to conduct timely and ethical studies in response to emerging threats; adaptation of international guidelines to promote implementation of evidence-based care; and strengthening of health systems that integrates these interventions.

However, the burden of critical illness and its global variation are not well established, even by the Global Burden of Disease project [4, 9, 21, 38] . Accurate estimation of ICU outcomes depends on administrative records or representative epidemiologic studies with sufficient follow-up, both of which require a well-organized health care system and a robust research infrastructure that are usually underdeveloped in resource-limited settings. Additional challenges to identifying the burden of critical illness include vague and sometimes varying working definitions of ICUs and critically ill patients [1, 39] and inconsistent ICU admission criteria across different settings, usually primarily driven by availability of ICU beds [37, 40] . Moreover, the need for critical care is usually substantially underestimated due to barriers to access related to distance, lack of transportation, and cost [22, 41] . Population-based estimates of the burden of critical illness in resource-limited settings are lacking [9] . Epidemiologic studies are typically cross-sectional and, except for few studies, have limited longitudinal follow-up to assess survival outcomes [5, 15] .

Moreover, a careful analysis of factors that contributed to variations in epidemic severity might lead to identification of additional characteristics to include in a ranking system. For example, local burial practices, having had prior local experience with a similar outbreak, and urban versus rural environments appear to have contributed to variations in the severity of recent West African EVD epidemics.

a clear communication plan that includes community input into the process for drug allocation would help avoid panic,0.1268316181028519,0.9269074201583862,2.022343635559082,874576cb-c233-49b6-8ef0-57e1ed00dae4,comm_use_subset/653-662 Lor et al,"Allocation of Scarce Resources Economic, demographic, geographical, and population vulnerability factors were common challenges identified as affecting resource allocation decisions. These challenges were shared in all regions where the meetings occurred. Participants agreed that because of the cultural and regional variations, a ""one size fits all"" approach to any planning and response activity is unlikely to be optimal and should be questioned and challenged. However, although differences were acknowledged, there were also shared understanding and general agreement on the importance of the ethical values discussed at the meetings. Participants felt that planning and response should take into account contextual variations and cultural differences. Additionally, participants discussed the issue of resource allocation within the framework of transparency, especially when preferential treatment is given to the most powerful community members as opposed to the most vulnerable. The African meeting participants affirmed the importance of providing resources to the young, but noted important differences in perspectives among countries. Many African societies give higher status to the elderly than to other age groups. With a life expectancy for some African countries in the 40s and even 30s, the proportion of the population composed of young children is much higher than in other countries. Thus, in African countries, a preference of allocating scarce resources to children would leave little resources for other segments of the population. Generally, African countries are much more rural than are countries of other continents, making access to villages difficult, whether by road, telephone, or internet. Although meeting attendees did not feel that rural or urban habitation should be a criterion for allocation of resources, they anticipated that logistical challenges would make it so. These concerns are dwarfed, however, by the likelihood that resources such as antivirals and vaccine will be far scarcer in African countries than elsewhere because of the continent's dual challenge of weak economies coupled with the number of other endemic health challenges, such as malaria and HIV/ AIDS. With few resources at hand, the ethical imperative to respond to pandemic influenza may fall below that of addressing hyperendemic fatal diseases. Each of the countries represented in the Asian meeting had a pandemic flu preparedness plan that addressed allocation issues and maintained a national stockpile of antiviral drugs. In most cases, biological vulnerability determined priority; thus, the very young or very old, pregnant women, and immunecompromised individuals tended to be prioritized to receive antiviral drugs. However, as Asian cultures exhibit more hierarchy than those in the West, more honor is accorded to the elderly, senior staff, royalty, and public service personnel in Asian cultures. In addition, it is expected that relatives and friends of the powerful will be unofficially prioritized to receive limited resources, without that being considered unethical. Indeed, in many Asian contexts, such prioritization is viewed as a social obligation (eg, a health worker would consider offering antivirals from the limited supply to a senior official before offering the resources to a person in one of the official priority groups). Nevertheless, participants expressed disapproval of officials who abuse their power and demand or extort limited resources for themselves. One participant described a shortage of N95 face masks (masks that can filter at least 95% of particles from the air) during the SARS epidemic. Although some people were willing to pay twice the regular price for a N95 mask, yielding to this demand would in effect favor protection for the rich over the poor. The participants felt the government had a duty to enforce price controls in order to ensure an adequate supply. As an example of enforcing price controls, one government instituted licensing for antiretroviral distribution to put a ceiling on the costs of the medications. Some of the Asian perspectives on ethical distribution differed by religion. An appeal to Buddhist beliefs stated a priority for those who are most severely ill, and the young making sacrifices for their elders. A priority for women and children was expressed with reference to Catholic values. When a choice must be made between a mother and her child, participants at the Asian meeting felt that Catholic values would typically give preference to the mother. Some Asian nations include island archipelagoes. It will be difficult for populations living on minor remote islands to access medical services and resources during a pandemic. The participants questioned whether their country plans address the challenges that certain geographical conditions may place on the equitable distribution of resources. Many participants of the Latin American meeting thought that individual rights were paramount and that during a pandemic a clear communication plan that includes community input into the process for drug allocation would help avoid panic. They emphasized the importance of including all sectors of society, including the private sectors, migrants, and minorities in public health decision-making process. Issues such as discrimination and stigmatization of certain sectors of the population must be addressed before an emergency situation arises. Meeting participants stressed that emergency plans should take into account the diversity of population, must be transparent, and favor equal distribution of resources. At the Eastern Mediterranean meeting, participants discussed the need to evaluate ""what is good for you versus what is good for others. "" This included discussing ethical challenges associated with distribution of scarce resources. Questions that were explored included: Which group of people should be vaccinated first? Who will make decisions about distribution? One theme that was identified from this discussion was the importance of prioritizing healthcare workers for access to limited resources, including medical and psychological care and other social benefits, should they become sick during an emergency.",31.249366975954878,12.854291627800562

Measurable progress has been made within a focused, but limited, scope. For progress to continue, however, CDC and the global health community must go beyond our initial efforts and work more broadly to confront challenges and embrace opportunities that arise. The GDD program has given us the following important lessons that can inform our next steps: 1) Create multiregional connectivity. Strong networks can harness a variety of strengths, share resources, and connect across disciplines toward common goals. A major success of the GDD program has been to create regional platforms where subject matter experts can engage with one another and programs can break free of their silos. Moving from siloed to shared approaches also enhances collaboration on science and research, thereby strengthening the foundation for public health action. Global networks have been created by GDD, and more recently with GHSA, in recognition that shared risk means shared responsibility, and the best way to achieve success is by working together to ensure our collective health, safety, and security. 2) Adopt consistent goals and measures. From the beginning, the GDD program has applied a consistent set of goals and metrics to track progress over time and across programs. The world's global health security efforts are also seeing the benefits of instituting consistent targets, as well as frameworks for measuring success against those targets. Over the past few years, the WHO Joint External Evaluations have become a valuable tool to track progress on global health security initiatives, both past-to-present and country-to-country [29] . Evaluation is a key part of recognizing accomplishments and is critical to finding gaps we must still address. Only once we know where we stand can we take action to implement successful programs and point them in the right direction to reduce our identified vulnerabilities. 3) Deploy the power of science and data. Cutting-edge scientific research has always been at the core of the GDD program's mission. Scientific data are the tool we use to detect, respond, and to halt or prevent outbreaks and to inform policy changes that protect public health globally. Scientific research helps partners make evidence-based decisions and implement effective local solutions that eliminate outbreaks at their source. Additionally, taking an active role in teaching others how to capture, analyze, and effectively use public health data creates a workforce capable of rapidly recognizing and responding to threats. Future scientific progress will require not only improved connection across scientific disciplines, but also sustained and dedicated commitment to a unified scientific strategy. 4) Build trusted partnerships. The GDD program's success has relied on strong partnerships. The program's longstanding presence in regions across the globe has proven that in-country engagement leads to trust. This trust becomes particularly valuable in outbreak response, as global partners rely on CDC data and expertise as a resource that saves lives. Strong partnerships at all levels are critical to global health security, and the process of creating GDD RCs has formed and strengthened partnerships at all levelsgovernment-to-government relationships, collaboration with other organizations and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and local and personal connectionsthat can be leveraged to address critical public health priorities. 5) Build for flexibility. Cross-cutting public health programs give us the ability to respond to any crisis, regardless of cause. Strong core systems and connected resources can pivot when needed to address emerging or reemerging threats. As threats change, and as science changes, funding tied to a single disease may prove limiting in its scope. Conversely, investment in core public health capacity ensures that a single mission does not dictate the longevity or capacity of a program, and that we can continue to maintain and grow our valuable resources, expertise, and connections. Flexible, nimble systems are our best answer to an unpredictable future.",28.974237786324903,14.726832295762726

We used bibliometric analysis and word cluster analysis to evaluate sanitation research from 1992 to 2016 based on the Science Citation Index EXPANDED (SCI-EXPANDED) and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) databases. Our results show that sanitation is a comprehensive field connected with multiple categories, and the increasing number of publications reflects a strong interest in this research area. Most of the research took place in developed countries, especially the USA, although sanitation problems are more serious in developing countries. Innovations in sanitation techniques may keep susceptible populations from contracting diseases caused by various kinds of contaminants and microorganisms. Hence, the hygienization of human excreta, resource recovery, and removal of micropollutants from excreta can serve as effective sustainable solutions. Commercialized technologies, like composting, anaerobic digestion, and storage, are reliable but still face challenges in addressing the links between the political, social, institutional, cultural, and educational aspects of sanitation.

Cyprus healthcare requires a unified independent service that can run national audits and provide guidance, education and training in clinical audit methodology and QI tools to clinicians and support staff. This is currently lacking. The SHSO oversees the operation of the six directorates (see Fig. 2 ) covering the Cypriot population: nationally, the capital district, the remaining four districts, as well as primary care, mental health and ambulatory services. In the effort to support the operating hospitals and clinics within each directorate, academic departments providing training to the healthcare workforce have a very important role in this. Key skills required to achieve this goal include clinical decision making, project management, data collection design and analysis, report writing, training, knowledge and experience in QI. The outcome of the clinical audit services should be a series of national audits on conditions identified as priority areas. Each audit will provide 'state of the nation' and individual provider organisation reports. Individuals and teams should be recruited in provider organisations with the skills and knowledge to develop local audits and implement changes in practice that lead to sustained improvements. Draft policy documents have also been produced and include a clinical audit policy setting out the principles, roles, responsibilities and practices which should be followed when auditing clinical practice. It also includes a clinical audit strategy, which describes how the MoH and HIO will implement the policy.

Different approaches are required for each unique situation (Curry, 2016) . Hence, many innovative toilet systems have been developed, especially in regional hotspots. More than one-third of the technologies are at the TRL level 4 (shown in Table 6 ), which means that most of the new technology is still at the level of component validation in the laboratory. Without three maturing application techniques (a TRL of 9), the rest of the technologies would require further development for practical utilization. Storage techniques for excreta have a positive effect for their hygienization. However, since a large space and long retention time are required for the process, its application is limited in an urban context. The challenges of MAP/MPP precipitation are related to the high recovery efficiency of nutrients and the purification of the products. The purer the products obtained, the more economic value the process will produce. Though MFCs could provide renewable energy during their operation, the high cost of the electrodes might be daunting. Like the MECs, chemical reagents could be replaced by electricity, but the maintenance of the electrodes is crucial. It would be difficult to balance the cost and efficiency at scale.

First, acute care facilities like hospitals can successfully manage outbreaks through collaborative efforts with multiple experts [73] . However, most of the LTCFs in this review requested advice from public health authorities and organizations for unexpected outbreaks instead of organizing a multidisciplinary team. This may imply that LTCFs do not have sufficient capacity and expertise to individually plan, implement, and evaluate the management of outbreaks. Forming a local support network between acute hospitals and LTCFs at a regional level would be a potential way to close the gaps and to enhance outbreak control practices in LTCFs without adequate capacity [74] .

Knowledge management theory has the potential to support research into problems such as HIV, antibiotic resistance and others, particularly in terms of aspects of scientific research related to the contribution of social science. To date, however, these challenges remain with us, and theoretical contributions that can complement natural science efforts to eradicate these problems are needed. This paper seeks to offer a theoretical contribution grounded in Kuhn's paradigm theory of innovation, and in the argument by Lakatos that scientific research can be fundamentally non-innovative, which suggests that social science aspects of knowledge creation may hold the key to more effective biomedical innovation. Given the consequences of ongoing and emerging global crises, and the failure of knowledge systems of scientific research to solve such problems outright, this paper provides a review of theory and literature arguing for a new paradigm in scientific research, based on the development of global systems to maximise research collaborations. A global systems approach effectively includes social science theory development as an important complement to the natural sciences research process. Arguably, information technology and social media technology have developed to the point at which solutions to knowledge aggregation challenges can enable solutions to knowledge problems on a scale hitherto unimaginable. Expert and non-expert crowdsourced inputs can enable problem-solving through exponentially increasing problem-solving inputs, using the 'crowd,' thereby increasing collaborations dramatically. It is argued that these developments herald a new era of participatory research, or a democratisation of research, which offers new hope for solving global social problems. This paper seeks to contribute to this end, and to the recognition of the important role of social theory in the scientific research process.",25.532358191599734,12.522027118768891

The economic cost of an avian pandemic to all countries would be phenomenal and, if allowed to last for months, become exponential [28] [29] [30] . Early detection and control of an AI pandemic will also require a coordinated international response. Controlling avian flu is for the good of global public health and all countries have an interest and obligation to do so. Firstly, the response to the influenza threat would need an integrated cross-sector approach, bringing together animal and human health, areas of rural development and agriculture, economics, finance, planning and others. Partnerships are needed at both international and national levels. Next, there is certainly a priority on curbing the disease ""at source"" in the agricultural sector, thereby reducing the probability of a human epidemic. International resources are also needed for surveillance on avian influenza outbreaks and human-tohuman transmission. It is also important to strike a balance between short and long term measures. Avian flu is becoming endemic in parts of East Asia and will require a long effort to suppress it. Meanwhile, a human pandemic may still emerge from a different strain of flu virus. Thus it makes sense for the international community to also undertake broader long-term measures to strengthen the institutional, regulatory and technical capacity of the animal health, human health and other relevant sectors in Asia. While country-level preparedness and leadership is essential for success, it must be backed by global resources. Even though the benefits of containing a pandemic are overwhelming, individual governments may still be daunted by the social, political and economic costs of various policy measures. Richer countries may have to support poorer countries in financial and non-financial means in the fight against a flu pandemic, for the sake of international good.

However, for such an organization to succeed, open communication and international cooperation is essential.

Historically HHR planning has focused primarily on staffing numbers; however, many of the PHHR policy documents have approached the issue of 'supply' of PHHR with a broader understanding of planning. This encompasses not only the numbers of staff, but their characteristics such as age of the workforce, and education and competencies, and incorporating issues such as the requirements to meet population health needs into planning. Policy documents published after the SARS event in ON discuss issues of 'shortages' of public health professionals [23, 27] . Given the effects of the SARS event, other public health crises in recent years, and emerging shortages of health professionals in general, it is not surprising that early policy documents were focused on these concerns. For example, early documents discussed the shortage of key public health personnel, in particular, the need for Medical Officers of Health and those health professionals with expertise in infectious diseases [23, 27, 41] . In contrast with ON, BC documents were less focused on the discussion of shortages and improving PHHR supply with the exception of one specific recommendation of enhancing Aboriginal PH staff [35] .

Three major implications emerge from this research. First, as stressed by the narratives of the informants, alienating the participation of populations and excluding their involvement, leads to non-compliance and increases risk of virus transmission. A community-based isolation of contacts, managed locally by leaders, health authorities, and community-based organizations, would likely have been a more acceptable alternative to vertical quarantine. Second, a top-down militarized-like measure does not allow the population to understand the emergency situation, creating a distance between institutions and citizens [14] . Third, coercion does not directly result in a change of practices or benefit health-seeking behaviours. On the contrary, enforcement of vertical measures is seen as a command, an injustice and a judgment of allegedly untoward behaviours. Such mechanisms feed self-organization as a form or resistance, but also a creation of informal economies that could be hazardous for public health and increase socio-economic divides. Throughout the epidemic, safe and dignified funerals should been sustained as a clear sign of respect and understanding of the complex socio-cultural and spiritual significance of the dead, even in times of crisis. Cremation, for example, could have been promoted as a temporary measure and organized through the involvement of community leaders-in particular those more in touch with people, such as chairpersons, chiefs, pastors and imams.

Figure 5 presents the comparison between actions made by hospital building managers and solutions suggested by the system. There are some differences in adopting renovation strategies for these two compared items. In the criterion of sustainable sites, the solutions suggested by the system cost more money than what hospital managers suggested because of high level actions for wall insulation technologies and eco-pavement. In the criterion of water efficiency, the hospital managers take a high level strategy for wastewater technologies that charges a costly budget, thereby increasing the total cost amount. In the criterion of energy, the system is adopting new green technology-building energy management system which is classified to high level, while the hospital managers take no action to improve the energy performance. In the criterion of health and well-being, hospital managers are trying to choose actions to improve the occupant environment that also raise the budget. For example, hospital managers choose the window insulation strategy with a high cost. In the criterion of pollution and waste, the system pays attention to prevention of refrigerant leak, watercourse pollution, and night time light pollution while hospital managers only take into account of the first two sub-criteria. Therefore, the total score yielded by the system (40.5) is higher than that of the project decided by hospital managers (33.5), as shown in Table 5 .

The auditor sat for an hour in the waiting room of the physicians' offices and noted the presence or absence of the four respiratory control activities listed just above. They also inquired as to how often potentially contaminated areas were cleaned with disinfectants, and if alcohol-based hand gels were used in examining rooms. The auditors were blinded to the outcome measures and aware only of data gathering requirements. In order to separate the intervention from the data collection, the physicians, office staff and facilitators were blinded from the outcomes and were not informed of the presence of the auditors. Statistically significant differences between before and after the intervention were observed for all four of the primary outcome measures: 67.3% (95% CI: 54.1%-80.5%), 48.1% (34.0%-62.1%), 54.7% (38.9%-70.5%) and 34.6% (20.1%-49.0%), respectively. Overall, the number of practices that applied all of the four audited primary prevention measures was 3.8% (0%-9.1%) prior to the intervention and 52.8% (38.9%-66.7%) following the intervention (p < .001), demonstrating a 49 (35.1-63.0) percentage point increase in the adoption rate of best practices. This study demonstrated that facilitation of a multi-faceted intervention by public health nurses successfully promoted best practices in respiratory infection control in primary care practices.

However, in township and district hospitals in sub-Saharan Africa, and South East Asia, ICU care is often very limited (43) . What can be found at the district hospital level may be a four-to eight-bed mixed adult and pediatric ICU with one to two nurses and minimal ancillary support. Hospitals often have a very limited supply of patient monitors, mechanical ventilators, necessary disposable materials (ECG stickers, tubing, and so forth), or electricity. Although the WHO recommends oxygen concentrators to be used as the primary oxygen supply for resource-limited settings, many of these countries utilize pressurized oxygen cylinders for oxygen delivery because they are less expensive, do not require electricity or ongoing maintenance, and are easier to use. However, transportation difficulties, exhaustible oxygen supply, and restricted patient use outweigh the initial savings, leading to frequent oxygen shortages (111, 112) . Appropriate supportive care was shown to help reduce many unnecessary deaths in the Ebola epidemic (13) . Although often considered part of basic care delivery in resource-rich settings, the availability and sustainability of clean water, reliable electricity, oxygen and compressed air, medical equipment, and support services (radiology, laboratory medicine, microbiology, and transfusion services) are essential for the delivery of critical care. In some areas, lack of basic health care resources, including protective gloves and gowns, intravenous fluids, and simple protocols or guidelines of care, limited the impact of frontline healthcare providers who risked their lives to care for those affected by Ebola (83) .

First, the distribution of economic consequences between unannounced (aerosol, liquid waste, and transference) and announced (tornados) releases are differentiated. While the releases are hypothetical, they are plausible as demonstrated by recent, similar FMDv events occurring across the world[2]. Second, a multi-step risk assessment evolved whereby an updated site specific risk assessment followed the initial site specific risk assessment. A purpose of the updated risk assessment is to respond to limitations identified by both the National Academy of Sciences and public comments. Third, mitigation control includes stamping out, vaccinate-to-live, and vaccinate-to-kill. A concern is that in the event of large outbreaks killing all infected animals may not be feasible. Fourth, uncertainty is carried from the plume model through the epidemiologic model outcomes to the economic assessment, identifying distributions of potential economic outcomes and not a simple point estimate of economic consequences. Finally, intertemporal welfare effects are differentiated across agricultural firms and commodities from production to feeding, processing, and down the supply chain to consumption. As a result, we are able to examine the impacts of FMDv releases over time and across commodities along the supply chain.",28.79763270839599,11.833204685634291

Physical space requirements extend beyond isolation of smallpox cases, to quarantine of contacts.

To combat these challenges, ongoing professional education programs encompassing a full range of disciplines are needed to help resilience-oriented professionals expand their skill sets over time and adapt to the evolving needs of the community they serve. Training and professional education programs can be competency-based, which have proven effective in other fields, such as public health preparedness [43] . Competencies known to strengthen community resilience, such as engaging vulnerable populations in planning and increasing community self-sufficiency [6] , should be targeted. Such competencies may include community outreach and engagement, decision making under uncertainty, holistic planning, and asset identification to understand what different sectors bring and build effective coalitions.

During the Roundtable discussions, participants underscored many of the challenges confronting the development of a robust workforce that can address the need for more transdisciplinary and integrated action. That is to say, actors from different disciplines need to work jointly to create new conceptual, methodological, and translational innovations that integrate and move beyond discipline-specific approaches to address a common problem [19] . Drawing upon these discussions, we set out to understand the key components that could drive the development of a resilience-oriented workforce. Previous efforts to advance workforce development (e.g., within the field of public health) have demonstrated a need for organizational structures and skill building [20, 21] , and this is particularly relevant for the field of resilience due to the myriad of disciplines involved and the emphasis on both individual and community organizing. Given this background, we aimed to answer three questions: (1) What organizational structures will support connections needed for a resilience-oriented workforce? (2) What elements of training will support resilience-oriented education? and (3) What are leadership models with a resilience orientation? This narrative review summarizes the existing literature on resilience-oriented leadership or workforce development as it relates to these three research questions to synthesize current approaches and ideas in the field and determine areas of opportunity going forward.",34.2625714587602,15.819269092540098

Instead we describe what resilience-oriented leadership looks like and elements that would be critical to include in a model, if developed.

Teams with resilience-oriented behaviors were characterized by shared organizational identity, purpose, and values; mutual support and trust; role flexibility; active problem solving; self-reflections; shared leadership; and skill building. Freedom from administrative dominance and the existence of horizontal leadership (i.e., multiple skills and leaders without a need to assert dominance) was seen as critical. At the same time, community resilience requires individuals to commit to teamwork. The same study found that trust and cooperation amongst the team facilitated resilience in disaster response. Therefore, the right balance between workforce autonomy and operation as a collective entity must be struck in any resilience workforce leadership model. Because a resilience-oriented workforce must continuously balance the decisions and tradeoffs that come from facing both acute shocks and long-term stressors and marginalization, shared organizational identity and trust are crucial. Further, resilience-oriented leadership programs must support ways to navigate intersectoral, collaborative structures, create shared metrics and accountability frameworks, and articulate a cohesive plan that integrates shocks and stressors in daily practice.",32.90199251452037,15.565740724579811

Several studies highlighted interprofessional education (IPE) programs [25, 30] . The field of resilience is clearly transdisciplinary and requires practitioners to be trained in a wide variety of areas. IPE occurs when students from two or more professions learn about, from and with each other to enable effective collaboration; it has traditionally occurred in the health professions [31] . IPE grew out of a need for a strong, flexible, and collaborative workforce to confront highly complex challenges in healthcare. The field of resilience is now facing the same types of complexities. While resilience is a broad field, requiring skills from a wide variety of professions, much of the reviewed literature on training was much more narrow in scope, such as collaborations between schools of social work and public mental health departments [30] or incorporating disaster preparedness training into health education curricula [32, 33] , in particular, for nurses [34] [35] [36] and physicians [37, 38] . IPE for the resilience-oriented workforce needs to be much more interdisciplinary than is currently in practice. For example, there is a need to integrate health sciences with urban planning and engineering education for resilience. Few models currently exist for this type of interdisciplinary educational experience. One that comes close is the framework for ""Disaster Health"" set forth by the World Association for Disaster and Emergency Medicine (WADEM) [39] . The consensus view in support of this framework resulted in a model which can facilitate the development of educational programs. The conceptual model includes the following components: primary disciplines (clinical and psychological, public health, and emergency and risk management); support disciplines (geography, engineering, anthropology); community response, resilience and communication; and socio-political context. This model may be a useful starting point for the type of IPE programs that can facilitate the development of a resilience-oriented workforce.

Both vaginal and cesarean deliveries are covered and no co-insurance is required for child delivery. The program offers patients complete freedom of choice among providers and methods of delivery. In order to contain the inpatient costs for Western medical services, the NHI program has instituted the case-payment method for 50 clearly defined medical conditions, and they include both vaginal delivery and cesarean delivery. Case payment is similar to the DRG (diagnosis-related groups) payment system in the U.S. It bundles itemized medical services essential for each condition and provides financial incentives for a more efficient delivery process. The case payment system reimburses the provider on a per-case basis, and the payment varies by accreditation level of the provider. It also assumes that the complexity or quality of care also varies by provider level. The current accreditation system categorizes medical institutions into 4 levels, from most advanced to most basic: medical center, regional hospital, district hospital, and clinic. The accreditation criteria include infrastructure, capacity, manpower, volume, management and administrative processes.

In respecting familismo, for instance, health facilities could adopt communication strategies that strengthen cross-cultural competency among critical care staff [65] . Moreover, health facilities could establish a process that gives family members a chance to confer among themselves when the patient no longer benefits from mechanical ventilation and withdrawal is called for. The emphasis within the familismo value system upon the collective and duty to the whole also provides a salient moral frame through which local authorities could communicate effectively about the need for developing and applying an allocation framework, and the importance of taking proactive measures that would help delay the implementation of an allocation framework in the first place, such as strengthening medical surge capacity.",25.520206985647306,12.197609170497644

In general, countries with higher human development exhibited longer reporting timeliness gaps. Human development is defined by a combination of health, education and economic status indicators. According to previous studies, countries with greater civil liberties tend to be more democratic societies with better economic status, more widespread education and better overall health. Within a developed society, the complex process of administration undeniably slows the standard process and operation of official organisations and systems [29, 30] . Therefore, countries with higher human development status have longer average reporting timeliness gaps. However, it is important to note that human development is not always a negative predictor of reporting timeliness. The shortest timeliness gap was found not in countries with low human development scores but rather in countries with medium human development scores. In other words, human development plays a positive role in improving reporting timeliness for countries in which development remained substandard. Relatively poor health technology or health resources in countries with low human development scores may account for this phenomenon. However, further research is needed to better understand the relationships between these factors. No significant association between timeliness gap and health workforce was found in this study. Although a curved relationship between timeliness gap and health workforce was found, no significant association between timeliness gap and health workforce was indicated in our logistic regression analysis. The significant correlation between the health workforce density and the human development index might be one explanation for this finding. In addition, this phenomenon might reflect the importance of public health efforts other than health workforce density. Although an adequate health workforce is one of the fundamental components of any public health system, there are other important factors related to reporting timeliness, such as the quality of the health workforce, the awareness of unusual diseases among the health workforce, and the overall effectiveness of the healthcare system. Therefore, the lack of a significant association between timeliness gap and health workforce density in our study may be attributed to these additional factors.",28.601435980597543,11.018125610043398

The National Strategy for Countering Biological Threats (National Security Council, 2009) seeks to facilitate a ""culture of responsibility"" through engaging the global life sciences community, encouraging: (1) sustained dialog on the development of behavioral norms; (2) the development of a code of ethics; (3) the development of training materials; and (4) efforts to explore community-based approaches www.frontiersin.org for identifying and addressing irresponsible conduct. Codes of conduct for the global sciences community are widespread. Many apply to the individual (e.g., professional oaths and codes of ethics) and workplace (e.g., recombinant DNA guidelines). Most are voluntary, have minimal penalties and/or no mechanism for ensuring compliance, and primarily rely on the ethical behavior of the individual. The scientific community is best served by a balanced approach between voluntary codes of conduct and regulations/laws that protect society from the misuse of BSATs, while not hindering legitimate biological research. Life science knowledge and technologies continues to advance at a rapid pace, which presents challenges to regulations (e.g., Select Agent Regulations) that govern pathogen security.

For example, the disease prevention and vector control response to the introduction and local spread of Zika virus infection in the United States is being blunted and hampered by congressional discord. Also, relying on legislation for emergency funds for each outbreak (rather than having a dedicated budget for preparedness and response to infectious disease outbreaks) is problematic. That said, previous zoonotic pathogen crises provide valuable insights into best practices, and herein, we detail the role of museum biorepositories in disease outbreak investigations. In addition to providing wide taxonomic sampling, museums and associated databases critically tie discoveries of new pathogens to permanent host records and samples and to a series of other informatics resources (e.g., GenBank and GIS applications) that facilitate future exploration, tracking, and mitigation of novel zoonotic pathogens.

These broad risk factors alongside limited resources have indicated the need for community-based initiatives for surveillance and interventions [6, 7] . For ARI surveillance in particular, infections in the community are those that do not get reported clinically. Clinical data generally represents the most severe cases, and those from locations with access to healthcare institutions. In Nigeria, hospitals are visited only when symptoms are very severe. Thus, it is hypothesized that viral information from clinical sampling is insufficient to either capture disease incidence in general populations or its predictability from symptoms [8] . Efforts worldwide including in East and Southern Africa have been focused on developing community-based participatory disease surveillance methods [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] .

As noted in the bottom panel of Table 3 , this criterion was defined by the (1) frequency of performance required to be effective; (2) feasibility of the behavior (e.g., single versus multiple steps, required negotiation or engagement of others); and (3) availability and accessibility of required materials (e.g., a brush to scrub a water-storage container).

Withdrawal of state subsidies may also affect smallholders (family farmers) who are tied to large agribusiness companies through contract farming (Catelo and Costales 2008) . Large companies often provide contractors with technical support and veterinary assistance; however, some may not source supply from smallholders if they can find larger producers who are able to make the necessary investments to operate profitably (Costales et al. 2006) . Under these circumstances, the burden is on the smallholders to make the investments. If they do not, they may be taken out of the market chain and potentially turn to illegal trade.

Since 1976, there have been 885,343 suspected and laboratory confirmed cases of EVD and the disease has claimed 2,512 cases and 932 fatality in West Africa. There are certain requirements that must be met when responding to EVD outbreaks and this process could incur certain challenges. For the purposes of this paper, five have been identified: (i) the deficiency in the development and implementation of surveillance response systems against Ebola and others infectious disease outbreaks in Africa; (ii) the lack of education and knowledge resulting in an EVD outbreak triggering panic, anxiety, psychosocial trauma, isolation and dignity impounding, stigmatisation, community ostracism and resistance to associated socio-ecological and public health consequences; (iii) limited financial resources, human technical capacity and weak community and national health system operational plans for prevention and control responses, practices and management; (iv) inadequate leadership and coordination; and (v) the lack of development of new strategies, tools and approaches, such as improved diagnostics and novel therapies including vaccines which can assist in preventing, controlling and containing Ebola outbreaks as well as the spread of the disease. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop and implement an active early warning alert and surveillance response system for outbreak response and control of emerging infectious diseases. Understanding the unending risks of transmission dynamics and resurgence is essential in implementing rapid effective response interventions tailored to specific local settings and contexts. Therefore, the following actions are recommended: (i) national and regional inter-sectorial and trans-disciplinary surveillance response systems that include early warnings, as well as critical human resources development, must be quickly adopted by allied ministries and organisations in African countries in epidemic and pandemic responses; (ii) harnessing all stakeholders commitment and advocacy in sustained funding, collaboration, communication and networking including community participation to enhance a coordinated responses, as well as tracking and prompt case management to combat challenges; (iii) more research and development in new drug discovery and vaccines; and (iv) understanding the involvement of global health to promote the establishment of public health surveillance response systems with functions of early warning, as well as monitoring and evaluation in upholding research-action programmes and innovative interventions.",27.816358479761593,13.409696989770959

The later the first detection occurs, the more critical it becomes to deliver the intervention rapidly. When the first detection is the fifth actual case (""FD = 5"") a delay of 4 weeks before burial practices are changed reduces the likelihood of control from 89% to 78%, but when the first detection is the twenty-fifth actual case (""FD = 25"") a delay of 4 weeks before burial practices are changed reduces this from 45% to 23%. Starting with a baseline case ascertainment of 80% and a small health care system (0.1% of population are HCWs, 1:15 and 1:50 ratio of bed and contact-tracing capacities to HCWs, as above), this figure shows the effect of doubling both the health care capacity and the health care workforce at different times after the first detected case. This increase in capacity represents the transition from a small health care system to a medium health care system, as defined in Fig 5. This clearly shows the importance of early detection; the time delay in delivering the additional capacity is less important over this timescale of 0-8 weeks, because the existing health care system is capable of accommodating patients in the early stage of the outbreak. As expected, reducing the force of infection from both dead bodies and from infectious individuals in the community has a dramatic effect on disease transmission and substantially increases the likelihood of control (Fig 9) . However, even the impact of this intervention is substantially reduced by late detection and delayed delivery. ",26.67243589679044,12.26726331116631

A CHW has been defined as any health worker carrying out duties related to delivering health care, trained in some way in the context of their work, and having no formal professional training [12] . CHWs have increasingly become part of healthcare systems in most developing countries due to limited numbers of formally trained professional health workers, and are recognized as being the cornerstone in the system in order to deliver strong primary care particularly in rural communities.

In his model, the demand is deterministic. However, a typical supply chain frequently faces disruptions caused by internal or external factors including demand fluctuations (new orders, order cancellations), raw material shortages, delivery delays due to transportation problems or inclement weather (such as storm, heavy fog), resource unavailability, natural disasters, etc. The supply chain disruption management is a new and interesting field. Qi et al. (2004) considered the coordination of a supply chain with one supplier and one retailer under demand disruptions. In their model, the demand disruptions incur a penalty to the supplier. Xia et al. (2004b) considered disruption management for a twostage production and inventory system. Xia et al. (2004a) introduced a production and inventory management model with raw material supply disruptions. considered the coordination of a supply chain with one manufacturer and two competing retailers when the demand is disrupted. Huntington (2003) studied the effect of energy disruptions on the decision-making of firms and aggregate economy. In addition to the disruption caused by accidental events, strategic disruption is often used by some firms. Strategic disruption refers to a firmÕs intentional manipulation of its competitorÕs transaction cost structure in an attempt to weaken the competitorÕs alignment of its governance structure. Averyt and Ramagopal (1999) used the auto industry as a case to examine the policy of strategic disruption pursued by American producers against Japanese competitors since the 1980s. In their model, a firm destroys its competitorÕs alignment of transactions and governance structures but leaves the firmÕs own alignment relatively unchanged through altering governance rules. Thus, its competitorÕs cost increases. In 1992, the United States and Japan signed the ÔGlobal Partnership Plan of ActionÕ, which is a strategic disruption management policy of breaking the established ties between Japanese auto producers and Japanese parts suppliers (Lewis and Weiler, 1996) . To our best knowledge, an evolutionary perspective on the effect of disruptions on a supply chain has not yet been studied in the literature. This paper will study the effect of the supply chain disruptions including the raw material supply and demand disruptions on the retailersÕ strategies by employing an indirect evolutionary game model. We neglect the penalty cost incurred by the supply chain disruptions when we consider the long-term equilibrium because the manufacturers will adjust their production scales and plans rapidly. In Section 6, we will also consider the case with a penalty cost. We will illustrate our findings using a numerical simulation.",39.33664699889988,16.62355951045175

This allows resources to be used more efficiently and allows less skilled health care workers working in expanded roles to function safely and effectively. A 50% increase in the critical care human resources capacity could be obtained by supplementing experienced ICU staff with non-ICU staff in care-teams.

The basis for current governmental and humanitarian responses to nutritional crises builds on lessons learned in the earliest organized relief efforts (circa 1940-1950) . During the 1970s, guidelines began to be published following experiences with relief efforts in places like Biafra and Ethiopia (2). In the subsequent decades, the experiences of various crises have progressively shaped what are, today, the characteristic challenges, and avenues of support available to older adults who are caught in CE situations in any given country. With increasing recognition that the elderly are uniquely vulnerable to CEs, efforts are underway to develop specific recommendations and resources for this population group. Table 29 .5 lists some of the resources available, along with web links. HelpAge International (www.helpage.org) is a global network of more than 70 not-for-profit organizations in 50 countries who are working for improvements in the lives of older people.

The Sphere Project Minimum Standards in Disaster Response project (http://www. sphereproject.org/content/view/27/84) advocates for the use of community-based systems to implement the care of older individuals in these circumstances. In the United States, a number of national organizations, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), The American Red Cross, and various branches of the military take responsibility for rescue and relief efforts following a major CE but the contribution of the private sector to the relief effort is traditionally also a substantial one.

An ongoing evaluation and revision process incorporates instructor observations, student feedback, and student evaluation. Wolf (2008) found that simulation-based learning in the health professions has proven to be an effective way to integrate didactic and clinical material, particularly in settings and for situations that students are unlikely to encounter during clinical placements. Ensuring that nursing students are prepared to assist in public health emergencies, such as rapid-onset infectious disease outbreaks, is a high priority. This was made very clear to us in fall 2014 when we ran the simulation at the height of the West Africa Ebola outbreak. Indeed, one of the major challenges to containing the Ebola outbreak was lack of sufficient training in outbreak investigation, including contact tracing and public health communication (Summers, Nyenswah, Montgomery, Neatherlin, & Tappero, 2014) dtwo skills that are central to this simulation providing an opportunity for nursing students to learn these skills in a simulated environment is an appropriate and effective way to build the public health nursing workforce and enhance the capacity of all nurses to provide care to communities in crisis.

This conceptualization was articulated clearly by Hick and colleagues , who defined surge capacity as ""the ability to manage a sudden, unexpected increase in patient volume that would otherwise severely challenge or exceed the present capacity"" (Hick et al. 2004, 1) of either an individual facility or the wider health care system ). This latter point demonstrates another common variation in published definitions, related to the site(s) at which ""surge capacity"" is deemed applicable. There is also variation in the unit of analysis employed by different studies. While some authors limit the concept to the individual facility 5 or single department (usually the emergency department or ICU), 6 the importance of embedding facilities within the wider health system's context is increasingly stressed. 7 Two broad applications are apparent, consistent with the priorities and objectives of the agencies involved. The first entails the concept's increasing occurrence in international guidelines and best practices. An early example of this is the United Kingdom's Department of Health's published guidelines on pandemic management (DoH 2009). Its approach is consistent with that advocated by Kelen and colleagues, which we discuss in some detail later. In its publication Hospital Emergency Response Checklist: An All-Hazards Tool for Hospital Administrators and Emergency Managers, the World Health Organization (WHO) took the lead in promoting ""surge capacity"" as a component of international good practice (2011b). This report advocates surge capacity as one of nine ""key components"" of health systems' disaster readiness (the remaining eight are command and control, communication, safety and security, triage, continuity of essential services, human resources, logistics and supply management, and postdisaster recovery). ""Surge capacity"" is broken down into thirteen key sites of action, centered on calculating baseline resources, estimating surge requirements, and identifying gaps to be addressed. It follows the academic literature's emphasis on the ""four S's"" of surge capacity (staff, stuff, structure, and systems) and, while concentrating on the facility level, notes the need to attend to the potential to mobilize extrinsic resources in line with the wider health systems approach. The WHO draws explicitly on the 2009 pandemic guidance (DoH 2009) issued by the United Kingdom's Department of Health. The second, and more common, use of the term (without the ""health systems'"" prefix) is in its application to the ability of humanitarian and aid agencies to scale up their own operational capacity in response to sudden-onset needs (Emmens and Houghton 2008; Houghton and Emmens 2007) .",34.657368992892145,15.63756525247746

Therefore, a fall in demand of goods and services is likely to bring about a fall in the supply of such goods and services. Also, the loss of consumer and business confidence would reduce the level of aggregate demand. These effects were observed as the manufacturing industry experienced supply chain disruptions as the Singaporean economy and employment market continued to weaken. Singapore was taken off the WHO's list of SARS affected countries on 31st May 2003-one of the first countries to be removed from the list. With the ""fear-factor"" managed, normal daily activities slowly resumed. SARS affected industries and sectors started to show signs of recovery towards the end of the second quarter in 2003. A more comprehensive analysis of the economic costs of SARS will need to consider the direct impact on consumer spending and indirect repercussions of the shock on trade and investment (Asian Development Bank Outlook 2003). The economic costs from a global disease, such as SARS, go beyond the immediate impacts incurred in the affected sectors of disease-inflicted countries. This is not just because the disease spreads quickly across countries through networks related to global travel, but also because any economic shocks to one country spread quickly to other countries through the increased trade and financial linkages associated with globalization. However, just calculating the number of cancelled tourist trips, the declines in retail trade, and some of the factors discussed earlier do not provide a complete picture of the impact of SARS. This is because there are close linkages within economies, across sectors, and across economies in both international trade and international capital flows. Thus, analyzing the tourism sector alone may not be sufficient in analyzing the overall financial impact of SARS. SARS inflicted a heavy toll on businesses and immediately impacted severely the viability of business. Businesses lost employees for long periods of time due to factors such as illness, the need to care for family members and fear of infection at work, or retrenchment. As the workforce shrunk due to absenteeism, business operations, for example supply chain, flow of goods worldwide and provision of services, were all affected both locally and internationally. In terms of retrenchment, the job prospects of employees in affected companies appeared miserable. A survey performed during the SARS period showed that the jobless rate increased more than 5.5 %, the highest for the last decade in Singapore (Ministry of Manpower, Singapore 2003) . In absolute numbers, overall employment diminished by 25,963 in the second quarter of 2003, the largest quarterly decline since the mid-1980s recession. Unlike previous retrenchment that affected mainly blue-collar labor, SARS also affected whitecollar employees too. The implementation of workplace SARS control measures added to operational and administrative costs. For example, the policy of temperature taking was implemented at workplaces in the private sector. Numerous private establishments installed thermal-scanners in their entrances from day one. However, such precautionary measures were necessary to contain the disease. This helped to restore business confidence and investment potential (a lower level of investments will lead to slower capital growth). But the reduction in an economy's capacity may linger on for a few quarters before it is restored to pre-SARS levels. The loss of productive working days from quarantine, and implementation costs incurred to monitor movements of employees contributed to the reduction in the aggregate supply front. Some of these economic effects may have worsened the public health situation if strategic planning was not in place.",27.721380374118876,12.250611807356098

A guiding principle for development of the tiers is that the provision of usual critical care, when able to meet demand, is always a preferred approach. When it becomes apparent that the risk for harm to all critically ill patients has exceeded baseline, response in isolation is discouraged, and attempts to muster additional resources must be undertaken. Barbera and Macintyre 19 proposed six layers of ""health and medical response management across intergovernmental and public-private divides"": (1) individual hospital, (2) health-care coalition, (3) local jurisdiction, (4) state response, (5) interstate regional response, and (6) federal responses. When it is determined that activities of a given layer remain insufficient to reduce the risk to critically ill patients, then assistance from the next layer should be requested. For everyday care, variation from best-care practices is undesirable and not deliberately permitted (tier 0). During small critical care expansions (eg, boarding critically ill patients in postanesthesia care units and EDs), most if not all usual critical care practices remain intact; and at most minor departures from best-care processes may occur (eg, frequency of patient turning may decrease). This is tier 1, and it occurs frequently during multiple casualty events 44 as well as periodically in many US communities as a result of occasional small surges in critical illness in the community. This does not represent EMCC, and expectations of high-intensity resource commitment for patient needs persist. It is not uncommon when EDs or ICUs are over capacity for other departments in the same hospital to be unaware of the ongoing crisis. When crucial patient care functions are at risk, an individual hospital may recover rapidly by declaring an intrafacility disaster and activating its hospital command center 43 to mobilize adequate space and supplies and necessitating adaptive critical care strategies for a short-term period (hours) [see Summary of Suggestions from the Task Force for Mass Critical Care Summit, Fig 1, 2] .",30.972588234315907,15.09629088700782

These included lack of needed resources, limited organisational authority of hospital infection control departments, and ineffective use of data monitoring and feedback to motivate improvements.

Under this system, the majority of clinical revenue generated by ID physicians derives from evaluation and management services rendered directly to patients. Although evaluation and management services are valued on a relative scale through the American Medical Association's Current Procedural Technology code book and resource-based relative value scale process, the ultimate value of the relative value units of these services is far less than the values of many procedural services, which account for the higher cost of equipment and other resources required to provide procedural services. CAC members have represented the IDSA in this process for well over a decade and, together with other cognitive specialties, have been able to achieve some gains in evaluation and management services payment, along with payment for physician supervision of OPAT services delivered in an office setting; however, these do not address the underrecognition of the ID physicians' value to their healthcare systems in the delivery of high-quality value-based care. Moreover, given the implementation of bundled payments, it is unclear how physician services that fall within the bundle will be paid out in the future, thereby placing more importance on highlighting the value that ID physicians provide to the system. To that end, the CAC has developed the concept of ID-focused hospital efficiency improvement plans (HEIPs) in the areas of infection prevention, antimicrobial stewardship, OPAT, and biopreparedness/emerging infections. ID-focused HEIPs treat such programs as hospital service lines, much like a hospital may treat orthopedic or cardiology service lines. ID-focused HEIPs position ID physicians as accountable, strategic physician executives who lead key facility/system-wide service lines that promote efficient, appropriate use of resources and mitigate the risk of HAI-related complications. The ID physician executive develops the overall plan that aligns with the overall facility or system strategic plan. Hospitals view the compensation arrangement for physician executives differently than they would for medical directors. Accordingly, the ID physician, as a medical executive HEIP leader, may be offered higher compensation than that associated with a traditional medical directorship. In addition, goals (in the form of targets such as reduced HAI rates and decreased antimicrobial use) can be set on the basis of the program's quality metric targets, for which shared savings can be distributed to the HEIP under the safe harbor of accountable care organizations and newer alternative payment models detailed in the Medicare Payment and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 [31] . Further defining the value of an ID physician that combines both administrative and clinical care is one of the CAC's goals and is an ongoing, fluid process. The CAC continues to develop resources, including detailed HEIP business plans and sample comanagement agreements, providing guidance for establishing ID-focused HEIPs that are accessible to IDSA members in the ID Physician Leadership of Population Health Services section of the IDSA website (available at: http://www.idsociety.org/uploaded-Files/IDSA/Manage_Your_Practice/ID_Physician_Leadership_ of_Population_Health_Services/ID_HEIP_Concept_Final.pdf). The shift from volume-based to value-based payment for services changes the parameters of healthcare reimbursement to a system structure in which the ID physician is uniquely trained and qualified to succeed. Given the substantial impact that government regulatory initiatives can have on these activities, CAC members and IDSA leadership continue to actively advocate for appropriate government regulatory oversight with the CMS and on Capitol Hill.",29.13301520268395,14.23596688362058

As at 2010, a worldwide contraceptive prevalence of 63.3% and an unmet need for family planning of 12.3% was reported among women aged 15e49 years who were married or in a union [17] . By 2015, the global contraceptive prevalence had marginally increased to 63.6%, while the unmet need for family planning dropped to 11.9% [18] . Unmet need is especially higher among adolescents, migrants, urban slum dwellers, refugees and women in the postpartum period. These less than desirable statistics on family planning, the projected growth in the number of contraceptive users worldwide worsened by severe shortages in skilled providers, has catalyzed the need for increased investments and more innovative solutions to address the gaps, with m-Health offering promising results in this regard. The adoption of m-Health technologies in providing the information that couples need to make informed family planning decisions or address their concerns regarding same, has been largely successful [19] . For example, the United Nations foundation-funded Mobile for Reproductive Health (m4RH) [20] and Mobile Alliance for Maternal Action (MAMA) [15] projects provide evidence-based results in this area.

What is needed is an understanding of the administrative and resource barriers, the high risk work procedures, and available training which can affect the organization and design of work in the health care setting. In addition, a better surveillance system for Thai HCWs' occupational illnesses and injuries would provide data to motivate changes in prevention and compensation systems.

It is always best to take measures beforehand to minimize property damage and prevent injury and death. In the case of hospitals, some preliminary research indicates that four factors affect an institution's motivation to mitigate: influence of legislation and regulation, economic considerations, the role of ""champions"" within the institution, and the impact of disasters and imminent threats on agenda-setting and policy making. It was discovered during this research that ""mitigation measures were found to be most common when proactive mitigation measures were mandated by regulatory agencies and legislation."" 55 Tax incentives, government assistance grants, and building code and insurance requirements may also serve to motivate administrators and decision makers to put the necessary time and effort into mitigation planning. 30 The Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP), designed to provide leadership and funding through grants to and cooperative agreements with states, territories, and eligible municipalities to improve surge capacity and enhance community and hospital preparedness for public health emergencies, 52 has undergone significant cuts over the past few years that threaten to undo progress made in the last decade. HPP appropriations have decreased from $426 million in FY2010 to $255 million in FY2014, including a one-third cut in the FY2014 omnibus. 56 HPP provides financial incentives to ensure that hospitals are able to coordinate, cooperate, and reduce loss of life during an emergency. The program allowed the coalition in Boston to practice two 24-hour disaster simulations involving several area hospitals before the 2013 Boston Marathon Bombing. The planning and efficiency of the hospitals after the attack were major factors in saving the lives of the 264 individuals injured in the bombings, and there were no additional deaths after the three on-site fatalities. 57 The loss of an estimated 46,000 state and local public health jobs since 2008 58 also has the potential to damage the progress made in all-hazards preparedness since 9/11. With little prospect of increased national funding in the immediate future, it is necessary for local communities to develop sustainability strategies to ensure every dollar is well spent in helping their communities prepare for disasters. 59 The CDC Capability 10: Medical Surge publication encourages the widespread collaboration and allocation of resources in community-wide surge capacity efforts and has been helpful in focusing these efforts in a realistic and operational manner. 60 ",26.94271913510946,12.277962344585216

A good example of this is a speech from the 1991 movie, which was based on a play, called Other People's Money. A character in that movie, Larry the Liquidator, is a corporate raider seeking to convince the shareholders of a company, New England Cable and Wireless, about the dangers of holding on too tightly to old practices.

The petrochemical industry and green Olympic Games were also derived from water environmental and resources stresses. Timing of the forcing is critical as well. Public policy, water environmental stress and water resources stress is the general forcing which continuously impact MBR applications and will continue to be the driving forces. It should be noted advantage of MBR has been discussed in previous section. It also interacts with every other driving force to affect MBR applications and thus is not discussed separately. The public health concerns caused by the SARS event in 2003 warranted better treatment of hospital wastewater which was a potential field for commercial MBR applications. The petrochemical industry need and green Olympic Games each increased the MBR application capacity by roughly a magnitude. Public policy, water environment and water resources stress drive the magnitude of MBR applications up to one more magnitude. The five driving forces are discussed in detail in this section, sequentially. which promote environment protection and resources conservation practices. Appendix A provides a list of national plans and policies that has promoted MBR applications in the last decade. According to the Water Pollution Prevention and Control Plan, the wastewater reclamation rate in China should reach 20% by 2020, which provided a great opportunity for MBR technology to be widely used in the upgrading WWTPs due to MBR's distinct technical advantages of high treatment efficiency (Zheng et al., 2016) . Additionally, the development of membrane materials has been outlined in the 12th National Five-Year Plan (2011 to 2015), such as Strategy of Accelerating Cultivation and Development of Emerging Strategic Industries, from both aspects of environmental protection and technological development. These national policies provided enormous opportunity for MBR applications (Huang et al., 2010; Abass et al., 2015; Xiao et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2013) . In general, public policy in China increase the demand on MBR application as it often Table 1 Representative MBR applications in hospitals promotes wastewater treatment and reclamation. Public policy also promotes the supply of MBR as it incentivizes the development of MBR technology and applications. The SARS event increased public awareness of public health concern and lead Chinese government to tighten regulation on hospital sewage which contains many pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, etc. . Therefore, the demand on advanced technology to treat hospital sewage is increasing. In addition, as large hospitals in China are often located in the city centers, where land prices and office rentals are prohibitively high, the ideal hospital sewage treatment systems should use minimal land and space. Generally, hospital wastewater is treated with primary treatment and disinfection process (often by chlorine, ozone and ultraviolet light) and infectious hospitals must use secondary treatment . MBR is an efficient technology in removing pathogenic microorganism. Its low SS of effluent is helpful to improve the efficiency of disinfection processes, minimize disinfectant, and reduce disinfection by-products (Zheng and Liu, 2007; Zheng et al., 2005) . It improves disinfection effects and reduces the toxicity of effluent. In addition, it does not require secondary sedimentation tank and thus reduce land and space usage for wastewater treatment, which made it an ideal potential technology for treating hospital wastewater (Lv et al., 2006) .

Caroll and Sikich (1999) argued that keeping track of at least a 3-year history of labour costs would serve to identify the dollar value of "" premium "" labour-related costs, which could be thought of as all labour/benefit costs above federally mandated minimum wage. Other techniques proposed by the authors were (1) to design a scoring system that illustrates productivity versus both baseline and premium labour/benefit costs by departments, and (2) to establish metrics to determine a productivity level for guest experience standards, facilities standards, and targeted revenue improvements on a department-by-department basis. Bloxham (2003) advocated adjustments to certain human resource expenditures to capitalize them over the time of the investment. In that approach, one-time human resources costs are amortized and capitalized in the value creation equation in an effort to demonstrate that human capital investments go beyond being a cost item in the firms ' operations. These costs can include recruiting, interviewing, and hiring costs; one-time hiring bonuses and relocation expenses; and training costs. The costs are capitalized and amortized over the average employee tenure with the company. In this case, if employee turnover is high, these costs would be amortized over a shorter time period (thus the costs will be higher), whereas the longer tenure of the workforce will enable the firm to spread the costs over a longer period of time. Kalafut and Low (2001) reported that in a study of the airline industry conducted by Cap Gemini Ernst & Young's Center for Business Innovation (CBI), the employee category was the single greatest value driver that had an impact on the firm's market value. The employee factor had a positive correlation of 0.68 with the firm value. Thus, Kalafut and Low (2001) conclude that in the aggregate, quality and the talent of the workforce, quality of labour management relations, and diversity are critically important in the value creation process of the airline companies.",24.919051746666018,11.984299265393469

In retrospect, improving access to CATH services in our centre was reactive to the increasing need of the community rather than based on anticipation of need and continuity of service within RMWTs. Still, it may be difficult to know whether emerging technologies, such as cardiac computed tomography, will divert diagnostic cases away from the catheterization laboratory [20] , or if the use of this or other modalities will result in more referrals to the catheterization laboratory for purposes of clarification or intervention. In addition, further investigation may be needed to ascertain the impact clinical studies (e.g. COURAGE [21] ) on disease management. In light of our experience over the last decade, it is recommended that governments work with researchers, cardiac service providers, and biotechnology/pharmaceutical industry representatives in order to plan for maintaining and improving access to CATH where needed rather than appropriating resources where service is failing to meet demand. It is also recommended that centres develop registries to provide a means of both monitoring changes in access and evaluating the effectiveness of strategies designed to improve timely access.",28.461446686609555,12.940223691273122

Specifically, one of the major limitations to the prosperity of air travel today is the ongoing regulatory regime that restricts and controls the airport and air traffic management capacities. Separation of powers is necessary in both arenas in order to prevent either elements from reregulating airlines. The airports, whether private corporations or public entities, need to be separated from political pressures defining slot or gate allocations and the civil aviation authorities, who set the air traffic management levels, need to be separated from the body that operates the system. Market distortions, limitations and inefficiencies will thus be removed.

Directly, certain basic resources are necessary for the maintenance of body functions. Access to a sufficient quantity and quality of food is essential for proper nutrition. Malnutrition and undernutrition have severe consequences for growth and development of children (de Onis, Monteiro, Akre, & Glugston, 1993; Stevenson, Latham, & Ottesen, 2000; Weinreb et al., 2002) , as well as for the functioning of the immune system and prevention of disease (Cunningham-Rundles, McNeeley, & Moon, 2005) . Adequate nutrition requires either enough arable land for local food production or access to markets with imported food and income with which to purchase the food. Not only are the absolute quantities and costs of these resources in a community important, but the distribution of these resources also contributes to shaping health outcomes. For example, the availability and cost of fresh fruits and vegetables and the spatial patterns of supermarkets are strongly linked to the income and racial characteristics of neighborhoods in Detroit (Zenk et al., 2005; Zenk et al., 2006) Similarly, the quantity and quality of a community's water supply is an important determinant of people's health (United Nations, 2005) . Insufficient water sources may lead to insufficient food supplies due to lack of irrigation of crops. The economies of developing countries are highly dependent on agriculture, which generates 80% of export earnings; however, this important source of income requires almost 70% of the world's freshwater use (United Nations, 2005) . In communities where potable water sources are far from residences, considerable time and energy is expended supplying households with water (Cosgrove & Rijsberman, 1998) .",23.357234487820364,12.739041856389287

We may use community mortality rates due to diarrheal disease caused by unclean water sources to examine how population movement may influence one particular health indicator. In order to understand the causes of high rates of deaths due to diarrhea in a community we have to consider communitylevel factors that have been shown to be important predictors, such as the age distribution of the population, local environmental conditions (sanitation), breastfeeding practices, malnutrition, personal hygiene and access to medical supplies and services (such as oral rehydration solutions, ORS) (Feachem, 1984; Kosek, Bern, & Guerrant, 2003; VanDerslice, Popkin, & Briscoe, 1994) . Limiting our study to community-level factors may be misleading, however. By including national-level variables, we might find that although community hygiene practices significantly predict diarrheal mortality rates at the community level, when we take national population densities into account, hygiene practices are no longer predictive. This might be because personal hygiene is associated with protection from infectious diarrhea-causing agents in countries with low population densities where these behaviors are mostly sufficient to protect against disease. In highly populated countries these behaviors may not be sufficient to provide protection (maybe due to high contact rates with the infectious agents). For example, high regional population densities have been found to be associated with greater child mortality rates in Zimbabwe (Root, 1997) and to be predictive of cholera outbreaks in Bangladesh (Myaux, Ali, Felsenstein, Chakraborty, & de Francisco, 1997) . Global factors may be essential in understanding and predicting the pathway between national population densities, community hygiene and population diarrheal mortality rates. National population densities may be highly dependent on global migration patterns and not just on domestic fertility rates as is the case in the United States, France and Germany (Cohen, 2003) . This example demonstrates how our understanding of the underlying causality of health outcomes is improved by widening the scope of study to include the global context.",21.832071614731255,11.267383982106164

This overuse does not reduce psychological penalty cost significantly, and it also does not affect building and transportation costs significantly. (4) Expanding the limits of resources (e.g., mental health workers, reserved resettlement resources and replenishment capability for resettlements) can affect psychological intervention cost and psychological penalty cost considerably. And the expansion itself may have a high cost because the probability of disaster occurrences is in fact low. Therefore, the increase in replenishment capability is practical for critical relief resources. (5) Although the unit cost of building a shelter affects building cost directly, it affects psychological intervention cost more, and also affects psychological penalty cost. Therefore, controlling unit building cost for temporary shelters contributes markedly to cost reductions related to victim psychology. Increasing the supply of shelters by emergency supply chain management and logistics is important to post-disaster psychological relief. (6) In comparing to psychological intervention cost and building cost, the ratio of transportation cost to the overall monetary cost is small. Although the ratios affect solutions, they can be neglected. However, when disasters such as earthquakes and landslides occur, road damage may increase transportation costs and evacuation difficulties. (7) Psychological intervention cost is the cost affected most by the initial resettlement capacity because infective people can be accommodated quickly after a disaster. Then, the psychological penalty cost and building cost can be markedly reduced. Therefore, improving the stock of temporary shelters or providing alternatives can reduce psychological and monetary costs significantly. (8) By the Pareto analytical tool, the tradeoffs between psychological penalty cost and monetary cost can be examined. In the experiments, a small increase to monetary cost (37.5%) can cause psychological penalty cost to decrease significantly (80%). Therefore, when the budget allows, psychological penalty perceived by victims can be minimized. By extending the proposed methods, the tradeoffs among four costs are revealed. (9) The magnitude of psychological penalty cost induced by wait times directly affects total psychological penalty cost. However, this magnitude cannot be determined directly according to disaster type or other simple quantification methods. It is affected by the extent of damage, disaster severity, and post-disaster natural and social environments. Therefore, minimizing the strength of panic and panic spread is important for evacuation and resettlement, and the recovery of disaster areas.

First, priority setting is necessitated, and is an attempt to solve the fundamental economic problem of scarcity and choice. 45, 50 Frameworks for priority setting practice, and indeed their evaluation should therefore consider how best to achieve health system goals, given scarce resources. 45 This essentially entails making choices such that desired outputs are maximized within the available resources. The choice of economic tools for priority setting is, however, dependent on, among others, the level of priority setting activity. For example, while CEA is more feasible at the national level, it might not be practical at the regional or hospital level. Challenges would include the limited technical capacity and availability of data required for these analyses. 45 It is perhaps more feasible to use methods such as considering affordability alongside effectiveness and the budget impact of choices at lower levels of the health system (such as hospitals). Second, the goal of maximizing desired outcomes must be traded-off against equity. Priority setting exercises in healthcare organizations should aim at achieving an appropriate balance between maximizing intended outcomes for a given resource level while considering equity. 14, 45 To achieve equity, the distribution of resources should be determined by needs rather than other factors such as ability to pay, favouritism or political consideration. Further, resource allocation should demonstrate a special concern for the worse off. 14 The worse off can either be patient groups in a worse medical condition right now (eg, medical emergencies), or, alternatively, the ones whose complete life in terms of health will be worse if not treated now. The worse off should also include vulnerable patient groups. Vulnerability is often context dependent but could include groups such as the disabled, the elderly, children and women.

Given that priority setting is a complex and value laden process, consensus on rational rules has been problematic. 2 Despite this, allocative efficiency and equity feature prominently in normative literature as being relevant in the distribution of scarce healthcare resources. 14, 15 Allocative efficiency is achieved when resources are allocated so as to maximize the welfare of the community. 16 Two main tools have been used to allocate resources-based on economic criteria. [45] [46] [47] The first, cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) (which in this review shall subsequently be used to refer to both costutility and cost-effectiveness analyses as is common practice in literature) has been used to allocate resources in both developing and developed countries. 48 The second economic tool is programme budgeting and marginal analysis (PBMA), a systematic priority setting framework that aims to help decision-makers to identify the most efficient use of available resources while taking into consideration the opportunity costs of choices. 49, 50 However, the employment of allocative efficiency as the sole principle for priority setting could result in undesired outcomes. 45, 51 For example, allocatively efficient decisions would result in the treatment of the elderly having less preference because of their lower life-expectancy or the disabled given less preference because they have a lower capacity to benefit from treatment. Further, the current methods used to assess efficiency in healthcare resource allocation, such as CEA, employ simple aggregative algorithms that can result in undesired outcomes. 14, 45 The pitfalls of such aggregation rules are best exemplified by the case of the initial ranking lists of the Oregon Health Services Commission where tooth capping was found to be more cost effective than appendectomy, and was therefore given higher priority. 51 There is significant consensus therefore that while maximizing outcomes is an important concern in allocating resources, it is also important that scarce resources are distributed equitably. 14, 45 There is no consensus in literature however on the conceptualization of equity in allocation of healthcare resources. There is, however, general agreement that, in publicly-funded healthcare systems, individuals or groups of individuals (patient groups) should make healthcare payments based on their ability to pay and receive healthcare benefits based on their healthcare needs. 52 Norheim and colleagues 14 have also proposed that resource allocation practices in healthcare should have a special concern for the worst off and should not be based on simple aggregation rules. The prominence given to allocative efficiency and equity in normative literature on consequential principles of priority setting is however not reflected in empirical literature. Of the 31 papers in the first set of literature, only 2 prescribed the use of efficiency, while none prescribed the use of equity as a principle for the evaluation of priority setting. Of the two that prescribed the use of efficiency, none conceptualized it as allocative efficiency. Further, a range of outcome measures were used to evaluate priority setting process across different settings. The most commonly proposed outcomes (or consequences) of healthcare priority setting in the first set of reviewed literature are stakeholder satisfaction with the process, improvement in stakeholder understanding of the process, and that priority setting exercises result in reallocation (shifting) of resources ( Table 3 ). The first two underline the recognition of the importance of stakeholders to not only accept or approve the adopted priority setting process, but also understand it. The requirement for the shifting of resources in essence means that priority setting procedures should be responsive to the dynamic environment of changing healthcare needs rather than perpetrate static historic considerations. It has also been proposed that priority setting procedures should reflect public values and/or gain public acceptance. 6, 24 Other priority setting outcomes that have been used to assess healthcare priority setting practices are the extent to which they further the achievement of the goals of the healthcare organization, 39 the extent to which decisions are implemented, 39 the extent to which decisions are based on evidence, 6 improvements in decision-making quality and health outcomes. 6, 7, 36 Procedural Measures of Priority Setting Of the 31 papers selected in the first set of literature, 30 prescribe a range of procedural conditions for evaluation of priority setting practices. Based on these papers and on the broader literature selected in the second set of literature, procedural conditions that have received significant attention both in theory and practice include wider stakeholder engagement, empowerment of stakeholders, provisions for revisions of decisions, transparency of procedures, the use of relevant criteria, and the use of good quality evidence/ information (Table 3 ). Other aspects of procedures that have been considered important include consistency in decision-making and enforcement of decisions. Even though some of these procedural measures appear to overlap with consequentialist rules, the distinction lies in where value is attached: procedural approaches value procedures as an end in itself, while consequentialist approaches value procedures to the extent that they are instrumental in achieving desired outcomes. Procedural approaches to priority setting have drawn significantly from principles of deliberative democracy and are aimed at achieving procedural fairness. Deliberative democracy is a type of democracy where deliberation is central to decision-making. 53 This differs from aggregative democracy where voting is key. Both theoretical and empirical literature on priority setting processes reveals an emphasis on deliberation and public 54 Habermas argues for free and un-coerced discussions among all stakeholders in collaborative decision-making processes. Habermas specifies four conditions to be met for the ideal speech situation to be achieved namely (1) That each subject should be allowed to participate in deliberation, (2) Each subject should be allowed to question presented proposals, (3) Each subject should be allowed to introduce their proposal into the deliberations, and (4) Each subject should be allowed to express their wishes, needs and attitudes. 54 Building on Habermas's concepts, Renn and Webler developed an evaluative framework for deliberative processes that is grounded on a normative theory of public participation. 55, 56 In their evaluative framework, Renn and Webler propose that deliberative processes should be judged on 2 meta-principles namely fairness and competence. 56 The fairness principle is met if all stakeholders are provided with equal opportunities to engage and contribute to deliberations. 56 These aspects include developing procedural rules, agenda setting, selecting the information and expertise that will be used in decisionmaking and assessing the validity of information. 56 The competence principle is met if the right understanding and knowledge of the issues is achieved by the use and appropriate interpretation of information. 56 The importance of access and use of quality information and evidence is therefore important. More recently, the Renn and Webler framework together with later work by Beierle, 57 was adopted by Abelson and colleagues 58 to develop an evaluative framework for deliberative processes, that is comprised of three key procedural components namely: (1) the structure of the procedures (reasonable, legitimate, fair and responsive), (2) representation, and (3) the use of information.",31.76434959810029,14.994030762159502

Measures such as the achievement of health system/organizational goals and improvement of health outcomes cannot be easily attributed to specified priority setting activities except perhaps over the long run. Such measures would pose significant measurement challenges when adopted as measures for priority setting success. There is therefore a need for intermediate measures of outcomes that can be easily attributed to specified priority setting activities.

Fourthly, there is a need for a clearly articulated occupational development path for workforce development, including education, definition of job role, promotion, assessment standard and in-job training. Components of the occupational development path should be closely linked. In this study, only 39.3% of respondents reported they had a clear occupational development path. Finally, the score for job satisfaction showed significant differences between levels of CDC, job role and educational level, which indicates that the concerns of provincial CDC staff, general staff and staff in lower positions need to be addressed. These issues should be addressed using a hierarchical model. Organization and individual are the main factors that influence these issues.

Although it seems that we have a good understanding of what specific elements contribute to the safety climate, no studies have attempted to implement measures to try to improve a safety climate where a poor climate exists. The study cited above recommended that safety climate surveys sponsored jointly by the infection control and occupational health and safety committees should be administered in hospitals using the safety climate scale. 23 The authors made several suggestions as to how they could be used. None of the recommendations, however, have been evaluated in terms of their ability to improve worker safety, once applied. Another challenge to improving safety climates in hospitals comes with the recent emphasis on downsizing organizations and outsourcing of the workforce. Studies in the United States have shown that hospital-based HCWs are having to work faster and harder than ever in an environment of higher patient acuity and increased patient turnover and with less time for training and education. [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] This is likely happening in Canada, and other countries, as well.

However, with the anticipation of large volumes of critically ill patients in future disasters, some believe that hospital capacity, and in particular critical care capability, will be a major limiting factor for survival. 15, 19 Numerous authorities have forecast scenarios that will result in large numbers of critically ill and injured casualties.

As a result, there are limited areas in which critical care can be provided on a routine basis outside of current critical care areas (ICU, postanesthesia care unit, ED). As with staffing, some hospitals face shortages of critical care spaces, 46,71-73 although occupancy varies across the United States. In Ontario in 2006, there were 1,789 critical care beds, 1,057 of which were capable of accommodating mechanical ventilation. 74 The occupancy rate for these beds approaches 90%. 50 Demands on critical care resources are expected to increase in both the United States and Canada as the populations age. 75 On a day-to-day basis, additional capacity can be created in the critical care system by expanding critical care to areas of the hospital such as the postanesthesia care unit. However, this expansion is still limited by the issues of stuff and staff discussed earlier. Therefore, even though the bed spaces may be available to use for critical care, if the hospital rents its ventilators and has no more on site, the ability to expand critical care remains limited unless specific advanced planning and preparation are undertaken. Finally, although it is possible to convert off-site locations 17, 53 (ie, hotels, gymnasiums, sports fields) into medical treatment facilities, the ability to convert such areas to critical care facilities on a large scale is curtailed because of the functional requirements and logistical challenges, such as large-volume portable oxygen supplies.",25.48609528419467,10.73642103986921

First, collectively, Africa needs a unified continent-wide strategy for preparedness and response. The strategy must be comprehensive, and member states, donors, and partners should immediately commit to releasing financial resources to support country-customised implementation plans derived from the strategy. To help develop a common strategy that will allow for effective coordination, collaboration, and communication, the African Union Commission, Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), and WHO, in partnership with African countries, have established the Africa Taskforce for Coronavirus Preparedness and Response (AFTCOR). The partnership has six work streams: laboratory diagnosis and subtyping; surveillance, including screening at points of entry and cross-border activities; infection prevention and control in healthcare facilities; clinical management of people with severe COVID-19; risk communication; and supply-chain management and stockpiles. Because mitigating the potential spread of COVID-19 in Africa will require rapid detection and containment, the laboratory work streams of AFTCOR, Africa CDC, and WHO are working closely to expeditiously scale up diagnostic testing capacity linked to enhanced surveillance and monitoring-eg, at the beginning of February, only two countries in Africa had the diagnostic capacity to test for COVID-19. However, as of Feb 25, 2020, more than 40 countries would have been capacitated to accurately diagnose COVID-19 infection, thanks to the coordination efforts of AFTCOR. 6 As testing becomes more available, it is possible that more cases might be detected. Second, any effective preparedness and response strategy for COVID-19 requires a committed political will; as such, the African Union Commission, Africa CDC, and WHO convened, on Feb 22, 2020, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, an emergency meeting of all ministers of health of 55 member states to commit to acting fast and collectively to develop and implement a coordinated continent-wide strategy. AFTCOR taskforce was formed, and a continent-wide strategy was endorsed at the end of the emergency meeting, with a call for strong coordination of efforts. To prevent the occurrence of a social, health security, and economic tragedy, actions agreed at the emergency ministerial meeting will need to be acted on quickly, before any additional COVID-19 cases are introduced to the continent, and result in sustained human-tohuman transmission. The potential social, economic, and security devastation that COVID-19 could cause in Africa should be enough of an incentive for African governments to invest immediately in preparedness for the worst-case scenario. Third, commitment and release of financial resources from partners and donors before a crisis hits Africa will help anticipate demand and address supply chain management, mapping, and stockpiling of COVID-19 response needs, such as large quantities of personal protective equipment, gloves, surgical masks, coveralls, and hoods, and medical countermeasures like antiviral agents.

Individual and family grants: These loans are granted to persons with needs not met by private insurances, SBA, or volunteer organizations. These grants are for basic needs only, not to return life to normal. Costs can include medical and counseling assistance, housing repair, funeral expenses, and insurance premiums. 2. Public assistance:This program gives aid to local governments for emergency services and the repair or replacement of public facilities, for example, the removal of debris, repair of infrastructure, or emergency protective measures. It is often the most costly element of recovery, and typically the cost is shared with the state in a 75%/25% split. 6 3. Hazard mitigation grant program 10 : These grants are used by the federal, state, and local governments to incorporate mitigation into the recovery process. Actions may include acquisition of homes, public education, and retrofitting structures to better resist subsequent disasters such as floods and hurricanes. Cost will be shared between federal and state resources. 6 Businesses have special considerations in light of a disaster. The primary objective of recovery planning is to enable an organization to survive a disaster and to continue normal business operations. To survive, the organization must ensure that critical operations can resume/continue normal processing and minimize the duration of a serious disruption to operations and resources (both information processing and other resources); a premade contingency plan is the best method of accomplishing this. 13 Specific measures may include having an alternate site of operations if the current facility is damaged, storing vital documents off-site, and having an alternative energy source such as a generator. Larger businesses may be better able to withstand a disaster because assets and the workforce may be dispersed across a wider geographical area. 6 A disaster is a life-altering event. Survivors share an enormous experience and come to view the world around them in new and different ways. Seeking help from the government, voluntary agencies, and insurance companies can be long and frustrating, which may only compound the feelings of helplessness. Anger and further despair are common. Mental health staff may assist persons by reassuring them that this ""second disaster"" is a common phenomenon 14 and that they are not alone in their frustration. Many people may not want to seek formal counseling, either because of the stigma some still associate with psychiatric help or because they are unwilling to take time away from putting their lives back together or helping others. Very effective mental health assistance can be provided while the worker is helping survivors with concrete tasks. The ""over a cup of coffee"" method of informal intervention may be the best method to help. For example, a mental health worker can use skilled but unobtrusive interviewing techniques to help a survivor sort out demands and set priorities while they are jointly sifting through disaster rubble. 14 Although having community involvement is beneficial to the process of recovery, it is also very important for the mental well-being of the community. Failing to involve the community can lead to resentment and fragmentation. The inhabitants may be unhappy when aid is not appropriate to the community's perceived needs, and this insult may be compounded if they are then labeled unappreciative of the federal help. When people have a hand in their own recovery, they feel empowered and will increase their involvement. This leads to a stronger community network that in turn increases the ability to provide self-help.",29.57018927312983,14.374835753957257

Information about a new or emerging disease may also change on an hourly or even a daily basis as new information emerges about the treatment of the disease and is communicated among country, state and provincial governments. In some cases international and national agencies may provide collaborative tools that allow for health professionals to exchange information and experiences with these emerging diseases to enhance development of protocols (as in the case of SARS where international experts around the world worked together on understanding how to best identify and treat the disease) [14, 15] . On a local healthcare organizational level (e.g. hospital, clinic, long term care facility), technologies that have policies, procedures and processes embedded within electronic health records may not be consistent with emerging international and national knowledge about the disease. These technologies may in turn lead health professionals to engage in activities and workflows that are not consistent with the current knowledge of the disease. Healthcare organizations must modify their technologies to support disease management.

Emerging diseases are not typically encountered by technology designers and HIT professionals. New and emergent diseases that we encounter today in our world of modern epidemics include Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the Avian flu and Ebola [12] . The development of HIT that supports patient-centred care for those patients and families affected by new/emerging diseases, especially in regions of the world where HIT and health professionals have limited knowledge or experience with new/emerging diseases, is critical to developing and exchanging knowledge about these diseases [13] . Such technologies are also needed to support patients who are diagnosed with acute and chronic illnesses. Given the new and emergent nature of some diseases one might conclude that HIT used to support health professionals in the management of these diseases is less patient-centred and therefore less effective in supporting patient-centred care. Yet, HIT can evolve and be used to support the development of patient-centred care. For example, in the early days of the global outbreak of SARS, there was little known about the disease. Yet, health and biomedical informatics researchers developed electronic tools and repurposed existing technologies such as electronic health records (EHRs) to effectively support clinicians and biomedical researchers. Here, HIT researchers developed virtual environments where healthcare professionals could communicate, collaborate, and document information about the treatment and management of SARS [14] . This included patient-centred approaches to the management of the disease. Clinicians, patients and their families were involved in decision making even as new information about the prevention and management of this disease was emerging using electronic tools. This could only be done through HIT such as the Internet, EHRs, decision support systems, and virtual collaborative environments [15] .

The greedy algorithm identified a small number of hospitals as key to preventing wide dissemination of highly resistant microorganisms (Fig. 3) under both the maximal and moderate infectivity conditions. For example, the greedy algorithm allocated all 500 resources to only 96 hospitals under the maximal infectivity condition; the geographic distribution of these hospitals is shown in Fig. 4 .

Privately paid 'companions' hired directly by families and estates to provide one-on-one care were not permitted on site because they were classified as visitors, not staff, even though the facility was their work site. Before the crisis, LTC management had not paid attention to how many companions worked directly for residents; however, companions became highly visible during the quarantine. At one facility companions were lined up outside the large atrium windows unable to get in, while the residents were seated in wheelchairs inside the atrium unable to get out. It was particularly remarkable because the size of the companion workforce rivalled the paid staff complement. According to a physician who worked at the LTC facility during the quarantine, nearly half of its 'workforce' had disappeared. At the time, this facility was atypical amongst peer organizations for its heavy reliance on companion labour as well as for the public way in which this shadow workforce was revealed. SARS pushed facility management to 'see' this otherwise invisible workforce.

Plans should be scalable and flexible to cope with the many types and varied timelines of disasters.

Proper pre-event planning and mechanisms for resource coordination are critical to the success of a response. The terrorist attacks of 2001 and the threat of large-scale infectious disease outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and pandemic influenza have revealed potentially large gaps in the ability of the health care system to find either the capacity or the special capabilities to cope with disasters that severely injure or infect a large number of victims. 1, 2 Although much current planning revolves around large-scale terrorist or epidemic events, the recent Rhode Island nightclub fire demonstrates that even a moderate-sized incident may generate large numbers of victims whose care requires supplemental staff and specialized resources and overwhelms local capabilities. 3 There is an urgent need for communities and regions, not just individual health care facilities, to develop tiered, scalable, and flexible surge capacity plans to provide care for a large volume of patients.

Combined inputs from experts all over the world led to the establishment of a Framework for Safe Drinking Water (WHO, 2004) based on the principles of HACCP (Hazard Assessment and Critical Control Points). Basically the strategy implies that the quality of water is controlled at a selected set of critical control points (CPs) in a multiple barrier drinking water treatment system. Typically, CPs are monitored by testing water quality using physico-chemical and microbiological parameters. However, other parameters may also be used, such as observational monitoring of livestock barriers and the integrity of groundwater sources. Raw water sources may be seen as the first barrier with its own set of control measures for quality protection.

In the event of a severe pandemic during which 30% of the health care workforce is expected to become ill, compliance with transmission-based precautions will become increasingly dif- ficult due to shortages in health care providers, nursing staff, and environmental services staff to provide cleaning and disinfection. Limiting factors to compliance also include logistical problems such as the number of private rooms available in the ED, the available supplies of personal protective equipment such as surgical masks, and the volume of patients in the ED. For example, one challenge during the SARS epidemic was fulfilling increased demand for personal protective equipment and biohazard bags (36) . Policies to enforce strict isolation are costly and time intensive and these policies may prevent health care workers from entering those patient rooms with the same frequency due to the burden of mask and gown use, with a potential impact on patient care and satisfaction (37) .

Despite CDC experience regularly providing assistance for smaller, shorter outbreaks, sustaining support over 21 months proved difficult.

Reports from WHO and the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board have shown that responses to urgent crises have improved under the IHR (2005), but important deficiencies in coverage still exist. 3, 4 We must scale up laboratory capacity and other surveillance capabilities, augment the readiness of health systems to care for large numbers of seriously ill patients while safe guarding the health-care workforce, and improve communication and coordination strategies and implementation. 5 Procurement and supply chain management must also be enhanced to ensure adequate stocks of personal protective equipment and essential medications and to enable equitable access to new diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines during health emergencies. 6 Second, we need to accelerate progress towards achieving the priorities and targets of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, 7 which was adopted by UN member nations in 2015. The Sendai Framework applies an all-hazards approach to increasing international, regional, national, and local resilience to withstand a broad spectrum of disasters, including epidemics, pandemics, and epizootics. Preparedness for emerging infectious diseases requires strengthening health systems and developing response plans that account for the social, environmental, political, and institutional factors that can either support or disrupt emergency management efforts. 8 The Sendai Framework complements the IHR by integrating infrastructure, climate change, and economic considerations into disaster management plans and promoting inclusive policies that protect vulnerable populations during all phases of mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. 7 Third, plans for preventing, detecting, and controlling outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases need to be built on a One Health foundation that emphasises the interconnectedness of humans, animals, and ecosystems. 9 Transdisciplinary, multisectoral strategies are necessary when seeking to solve complex problems that threaten global public health and safety. 10 More specifically in relation to diseases such as COVID-19, One Health focuses on the danger existing at the human-wildlife interface.

It can equally be argued that ''risk'' is measured in various ways, many of which are dependent on the decision maker's preferences and perceptions (Garvey et al., 2015; Zsidisin and Ritchie, 2009) . While one may view the minimization of ''risk'' by minimizing expected cost, another may prefer to instead minimize total spread of risk (i.e. severity). This is simply a matter of preference.

During emergencies, decisionmakers may be inundated with data and information leading to improvident action, or worse, inaction. Tools and technology that automate the presentation of data to decisionmakers could help by triggering alerts and pushing messages indicating aberrancy to both decision-makers and front-line staff.

The public health workforce, including ID physicians, has been shrinking over the last decade [10, 11] . These workforce losses pose a significant barrier to carrying out routine public health activities and responding to public health threats. ID physicians employed by federal agencies and state health departments have the community as their patient. Along with ID physicians in other practice settings, they provide leadership and subject matter expertise to enable a wide variety of community-based interventions. For example, ID management and prevention. Public health strategies to contain the spread of HIV rely on ensuring that people living with HIV-AIDS have access to ID-driven clinical care. By achieving sustained virologic suppression, people stay healthy and reduce the risk of community transmission [12] . The 2015 HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) outbreaks linked to injection drug use in rural Scott County, Indiana, serve as a stark reminder of the risk for rapid disease transmission in communities that lack robust outbreak prevention resources and activities [13] . In 2017 there was an outbreak of hepatitis A virus in the homeless population of San Diego, California, that required significant work from the public health community to resolve [14] . In March 2017, a National Academies of Medicine panel declared the elimination of hepatitis B and HCV in the United States by 2030 to be a feasible goal. A sufficient workforce with the expertise to treat patients with HCV will be critical to reaching this goal [15] . As an example of outbreak detection and response to emerging infections, the Indiana State Health Department recognized the first identified case of MERS in the United States in a traveler to that state. ID specialists at the department helped develop and implement protocols to ensure appropriate care, prevent the spread of infection, and avert an outbreak. ID physicians working inside or outside of public health often provide guidance to help allocate community vaccine resources and other preventive services. For example, during measles outbreaks in California in 2015 and Minnesota in 2017, ID physicians within the state and local health departments helped lead vaccination campaigns to halt the spread of the disease [16, 17] . Even in the absence of a major outbreak, patients in hospitals and healthy individuals in communities are potentially exposed to increasingly drug-resistant and difficult-to-treat pathogens, necessitating ID physician leadership to protect the population by limiting the spread of infectious threats [18] . ID public health physicians act as a trusted resource, working through the media, to help educate the public about communicable diseases and prevention strategies. Current topics of concern include multidrug-resistant bacteria, Zika virus outbreaks, the 2017 hepatitis A outbreak in San Diego, and Mycobacterium chimera infections in patients treated with heart-lung bypass machines.",34.15287901326483,15.159400742029776

Significant medical school debt can drive new physicians away from the ID specialty and public health. Targeted loan repayment opportunities would allow more physicians to pursue these critical career paths. In July 2018, in a move supported by IDSA, the US House of Representative's Energy and Commerce Committee passed legislation that would authorize the CDC to provide loan repayment for those who serve in the Epidemic Intelligence Services (EIS). More than 85% of EIS officers continue serving in public health roles, and this proposal would significantly help make this career path more financially feasible for physicians. Such loan forgiveness opportunities could also be broadened to support ID physicians who work in public health at the federal, state, or local level and face similar challenges around compensation and medical student debt. Establish financial compensation for ID physicians who work in public service (eg, local, state, and federal public health agencies) or who do ID work that provides broader public health benefits (infection control and antimicrobial stewardship). Physicians who perform infection control and antimicrobial stewardship work should be compensated for these activities. As part of hospital accreditation, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) mandates that every participating facility have an active infection control program [37] . States could attach an accreditation process to such mandates that would formally document ID clinicians who oversee hospital infection control and antimicrobial stewardship committees, with loan forgiveness or other financial incentives attached to this accreditation. Ensure that ID physician compensation reflects public health value added. As a cognitive specialty, many of the clinical services ID physicians provide are billed under Evaluation and Management codes, which have not been reevaluated in more than 20 years. The CMS should update these codes to reflect the increasingly complex care provided in inpatient and outpatient settings. Public and private payers, healthcare systems, and hospitals should also provide appropriate compensation and protected time for nonclinical services that are crucial to public health, including infection prevention and control, antimicrobial stewardship, and bioemergency preparedness and response.

However, Ng (2011) concludes that the hospitals in coastal provinces suffer from more productivity decline than the non-coastal provinces in China from 2002 to 2005.

In addition to the benefits above regarding healthcare resource management and provision of emotional support, we expect psychiatry to be essential in helping to prevent and manage the higher levels of depression and worse outcomes that have been observed in patients requiring infectious isolation in hospital settings. 3 Similar to other acutely medically ill patients, those with presentations concerning for COVID-19 are likely to be vulnerable to delirium, agitation, and decompensations of psychosis or mood disorders, necessitating psychiatric evaluation. Psychiatrists will also be needed to assist with capacity evaluations for these patients should they wish to leave against medical advice (AMA). Finally, as our medical colleagues face exhaustion, anxiety, and burnout from the increasing volume of patients and uncertainty regarding healthcare resources, the need for C-L psychiatrists to provide moral support through our liaison role will be critical. This is not the first pandemic we have seen; our mentors tell us the stories of working on the wards during the early cases of HIV/AIDS in the 1980s and the Hong Kong influenza in 1968. It is not surprising that we face similar challenges today, with fear of infection transmission among health care professionals ranging from reasonable concern to panic. During this modern pandemic, some mental health care can and should transition to remote channels. In medical hospitals without psychiatrists on-site, telehealth is clearly preferable over the option of having no psychiatric support. However, where resources allow, we encourage our fellow C-L psychiatrists to stand firm in our role as physicians providing critical in-person care to patients and colleagues who need our care now more than ever. With close attention to following the evolving precautions dictated by infectious disease authorities and hospital leadership, let us model to psychiatry trainees the importance of C-L psychiatry presence in the acute care hospital amidst these challenging times.",37.71848282815989,16.83156745196076

Hence, to minimize the impact of emerging viral diseases, it is critical to establish local laboratory capacity as this plays a critical role in the surveillance, diagnosis, and monitoring of viral disease, as well as in the understanding of the viral genetic changes. The program might cover improving laboratory facilities, ensuring availability of required equipment, building human resource capacity and ensuring quality laboratory management. It is important to generate reliable and accurate data from a diagnostic laboratory needed to guide control measures. Improved laboratory capacity is essential to enhance national self-reliance in responding to viral disease outbreaks and to support an international agenda in reducing the spread and adverse impact of emerging viral diseases. The development of laboratories with an established capacity for molecular diagnosis and research of emerging viruses may be challenging because investment and long-term commitment is required for sustainability of capacity improvements (World Health Organization (WHO), 2008); Wertheim et al., 2010; Chua and Gubler, 2013) . Laboratory management is critical for successful establishment of laboratory capacity. It is important to ensure the availability of qualified personnel, appropriate facilities, equipment, reagents, materials, SOP, training programs, implementation of good laboratory practices, etc. (World Health Organization (WHO), 2009). Good facilities for preservation of viral sample, especially RNA viruses, are important as viral RNA molecule is unstable and highly prone to degradation. In underdeveloped countries, accurate laboratory diagnosis of RNA viruses is frequently hampered by a lack of sample preservation due to difficulties in the transportation and storage of clinical material collected from suspected outbreaks located far from a laboratory. Maintenance of the cold chain is important to avoid sample degradation which causes difficulties in detecting and characterizing field isolates. Facilities required for cold chain maintenance for sample transport and storage are important to keep samples or material within a certain temperature range during all stages of delivery, processing and storage to ensure the viral preservation. The effective mean to maintain the integrity of RNA viruses for laboratory analysis is by freezing. Hence, the availability of deep freezers for adequate specimen storage and power back-up systems for an uninterrupted power supply is also crucial (Wolking, 2013; Fowler et al., 2014) . In order to improve effectiveness and efficiency, it is necessary to maximize the use of existing resources and facilities.

Hence there is a need to develop new and improved vaccines for animals so that they are protected during their life-span from different pathogens. Reduced use of antibiotics for the control of diseases in animals will lead to low levels of antibiotics in the food supply chain which could lead to lowering of the incidence of antibiotic resistance .",30.887951395002148,10.64178417005812

The community approach provides a manageable implementation project with participants who have the shared motivation of improving health care in their own geographic area. The sometimes difficult compromises required for agreements to facilitate sharing of health information (e.g., between competitors) are also more easily made at a community level, where all involved have a common and easily perceived interest in improving health care for themselves and their neighbors. The attendees suggested that regional steering committees would be the best organizational entities to build these community health information infrastructures. An incremental approach to data exchange and interoperability was recommended to minimize disruption from overly rapid change. Linkages among these regional steering committees should be established to promote sharing of lessons learned so that best practices can be developed and disseminated.",27.604686201022776,11.5966277153714

Rapid spread with a high number of cases will saturate the capacity of healthcare system, resulting in excessively high toll of mortality and morbidity; in contrast, slower propagation will allow us time and resources for adequate preparation and management. Thus, efforts for mitigating transmission risk is still important even in the worst situation. Weak spots in systems and societies should be identified. History of recent epidemics – SARS, Ebola, and MERS – universally taught us that healthcare facilities, which comprise the pillars of our healthcare, are at particular risk at the time of epidemic. Hospitals have become stages of super-spreading events during SARS and MERS outbreaks [45]. Outpatients and emergency departments, which serve as gatekeepers of hospitals, are expected to be most exposed. Facilities should formulate detailed plans for safe and effective screening, isolation, and testing of suspected cases (Table 1); otherwise, an increased number of patients and confusion on the front line may make those places epicenter of hospital-associated outbreaks. A dedicated triage area, perhaps makeshift, can serve as a safety barrier for a healthcare facility. Triage could utilize a clinical pathway to manage patients with symptoms of acute respiratory illness: for example, test and treat for influenza or other bacterial causes first with voluntary home isolation, then test for COVID-19 if unresponsive 3 - 5 days later [6]. Use of telemedicine or electronic prescription can be considered to reduce the need for outpatient visits. Hospitals should also build contingency plans for general wards and intensive care units. Care for numerous patients with COVID-19 would require a large number of airborne infections isolation rooms (AIIR) which greatly exceed the current capacity. Building temporary AIIRs with mobile negative-air machines or by adjusting ventilation systems can be useful alternatives, as demonstrated in Korea during the MERS outbreak. Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), along with sewage and waste handling, should be reviewed when general-purpose wards need be used for management of COVID-19 patients. Private practices and pharmacies face unique challenges, due to lack of capacity for isolation and testing. Effective workflow for screening and referral of patients are necessary, and public health authorities should work with the community to provide adequate support to this foundation of our healthcare.",23.187581166957845,12.339748371508975

According to the assumptions based on an expert opinion, mothers were assumed to be the primary caretakers and were therefore considered to accrue work loss over the course of a child's hospital stay. The fathers were assumed to have one day of work loss per week over the course of a child's hospital stay. The parents were also supposed to come for the control visits together and thus, it was assumed one day of work loss at each control visit. Workforce losses of the mothers and fathers were calculated by multiplying aforementioned earnings by the number of days of work loss. Expenses for round trip to hospital were calculated by multiplying the number round trips to hospital by €4.59.23 It was assumed that the fathers had a round trip to hospital every day over the course of his child's hospital stay and that 5 more round trips to hospital arose from mothers making 1 trip to the hospital on the first day of hospitalization and 1 trip from the hospital on the day of discharge and from both mothers and fathers making 4 round trips to the hospital for two control visits after discharge. All costs were expressed in Euros according to the 2014 currency of Turkish Liras (€1.00 = 2.9 Turkish Liras, without inflation adjustment).

Notably, this new cadre of CHWs differs substantially from the CHWs who are the subject of this paper except in their duties. While the policy issues of existing CHWs still remain to be addressed, the new programme only proposes to recognise the existing CHWs provided they will be useful in providing voluntary assistance to the formally remunerated new cadre of CHWs, and their continuous existence will be dependent on the particular health district. A justifiable policy question may therefore be why introduce a new cadre of CHWs to take up duties which were essentially carried out by a particular workforce but whose contribution has hitherto not been recognised and whose integration into the new programme has not been explicitly addressed.

Illustrating the success of the procedure, around 23,000 transplants were performed around the world in 2017.2 However, access to LT is limited. A stagnant pool of donor organs contrasts with an increasing number of candidates. In France, for instance, the overall number of newly listed patients increased by 24% between 2011 and 2017 with an average 2.4 transplant candidates per available graft.3 Regulation regarding the allocation system has led to grafts being offered to the patients with the highest risk of short-term mortality. As a consequence, severely ill patients with end-stage liver disease (ESLD), prioritized for LT, have been increasingly admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).4 Outcomes of patients with ESLD in the ICU used to concern intensivists due to their outcomes compared to the general population.[5], [6] However, improved practices have led to an outstanding 30 point short-term survival gain between 2000 and 2010 in a liver-specific ICU.7 The reasons for such improvements are fourfold: better identification of candidates for ICU admission based on specific prognosis scores,[8], [9] better understanding of the pathophysiology of complications in chronic liver diseases, general improvement in ICU care,[10], [11] and development of specific management for patients with advanced liver disease. Indeed, in the last decades, there have been numerous medical improvements in the management of precipitating events and complications of ESLD. For instance, improvement in administration of antimicrobial therapy and bundle of care in sepsis resulted in better outcomes in both sepsis and septic shock.[12], [13], [14] Among others, the use of vasopressors, antibiotic prophylaxis and endoscopic management resulted in significant improvements in prognosis for patients admitted in the context of acute variceal bleeding.[15], [16], [17], [18] In the setting of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), the combination of using albumin infusions, and vasopressors alongside clearer disease definitions has led to significant improvements in terms of outcome.[19], [20], [21], [22] Despite these improvements, LT remains the only life-saving procedure in patients that fail to recover adequate liver function. In order to illustrate the importance of “urgent” LT in this situation, the “share 35” policy has recently been implemented in the US to improve equity in access to LT, based on the comparable outcomes observed in patients with very high MELD scores without LT as in patients with fulminant hepatic failure (FHF).[23], [24], [25] With Share 35, patients with ESLD are now given the same geographic access to organs as patients with FHF, while the latter group is still granted higher allocation status in a given region.24 Several unmet medical and ethical issues have to be faced by clinicians in order to optimize management of patients with very high MELD scores from the perspective of LT, such as: How should these patients be categorized in the era of the dual concepts of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) and “mere” acute decompensation? Which prognosis assessment should be used? In the context of permanent scarcity of resource, how should the priority access to LT be managed in the most severely ill patients given the potential increased risk of post-LT mortality? Can upper limits of sickness be identified beyond which a patient should not be listed for an LT? How should we deal with patients already listed with less severe disease who are exposed to brutal deterioration of liver function and death due to restricted access to LT? Finally, how to identify and manage patients that are not candidates for LT and who do not recover adequate liver function?",14.690978390958172,7.384246695086549

The reporting quality was generally poor. Consequently, unclear randomization and allocation concealment may lead to a potential possibility of selection bias. The quality of evidence was influenced by considerable heterogeneity in the outcomes of duration of invasive ventilation, total duration of mechanical ventilation, LOS in ICU, LOS in hospital, and hospital costs. Substantial heterogeneity may arise from the changing conditions of patients and the blood gas analysis during ventilation, which were indirectly reflected by the different ventilator modes, as 5 studies[30,32,35,36,40] used (SIMV + PSV + PEEP), 3 studies[40,42,44] used (A/C +SIMV + PSV), 2 studies[33,43] used (SIMV + PSV). Such inconsistencies relating to patients’ clinical characteristics during the treatment were the reasons for downgrading one level of the evidence. Regarding imprecision, in addition to the CIs and the lines of no effect and appreciable benefit or harm, another criterion, the OIS, is also a determinant to guarantee adequate precision. The OIS is referred to the number of participants estimated by a sample size calculation for a single adequately powered trial.[56] If the total number of participants of a meta-analysis is lower than the OIS criterion, the quality of evidence should be downgraded because of imprecision.[57] In this study, although the 95% CIs of the outcome of reintubations excluded a relative risk of 1.0 and the appreciable harm,[57] the total number of participants (n = 327) of the meta-analysis did not exceed the OIS (n = 398); it was therefore more likely to support the decision to downgrade the evidence quality due to impression. Because no substantial differences existed between the patients’ baseline characteristics or the outcomes measured in the included studies, we considered the indirectness was not serious. Potential publication bias was detected regarding the outcome VAP through visual inspection. So, the quality of evidence on this outcome was rated down. Overall, the quality of evidence with respect to the 9 critical or important outcomes was graded from moderate to low, and the uncertainty of long-term effects was more likely to warrant a weak recommendation of noninvasive ventilation used at PIC window for ARF in AECOPD patients.",13.809634643975942,5.669059284765936

A medical resource allocation problem in a situation caused by a disaster is considered in [30] , where victims' deteriorating health conditions are modeled as a Markov chain, and the resources are allocated to optimize the total expected health recovery rate and to reduce the total waiting time. Certain illustrative examples in a queuing network setting are also given in [30] . The problem of scarce medical resource allocation after a natural disaster using a discrete event simulation approach is investigated in [15] . Specifically, the authors in [15] investigate four resource-rationing principles: first come-first served, random, most serious first, and least serious first. It is found that without ethical concern, the least serious first principle exhibits the highest efficiency. However, a random selection provides a relatively fair allocation of services and provides a better trade-off with ethical considerations.

As of March 26, 2020, the United States had the highest number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV2, of any country in the world. 2 Multiple areas in the US are seeing dramatic increases in cases of COVID-19 and concerns are mounting that local medical system response capacities will be quickly exceeded. Hospital critical care is perhaps the most important medical system choke point in terms of preventing deaths in a disaster scenario such as with the current COVID-19 pandemic. 3, 4 A spectrum of critical care, from intensive care units to other serviceable hospital critical care structures, can be drafted in the event of mass disasters, potentially doubling hospital capacity in a crisis care surge situation. 5, 6, 7, 8 However, whether the nation's potential hospital surge capacity is exactly double, or perhaps more or less than that, in the context of rapidly growing cases of COVID-19 in the US, remains unclear. We therefore brought together previously established disease modeling estimates 9 of the growth of the COVID-19 epidemic in the US under various social distancing contact reduction assumptions, with local estimates of the potential critical care surge response 10 across all US counties. Our objectives in doing this was to highlight US counties that are at risk of exceeding their critical care surge capacity limits within one month, indicate the typical time it would take these counties to exceed their critical care surge capacity limits, and estimate the excess mortality that would potentially result from exceeding critical care surge capacity limits in these counties. These objectives speak to the capabilities of the US medical system under disaster conditions and the usefulness of social distancing and other prevention strategies for slowing the presentation rate of severe COVID-19 cases to a point where the US critical care system can adapt in minimizing preventable mortality. 11, 12 ",19.891454070773612,9.763247682142666

First, the medical and wider community should be informed that latent/active TB is a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and those at risk should be encouraged to pay special attention to preventive measures. Ideally, this vulnerable group should be monitored regularly at community-based medical centers in situations when resources are available. Second, the MTB infection status (history and IGRA response) of suspected/confirmed COVID-19 cases should be checked routinely on admission to ensure coinfected cases are placed in appropriate isolation wards if active TB is detected. Third, special medical resources (such as ECMO therapy) should be arranged in advance for coinfected patients in view of the increased likelihood of rapid development of severe or critical symptoms. Fourth, therapeutic approaches for cases known to be coinfected both SARS-CoV-2 and MTB should bear their MTB infection history in mind; for example, treatments involving immunosuppressive agents should be reconsidered, as they hold the potential to reactivate latent TB infections. .

The target of each strategy is to maximise the social welfare by incurring in the minimum economic cost. For interventions where travel restrictions are implemented 46 , the cost increases with the number of closed airports and the number of individuals that get stranded in those airports. The reward is related to the relative decrease in the global footprint of the disease, compared with the null case of non-interventions. In contrast to the mobility-driven strategies that change the population's mobility patterns, other solutions such as hand washing appear to be more cost-and reward-effective. A future research on the socio-economic impact of global pandemics and the cost-effectiveness ratio of different mitigation strategies (e.g. hand washing, vaccination, airport closures, mobility routing diversions) against disease spreading would evaluate the efficiency and significance of hand-hygiene interventions. However, while hand hygiene is considered as the first prevention step in the case of an epidemic emergency, the capacity of hand washing facilities in crowded places, including airports, is limited only to wash basins at restrooms. It is not known, however, if increased capacity would enhance hand washing engagement by air travelers. New technology is being developed aiming to increase the capacity of facilities even outside restrooms, thus expanding the options for hand hygiene and the solutions for air and surface sterilization. Airbus 47 , for example, is exploring an innovative antimicrobial technology that is able to eliminate viruses and pathogens from aircraft surfaces (e.g. tray tables, seat covers, touch screens, galley areas). Boeing is also exploring a prototype self-sanitizing lavatory that uses ultraviolet light to kill 99.99% of pathogens 48 .

According to the quantitative data, we observed relatively good completeness of IDSR monthly reports compared to timeliness. Timeliness is a general problem to countries implementing IDSR system across Africa, and this makes the public health authorities unable to take quick action and respond to the suspected health events [12, 25] . Facility level IDSR reports may not be sufficiently timely to pick up the outbreaks from community. The strengthened community level surveillance and verbal autopsy to detect unusual deaths can be a good approach to detect lower level health events and provide timely response [26] .
