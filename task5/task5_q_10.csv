Of these, only a few are approved for human use in the fields of pharmaceutics. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lists 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) and 2-hydroxypropyl-γ-CD (HPγCD) as approved inert materials (excipients), with HPβCD being suited for oral and intravenous administration while HPγCD can only be used in topical products and in a maximal concentration of 1.5% (w/v) (FDA, 2016). Within O-methylated CDs, the approval status varies from one molecule to the next. For instance, heptakis-2,3,6-tris-O-methyl β-CD (TRIMEB) is deemed unsafe for human use due to its hemolytic action and renal toxicity. Its sister cyclodextrin, heptakis-2,6-di-O-methyl-β-CD (DIMEB), also features some toxicity, mostly targeting the liver: Doses of 300 mg/kg in mice caused elevated levels of glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT) and glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) [22] , two biomarkers of hepatic injury. Despite this, DIMEB is approved by the FDA for commercial use in a few injectable vaccines [23] , probably due to the fact that it is present in low amounts in such products. Cyclodextrins that have undergone O-methylation in random positions have different safety profiles, according to the different degrees of substitution. RAMEB (from randomly methylated beta-cyclodextrin), with an average of 1.8 methoxyl groups per glucose unit, has some hydrolytical action on erythrocytes [24, 25] , as well as renal toxicity that is higher than that of the parent βCD. For these reasons, RAMEB is not recommended for parenteral use by the EMA [15] . CRYSMEB (named after the fact that it is a crystalline solid, crystalline methylated beta-cyclodextrin) has a deliberately low substitution degree (average of 0.56 methyl groups per glucose unit, i.e., only four methyl groups in each CD molecule) because it was designed for high biotolerability. CRYSMEB does not cause hemolysis and it is already approved for dermal applications and as an ingredient in cosmetics. Another biocompatible CD is sulfobutyl ether β-CD (SBEβCD), developed to be non-nephrotoxic and present in several FDA-approved marketed medications for both oral and intravenous administration [26] .",9.375820913070585,9.113970769796719

For classic scabies, topical permethrin or oral ivermectin are considered first-line treatments. 23 Dosing regimens are included in the table. Although high-quality trials comparing medications for the treatment of scabies are lacking, a Cochrane systematic review concluded that permethrin is more effective than ivermectin. 37 A more recent 2018 systematic review, however, concluded that both ivermectin and permethrin have similar efficacy. 38 When used as directed, topical permethrin 5% has high cure rates, approaching 90% in randomized trials. 39 Permethrin is applied topically in patients older than 2 months of age from the neck to the soles of the feet and washed off after 8 to 14 hours. Considering that scabies can also affect the face, scalp and neck in infants and young children, topical application should be extended to these areas. 36, 40 Repeating the topical permethrin treatment one or two weeks after the first treatment is necessary in severe cases. 36 Oral ivermectin is an alternate therapy that may be used if topical treatment fails; however, its safety in pregnant women and children weighing less than 15 kg has not been established. 34, 46, 37, [41] [42] [43] For crusted scabies, both an oral and a topical scabicide should be administered concurrently (Table) . 15, 19, 37 Ivermectin use has also been described for scabies control in endemic areas or outbreaks where topical scabicide use may be difficult. 12 A randomized controlled trial examining mass administration of ivermectin for management of scabies concluded a reduction in prevalence from 32.1% to 1.9% in the ivermectin group compared to a reduction from 41.7% to 15.8% in permethrin-treated controls. 44 Other topical agents such as sulfur, benzyl benzoate, crotamiton, and lindane are also options if first-line treatments fail.

According to the regulations of Chinese health insurance, clinically stable patients with major psychiatric disorders are usually required to visit hospital outpatient clinics, often far from their homes, to obtain their monthly maintenance medications. The suspension of public transportation in Wuhan and many other cities in China have created significant barriers for patients to access treatments and are likely to widen the treatment gap for serious mental disorders, at least in the short to medium term. To address the over-dependence on psychiatric hospitals, appropriate reform of the health insurance and development of community-based mental health services could increase the availability of psychotropic medications at community health clinics, and reduce patients' need to travel, thereby decreasing pressure on psychiatric hospital outpatient clinics. Furthermore, community psychiatric outreach services by psychiatrists and nurses should be developed for clinically stable patients. To avoid the need to attend hospitals, mental health professionals could use special designated vehicles to visit patients at home to assess their symptoms, and provide necessary medications. In addition, it is important to establish an infection disease alarm and control system in psychiatric hospitals. The health authorities should hire specialists to monitor, implement and adopt the preventive and control measures for infectious diseases, and establish infectious units in psychiatric hospital settings [12] .",9.216435039429532,7.164526122347548

This disease could have lead to a more difficult management of DM. In the first case the animal went into clinical DM remission and few days later the FCGS symptoms worsened. In the second one, the FCGS was a clinical problem during insulin therapy. Despite being associated with a previous good clinical improvement and a reduction of lesions, corticosteroids were contraindicated in both cases. Therefore, based on previous clinical trials [12] , an oral protocol of rFeIFN-ω was successfully applied. In both cases, clinical improvement was gradually observed and was significantly marked (and noted by owners, who remarked that the animals started eating without discomfort and had reduced hypersalivation) around 60 days after the onset of therapy. This was particularly evident in the second case where rFeIFN-ω therapy was associated with a clinical improvement of oral lesions and a concurrent reduced insulin dose requirement which culminated in type II DM remission. This is in agreement with the previously cited work that describes an overall relief of pain in refractory cases of FCGS [12] . It is also in agreement with multiple anecdotal reports that describe a rapid improvement in well-being in cats with FCGS during oral rFeIFN-ω treatment, but with a period of three to six months being necessary in some severe cases before the lesions are fully resolved, especially where there has been regular previous use of corticosteroids (D. McGahiepersonal communication). Although there are no studies that clearly detail the immunomodulatory mechanisms of oral rFeIFN-ω use, it has been proven that oral human interferon-alpha administration may potentiate a local T-helper 1 response (Th1) [23] . In fact, human interferon-alpha seems to increase the expression of gamma-interferon, a Th1 cytokine inducer, while it reduces the Interleukin-4 production, responsible for a T-helper 2 response [23] . Recognizing that the Th1 response is an important immunological pathway against viral infections [23] , it seems reasonable that rFeIFN-ω and human interferon-alpha (both type I interferons) may have a similar local action. Therefore, this Th1enhancement may explain the clinical improvement observed in these calicivirus positive cats during rFeIFN-ω therapy. Further controlled prospective studies are needed to reinforce these clinical findings, correlating them with the local immune response. These two clinical cases describe the successful use of oral rFeIFN-ω in diabetic cats with FCGS as an appropriate alternative to corticosteroid treatment where its administration is contraindicated.

Recombinant feline interferon-omega (rFeIFN-ω; Virbagen, Virbac) is an immune-modulator drug currently licensed in Europe for treatment of feline retroviral infections [13] [14] [15] . According to the manufacturer's instructions, the licensed protocol consists of three cycles of five daily administrations of 1 MU/kg subcutaneously (SC) at days 0, 14 and 60. However other dosages and routes have also been used in the management of other diseases. For instance, alternative subcutaneous and topical protocols were tried in feline coronavirus and FHV-1 infection, respectively [16, 17] . Also in cases of FCGS (some of them FCV positive), a study suggested the benefit of intra-lesional administration of rFeIFN-ω [18] . More recently, its oral administration was documented in noneffusive feline infectious peritonitis [19] and in refractory FCGS, particularly in an efficacy study which compared the use of an oral rFeIFN-ω protocol with the use of oral corticosteroids [12] . This study concluded that oral rFeIFN-ω was associated with a significant clinical improvement of FCGS lesions [12] . Furthermore, there was no difference between this protocol and corticosteroids except on pain control, where animals treated with rFeIFN-ω achieved a better pain relief [12] . Therefore, as oral rFeIFN-ω is a useful alternative management option for refractory FCGS, it may also be of particular interest in cats where corticosteroid administration is contraindicated, such as those with DM. This report underlines the relevance of rFeIFN-ω by describing two clinical cases of diabetic cats in which it was successfully administered as an alternative therapy for concurrent FCGS.",9.164229181314633,5.91753301363865

Currently, Bacillus subtilis as recombinant vaccine carrier has been used for antigen delivery and proved well in immune effect and safety. The present study evaluated the immunogenicity of recombinant Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis-RC) in piglets via oral administration. After oral immunization in piglets, B. subtilis-RC significantly increased the local mucosal immune responses. Oral administration with B. subtilis-RC significantly improved the level of specific mucosal immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies against PEDV infection, through enlarging the area of Peyer's patches (PPs) and increasing the number of ileum IgA + secreting (SIgA) cells. In the meantime, B. subtilis-RC remarkably increased the number of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs). We also observed that oral administration of B. subtilis-RC significantly increased CD3 + T lymphocytes' numbers and up-regulated the ratio of CD4 + /CD8 + T cells. Furthermore, high titers of specific serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) revealed satisfactory systemic immune response against PEDV infection.

Such compounds could provide new options to treat a diverse set of indications, including NAFLD, diabetes and metabolic disease, viral infection and a variety of cancers. Herein we report the bioavailability of several compounds has been improved by achieving a balance between the polar, hydrophilic carboxylic acid group and the non-polar, lipophilic tert-butyl group as exemplified in 500200 and 600453.

In support of this idea, it has been observed that in C. elegans neurons stress resulted in the expulsion of a bolus of protein aggregates by exocytosis [81] . The autophagy protein, Atg5, was shown to dissociate the V1E subunit from the V 0 -V 1 ATPase complex to promote exosome production [82] .

Experimentation using surrogate hosts and S. enterica serotypes (e.g. S.

Whilst these mechanisms have never been directly proven for typhoid, it is clear that S. Typhi has predominantly forsaken ongoing transmission in the habitat of the mammalian gastrointestinal tract of most enteric bacteria, in the favor of systemic dissemination.

The EBOV is an RNA virus the replication of which is highly error prone with nearly one viral mutation occurring during each cycle of replication. This extremely high mutation rate leads to significant genetic and antigenic diversity that allows the EBOV population to evolve resistance to antiviral medications and vaccines [227, 228] . A combination therapy has been used in the treatment of RNA virus infections, such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [229, 230] and hepatitis C [231, 232] to minimize the development of drug resistance. Given the broad cell tropism and high replication rate of the EBOV due to the potent suppression of both innate and adaptive immune responses of the host, patients with the EBOV infection have an extremely high viral load. The selective pressure in the presence of the high mutation rate and viral load during the human EBOV infection make the evolution of the EBOV viral strains resistant to a single drug inevitable. The currently available medications in the proposed regimen-which is a treatment regimen containing a cocktail of antiviral medications targeting the different steps of the EBOV replication in order to achieve maximal suppression of viral replication and to prevent the rapid development of resistance to favipiravir, the only drug in the regimen that is directed against a mutable target of the EBOV-has been shown to reduce the replication of the EBOV.

Furthermore, several types of classical conditioning/implicit learn ing paradigms, including eye-blink conditioning (McGlinchy-Berroth et al. 1994) , visual discrimination learning (Rogers et al. 2000) , and contextual cue discrimination learning (Greene et al. 2007) , have been shown in both animal and human studies to be critical ly dependent on selective cerebellar sites.",10.442808259278166,5.621958609484007

Among the different types of oral cancer, oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) arising from the oral mucosa accounts for more than 90% of these malignancies. Thus, OSCC is the most common malignancy affecting the head and neck region. Notably, there are nearly 300,000 new cases of oral cancer reported annually [1, 2] , and it was estimated that approximately 128,000 oral cancer patients died worldwide in 2008 [3] . Therefore, despite recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment of oral cancer (e.g., chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgical therapy) the survival rate of OSCC patients has remained less than 60% [4, 5] . A fundamental barrier in improving the survival of OSCC patients is the fact that these malignancies often remain undetected until the later stages. In this regard, it was reported that a severalmonth delay in diagnosis could reduce the chance of survival from 80% to 40% [6] . Thus, in order to prevent the high OSCC-related mortality rate, recent attention has been focused on identifying potential diagnostic molecular markers (e.g., cell cycle regulators) that might represent biological predictors of oral cancer [7] .

In Vitro Study. β-Defensins are predominantly expressed by epithelial cells and therefore can serve as a first line of defense against invading pathogens at mucosal surfaces and skin. The synthesis of HBDs is regulated by, and can regulate, responses of both innate and adaptive immunities. HBD production and secretion are stimulated by microbes [68, 69] and the release of cytokines including IFNγ, IL1, IL17A, IL22, and TNFα [70] [71] [72] . The effects of β-defensins on HIV-1 pathogenesis have traditionally centered on the oral environment because the rate of oral HIV-1 transmission is significantly less than that of vaginal or rectal transmission [73, 74] , and detectable levels of HBD1, 2, and 3 are routinely found in normal oral epithelium of adults [75] . In addition, recombinant HBD2 and 3 were shown to directly inactivate HIV-1 [76] . A recent study in tonsil epithelial cells has demonstrated that simultaneous binding of heparan sulfate proteoglycans of epithelial cells to HBDs and viral gp120 initiates cointernalization of the defensins and the virions into endosomes and results in reduced HIV infectivity [77] . Following viral entry, HBD2 also blocks HIV-1 replication by preventing an accumulation of reverse transcription products [74] . Moreover, HBD2 and 3 exert anti-HIV-1 activity against both CCR5 and CXCR4 tropic HIV infections [74] . Mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1 most commonly occurs at the oral and gastrointestinal epithelia [78] . In fetal and infant oral epithelial tissues, a lack of HBD expression allows transmigration of virions within oral mucosa and increases the risk of HIV-1 transmission [79] . Both cell-free and cellassociated HIV-1 viral particles can transmigrate through fetal, but not adult, oral epithelium and infect permissive cells [80] , further highlighting the potent antiviral activity of HBDs in the adult oral environment.",8.96294931104397,6.883133519050631

It is now documented that it must be used not only in client-owned symptomatic cats but also in animals living in catteries or shelters where opportunistic infections are problematic. Although without a truly effect on the cytokine profile, this compound induces a significant clinical improvement and seems to reduce the pro-inflammatory stimuli. Particularly, for FIV-infected cats, this work presents a new oral rFeIFN-ω protocol, which was successfully tested and validated. Although it induces a significant clinical improvement, its overall action as an immune modulator is less than the subcutaneous protocol. In fact, it slightly decreases the pro-inflammatory stimuli without affecting the acquired immunity, or even other parameters of the innate response such as acute phase proteins. Therefore, whilst the high pulsate subcutaneous protocol is strongly recommended for symptomatic FIV-infected cats, this lower continuous oral protocol is a good alternative for cats presenting mild clinical signs, for cases where cost limits the use of licensed protocol or even for cats, which previously received subcutaneous rFeIFN-ω and require continuous immune modulation therapy.

Whereas some measures, such as free HIV testing for all pregnant women, encountered little pressure, some measures were upsetting to the public or other branches of the government, including the distribution of free needles and syringes through public health venues and voluntary community pharmacies, and the provision of free oral methadone as a maintenance treatment for heroin to avoid injection-related health consequences. These objections could be vehement, as the liberating ideas and practices of harm reduction (i.e., the government giving free needles and maintenance medications to active drug users) were simply unacceptable given the long tradition of suppression and prohibition in terms of illegal drug use.

For example, dietary supplementation with a low dose of creatine (as 3 g of creatine monohydrate per day) to adults can enhance the capacity of skeletal muscle to store energy by 16% [(142 -122)/122 = 16%] (Hultman et al. 1996) . The rate of utilization of creatine phosphate by the skeletal muscle of adult humans during intensive exercise is 23 mmol/L of muscle water/min (Baker et al. 2010) . This is equivalent to 483 mmol/whole-body skeletal muscle/ min (23 × 70 × 40% × 0.75 = 483) for a 70-kg adult with 21 L of muscle water. Through creatine recycling via creatine kinase, ingestion of 3 g of creatine monohydrate can help store 50 kcal energy in the skeletal muscle of a 70-kg person for supporting a 60-min intensive exercise (i.e., 483 mmol creatine phosphate/whole-body skeletal muscle/min × 20/1 42 = 68 mmol = 68 mmol × 12.3 kcal/mol × 0.001 × 60 min = 50 kcal). Thus, a small amount of supplemental creatine makes a very significant contribution to energy storage and metabolism in the skeletal muscle of humans to enhance the power and duration of muscular work. In support of this view, dietary supplementation with creatine to young adults decreases oxidative DNA damage and lipid peroxidation induced by a single bout of resistance exercise (Rahimi 2011) . Oral administration of creatine phosphate (20 g/day on days 1-3 and 10 g/day for days 4-42) offers a comparable ergogenic effect to that of equal amounts of creatine monohydrate (Peeters et al. 1999) .",8.626224454102905,9.333335734953778

Despite good application prospect of rLAB as therapeutic delivery vehicles, there are still many questions remaining unanswered, such as the dose of therapeutic protein delivered in situ by the rLAB after oral administration, the more effective immunization route (the intranasal route or the oral route), the best period of life (neonate or adult) [52] . This study is in the early stages of the FMD oral vaccines and needs more tests to enhance the immune effect. Further studies will be carried on larger animals which are susceptible to FMDV, such as swine and bovine, and the studies are required to consider immune effect comparison of the intranasal immunization and the oral immunization, the coexpression of larger fragments and cytokines.

[18] [19] [20] Persistent hyperammonemia in Morgan horses is suspected to be similar to a syndrome of hyperornithinemia, hyperammonemia, and homocitrullinuria (HHH) in humans. 18 These foals exhibit neurologic signs including seizure activity, aimless wandering, yawning, and circling. Supportive care, lactulose, and a low-protein diet resulted in temporary clinical improvement in one of two foals that was treated, however the foal relapsed and was euthanized. 18 Glycogen-branching enzyme deficiency has been recently attributed to a mutation in the glycogen branching enzyme 1 (GBE 1) gene in Quarter Horses. 20 The syndrome has recently been termed glycogen storage disease IV and is believed to be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, with clinically affected foals being homozygous for the mutation. 19, 20 Affected foals are sometimes stillborn, and otherwise exhibit flexural deformities, seizure activity, respiratory or cardiac failure, or recumbency. Leukopenia, hypoglycemia, and high serum CK, AST, and GGT concentrations were common, and all foals died by seven weeks of age. 19 The livers of affected foals contained periodic acid Schiff's (PAS)-positive intracellular inclusions and no GBE activity. An additional consideration for congenital hepatic disease is hepatoblastoma. 21 Polycythemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and increased liver enzymes occur with this liver neoplasm. 21 These foals may survive to weaning or adulthood, but hepatoblastoma has been reported in an aborted fetus and may thus be congenital. 22 Toxic hepatopathies have been reported in neonatal foals following administration of oral pastes contain-ing ferrous sulfate in the first one to two days of life. 23 Experimental administration of iron to foals confirmed that the hepatotoxicity from the oral paste was indeed due to the contained iron. 23, 24 Pathologic changes included liver atrophy, bile duct hyperplasia, lobular necrosis, cholestasis, and periportal fibrosis. Druginduced hepatopathies can also occur during this time period because of relatively immature hepatic function and increased absorption of macromolecules during colostral IgG absorption. 12 Oral medications should be used with caution in foals less than 24 hours of age because of the potential for increased bioavailability with subsequent hepatotoxicity. Other potential hepatotoxins reported in horses include aflatoxins, pyrrolizidine alkaloids, leukoencephalomalacia, and chlorinated hydrocarbons, although these are considered unlikely in the young foal because of lack of ingestion of feedstuffs by neonates. Steroid hepatopathy has been reported in three-and 10-year-old horses, secondary to intramuscular administration of high doses of triamcinolone acetonide in both cases. 25, 26 (Figure  11-36) .",11.817369081120514,8.411079524099119

Pharmacists should be both health generalists and health specialists, which will have an impact on public health. Even the American Public Health Association (1981) supports the pharmacists' role in public health. Should community pharmacists move beyond their traditional role? Even when dispensing medicines through paper-based prescription services, pharmacists should comply with some fundamental standards. Safety issues must be considered when dispensing medications. The Pharmacy Board of Australia published guidelines for medication dispensing (i.e., guidelines for scanned and faxed prescriptions and steps to take when handling Internet or mail-order dispensing); guidelines for dispensing extemporaneous medications; guidelines when handling errors (e.g., dispensing errors); guidelines for appropriate medication labeling; guidelines for patient counseling, privacy, and confidentiality; and pharmacy technicians' functions, responsibilities, and competencies (Pharmacy Board of Australia, n.d.). In addition, for pharmacies that use electronic and computer systems, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain (n.d.) has provided several guidelines and principles for good dispensing and appropriate dispensing procedures (e.g., professional checking, medication substitution, and labeling). Malaysia, a developing country, has also developed Guide to Good Dispensing Practice (Malaysian Pharmaceutical Services Division, 2016) . These guidelines aim to have both public and private facilities dispensing medications according to the law and guidelines, which may ensure that patients receive the correct medications, adherence is improved, adverse effects are minimized, and errors are avoided. The document's contents relate to processing prescriptions, preparing medications, labeling, recoding, and issuing medications to the patient.

First, we are expecting more work that bridges within-vs. betweenhost dynamics (e.g. Lythgoe & Fraser 2012) . This is important because considerable genetic variation is created and selected for within the host; however, the within-host processes of short-lived infections have not yet received sufficient attention. We are expecting more within-host work, including time series and deep samples for pathogens that are traditionally studied at the between-host level. The M. tuberculosis work described in this review is a good example, but new within-patient work on influenza is also being done (Rogers et al. 2015) . Second, with deeper samples and more time series, it should become increasingly possible to estimate selection pressures on pathogens and to estimate epistatic interactions between mutations. For some of this work, methods that are currently used for identifying mutations and evaluating selection in viruses grown in cell culture (Lou et al. 2013; Foll et al. 2014 ) will hopefully find use in clinical samples taken from infected patients.

Both of these characteristics are especially true for VLPs of NoV because their cognate viruses are natural gastrointestinal pathogens.

No mention was made in the article about adverse effects in any of the study arms. Concerns expressed by subsequent letter responses challenged the use of nonstandard allopathic medications as control, pointing out that the combination of oral salmeterol and theophylline poses known cardiovascular risks to COPD patients, and expressed concern about the issue of heavy metal poisoning associated with plant-based Ayurvedic medicines. Drosera species have been used for hundreds of years for respiratory tract problems, and it is a fairly commonly used medicine as a solitary ingredient or as part of combination medications in roughly 200 to 300 registered medications. Testing of individual Drosera constituents reveals antiinflammatory, antispasmodic, and antibacterial effects, with minimal adverse effects although safety data are limited. Although purported to have some evidence of antitumor and antiinflammatory effects, Bryonia has been rated as unsafe with serious gastrointestinal, renal, and neurologic adverse effects reported. Ipecac is well known in the United States from its previously recommended role as an emetic in cases of suspected pediatric poisoning.

These factors increase the risk of treatment failure, and hence need for hospital admission, and should be part of the clinical decision making regarding need for hospital admission. 21 Admission to the ICU is appropriate in many patients with severe CAP who require high level of care. The Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society guidelines for CAP management from 2007 proposed criteria for severe CAP. Major criteria include mechanical ventilation and septic shock. There are nine minor criteria, including CURB components, as well as hypothermia, PaO 2 :FiO 2 ratio of 250 or less, bilateral or multilobar infiltrates, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. One major criteria or 3 minor criteria indicate the need for ICU admission. In addition, a CURB-65 of greater than 3 may indicate severe pneumonia and the potential need for intensive care. 32 For LTCF residents, most mild to moderate pneumonia can be treated in the LTCF, and the decision to transfer the patient to an acute care facility is based on both clinical assessment, LTCF management availability (chest radiograph availability, intravenous treatment, physician availability), and social considerations. Loeb and colleagues 107 demonstrated that an intervention that included initial assessment of patient eligibility to be treated in the LTCF, followed by early imaging, oral antibiotic treatment, as well as intensive maintenance of hydration and oxygenation in, resulted in reduced hospitalization rate (18% compared with 30% in the usual care group) and costs, and did not impact mortality rates. According to expert panel recommendations from the Infectious Diseases Society of America in 2008, LTCF residents who have suspected pneumonia and an increased respiratory rate (>25/min) as well as hypoxemia (pulse oximetry <90%) should be transferred to the hospital, as should persons with imaging findings that require more intensive management (pleural effusion, heart failure). Residents should also be transferred to an acute care facility when critical diagnostic tests or necessary therapies are not available in the LTCF. In addition to these considerations, when considering site of care for LTCF residents, the patient's desire to be transferred to an acute care facility and intensively treated is another factor to consider. 51, 86 Antibiotic Treatment",10.852547326280494,7.942344112702049

Systemic steroids, administered orally or parenterally on a chronic basis, are associated with a long list of adverse effects, many of which are potentially more serious than the disease they are being used to treat. These side effects are listed in Table 11 . One important side effect that is sometimes forgotten is osteonecrosis. While corticosteroid-induced osteonecrosis is more common in autoimmune diseases and transplant patients than in asthma, one should still have a high index of suspicion when treating an asthmatic child who has been on steroids for a long time [88] . Generally speaking, a short course of steroids to treat an asthma exacerbation is acceptable from a risk benefit standpoint. In this case, if the corticosteroid course is less than 7 days, no tapering of dose is needed. A tapering schedule should be formulated for those patients in whom steroids are being used for longer than 1 week. If the patient requires multiple courses of steroids, then the possibility of developing serious side effects should be considered. There are several corticosteroids available to treat asthma exacerbations. These are shown in Table 10 . Many of the oral preparations have a very bad taste and may need to be disguised in foods in order to be able to administer them to young children. There is also available at least one form in an oral disintegrating tablet, which will facilitate compliance in young children.",13.178563996843664,11.32657303575899

The evaluation and management is typically guided by the likely cause based on the history and physical examination. Although clinical experience suggests acute dystonia is relatively rare in children, one of the more common causes is exposure to medications. Commonly implicated medications include dextromethorphan, cisapride, and metoclopramide. Treatment for medication-induced acute dystonia is often accomplished by administering 1.25 mg/kg (up to 50 mg) of intravenous or intramuscular diphenhydramine.

A single 50 mg/kg dose of intravenous of intramuscular ceftriaxone may be given to children who are vomiting, unable to tolerate oral medications, or are unlikely to be adherent to initial doses of antibiotics [22] . Oral antibiotics may be started 24 h after this parenteral dose, to complete the course of therapy. For additional details regarding treatment of children with ABRS, including treatment in patients with penicillin allergies, the reader is referred to the AAP Guidelines [22] .

Greene, J. Mauskopf, C. Roberts, T. Zyczynski, H. Schlamm (Boston, Research Triangle Park, New York, US) Objective: We estimate the cost-effectiveness of alternative initial drug treatments of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) in suspected earlier and later lung involvement, based on the presence or absence of the halo sign on thoracic computed tomography (CT). Methods: We constructed a decision analysis model comparing 12-week treatment outcomes for a subset of patients enrolled in a clinical trial of initial treatment of IPA with amphotericin B dexoycholate (AmBd) vs voriconazole (VOR). Patients included those with suspected lung involvement who underwent a baseline thoracic CT. The subset was subdivided into two groups based on the presence or absence of a characteristic CT halo sign, a perimeter of ground glass CT opacity surrounding a solid lung nodule ‡1 cm diameter, known as an early indicator of IPA. Healthcare resource use and survival data were obtained directly from the clinical trial. US unit costs for drugs and health care services were applied from standard data sources. Cost and survival at 12-weeks were estimated for those with and without a halo sign at baseline. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios comparing VOR to AmBd were calculated for both patient subgroups. Sensitivity of results to uncertainty in health care use and cost estimates was tested. Results: Patients in the halo subgroup had better survival than those in the no-halo subgroup (70.6% vs 54.4%), with lower total treatment cost ($44,352 vs $47,077) . Survival was higher for VOR than for AmBd in both patient subgroups (halo: 75.3% vs 65.2%; no-halo: 68.3% vs 39.5%). In the halo subgroup, total costs were lower for those treated with VOR than for those treated with AmBd ($40,380 vs $48,985) . In the no-halo subgroup, total cost per patient was slightly higher for those treated with VOR ($48,133 vs $45,938) . Accounting for the difference in survival, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for VOR compared to AmBd was $7,625 per additional 12-week survivor in this subgroup. Conclusions: Earlier identification and treatment of IPA appears to result in better survival and potentially lower costs than later treatment. Initial treatment of IPA with VOR improves survival in patients with early or late disease compared with AmBd, is cost saving in the halo sub-group, and is cost-effective in the no-halo subgroup, within the constraints of our analysis. Objective: To describe and compare the nursing labor time required for preparation and administration of liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB), amphotericin B deoxycholate (AmBd), and voriconazole (VOR). Methods: Activities associated with nurse preparation and administration of the three study drugs were timed by trained observers at five hospitals (one in Italy, three in France, and one in the United Kingdom). Target tasks were classified as those likely to be affected by the difference between the drugs and excluded those tasks likely to differ because of site-specific factors (e.g., travel time to a patient room in different hospitals). Target tasks included: obtain supplies and medications; prepare medications; educate patient; administer medications; monitor for adverse events; and prepare follow-up medications. The mean times for administration of a single day of study drug were summarised and compared, accounting for a single daily dose of L-AmB and AmBd and 2 daily doses of VOR IV or oral. Results: Sixty-nine patients were observed receiving 256 doses of study medications at the five hospitals. Time of administration in minutes per day was 20, 16, 14, and 3 for L-AmB, AmBd, VOR IV, and VOR oral, respectively. Administration time was significantly lower for VOR IV compared with L-AmB (P < 0.05) and for VOR oral compared to all IV regimens (P < 0.05). The task of preparation of medications required the most time for IV formulations, and was longer in the L-AmB group than the others (L-AmB: 12 mins vs AmBd: 7 mins; VOR IV: 9 mins). AmBd required more time for patient monitoring and administration of followup drugs than other formulations (AmBd: 7 mins vs L-AmB: 4 mins; VOR IV: 2 mins). Conclusion: VOR IV required significantly less time to prepare and administer on a daily basis compared to L-AmB. Measurements of IV antifungal versus oral VOR administration suggest the opportunity to save 10-17 minutes per day by switching to oral therapy when possible.",14.009888873743568,9.762470467077339

Factors such as patient compliance to oral medication and outpatient social support Pneumonia in Adults systems should be taken into account. The ATS has also developed criteria to assist in the decision making regarding which patients require higher-level monitoring or an ICU admission directly from the ED. 7 The PSI uses a 2-step approach to risk assessment. Patients are first identified as low-risk and recommended for outpatient management. The low-risk patients are those less than 50 years, who do not have significant comorbid conditions, and who have no concerning features on physical examination. Patients who do not meet these low-risk criteria are then classified into categories based on age, comorbid illness, abnormal physical examination findings, and laboratory abnormalities. Scoring is divided into 5 classes and each class is associated with a predicted mortality: class 1, points 0, mortality 0.1%; class 2, points less than 70, mortality 0.6%; class 3, points 71-90, mortality 2.8%; class 4, points 91-130, mortality 8.2%; class 5, points greater than 130, mortality 29.2%. Classes 1, 2, and 3 are considered low-risk patients, class 4, moderate-risk, and class 5, high-risk. Hospital admission is recommended for those patients who score more than 91 (class 4). This score has been shown to decrease overall admission rates and decrease health care costs. 34 However, the scoring system does not consider dynamic observation of patients over time, the ability to take oral medications, home supports, and access to follow-up.",15.015374621076838,9.548066256556123

For example, the pharmacy would document that the dispensary had received 5,000 tabs of Ibuprofen, but not how many or to whom those tabs had been dispensed. While only a small portion of the medications had barcodes printed on the packaging, we were able to create a simple barcoding system by labeling the shelf on which the medications were stored at the dispensation window. We arbitrarily assigned medication ID numbers to all drugs in the pharmacy and printed barcoded labels for each section of the shelf. Using these barcodes to identify medications being dispensed, and patient identifi ers in barcode form on the patients' health passports, pharmacy technicians were able to record patient-level dispensation of medication in real-time using a touchscreen computer located at each of the four dispensation windows in the pharmacy.",10.40937360322168,7.453393237476464

We identified for the first time that a number of other non-infectious exposures occurred within 6 months of the first signs of illness, including medications, many of which are potentially myopathic or photosensitizing, immunizations, stressful life events and sun exposure. The main novel findings of this study were differences in some exposures by age at diagnosis, delay to diagnosis, race, disease course and autoantibody phenotypes. For example, children younger than the median age at the time of diagnosis had a higher frequency of documented infections, whereas older children had a higher frequency of stressful life events in the months before illness onset. Patients without a myositis autoantibody had a higher frequency of infections in the 6 months before illness onset than was seen in patients with anti-p155 or anti-SRP autoantibodies, whereas patients with anti-SRP autoantibodies had a greater number of documented exposures than patients without a myositis autoantibody. These findings suggest that environmental exposures may differ by phenotype, and that they could be useful in understanding pathogeneses [1] . We found that an infectious illness, particularly a respiratory infection, frequently occurs within several months before juvenile myositis onset, supporting the findings of other studies of exposures temporally associated with the onset of JDM. In one study, a prospective registry of patients within 6 months of illness onset in which data were based on a parent environmental interview and medical record review, respiratory infections were identified within 3 months of illness onset in 57% of patients [16] .

Potentially, for example, fronts that combine disciplines and challenge existing paradigms will have more difficulty being absorbed and may, in aggregate, presage paradigm shifts (Kuhn 1970) .

The research on explicit collaboration between scientists has emphasized the value of cross-company alliances, informal networks, and social capital (Gittelman 2003) . Interdisciplinary work, as a process for sharing information and as an inspiration for analogies, is often seen as one of the drivers of innovation (Amir 1985; Birnbaum 1981a, b; Ponzi 2002) .

Antimalarial medication should be started only for patients with a definitive malaria diagnosis. However, death from severe malaria is basically a rule rather than an exception (mortality is defined 100 %, particularly in cerebral malaria) and falls to 10-20 % with appropriate antimalarial therapy. Therefore, empiric treatment might be initiated when either severe P. falciparum infection is suspected or there is no clearly identified alternative diagnosis. Parenteral antimalarial therapy is essential in the initial treatment of severe malaria. The cinchona alkaloids (quinine and quinidine) and the artemisinin derivatives (artesunate and artemether) are two major classes of drugs for parenteral treatment. Artemisinin derivatives clear parasitemia more rapidly, and they are effective against a broader range of parasitic stages and species. However, artemisinin-based combination therapy is not widely available and the CDC recommends parenteral quinidine for severe malaria in these cases. Intravenous or intramuscular artesunate should be administered at least for 24 h until the patient can tolerate oral medications.

Malarial infections caused by P. falciparum and P. vivax may be prevented with the prophylactic use of mefloquine hydrochloride. Mefloquine hydrochloride has been linked to neurological side effects (dizziness, tinnitus, and balance problems) and psychiatric side effects (hallucinations, having the feeling of anxiousness, depression, or mistrustfulness). A five year study conducted in Denmark examined the psychiatric adverse events associated with the use of mefloquine [38R] . Patients that reported possible psychiatric side effects were assessed with SCL-90-R tool. Using the SCL-90-R, the study found clinical significance for anxiety, phobic anxiety, and depression for patients receiving mefloquine. The study found that women experienced hallucinations more often than men. The study also found that neurological side effects can become long term and sometimes even permanent side effects. As a result, the FDA has issued a black box warning about the neurological and psychiatric side effects. If a patient develops neurological or psychiatric symptoms while taking mefloquine for the prevention of malaria, the patient should discuss his symptoms with his physician and the physician should consider discontinuing the use of mefloquine and using an alternative drug [39S,40] . The study of Stienlauf et al. was designed to examine the interactions between chronic medications used in the treatment of pre-existing disease states and medications used for prophylaxis in patients traveling to developing countries. The study was a retrospective cohort that evaluated mefloquine, primaquine, doxycycline, atovaquone/proguanil, fluoroquinolone antibiotics, rifaximin, azithromycin, and acetazolamide to determine if there were interactions with chronic medications. This was a large study of over 16 000 individuals. Fluoroquinolones, as well as azithromycin, were shown to most commonly have drug-drug interactions with chronic medications. About 45% of study subjects were given a preventative medication that interacted with at least one of their chronic medications.

At the global level, international policies regulate trade in goods. As this partially predicts income distribution, governance, trade, and income are closely intertwined. At the national level, income mediates the effect of global governance on population health. A classic example is the debate over generic pharmaceutical production in developing countries that arose over the need for antiretroviral (ARV) medication for HIV. Under the TRIPS agreement created by the WTO, the production of patented medications was prohibited at the global level. The result was that national access to expensive medications was determined by national income; rich countries could afford to buy life-saving medication for their populations and poor countries could not. To pursue this example to the community level, countries with enough income to purchase limited supplies of ARVs might offer better health outcomes to high income communities that could afford the high prices. Alternatively, these nations might choose other distribution criteria, offering the medications to government employees or to those seeking care at a certain health facility. It is easy to understand how, in a community with high HIV prevalence, differential access to ARVs might erode social cohesion and trust (Bennett & Chanfreau, 2005) . High medication prices may also divert resources from other necessities, such as food and school fees, producing resounding population health effects.",9.164249339951859,8.57266084724548

Lower tidal volumes (TV) are recommended than in the past years, when tidal volumes of 10-15 mL/kg were routinely used. This is thought to reduce barotrauma. An initial TV of 5-8 mL/kg of ideal body weight is generally recommended. The lower range is recommended in the presence of obstructive airway disease and ARDS.

A) Lorazepam 5 mg by mouth B) Haloperidol 10 mg intramuscular and lorazepam 2 mg intramuscular C) Haloperidol 5 mg PO D) Lorazepam 2 mg intramuscular E) Place IV fi rst Answer: B This is a medical emergency that requires rapid action, for patient, staff, and fellow patient safety. The acutely agitated patient often does not have IV access, and gaining access is often diffi cult. Both benzodiazepines and atypical antipsychotics have shown similar effectiveness in reducing aggression and time to sedation when use as single agents. Oral medications have been shown to have similar onset of action compared to intramuscular (IM) administration, are less invasive, and are more widely accepted by patients. However in this situation the risk of harm to patient and the staff is too high that attempting an oral route may not be successful. A few randomized trials have indicated that the combination of a benzodiazepine with a traditional or classic antipsychotic results in a more rapid onset of sedation with a similar adverse effect profi le. In this situation, a combination approach may be the most effective. This approach is commonly used by physicians in correctional facilities.

This concept is fundamental to safety in the microbiology laboratory and, if practiced, will prevent or reduce the contact of potentially infectious material with the skin or mucous membranes of laboratorians (1). Two key components of laboratory safety are proper hand hygiene (23) and the use of gloves when performing routine laboratory work with blood or other potentially infectious material or contacting surfaces potentially contaminated with these materials (1). Frequent hand hygiene is extremely important, and the hands should be washed with soap and water (or an alcohol-based product) after removal of gloves, after accidental skin contact with potentially infectious material, or after a break in a glove. Soap and water should be used when hands are visibly contaminated with potentially infectious material. Whether gloves should be required for routine bench work in the microbiology laboratory is a question that has been discussed for years. There is no doubt that laboratory surfaces are contaminated, (22) but to my knowledge, there is no specific regulation that requires the use of gloves while manipulating cultures.

While there is evidence of the involvement of specific fungal species in COPD [77, 78] and CF [79] [80] [81] , little is known of the airway fungal microbiota in the pathogenesis of asthma, COPD or CF. Moreover, even less is understood regarding potential interkingdom microbial interactions that may impact functional expression of the collective microbiome and in turn, host responses and manifestations of airway disease. The oral fungal microbiome was recently studied in 20 healthy individuals from whom oral rinse samples were analyzed using pan-fungal primers followed by pyrosequencing [66] . In total, 101 fungal species were identified and of these, in a given individual, only between nine and 23 were known culturable species. Candida spp. were the most frequently isolated, in 75% of subjects, followed by the genera Cladosporium, Aureobasidium, Saccharomycetales, Aspergillus, Fusarium and Cryptococcus. While four genera (Candida, Cladosporium, Aureobasidium and Saccharomycetales) were detected in at least ten subjects (50% of participants), the authors also suggest the existence of a 'basal' state oral mycobiome, consisting of 15 genera present in at least 20% of study subjects. However, a large number of diverse fungi were putatively identified in this study, with 53% of the identified genera observed only once across samples. These findings provide an initial baseline for studying fungal microbiota along the respiratory tract and demonstrate that within the oral cavity which houses a diversity of bacterial species, a diverse fungal microbiota can coexist. Future investigations of the fungal mycobiome in other respiratory niches such as the lower airways, and potentially in relation to chronic inflammatory airway disease, would be of great interest.",9.911974760061737,9.948927637197755

Previous studies demonstrated weight loss in calves fed only oral rehydration solutions, compared to weight gain in those that received milk in addition to oral rehydration (Fettman et al., 1986; Garthwaite et al., 1994) . Indeed, even hypertonic oral solutions (with a high concentration of glucose) cannot provide sufficient energy for maintenance and growth (Constable et al., 2001) . However, the severity or duration of diarrhea is not different between calves that receive milk in addition to oral rehydration compared with oral rehydration alone (Garthwaite et al., 1994) .

In addition, release of pro-inflammatory cytokines is also reduced by ribavirin. The in vitro activities of ribavirin on SARS-CoV are highly variable, depending on the type of cells used for antiviral assays. When tested on Vero cells, ribavirin demonstrated little-to-no activity on SARS-CoV, presumably due to the lack of phosphorylation of ribavirin in this cell line. However, ribavirin at clinically achievable concentrations possessed significant inhibitory activities when tested in other cell lines such as Caco-2. 31 Animal studies with ribavirin have not been encouraging. 25 The clinical benefits of ribavirin alone from the case series are likewise uncertain. Anaemia is the main adverse reaction associated with the use of ribavirin. In a Canadian cohort of 110 patients, 61% of those who received ribavirin had evidence of dose-related haemolytic anaemia, 46% had hypomagnesaemia, 58% developed hypocalcaemia and 29% had both hypocalcaemia and hypomagnesaemia. 32 Although ribavirin alone is unlikely to possess substantial antiviral activities at clinically used dosages, it may be considered for use in combination with other agents, especially type I interferons, which have synergistic activities with ribavirin when tested in vitro. 31, 33 Therefore, the use of ribavirin in this infection should be undertaken in clinical settings as part of a combination therapy.",11.159814911921153,9.718212846163675

For example, the entire team should routinely discuss the continuing need for intravenous and urinary catheters. In the pediatric hematology-oncology population, however, care may require a central venous catheter for months to years at a time. Further, to reduce line accesses, nurses and physicians will need to work together to bundle lab draws, and nurses, pharmacists, and physicians will need to work together to switch from intravenous to oral therapy.

Although potentially nonselective b-blockers are contraindicated in all people with asthma, only about 5% of those with asthma or up to 40% of people with asthma with nasal polyps are triggered by aspirin or NSAIDs. These patients are classified as having aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), which is also commonly known as Samter triad: asthma, aspirin sensitivity, and nasal polyps. [24] [25] [26] [27] Reactions to NSAIDs in those with AERD are classified as pseudoallergic because it is not a typical IgE-mediated reaction but rather is based on the common ability of NSAIDs and aspirin to inhibit the cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 enzyme. The pathophysiology of AERD is incompletely understood and most likely is related to overproduction of proinflammatory arachiadonic acid products, especially the leukotrienes. This is supported by the fact that medications that inhibit leukotriene synthesis and leukotriene receptor antagonists (eg, zileuton, montelukast) reduce or eliminate the bronchoconstrictive response to aspirin. [28] [29] [30] The diagnosis of AERD is based initially on clinical features being present. If Samter triad is present, the diagnosis can be relatively unambiguous, but more often only part of the triad is present or each part develops slowly over time making the association more difficult. 31 When suspicion of NSAID reaction is aroused, the physician should question the patient about any NSAID use after the first suspected reaction and whether any reaction occurred at that point, the reason being that NSAID sensitivity is acquired and thus prior nonreactivity is not as relevant. 26 Aspirin challenge is the only way to definitively diagnose NSAID sensitivity. There is an 80% likelihood of positive oral aspirin challenge with a history of a single NSAID reaction, which increases to 90% with history of two reactions. 32 Aspirin challenge is only needed in cases where a patient has ongoing regular need for NSAID therapy, such as rheumatologic disease or cardiovascular disease.

Most compounds suitable for oral administration are small molecule drugs formulated to release the active agent in the stomach or small intestine for absorption by the gut mucosa and eventual release into the circulatory system. This environment is quite harsh, and any drug delivered this way experiences wide swings in pH with prolonged exposure to a variety of nucleases, as well as proteases and lipases. While oral administration of siRNAs remains a lofty goal, it seems unlikely that true systemic delivery will be easily achieved, although Tillman and colleagues have reported some success with oral delivery of single-stranded ASOs. 290 Double-stranded siRNAs have a very high molecular weight and, even if such compounds survived the harsh gastrointestinal environment, they would be largely excluded from uptake by the gut epithelia and subsequent escape into the circulatory system. Therefore, this discussion of a common route of systemic delivery for small molecules is more appropriately highlighted under the heading of ""local delivery"" since oral administration of siRNAs may more easily find application to treat local diseases within the gastrointestinal system itself. Wilson and colleagues designed a thioketal delivery system that is selectively degraded in the presence of reactive oxygen species produced in the intestinal epithelium. 291 In this case, the orally-delivered siRNA targets Tnf, a proinflammatory cytokine which induces the intestinal inflammation required to release the siRNA from the thioketal delivery system. Colitis-induced mice were dosed by oral gavage with 0.23 or 2.3 mg/kg of siRNAs daily for 6 days and sacrificed on the 7th day to determine siRNA uptake and function in target tissue. The induced colon inflammation coupled with thioketal-formulated particles led to increased release of Cy5-labeled siRNAs selectively in regions of inflammation. Also, colonic Tnf levels were significantly reduced based on RT-qPCR analysis of mRNA in harvested tissue. In addition to the thioketal work, the same group also developed a PEI-condensed siRNA and PLGA nanoparticle delivery system for reducing TNF in inflamed colon tissue. 292 Anti-Tnf-siRNA nanoparticles showed a tenfold decrease in colonic TNF expression when dosed orally over the course of 4 days compared to control siRNAs.",8.83339871569456,7.890213155362939

Inhalational delivery of corticosteroids by use of MDI allows for local antiinflammatory activity while minimizing systemic absorption and the potential adverse effects that may arise. Systemic absorption of inhaled medications still occurs with some drugs; one study demonstrated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA) suppression in healthy cats receiving 250 µg flunisolide every 12 hours, 223 but another study of cats receiving 220 µg fluticasone every 12 hours showed no suppression. 40 Research using nebulized radiopharmaceutical agents has demonstrated that inhaled medications delivered using a face mask and spacer can be distributed throughout the lung fields of cats. 242 The most commonly used inhaled corticosteroid is fluticasone, although others are sometimes available (e.g., beclomethasone) and may be less expensive (but potentially less effective). Fluticasone has the longest half-life of the available inhalant corticosteroids, is the most potent, and is the least likely to be absorbed systemically. 205 The drug is available in three strengths per actuation, with the labeling varying by country: 44 or 50 µg, 110 or 125 µg, and 220 or 250 µg.

NSAIDs are indicated to control the pain and inflammation of toxemia (flunixin meglumine, 1.1 to 2.2 mg/kg IV). 1, 12 Oral administration of magnesium hydroxide and magnesium oxide (1 g/kg) may neutralize the acidic pH and is sufficient in mild cases. However, if much of the feed is still in the rumen, these two alkalizing agents will only work temporarily. Oral antibiotics have been recommended to kill rumen microflora and stop fermentation. We believe that these agents are contraindicated, however, because the gramnegative anaerobes that need to flourish to reestablish normal rumen microflora are susceptible to most antimicrobials effective against Lactobacillus species. Removing the substrate for growth of Lactobacillus organisms is more effective. Because orogastric tubes with largeenough bores for reflux of feedstuffs are too large for sheep and goats, rumenotomy is indicated in severe cases to remove the feed (see earlier under ""Rumenotomy"").

Subsequently, prevaccine era morbidity (15% to 20% hospitalization rates) returned. 5 Replacement ADV vaccines are under development but years away from licensure. ARD vaccine arsenals currently consist of measles-mumpsrubella, meningococcal, and influenza vaccines. 6, 7 The potential use of pneumococcal vaccines is being assessed for military use. 8 Despite vaccine preventive measures, military trainee and other populations living in close contact continue to suffer from respiratory disease outbreaks. 5,9 -13 Nonvaccine ARD interventions (NOVARDIs) have been considered since the beginning of the U.S. Army, when a 1777 regulation limiting to six the number of soldiers permitted inside a tent was enacted due to military physicians' belief that crowding caused disease. 14 NOVARDIs used and considered for ARD control included antimicrobials and other medications; herbal and dietary supplements; management of work, rest, and sleep periods; handwashing; respiratory masks; and many administrative and engineering measures to limit contact between people, and decrease the concentration of potentially harmful agents in the environment. This study focuses on prevention of communicable respiratory diseases, and NOVARDIs that would not significantly interfere with standard operating procedures for training programs nor require human-use study protocols (such as for a study of medications or herbal supplements).

Because many of the toxic effects of antiretroviral medications may be worse early in the course of treatment and are dose dependent, lowering the dose in this period may allow therapy to continue. However, optimal antiretroviral activity is usually dose dependent, particularly with PIs, and development of resistance of HIV-1 is a very real danger, so monitoring of both clinical and virologic status is important. Changing antiretroviral agents may be preferable to lowering doses. Evaluation of the overlapping toxicities of different medications and their effects on drug metabolism may allow successful continuation of the most critical agents. In this regard, patients should be asked about other unrecorded or nontraditional agents they may be taking. Severe or prolonged complications require discontinuation of individual agents, as does the development of hypersensitivity reactions with abacavir. Gastrointestinal symptoms are common and may be quite difficult to resolve.

In general, gastrointes-tinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, often occur early in the course of therapy and may abate over time. Gastrointestinal toxicity significantly limits the initial tolerance to protease inhibitors, often requiring dose escalation and sequential addition of other medications, such as nucleoside analogue RTI. Hepatic toxicity is more often associated with long-term therapy and is typically mild, although severe hepatic toxicity, particularly with the protease inhibitor ritonavir, may require discontinuation of the medication. 162 Pancreatitis is a more specific complication of individual drugs. As in other immunocompromised hosts treated with multiple medications, such as organ and marrow transplant patients, rates of toxic reactions ascribed to each drug may be confounded by concomitant administration of 2 or more drugs.

Sodium balance and the dysnatremias,"The oral electrolyte solution must contain an alkalinizing agent, such as acetate, propionate, or bicarbonate, at a concentration range of 40 to 80 mM/L. [39] [40] [41] Acetate-containing fluids are as effective as bicarbonate-containing solutions at correcting mild to moderate acidosis: [acetate-= CH 3 COO − ] + H + + 2O 2 ↔ 2CO 2 + 2H 2 O. Acetate must be metabolized to be effective, and metabolism may be impaired in severely dehydrated or acidemic animals, although this has not been proven in severely dehydrated calves. Acetate-or propionatecontaining fluids can be fed with milk as acetate and propionate do not raise abomasal pH or inhibit milk clotting. In comparison, bicarbonate containing oral electrolyte solutions, when fed without milk, excessively alkalinize the abomasum and proximal small intestine, decreasing the effectiveness of the ""abomasal sterilizer"" in killing ingested enteric pathogens, and potentially promoting enterotoxigenic E. coli attachment to epithelial cells and STa enterotoxin production. Moreover, bicarbonate does not inhibit growth of Salmonella in the intestinal lumen, whereas acetate and propionate both inhibit Salmonella growth. However, it is important to note that bicarbonate-containing oral electrolyte fluids are theoretically more effective at rapidly correcting severe acidemia than acetate and propionate, because bicarbonate reacts directly with H + ions (HCO 3 − + H + ↔ H 2 CO 3 ↔ H 2 O + CO 2 ). The main disadvantage of bicarbonate-containing oral fluids is that the pH of the abomasum (a natural defense mechanism) is increased, raising concerns that bicarbonate may decrease the ability to form a clot in the abomasum. This theoretical disadvantage regarding bicarbonate does not appear to be true, at least when low concentration bicarbonate solutions (25 mmol/L) are fed. 37 The alkalinizing potential of an oral electrolyte solution can be estimated by calculating the effective SID of the formulation as fed. Because electroneutrality must be preserved at all times, the difference between the charge assigned to all strong cations in an oral electrolyte solution (usually only sodium and potassium) and strong anions in an oral electrolyte solution (usually only chloride) is called the effective SID and reflects the concentration of metabolizable strong anions, such as acetate, propionate, and citrate, as well as the concentration of bicarbonate. 39 Oral electrolyte solutions should have an effective SID of approximately 40 to 80 mmol/L. Electrolyte solutions with an effective SID = 0 are acidifying because they create a systemic strong ion acidosis; such solutions are not recommended for the treatment of dehydrated calves with diarrhea.",9.531928490752867,8.043933291141403

Intra-oral; microbial VOCs from microbial biofilms that are encountered in the oral cavity,0.16897273038304422,4.3010969161987305,3.8619332313537598,58820e0b-dfb5-465b-8dc9-48ce17374722,custom_license/TOPICAL REVIEW Microbial volatile compounds in health and disease conditions,"Human breath will contain VOCs that have originated from more than one source within the respiratory system. Three main VOC sources can be identified: (1) exogenous sources; VOC's inspired from background ambient gases and then expired again, (2) Extra-oral; from microbes further down the respiratory tract (oropharynx, bronchioles), or else bloodcirculatory VOC's that enter the lungs and, through gaseous exchange, are removed from the body, and (3) Intra-oral; microbial VOCs from microbial biofilms that are encountered in the oral cavity. Exogenous sources depend on the ambient gases around the time and place of the sample streams, and may include industrial-synthetic sources or else VOCs emitted from plants, animals or microbes in the vicinity of the sample. The other two sources (extra-oral and intra-oral) can be differentiated by comparing lung gas samples (e.g. collected via nose) with samples obtained from the mouth, following a period of 'holding' the gas within the mouth (by breathing through the nose) to allow for phase equilibration with the aqueous phase (typically one or two minutes) and finally sampling the mouth gas after this period. The majority of human subjects with halitosis (80 to 90%) have oral malodour because of microbial activity from biofilms within the oral cavity (Miyazaki et al 1995) . For extra-oral halitosis, (about 5-10% of all cases of halitosis), then the majority of patients have blood-borne halitosis (Tangerman and Winkel 2010) . Blood-borne halitosis is frequently caused by odorous VSCs, in particular dimethyl sulfide (CH 3 SCH 3 ). Extra-oral halitosis can potentially be a manifestation of a more serious disease, for which treatment is much more complicated than for intra-oral halitosis. Potential sources of (non-microbial) halitosis include liver and kidney diseases, metabolic disorders, medications and certain foods (Greenman and Saad 2009), and most of these VOCs are therefore produced by the mammalian system (van den Veld et al 2007a). It is therefore of utmost importance to differentiate between intra-oral and extra-oral halitosis. For malodour to be perceived as noticeable and unpleasant, the VOCs in question must be well above the threshold concentration for smell detection by the perceiver. The relative 'smell' of a pure compound can be determined by accurate dilution of the VOC in question to the point where a panel of judges can just detect it. The degree of dilution necessary to reach this point is a measure of the olfactory power (p ol value) of the compound in question (Greenman et al 2004) . The main unit of measurement (p ol by volume) is defined as the negative log of the threshold concentration expressed in volumic or molar fractions, for example, 1 ppm = p ol 6, whilst 1 ppb = p ol 9 (Devos et al 1990). Approximate averaged standardized thresholds have been published for a number of compounds (Devos et al 1990) .",14.130511757109122,10.25164871089731

The major challenges for drug delivery to the brain are the low permeability of the BBB and its role as the natural brain-protective layer against the entry of foreign substances and blood microbes Monopoli et al., 2012) . The usage of polymeric nanoparticles has demonstrated that they are potentially noninvasive drug carriers that can cross the BBB and enter into the brain (Ong et al., 2014; Patel et al., 2014) . The antitubercular drug-loaded nanoparticle has the capacity to enter into the Mycobacterium tuberculosis organism and produce a potent efficacy against tuberculosis (TB) (Garg et al., 2015a; Pandey et al., 2003) . The oral administration (five oral doses every 10 days) of coencapsulated poly (DL-lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles with antitubercular drugs (e.g., rifampin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide) produces complete bacterial clearance from the organs compared to conventional TB drugs in mice and guinea pigs (Pandey et al., 2003; Sharma et al., 2004) . Moreover, the oral administration of poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles encapsulating ethionamide produces a potent tissue distribution and manages multidrug-resistant TB. And, the sustained release of ethionamide for 6 days in plasma comparable to the 6-h plasma concentration of free ethionamide in mice has been shown (Kumar et al., 2011) .

Most infections are pulmonary including pneumonia, and abscess with cavitation. Symptoms are typical of lung infections but also may include headache and diarrhea. A legionella urinary antigen test and culture of lower respiratory secretions on selective media are used for diagnosis. Empiric treatment for Legionella is appropriate while waiting for results. Quinolone antibiotics, such as levofloxacin, are preferred over macrolides in renal transplant patients because of drug interactions between macrolides and immunosuppressive medications. Initially given intravenously, quinolone antibiotics can be quickly deescalated to oral treatment when the patient has defervesced.

The injury of normal tissues is the major limitation of using cyclophosphamide (CP), a cytotoxic alkylating agent that has been widely used in the treatment of various neoplastic diseases and autoimmune disorders. Meanwhile, lack of detoxifying enzymes, aldehyde oxidase and aldehyde dehydrogenase in the lungs is a cause of selective CP toxicity to lung tissue.

We showed that this is also true for other HCW types, who on the average had even more total work-related contacts than nurses. Furthermore, we found that many of the interactions involving HCWs are effectively new contacts, i.e. persons they do not meet daily or even weekly. By contrast, community-based working adults largely work with the same set of individuals on a daily basis. The right-skewed distribution for community-based working adults ( Figure 2C) suggests that a small minority have much higher numbers of work-related contacts, including new contacts; these may represent individuals in other service industries. However, while severely ill individuals are less likely to use services such as retail and food-and-beverage in the community, they will almost always present to e and moreover have physical interactions at e health facilities. The large number of new work-related physical contacts increases HCWs' risk of encountering and hence acquiring an infectious disease, especially because they provide healthcare services to patients who potentially present with an infection. Moreover, the large number of new contacts reported by HCWs implies that non-HCW contacts encountered at health facilities by an infectious individual would also mostly be new contacts. This may be what makes the healthcare setting a potent amplifier for certain types of infection. HCWs been reported to have a higher infection rate for influenza, measles, and tuberculosis [18e20]. In recent years, the possible role of the health facility in amplifying transmission for emerging infections such as SARS, MERS-CoV, and Ebola virus disease has also been highlighted, with nosocomial transmission being implicated in several large outbreaks [8e10, 21, 22] . We believe that nosocomial amplification arises partially because of the high numbers of new contacts among HCWs, and other patients and their visitors, which potentially allows the infection to spread beyond the immediate family members of an infectious individual [8, 23] .",8.876742314102344,6.724457991898787

They follow the regulations of local and national government, and provide prescription medications dispensing service and other pharmacy-related services. Retail pharmacies in China provide some prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, supplements, and health-related products and devices for sale. They are not considered part of the healthcare system as they practice follow different companies' regulations. The professional skills of pharmacy staff and pharmacists work in these retail pharmacies varies significantly, and are generally not considered as healthcare professionals. 4 Special needs of PC services during the COVID-19 pandemic During the COVID-19 pandemic, the need of PC services is beyond the scope of traditional practice of community pharmacists, which can be divided into two parts: the need of pandemic prevention and control and the need from patients of pharmacy-related issues. To promote the pandemic control, community patients need to be screened properly and suspected patients shall be referred to designated medical institutions in a timely manner. 5 The public also need to master effective personal protection skills to control the community transmission of COVID-19. 2,6,7 Patients on medical isolated observation or patients with mild COVID-19 on treatment at home are lacking guidance on home care strategies. 8 The pharmacy-related needs of community patients have similarities with the traditional patient population, but with different emphasis. For example, when providing consulting services to community patients, instead of focusing on medications as usual, their questions are mainly on the scientific prevention knowledge and basic information about COVID-19, such as mask selection and typical signs and symptoms of COVID-19. For chronic disease patients, especially those in communities under quarantine, drug supply and patients' compliance are facing a greater challenge, though the safety and effectiveness of treatment is also important for this patient population. Thus, community pharmacists shall learn to switch gears when needed from providing professional knowledge on medication use only to fulfilling community patients' various needs.",10.247069859849844,8.497305699707669

However, in younger children and for smaller doses, the use of oral liquids may be the only solution. Oral liquids should be mea-sured in appropriately sized devices. Often, especially in infants, doses may be so small that accurate measurement becomes challenging. Doses less than 1 mL are ideally measured in 1 mL (or even 0.5 mL) oral syringes in order to maximize accuracy. Typically, manufacturer guidance dictates that doses <10% of the syringe size cannot be accurately measured (e.g., no less than 0.1 mL in a 1 mL syringe or 0.05 mL in a 0.5 mL syringe). Occasionally, unique solutions to measurability issues need to be explored. Very small doses of some injectable products (e.g., enoxaparin doses <10 mg) may be most easily measured using an insulin syringe (e.g., 1 unit = 0.01 mL = 1 mg enoxaparin). Very small doses of oral medications only available in capsules may require (very careful) preparation of powder papers which involves weighing of powders from capsules and packaging in specially folded papers.

We refer to this reconceptualisation as the border 'within'. These nodes have emerged following air travel liberalisation, as regional airports -across the globe -increasingly host international flights (Maertens, 2010) . We argue that these transformations in international passenger air travel have significant implications for the geographies of public health preparedness. Moreover, these changing patterns of aeromobility have been complicated by UK government reforms, including the proposed devolution of many of the PCT functions to multiple GPled consortia and the absorption of the work of the HPA into the DH.

First, to gain control of the underlying disease process, or to achieve a state of disease remission (eg, in status asthmaticus, or in patients with chronic stable asthma who have had significant diminutions in lung function over more prolonged time periods). Second, to maintain this control (remission) for as long as possible with the least amount of side effects. These initial actions usually require high-dose ICS or, more frequently, systemic corticosteroids. Remittive therapy usually requires an oral corticosteroid burst [eg, 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg per day prednisone for 5 days (usual adult maximum is 40 to 60 mg/d)]. The duration of the burst will vary considerably among patients, but the goal should be to maximize lung function, minimize symptoms, and reduce the use of rescue medications. At the same time, an ICS medication should be started at doses sufficient to maintain the initial remission for prolonged periods of time. The dose and type of medication may be influenced by age (delivery systems, side effects), cost, and the familiarity of the clinician with the nuances of the various available products.

It is now well established that oral tolerance is a important natural physiological property of the immune system, whereby the host can avoid dangerous reactions such as DTH (delayed-type hypersensitivity) to ""non-dangerous"" antigens and other substances encountered in our daily diets (Mowat, 1987) . Oral tolerance has been viewed as a potential therapeutic strategy for preventing and treating autoimmune diseases such as T1DM when specific disease-inducing self antigens (autoantigens) such as glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) are identified. With greater patient acceptance of oral rather than systemic therapies (e.g., by injection) and antigen specific effects without toxic effects of general immunosuppression, oral tolerance remains an attractive strategy that merits further clinical testing. Oral tolerance has been shown to suppress several autoimmune diseases in animal models, including experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), uveitis, thyroiditis, myasthenia, arthritis and T1DM in the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse, as well as other inflammatory conditions such as allergy and transplantation (Faria and Weiner, 2005) . Oral tolerance induction has been further tested in human autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), uveitis and T1DM. The results of human trials suggest that there is no systemic toxicity or exacerbation of disease (Faria and Weiner, 2005) . As induction of oral tolerance requires repeated administration of large doses of antigen, however, clinical application of oral tolerance strategies may be restricted by the potentially huge cost of producing autoantigens. A new expression platform that provides large amounts of functional protein at extremely low cost is highly desired to make oral tolerance a more efficient and affordable therapeutic regimen. Transgenic plant expression systems have the potential to produce not only large amounts of protein economically, but also to be used as a vehicle for direct oral delivery of minimally processed peptides or proteins to induce oral tolerance.",12.058833820421503,8.707656282166294

The first publication on plant-based vaccine antigen expression was with HBsAg in transgenic tobacco (Mason et al. 1992) . After optimization of HBsAg expression in transgenic potato tubers (Richter et al. 2000) , its oral immunogenicity in mice (albeit dependent upon inclusion of CT; Kong et al. 2001) , encouraged a human trial. Due to FDA concerns that immunologically naïve subjects might experience antigenic tolerance after ingestion of HBsAg, the clinical study used HBsAg seropositive volunteers who had been previously vaccinated with the yeast recombinant HBsAg (Thanavala et al. 2005) . Titers of anti-HBsAg in serum were increased in 9/17 and 10/16 volunteers who consumed 2 or 3 doses of transgenic potatoes, respectively, with each dose containing roughly 850 lg HBsAg.

One worth mentioning is nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC). After the development and success of SLN, a number of problems were identifi ed. Using a single type of solid lipid in the core of SLN led to the formation of a crystalline lattice over time that potentially reduced drugloading capacity [ 100 ] . Gelation of SLN also occurred after prolonged storage [ 101 ] and NLC were created as a way to reduce these problems. NLC use a mixture of solid and liquid lipids to create an imperfect core environment so there is more space to accommodate drugs, while still maintaining a solid state [ 104 , 150 ] . It can therefore be said that NLC are a second-generation lipid-based nanoparticle formulation [ 100 ] . Due to the relatively new development of NLC, there has not been as extensive study into the targeting of NLC to the GALT, but research has begun in assessment for their targeting potential. One work studied the oral administration of NLC loaded with a lipophilic vasodilator [ 150 ] . The oral administration of these NLC resulted in a threefold increase in bioavailability of the loaded drug compared to an aqueous suspension. This suggests that NLC activated an alternative absorption pathway, possibly also avoiding fi rst-pass metabolism, a frequent cause of low oral bioavailability for many lipophilic drugs [ 151 ] . It is therefore conceivable that immunomodulators can be loaded in NLC and targeted towards the GALT in a similar fashion.",11.401808562872331,7.402345971315237

Further, with the oral vaccine, there wasn't a significant anamnestic response following the secondary immunization. This may be due to the induction of hAd5-specifc immunity, which prevented virus infection or uptake by mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue. The parenteral DSE-specific vaccine induced antibody responses that were also detectable in nasal secretions and cerebrospinal fluid.36 The failure of the oral vaccine to induce detectable humoral responses within either nasal secretions or CSF [data not shown] may be attributable to the induction of a much lower systemic antibody response. There are several options to increase the immunogenicity, and potentially protective capacity, of the hAd5 vector. These include optimizing the dose and timing of vaccination as well as incorporating accessory immunostimulatory proteins in the transgene, chemical modification or encapsulation of the recombinant virus to decrease degradation in gastrointestinal tract, and possibly reducing interference by vector immunity by increasing the interval between multiple immunizations.48-50",9.68941168609973,9.15785030542116

In this system, females have a preference for conspicuously colored males. These bright colors seem to be reliable indicators of male fitness, including resistance to parasites. Conditions of light penetration favor blue males in shallow depths and red males in deeper waters. The parasites encountered at different depths also vary in density and composition such that habitat-specific defenses could occur. Females from the depths prefer brighter red males whereas those from shallow water prefer brighter blue males, potentially leading to divergence, with visual cues playing a key role. This example points out the immunology may work in concert with a number of other forces such as predator avoidance or dietary preferences which all conspire to reinforce divergence of the two incipient species by visual means (Maan and Seehausen, 2010). Mating among hosts between different locations would break down these differences, but might be disfavored if the progeny had reduced resistance to any local set of parasites.",11.005958497910756,6.370164677635998

Acute changes in cough, sputum production, respiratory rate, or work of breathing are likely reliable markers of a respiratory exacerbation in PCD (as demonstrated in non‐CF bronchiectasis121), and oral antibiotics are recommended for mild exacerbations. Most physicians use a broad‐spectrum oral antibiotic (amoxicillin plus clavulinic acid or an equivalent cephalosporin) to target the common respiratory pathogens in children with PCD. Typically, at least 2–3 weeks of oral antibiotics are recommended in PCD, based upon other disorders with similar pathophysiology (protracted bacterial bronchitis,122 cystic fibrosis,123 and non‐CF bronchiectasis124). More severe exacerbations, or those failing oral therapy, may require parenteral antibiotics. Antibiotic choice should be guided by past respiratory cultures. Despite a lack of published evidence, inhaled antibiotics are also an option for acute PCD respiratory exacerbations, but these are usually reserved for patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. Eradication of initial positive Pseudomonas airway culture also seems prudent in PCD, although no evidence supports this practice.

ViroSAL has optimal activity at pH5.5 and is consequently suitable for use in environments close to this pH, such as skin, oral cavity and mucous membranes which are also relevant portals of infection. The present study demonstrated that ViroSAL has antiviral activity against HSV-1, EBV and orf viruses, all of which are pathogens of skin or mucous membranes and have a tropism for epithelial cells. Since ViroSAL has optimal activity at pH5.5, we also tested a range of epithelial cell systems that would physiologically have a lower pH than that of plasma, such as skin which has a pH of approximately 5 (Lambers et al., 2006) and the oral cavity which can have a pH of 6.5 or lower depending on the level of oral health. ViroSAL had strong antiviral activity against Semliki Forest and Zika viruses, which are transmitted via mosquitoes into the skin dermis. This is an important stage of the virus life cycle, in which it replicates in dermal cells before disseminating to the blood and then throughout the body (Hamel et al., 2015; Pingen et al., 2017) .",7.978942722935341,5.62092373549998
