As Emmanuel [24] has instructively noted, the historical record of physicians is decidedly mixed in this regard; indeed, it was in response to the vocal and mounting opposition to treating seropositive patients at the height of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the 1980s that the medical profession reconsidered the ongoing retrenchment of the duty to care.

Accelerated, continuous fractionation with 7-day-perweek courses has been studied and shown to provide excellent tumour control, particularly in head-andneck cases 10 . However, in the management of palliative patients, considerably fewer data are available on the suitability of weekend treatments and acceptable standards of care. A recent study into patterns of care demonstrated that the top three reasons for administering radiation urgently were myelocompression from spinal metastases, svco, and intracranial pressure from brain metastases 5 . These appear also to be the most common emergency conditions across other series 7 , and the data from the present study show similar correlation. It is well recognized that spinal cord compression and svco remain classified as ""emergency"" conditions, as does tumour obstruction or bleeding 11, 12 . These conditions are all documented within the cco guidelines-a situation that generally suggests that the intent for treatment in the present study complies with cco policy 1 . The occ departmental policy is different from that of cco: the department is bound by looser guidelines, without clear objectives for treatment on weekends and holidays. An example would be the statement ""when a delay in radiotherapy might compromise treatment outcome"" 2 . With that statement in the policy, some radiation oncologists could justify treating an impending cord compression over the weekend if they feel it may compromise outcome; other oncologists may not feel the same way. The retrospective nature of the study made it difficult to determine from case records the exact intent for treatment in these more ""grey"" areas, and thus, became a limitation of the research.

Resilient infrastructure includes not only physical strength but also back-up for the systems. However, no standard has been endorsed or enforced to ensure that healthcare facilities can resist natural disasters. In addition, back-up systems (e.g. electricity, water, and communication) were not fully considered when many hospitals were being built. For example the health facilities in the earthquake-prone areas of western and rural China rarely comply with the standards of construction, nor are their back-up systems required to resist natural disasters (23) . The 2008 Sichuan earthquake caused the collapse of 67.5% of healthcare buildings in the worst affected areas (24) . As a consequence, a large proportion of the county hospitals were destroyed or lost their critical systems.

These standards can be broadly categorized into medical standardization and technical standardization. Medical standardization is the employment of universally accepted medical terms, abbreviations, writing format, etc. Standardization of medical concepts and procedures enables improved performance of medical professionals in transfer, referral, and supportive care of patients [82] . A major effort in creating a standard definition of medical concepts and procedures was conducted by the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) and resulted in the creation of the System of Concepts to Support Continuity of Care, commonly referred to as ContSys (EN ISO 13940n). In a more targeted approach, the World Health Organization (WHO) has created a medical classification list that assigns codes to diseases, signs and symptoms, etc. The latest edition, ICD-10, contains more than 14,400 unique codes. This coding system is primarily intended to facilitate statistical international health surveys [82] . Technical standardization is the employment of software and hardware protocols and practices which enable the easy cross-system transfer and access of medical data. Transfer of data between medical facilities that may or may not be part of the same EHR system requires the establishment of standard protocols for communication, messaging, data structures, privacy, and security [82] . To meet these needs, various organizations have proposed different hardware and software standards for EHR systems. The international Organization for Standardization (ISO) has proposed the adoption of ISO/TS 18308 for EHR systems. Key features include interoperability with other EHR systems, storage of both structured and unstructured data, cross-software and hardware platform compatibility, storage of both administrative and clinical data, possibility of translation of stored information to different languages, and reliability data storage. In addition, ISO/TS 18308 mandates recording the chronology of actions by users as means of accountability and requires measures to ensure security and privacy by mandating user identification and different levels of access among other measures.",23.276260202513246,11.238537650192914

The level of reporting may also be influenced by the capacity of the local health systems, which can vary over time and space. During the West African Ebola epidemic, less than a third of cases were estimated to be reported [122] and severe cases were probably over-represented compared to mild cases. At the end of 2014, health-care capacity was exceeded in many parts of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone [14] , but new health-care facilities were subsequently built; hence the line-list of cases is likely to be more complete towards the end of the outbreak. Underreporting might also have been higher in this compared to previous Ebola outbreaks, during which the health-care systems were less overburdened. Systematic evaluation of the surveillance system [123] over different spatial units and time periods could help inform the level of underreporting. In addition, joint analysis of genetic sequence and surveillance data can provide insight into the degree of underreporting [124] .

Shin et al. [30] found that the standard precaution adherence rates of nurses in the newborn nurseries were higher than those of nurses in medical, surgical, and intensive care units. Since newborns are vulnerable to infections, and an environment with a large number of newborns is highly susceptible to the spread of infections, thorough implementation of infection prevention guidelines is important [32] . Such precautions reflect the specificity of departments that care for patients at high risk of infection, which likely result from safety management awareness and increased performance of safety precautions due to continuous infection rate monitoring and training. Additionally, the rate of adherence to standard precautions in this study was significantly lower among nurses who worked in settings where there were more than 15 patients per RN per shift. According to Korean medical laws, the daily patient census per RN is 2.5, which converts to an estimated patient-per-RN rate of approximately 15 per shift. The average estimated patient-per-RN rate per shift in Korean general hospitals from 1996 to 2013 was 16.3 to 21.8, which exceeded the minimum standards required by law [33] . Failure to obtain an adequate number of nurses leads to increased job burden, insufficient nursing time, and decreased job performance ability [34] , and an increased rate of infections [17, 34] .

In comparison, previous studies found that significantly fewer HCWs might commit to work in the event of a transmissible disease outbreak. However, it should be pointed out that these studies were carried out among general HCWs rather than critical care clinicians. For example, in a survey of 303 employees at 3 health departments in Maryland from March to July 2005, 163 (53.8%) indicated they would likely report to work in the event of an influenza pandemic [7] . Moreover, Syrett and colleagues reported that even fewer HCWs (18%) in University of Rochester Medical Center committed to work in the hypothetical setting of a transmissible infectious agent with only unproven, experimental prophylaxis or treatment [8] . Both the present study and Daugherty's study found that significantly more critical care clinicians reported willingness to work during an influenza pandemic [10] . Similarly, Martinese et al found that, in comparison with the general HCWs, staff working in emergency and acute medical wards directly responsible for the care of influenza patients were more likely to report for duty [9] . The reason for such a significant difference between critical care clinicians and general HCWs remains to be elucidated, but could be related to the perception of the importance of their roles in response to a public health crisis [7, 9] .",18.939310586758307,8.60075528691982

Specifically, there have been issues raised regarding the quality of emergency care provided in private hospitals [7] . While there is no national categorisation of levels of capabilities of EDs [8] , all public health-care institutions have a service level agreement with the Ministry of Health that includes the 24-h availability of dedicated ED services. It is not clear if a similar agreement exists with all hospitals in the country. There is a need for national knowledge of the capabilities of the individual hospitals, which can form a basis for characterisation, if not categorisation, of hospital EDs. The US has led the field in formulating a system to document and inventory EDs [6] . The NEDI project has also been introduced in other countries [5] .

Nevertheless, gaps in global sanitation still exist in the form of technical, economic, social, cultural, educational, political, and institutional challenges. The previous data show that only 7.9% of the papers on sanitation indexed in the SSCI, indicating a mainstream of technical research and a lack of social study. Nevertheless, it must be mentioned that there has limited publications for SSCI. To realize the targets of SDGs, government support, social acceptability, as well as technological reliability are necessary. From governmental aspects, favorable polices for the sanitation value chain stakeholders (toilet manufacturers, emptying agencies, transportation, treatment system operators, end product sellers as well as users etc.) should be established, such as subsidies, ISO/National standards, regulations, in order to form a healthy market for new sanitation systems, so that everyone could play a specific and positive role in it. Social acceptability is closely linked to private behavior; thus, the developed toilet should adapt to religious belief, ethnic culture, and economic level as well, which would be conducive to governmental motivation. Technological reliability is the driver for sanitation development and practical application. The developed technologies should meet the requirements for safe local discharge, efficient nutrient/energy recovery, limited air emission, nonnoise, operability following non-usage/short term/long term shutdown, overload protection, expected lifetime, flexibility in ambient change, etc. Table 7 lists a brief evaluation of the current techniques described above. The comments for each technology vary according to an overview of the whole ""input-operation-output"" system. The TRL was also applied using the standards of commercialized applications (such as a centralized treatment plant or decentralized integrated toilet system), where the economic feasibility is distinguished by the development and effective operation of the economic value chain. The relevant policy refers to sustainable market-driven mechanisms to support its development, viability, and up-scaling of the technologies, as well as policies including subsidies, import duties, and taxes from the government. Institutional behavior relies on regular certified laboratory testing to ensure the end-product is safe for use. Social acceptance refers to the acceptance of both the treatment process and end products. Lastly, cultural tradition decides whether the innovative toilet system changes the habits of the users, such as the body-cleaning style, the education/ training of individuals, including knowledge dissemination for the stakeholders and users, and the specialized training for workers, administrators, and decision makers. For example, a composting toilet or composting infrastructure incorporating fecal sludge could presently meet the standards for commercial use; the TRL of compost reaches as high as 9. The end products could be used in agriculture. The relevant composting policies and standards have already been established to encourage the creation of organic fertilizer via composting. Therefore, composting meets the criteria for economic feasibility, relevant policy, institutional behavior, and social acceptance. However, the application of a composting toilet would be limited for non-dry toilet users who lack the awareness of its safe management. Additionally, the use of such a toilet requires public education, which would mainly come from the older farming stakeholders. The other 11 techniques have been carefully evaluated through research. These technologies still do not address all the various aspects of sanitation. We found the following challenges and drew a number of conclusions from this work.",21.138034837350446,9.90113664261184

WHO member states have repeatedly affirmed their commitment to developing their primary care systems with a view to training up community-based health professionals who are able to provide care across the spectrum of prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery. As the 'front door' of the health system, primary care professionals should be involved in planning and action for health emergency risk management. WONCA (the global professional body for family medicine) has actively championed the ways in which primary care can be supported to deliver care during population emergencies. National primary care bodies can coordinate with public health leads to cascade information to practitioners, communicate with the public, and collate health intelligence from the frontline primary care. 8 The Ebola crisis taught us a valuable lesson about what happens when an outbreak takes health workers away from core functions to focus on crisis response; the number of people who died from reduced access to usual care probably exceeded the number killed by the virus. 9 Strong health systems built on comprehensive primary care are able to integrate both functions, disseminating the emergency response resources and information required to community-level staff who have the breadth of training required to manage new suspected cases alongside routine family medicine. Decent access to primary health care is essential in health emergencies, and its infrastructure crucial for containment, 10 just as good access to high-quality primary care is at the foundation of any strong health system. 11",27.68663144140612,11.945709288221694

First, the use of facemasks among health care providers on different social occasions and in media appearances was crucial for the construction of this new social norm and for normalizing the use of facemasks, because of their social power. Health care professionals, as a social institution, allowed them to exercise social control with respect to facemask use in the community, which motivated the participants to use a facemask during the SARS outbreak. Second, the participants used facemasks as a form of symbolic support for health care providers. Because facemasks were perceived as a tool for infection prevention, using a facemask did not simply prevent the participants from becoming infected, but by so doing, it also implied a show of support for health care providers in an attempt to reduce their workload and the burden on the health care system. Using a facemask was akin to a symbolic declaration that they were committed to reducing the burden on the health care system by preventing themselves from becoming infected.

Simulation technology combined with telemedicine empowers the generalist to provide care at the level of the specialist. EMRs, cell phones, and sensors empower the patient provider to care for him-or herself with the help of a nurse practitioner (NP), physician assistant (PA), or family member in their home or local clinic. Artificial intelligence can be designed into laboratory tests that tell the doctor when the test is complete, through the use of intelligent agents assigned to a laboratory test or imaging study. Smart robots exist that could help the patient conduct or interpret lab tests and other tasks in the home [24] , and many more are in development. Emphasis is placed on the prevention of disease and living a healthy lifestyle. The network provides information and tracking that enables better prediction of disease pandemics, so that clinicians can intervene earlier.

The Canadian Standards on xenotransplantation is consistent with international guidelines including the WHA Resolution 57.18. The Canadian national inquiry was initiated because a scientist had indicated his intentions to submit an application to conduct a clinical trial involving the use of porcine cells. Thus far, no such trials have taken place in Canada (Einsiedel et al. 2011a) . The Canadian public consultation on xenotransplantation was a novel social experiments in community engagement on a complex technoscience.

From their interviews with members of the Canadian public service, Jones and Einsiedel found that the xenotransplantation consultation contributed to learning about public engagement at Health Canada. While the routine of closed, expertdriven regulatory practices was destabilised, Health Canada has gone on to develop in-house infrastructure and expertise for public engagement (Jones and Einsiedel 2011) .

Cases were defined as the STIP and CDP programs that are directed by policy. These programs were chosen because they were offered in both provinces and were likely to involve collaboration with primary care -a cross cutting theme. Six out of 36 health units in the province of Ontario were recruited to provide a diverse sample that matched the general demographic makeup (e.g., population density; ratio of immigrants; urban, rural, remote or mixed) of the health authorities in BC. One health unit dropped out due to reduced capacity to participate in research as a result of multiple staff changes and vacancies; the health unit was replaced by another in 2011. Service providers, managers and senior management (i.e., directors, a Chief Nursing Officer, Medical Officers of Health, and Associate Medical Officers of Health) were recruited to participate (Table 1) .

Accurate, complete and timely hospital mortality reporting would seem a basic indicator of a quality health system. As access to care expands, better hospital mortality data should offer a granular picture of the burden of disease in a given geography taken together with reporting of all deaths through vital status reporting. It can therefore support advocacy based on population needs and promote equity by highlighting regional variation. More detailed examination of mortality rates, or for selected cases all the events leading up to death, can be important tools to Fig. 4 The sensitivity of outcomes of LMIC hospital care to improved quality. This figure seeks to represent hypothetical relationships between the proportion of all mortality (Y Axis) that occurs outside and inside hospitals (blue and red lines respectively) as the strength of a health system and life expectancy increase (X axis). Here we assume that a proportion of all mortality is sensitive to quality of hospital care (dashed line) that first increases as access improves and then decreases as quality improves in parallel with an increase in the strength of a health system. In this simplified model the relationship between the distances represented by A and C is a measure of access that may be particularly important for conditions for which hospital based care might improve outcomes (eg. trauma; acute myocardial infarction; complications of childbirth; preterm birth). If the distance B represents the proportion of mortality that may be averted by better access to higher quality hospital care then in LMIC it is possible that the ratio of B:C (avoidable mortality) is considerably higher than in high income countries (located at the right extreme of the Y axis). With appropriate case-mix and case-severity adjustment mortality may therefore, be a better global metric of quality in LMIC hospitals than it is in high income countries Box 3 -Initial steps to improve the production and use of hospital mortality data analyses as data from a wider array of population and health system indicators become available identify system failings.

Despite the announcement of post-pandemic period on 10 August 2010 by theWHO, H1N1 (2009) virus would continue to circulate as a seasonal virus for some years and national health authorities should remain vigilant due to unpredictable behaviour of the virus. Majority of the world population is living in countries with inadequate resources to purchase vaccines and stockpile antiviral drugs. Basic hygienic measures such as wearing face masks and the hygienic practice of hand washing could reduce the spread of the respiratory viruses. However, the imminent issue is translating these measures into day-to-day practice. The experience from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong has shown that general practitioners (GPs) were willing to discharge their duties despite risks of getting infected themselves. SARS event has highlighted the inadequate interface between primary and secondary care and valuable health care resources were thus inappropriately matched to community needs. There are various ways for GPs to contribute in combating the influenza pandemic. They are prompt in detecting and monitoring epidemics and mini-epidemics of viral illnesses in the community. They can empower and raise the health literacy of the community such as advocating personal hygiene and other precautious measures. GPs could also assist in the development of protocols for primary care management of patients with flu-like illnesses and conduct clinical audits on the standards of preventive and treatment measures. GPs with adequate liaison with public health agencies would facilitate early diagnosis of patients with influenza. In this article, we summarise the primary care actions for phases 4-6 of the pandemic. We shall discuss the novel roles of GPs as alternative source of health care for patients who would otherwise be cared for in the secondary care level. The health care system would thus remain sustainable during the public health crisis.",30.38281320249319,11.800119160119175

All processes and procedures are open to modification and must be considered from a new perspective including standards of care, staffing, equipment, and the allocation of resources. Although there certainly is a need to modify the standard of care during a pandemic, one must always keep in mind the primary objective of ensuring that the maximum number of people possible, survive. Thus, caution must be exercised when expanding clinical roles or modifying management to ensure that care is not compromised beyond the point where more harm is being done than good. For instance, it is of little use to move to a ventilation strategy such as long term manual ventilation with bag-valve-masks that may allow many more people to be ventilated but results in an increased number of deaths due to barotrauma than would have occurred if fewer patients were ventilated using a less harmful ventilation strategy. Striking an appropriate balance requires monitoring treatment outcomes during the response. In order to comply with medicolegal and ethical standards, plans to alter the standard of care during a pandemic should be publicly discussed and documented in advance with clear, objective criteria defined for the institution of mass critical care [44] . For these same reasons it is critical that all hospitals within an area adhere to the same standards of care.",42.51738796803401,18.71665661295817

The potential for contamination of food or animal feed with transgenic products approved only for other uses has elevated the concern for stewardship of these materials. Stewardship is a deliberately proactive management position against unintended exposure, which could otherwise ultimately halt this technology if further events were to suggest unacceptable continuing probability of this risk. The manufacturer is also responsible to the appropriate government agency for all practices during technology development and for adhering to the standards, which are approved by FDA for manufacturing. Failure to follow these standards can result in significant financial penalty from either agency. Ultimate penalty can include the revocation of product and facility licenses; something that would have significant impact on further relations between the manufacturer and the regulatory authority. In addition to the regulatory liabilities, failure to meet these standards during the manufacturing phase can result in liability owed to private individuals. In 2002, food products contaminated with transgenic corn 2 years earlier were determined by a US District Court (Northern District of Illinois) to be of sufficient 'public nuisance' that farmers whose market was affected through reduced prices were entitled to a total of US$110 million compensation from the manufacturers (Aventis CropScience USA and Garst Seeds) who produced StarlinkÔ corn. Manufacturers of PMVs must therefore also be cognizant of the potential for further public nuisance rulings and significant financial liability for contaminating food commodities. The precedence for public nuisance rulings reinforces the need for active stewardship of this new technology.",23.9030336881169,13.27991592492371

Concordant with the use of less toxic conditioning regimens and better long-term outcomes, there is a growing perception that the scope of pulmonary disease has shifted from acute disease early in the post-transplant course to an increase in late noninfectious pulmonary complications [15, 16] . The implementation of rapid detection of CMV from BAL fluid in 1988 [3] and preemptive treatment strategies with ganciclovir and foscarnet [17] have led to the decline in incidence and mortality of CMV pneumonia. In addition, major shifts in antifungal treatment and prevention [18] have improved outcomes.

Hick, propose a formalized model of scalable surge capacity composed of a three-tier system of escalation in resource utilization, from conventional, to contingency, to (ultimately) crisis phases. The first two phases imply minimal disruption to normal standards of patient care, but the third implies a reallocation of priorities from maintaining the usual standard of care to providing the best standard of care possible in exceptional circumstances.

One tool to assess infection control practice in clinical areas is the infection control audit; however, many institutions do not approach this in a systematic fashion. Methods: Key features of the infection control audit were identified by the infection control team and developed into a standardized format for review of clinical areas. The audit incorporates a review of the physical layout, protocols and policies, knowledge of basic infection control principles, and workplace practice review. Results: Over the last 13 years, the infection control unit has completed 17 audits involving 1525 employees. Four-hundred-one staff members have filled out questionnaires that assessed their understanding of standard precautions. A total of 257 recommendations have been made, and 95% of these have been implemented. The majority of recommendations address separation of clean and dirty supplies, hand hygiene compliance, hand hygiene signage, proper use of barriers, and environmental cleaning. Conclusion: The infection control audit is an opportunity to implement changes and to introduce remedial measures in collaboration with various departments and services. A standardized approach to the audit allows benchmarking of practices across the institution and enhances standards of care. (Am J Infect Control 2007;35:271-83.)

The wavelet power spectrums in Fig. 2A and the second column of Table 2 show significant (at 5% significance level) volatilities of the DE health care returns for high frequency (1-2 months) over the periods 2000-2003 and 2007-2010 , for the 2-4 months' frequency band in 2004-2010, and for low frequency (4-8 months) in 2003-2010, when the DE health care sector experienced the Doc-com bubble, SARS epidemic, subprime mortgage crisis, global financial crisis, and European debt crisis. These findings suggest that there are significant variances and structural changes in the DE health care stock returns. In fact, a structural change in the DE health care returns also occurs on cycles of wavelet power across the medium run (2-4 months) and long run (4-8 months) during the periods 2004-2010 and 2003-2010, which as mentioned above is within the period of the SARS outbreak, subprime mortgage crisis, global financial crisis, and European debt crisis. Those significant volatilities at different frequency bands identified over various periods suggest that the above-mentioned events are likely to have influenced the DE health care returns in all ranges of frequency bands. The white lines on the short, medium, and long periods across all times mean that there is a permanent cycle with DE health care sector returns.

The terrorist events of 9/11 were sufficiently isolated so that this model was generally effective, although the Pentagon attack resulted in a rapid medical response on the grounds of the Pentagon itself. Using the military model and building upon the experiences of 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina, as well as the events of worldwide earthquakes and tsunamis, a new specialty of medicine is emerging-""disaster medicine."" A major issue that was found to be a major aspect of the aftermath of Katrina and is currently being addressed, is that of the ""surge capacity"" of US hospitals, in which acute casualties may overwhelm hospitals, requiring a prioritization of care of both the newly ill casualties and the chronically ill inpatients. 8, 9 There has been significant planning by agencies of the federal government since these two disasters, in good part because the United States was ill prepared to handle these disasters, both from a medical and a response preparedness perspective. The US Department of Health and Human Services issued a directive entitled Bioterrorism and Other Public Health Emergencies-Altered Standards of Care in Mass Casualty Events as a federal guide in response to the 9/11 terrorist events and the subsequent anthrax attacks. 10 One of the main issues addressed by the guide was ""how current standards of care might need to be altered in response to a mass casualty event in order to save as many lives as possible."" Additionally, the report proposed that ""the basis for allocating health and medical resources in a mass casualty event must be fair and clinically sound."" As part of the recommended use of altered standards of health and medical care, a model was proposed for emergency state health powers that recognized the difficulties of providers and institutions when providing care under stress with less than a full complement of resources. It was recommended that the plan would ""have to provide for 'hold harmless' agreements or grant immunity from civil or criminal liability under certain circumstances."" Rolfsen 11 addressed the ethical issues of liability or criminal prosecution in a disaster situation in the Journal of the Louisiana State Medical Society. He stated, ""During disasters such as Katrina, many deaths of both previously healthy and chronically ill patients can be expected. Despite society's tendency to attempt to place blame for these tragedies, attributing causation of the deaths to medical providers is a complex process."" Contributing to the complexity are the harsh and unusual conditions under which medical care must be provided in a disaster, and the overwhelming requirements for medical resources in the face of rapidly dwindling supply.",29.77466137240445,10.446617296939495

The lack of adequate routes into the medical care system has also resulted in an increase in ED use and an increased illness severity of the patients being treated in EDs. 49 Major disasters could quickly overwhelm the already limited excess capacity of the health care system. Emergency physicians would then confront difficult challenges in expanding capacity and in triaging patients. Recent experiences with SARS, anthrax, and Hantavirus suggest we will have enough physicians who remain to treat patients, even if they are at significant risk. Whether this occurs during the next crisis may depend, in large measure, on preparing in advance to ameliorate risks to health care workers and on using methods to reduce stress by communicating effectively during and after the crisis. Public health departments, EMS agencies, hospitals, and EDs should develop plans to address foreseeable major health care crises.

Failure to do so may lead to situations that are ethically compromising and undermine public trust, such as when access to critical care resources is denied based on crisis standards by one institution without referral to a nearby institution capable of providing critical care. Regions should institute an Incident Management System (IMS) at the facility, local, regional or state, and national level to exercise command and control over scarce resources. 16 Furthermore, decision-makers should communicate with community emergency services and local hospitals to ensure a coordinated approach to patient transfers, standards of care, and resource allocation. 16 , 17 2. We suggest critical care only be rationed when resources have, or will shortly be, overwhelmed despite all eff orts at augmentation and a regional-level authority that holds the legal authority and adequate situational awareness has declared an emergency and activated its mass critical care plan. A basic tenet of ethically conducted triage is that the degree of rationing through triage is proportionate to the anticipated or realized shortfall in resources. 18 Th erefore, the rationing of critical care should be held as a last resort and only implemented when all eff orts have been made to optimize the use of resources. Th e task force considers all eff orts at augmentation to include all attempts to acquire scarce critical resources or to transfer patients to other health-care facilities that are able to provide care (state, national, and even international partner institutions). 19 In rapidly evolving disasters, critical care may need to be rationed before the appropriate authority has declared an emergency or activated its mass critical care plan, but this should only be done in exceptional circumstances. Similarly, in some jurisdictions, the relevant authority will be responsible for declaring an emergency and activating a mass critical care plan but may not have statutory powers. Nevertheless, a decision to ration critical care should not be made unilaterally at an institutional level because individual institutions do not possess the situational awareness in isolation to operationally or ethically justify such a decision. Similarly, the decision to cease triage should occur in a graduated and coordinated manner by altering the prioritization criteria and exclusion thresholds as resources become available. 19 3.

Almost all ICPs report that their hospital cannot accommodate an influx of any patients who require mechanical ventilation or that their facility can handle fewer than 10 such patients. Smaller-sized hospitals have less ventilator surge capacity than do larger-sized hospitals; this is likely related to the decreased ability of many small hospitals to provide large volume intensive care. Many potential bioterrorism agents and emerging infections cause diseases that result in severe respiratory distress or failure that would require prolonged intensive care for patients, including the use of mechanical ventilation. Without ventilator surge capacity, patient care could be compromised severely and result in increased morbidity and mortality. Most U.S. hospitals also report a lack of NIOSH-approved respirators, and half do not have sufficient numbers of surgical masks to handle a 3-day influx of patients. Although ventilators, respirators, and masks will have some availability through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Strategic National Stockpile, there will be a delay before such resources are made available at the local level and the amount available might not meet the demand.

Some of the classic researches on vaccines and chemotherapeutic agents aroused moral suspicion and debate already when it was conducted in the late 19th and early 20th century. Studies, among them Robert Koch's and Paul Ehrlich's experiments with Salvarsan and other chemicals, were criticized for insufficient informed consent of study participants and for using vulnerable populations, like people living in ''the colonies '', prisoners, children, or prostitutes (Reuland, 2004; Roelcke and Maio, 2004) . The guidelines of the German Reich's Ministry of the Interior of 1930 reacted to the increasingly intense political debate by specifically emphasizing the necessity of explicit informed consent und the moral inadequacy of exploiting a person's difficult social situation for performing studies that pose a risk to the participant's health (Steinmann, 1975) .

Instead of serving as a gate-keeper for community health, most community-based primary care organizations still act like small-scale hospitals. Rather than serving as complementary components of the healthcare system, as they do in many western healthcare systems, these organizations compete with larger hospitals in China for providers and patients.

By comparison, standards were established early on for DNA-based NGS by the 1,000 Genomes Project, including variant call format (VCF), binary alignment/map format (BAM format) and genotype likelihoods, essentially providing the 'best practice approaches' . Before 2014, reference standards, ERCC spike-in controls and the general MAQC were major contributors towards building a reproducible RNA-seq pipeline, but they pale in comparison to having a consensus germline-genomic reference standard, such as the NA12878 human reference genome 112 . As a consequence of this lack of standards, RNA-seq provided fertile grounds for the emergence of a multitude of software tools and other options, all competing for relevance as part of a broad range of RNA-seq solutions.

The viruses included in a certification program can vary from country to country or state to state. An excellent example is grapevines where certification in Italy includes more viruses than programs in Germany or France; or grapevine certification in Washington State is different from California. Some of these differences are due to environmental considerations, where infection by a pathogen may cause severe disease in one setting, such as crown gall in grapevine in New York State, but be latent or symptomless under different environmental conditions, such as crown gall in grapevine in California. Attempts to harmonize certification schemes across boundaries to facilitate trade of plants without increasing trade in plant pathogens will require certification programs to account for disease expression by pathogens in areas where the certified plants may be sold, rather than only where the nursery stock is produced. In the United States, where certification programs are regulated by individual states, there are efforts underway in multiple crops (blueberry, grapevines, hops, Rubus, strawberry, and fruit trees) to develop a single certification standard that all states with programs for that crop would adopt. If successful, this in essence would provide a national program for certification of these crops.

Although determination of chromatographic parameters does not allow a structural assignment a priori, comparison with the elution volumes of a set of appropriate oligosaccharide standards in at least two different chromatographic systems gives reliable results (Liedtke et al., 1997) . The glucose units obtained from internal calibration with isomaltooligosaccharides were compared with those of authentic fucosylated di-, two isomers of tri-, tetra-, and bisected dianten- nary standard oligosaccharide alditols. The majority of glycans thus identified (Figure 5A-D; fractions F01, F11, F13, F21, F31, F32) represented fucosylated species with two, three, or four N-acetyllactosamine antennae in addition to a few species not coeluting with any of these standard glycans (fractions F02, F12). This assumption was supported by gel filtration data which suggested the presence of incomplete triantennary species lacking one (or two) galactosyl residue(s). To further substantiate these assignments, the four fractions of complex type glycans as well as the respective oligosaccharide standards were treated with β-galactosidase from D.pneumoniae. Resulting products were again analyzed by HPAEC and, in part, also by gel filtration. As shown in Figure 5E -H, compounds identified as fucosylated di-, tri-, and tetraantennary species coeluted with the respective agalacto oligosaccharide standards after β-galactosidase treatment. Species F02 and F12, formerly eluting at 4.62 and 4.44 glucose units ( Figure 5A ,B), now coeluted with triantennary agalacto oligosaccharide standards ( Figure 5E ,F) and thus may be assumed to comprise fucosylated triantennary species with one (or two) incomplete antenna(e). Differentiation between the possible isomeric forms, however, was not possible. The elution position of species with 2.9 glucose units ( Figure 5A ) did not change after digestion with β-galactosidase, indicating the presence of incomplete species without any galactosyl residue. Because of their elution properties, it may be further concluded that they were also lacking, to a certain extent, outer GlcNAc residues.

(2011) defined health as the ability to adapt and self-manage in the face of social, physical, and emotional challenges. This definition was initially proposed in 2008 (see Jadad and O'Grady 2008) . The definition seems to be receiving some considerations, especially because of the use of ""adaptation."" While the WHO's definition stresses on a complete state, this definition proposes adaptive capacity. Lancet Editorial (2009, p. 781) commented, ""Health is an elusive as well as a motivating idea. By replacing perfection with adaptation, we get closer to a more compassionate, comforting, and creative programme for medicine-one to which we can all contribute."" The major strength of this definition is that it takes account of the shift in health challenges in the twenty-first century. Unlike the period before World War II when acute diseases were more prevalent than chronic diseases, now the latter constitutes a greater burden. Chronic diseases require behavioural adjustments in terms of self-care or management (see Sects. 2.6.2 and 8.3).

There is precedent for dual certification of respirators that allows the employer to meet OSHA requirements to use a NIOSH-certified respirator while obtaining additional features desired by the end user. For example, in other occupational settings such as firefighting, it is not uncommon to set voluntary consensus standards that exceed minimal performance standards set by government agencies. A good example of this is the National Fire Protection Association 1981 standard for self-contained breathing devices, 49 which requires NIOSH certification as the baseline. The Federal government sets the minimum set of general requirements for devices used by any worker in any type of workplace setting, but the standards development organizations set special, additional requirements that benefit workers in unique workplace settings. The health care setting is one of those unique workplace environments. Obtaining a B95 standard will not be mandatory for manufacturers but, instead, will be optional. B95 respirators will be the best in class in terms of comfort and fit and tailored for HCP, and thus it will be ",24.865182019020835,10.78053092148006

There is no single, simple and universally relevant means of expressing quality or setting a quality threshold. Desmond Laurence's admirable ""Dictionary of Pharmacology and Allied Topics"" does not define quality beyond ruling that ""It is essential that manufactured medicines be of high and consistent quality."" (Laurence 1998 at p. 282) Even plain water has various levels of quality: alongside water approved for human consumption (aqua potabilis, aqua communis) the pharmacopoeias provide specifications and modes of preparation for both purified water (aqua purificata) which is prepared by distillation, reverse osmosis or other suitable methods and then stored in inert airtight containers, and water for injection (aqua ad injectionem) which is sterile and free of pyrogens. Physiological saline -plain salt solution -has at least five measures for quality and several standards; one must know its actual concentration, the degree to which that concentration can be allowed to vary, its degree of chemical purity and the permissible degree of contamination with bacteria, viruses or pyrogens. For a finished medicine there will be far more measures of quality and numerous matters on which experts (and regulatory agencies) may disagree regarding the necessary standards, ranging from issues of colour to stability and from disintegration time to bioavailability. If the quality standards are set too low the medicine may be ineffective or dangerous, whereas if too much is demanded the work of making the medicine and checking the quality of every batch may be so laborious as to render it unaffordable. These are not minor matters, since they have both medical and judicial consequences; the law requires in general terms that drugs be of adequate quality and imposes sanctions if they are not; there are detailed and legally established procedures for setting the standards applicable to any individual medicine and testing to these standards; finally one will be obliged to ensure that the medicine attains all those standards throughout its shelf life, and to reject or discard any medicine that fails to do so.",21.410578236120003,9.238582175272674

In the case of crystallography and NMR, the pressure to develop such standards grew as the techniques became more widely used, and so the development of broadly accepted standards must also evolve as the use of small-angle scattering continues to grow. As small-angle scattering yields data that are inherently one-dimensional, and the user invariably is looking to support a three-dimensional model, overinterpretation of the data will always be a risk if not given careful consideration. Importantly, the absence of quality control in sample characterization and data reduction can mislead the experimenter. In this review, we describe the small-angle scattering experiment, its range of application, and the necessary quality control measures. A particular emphasis is given to the importance of standards for demonstrating sample quality, and the power of other biophysical and biochemical methods in providing constraints for modeling that will reduce the likelihood of overinterpretation of the scattering data.

The field of medical ethics or bioethics in general is multidisciplinary because the ethical dilemma in health care requires the inputs and understanding of various professionals. Some of these moral perplexities are part of societal concerns for equity, equality, and justice in health care. A majority of these issues are sociocultural issues and general ethical or moral standards of behaviour in the society. This is why sociological insights are necessary if the ethical conundrums presented by medicine are to be successfully resolved in practice. The most vital tool in medicine is the ""human body.""

Therefore, while there is acknowledged need for ICT in the coordination and monitoring of treatment, surveillance, response, education, and communication in health care, in reality there are significant barriers in the application of ICT that slow progress. These barriers are in no way restricted to the developing world. The United States and other more technologically advanced nations have their own sets of challenges. Cost, misalignment of incentives, resistance, an unskilled workforce, concerns about impact on productivity, lack of standards and interoperability, and other issues contribute to a poor level of healthcare ICT adoption in the industrialized world. 16 The digital divide has resulted in large segments of low income and/or other underserved groups being excluded from online health resources. 16 Economic hardships and difficult tradeoff decisions in the US healthcare industry have further inhibited healthcare information technology growth. 17 In developing nations, the problem of ICT uptake is even further compounded. A lack of local expertise and decades of well-meaning but non-sustainable ICT projects in the developing world have left a legacy of skepticism in their wake. Systems built for Westernized health care delivery often do not match the local context, resulting in a misalignment between need and technology.

Department of Nursing, Taipei Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation Background: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) commonly occurs in intensive care unit patients who have a tracheal tube. In Taiwan, approximately 13.7-25.3% of hospitalized patients contract VAP, which has a mortality rate of 20-33%. Hospital infection control center reported the VAP infection rate in our medical intensive care units was 1.17‰ in 2015, which was higher than the nationwide in medical centers (0.6‰) and which has steadily increased. Accordingly, hospitalization days and medical costs in Taiwan have risen. For this study, we collaborated with the infection control center, respiratory therapist team, information management center, and medical quality management center to develop and implement a bundle care intervention to reduce the VAP infection rate. Methods: A medical intensive care unit that has 45 patient beds and which averages a 96.4% occupancy rate was adopted for this study. Through cross-team cooperation and brainstorming, we analyzed several crucial factors related to VAP, and developed a VAP bundle care scale by referring to previous studies for investigating medical employees' knowledge of VAP bundle care procedures. The results showed that their knowledge varied, and that they did not adopt consistent care standards or have adequate daily assessment tools. In response, we invited external infection control experts to train hospital medical personnel on how to provide bundle care, modify daily VAP care standards (e.g., raising bedhead to 30°-45°, adopting daily sedation cessation, using 0.2-0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate for oral care, draining ventilators water, and washing hands), provide training, develop a daily care assessment form, and establish an information sharing platform. Results: In this study, we modified VAP bundle care standards and the medical team enhanced their knowledge of VAP bundle care through classroom learning and digital training videos. Through visual management and reminders from an information system, the accuracy of the VAP bundle care increased from 44.6% to 95.9%. Moreover, the VAP infection rate reduced from 1.17‰ to 0.44‰. We found that when bedheads were raised to 30°-45°, alert conscious patients could not fall asleep and experienced sacrum pain; accordingly, these patients refused this care procedure.",24.0038584532156,8.411087775517009

Medicare was born in one province in 1947. It spread across the country through federal cost sharing, and eventually was harmonised through standards in a federal law, the Canada Health Act of 1984. The health-care system is less a true national system than a decentralised collection of provincial and territorial insurance plans covering a narrow basket of services, which are free at the point of care. Administration and service delivery are highly decentralised, although coverage is portable across the country. In the setting of geographical and population diversity, long waits for elective care demand the capacity and commitment to scale up effective and sustainable models of care delivery across the country. Profound health inequities experienced by Indigenous populations and some vulnerable groups also require coordinated action on the social determinants of health if these inequities are to be effectively addressed. Achievement of the high aspirations of Medicare's founders requires a renewal of the tripartite social contract between governments, health-care providers, and the public. Expansion of the publicly funded basket of services and coordinated effort to reduce variation in outcomes will hinge on more engaged roles for the federal government and the physician community than have existed in previous decades. Public engagement in system stewardship will also be crucial to achieve a high-quality system grounded in both evidence and the Canadian values of equity and solidarity.",22.633887624027388,9.86266152595353

As with staffing, some hospitals face shortages of critical care spaces, 46,71-73 although occupancy varies across the United States.

However, this expansion is still limited by the issues of stuff and staff discussed earlier.

Modern medical technology is available in the world market but at costs higher than most of the region's population can aff ord. Many traditional health practices persist alongside the use of new medical technologies and pharmaceutical products, presenting regulatory problems in terms of safety and quality. With increasing educational levels, ageing populations, and growing consciousness of human rights in the recently developing democratic environment, the demand for better care is increasing. Health systems in the region face more serious adjustment problems than ever before. 51 Health services have become an important industry, with a mix of public and private non-profi t and for-profi t actors, along with the growth of trade and medical tourism. The provision, fi nancing, and regulatory functions of the public sector have to adapt accordingly to these transformations. The need to restructure healthcare delivery and fi nancing systems becomes crucial to balance new demand and supply equilibriums. 52, 53 Countries in southeast Asia and their health system reforms can thus be categorised according to the stages of development of their health-care systems. A typology of common issues, challenges, and priorities are generated for the diverse mix of health systems of southeast Asia at diff erent stages of socioeconomic development (see webappendix pp 5-8). The pressures placed on national health-care systems by the recent demographic and epidemiological transitions that we have described are amplifi ed by the growing demands of an increasingly educated and affl uent population for high quality health care and the supply of the latest medical technology. Before the east Asian fi nancial crisis in 1997-98 and the recent global economic recession, an expanding middle class in the urban populations of the larger cities pushed their demand for high quality care into a booming private sector. As a result, market forces have turned many aspects of health care into a new industry in countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand, contributing to labour-force distortions for the production and distribution of health workers both within and across countries.",22.0932011542336,10.388414613223627

The end product must be stable (i.e., no odors, no vector attraction), noninfectious, and of sufficiently low metals content so as not to translocate and bioaccumulate to undesirable levels. Some treatment technologies capable of producing a Class A sludge include composting, heat drying, auto-thermal thermophilic aerobic digestion, pasteurization and gamma radiation. The constraints on the use of sludge for growing edible crops are primarily associated with the presence of heavy metals, the nitrogen content, and the possibility of the presence of phytotoxic materials in the sludge. Particular care must be given if the solids contain contributions from industry. Some metals of concern include arsenic, mercury, lead, zinc, copper, and nickel, although the limiting metal is usually cadmium. Cadmium is of particular concern because of its potential translocation from the soil to the fruit and the ability of certain crops, such as chard, to accumulate significant quantities in the edible portion of the plant.

Rubinson et al. [48] have made recommendations based on the premise that provision of a lower level of intensive care to more patients is preferable to provision of a higher level of care to fewer patients. We have taken a different approach and have made recommendations on how to expand intensive care without a significant reduction in quality of care [31] . While both approaches have merits in different situations, we believe that the nature of avian influenza make the low level approach less suitable. The mortality of cases requiring advanced life support is 90%, and the incidence of multiorgan failure is high. Given the complexity of cases, it is likely that a reduction in the level of intensive care would result in a substantial rise in mortality. This could raise mortality to the point that it becomes questionable whether, on the basis of triage, patients with avian influenza should be admitted to ICU [50] . Indeed, even at the current 90% mortality diversion of resources from other critically ill patients is justified only by the young age of the patients with avian influenza. Age per se is unimportant, but it would reasonable to expect young survivors to have a long life expectancy. Furthermore, the small benefit to patients may not justify the risk to staff. We therefore believe that ICUs have a useful role only in relatively small avian flu epidemics in which an increase in ICU capacity of 50-100% would be sufficient, and that contingency plans should be made on that basis. In larger epidemics it may be more appropriate to re-deploy ICU staff to care for less severely ill patients. There are currently insufficient data to determine which patients with avian influenza should be admitted to intensive care and which should be refused.",20.181935866649127,8.392842910678498

It is known that benefi ts in the processes of clinical care leading to improvements in quality can arise purely from measurement; that is, performing service reviews such as this one [3] .

When a patient is admitted to a unit able to provide a higher (lower) level of care than required, a waste (overuse) of resources can be advocated. StART is an approach to identify possible mismatches between the level of care actually delivered, assumed to correspond to what is clinically required, and the level of care deliverable by the unit. Methods ICU beds are classifi ed by levels of care deliverable as High (ventilator, monitor, and 720 minutes nurse time) and Low (monitor and 360 minutes nurse time) [1] . The level of care actually delivered is classifi ed as High (invasive or non-invasive ventilation, or two vasoactive drugs, or at least two of the following: one vasoactive drug, dialysis, respiratory support), Low (single vasoactive drug, or dialysis, or respiratory support) and Ordinary (none of the above) [2] . Mismatches between the level of beds available and the level of care delivered were evaluated both on admission and for each ICU-day of 4,237 patients in 28 ICUs. An ICU-day was judged as inappropriate, even without mismatch, if an Ordinary patient was present. [1] . Patients in critical care typically receive highrisk medications. Error reporting is integral to identifying common errors and medication risk reduction. Methods A medication reporting form was developed to run alongside the offi cial hospital incident reporting system for 2 weeks. Forms were distributed throughout the critical care facility. All members of the multidisciplinary team were asked to anonymously complete a form every time a medication error, or near miss, occurred. After 2 weeks, the submitted forms were analysed by the project team.",19.702289143297723,10.738940705540555

Since the late 1990s, we have been living in an era of failed health care reform where cost containment strategies have created additional nonprice barriers to care. Americans are faced with an increasingly complex health care system and the barriers to care are more pervasive and subtle than previously identified barriers because of unfavorable insurance status. While earlier legislative initiatives such as EMTALA and the prudent layperson standard provided important safeguards for managed care plan enrollees and the larger community, many emergency providers eventually came to resent the legislation as an unfunded federal mandate for universal access to health care via emergency departments [14] . The resultant combination of regulatory and fiscal pressures on hospitals resulted in increasingly stressed and crowded conditions in many EDs [3] . Regulatory extensions of EMTALA have held health systems liable for providing not only emergency care, but also any needed care. With decreases in reimbursement for the care of publicly insured patients, the ED has become a medical-legal and financial liability for many hospital systems, as the primary portal of entrance for uninsured and publicly insured patients who compete with privately insured patients for scarce inpatient beds [15] .",23.47929061711682,12.520180414530621

Eventually, three standards emerged that established the most basic framework for representing and manipulating web services: the Web Services Description Language (WSDL), Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), and Universal Discovery, Description and Integration (UDDI). WSDL is an Extensible Markup Language (XML)based standard for describing web services and specifying their parameters, inputs and outputs * . SOAP maps the abstract services described in WSDL to their concrete implementations, describing in detail the objects that are passed to and from web services and enabling them to be executed by the remote client. UDDI enables service providers to publish their services for the community, and potential end-users of the services to browse and look up specific services (http://www.w3.org/).

Although non-emergency A&E visits have slightly decreased in recent years due to situational factors such as the deterrent of severe acute respiratory syndrome and policy-related factors such as the implementation of emergency fees, this trend has been offset by dwindling A&E personnel and more complexity of the case-mix (15, (24) (25) (26) . Several immediate measures, such as relinquishing treatment of the semi-and nonurgent patients to nurses and opening parallel ambulatory clinics next to A&Es, could be more widely adopted (20, 27) . Although there are no laws that forbid turning away patients or diverting ambulances to other A&Es, morality and ethical concerns preclude such measures as policy (12, 28) . However, the Hong Kong government is considering an expansion of public and private primary care services, such as 24/7 and Sunday/Holiday clinics, and also extending primary care services in private clinics. At the same time, the government may enhance public health education through mass media and communities to prevent inappropriate A&E visits. Nevertheless, even widespread adoption of these measures would be insufficient to address the level of crowding in Hong Kong A&Es, and if hospitals are required to comply with governmental mandates regarding waiting time and LOS targets for patient care, additional nurses and medical officers in walk-in clinics would be crucial to buffer the burden of resuscitating emergent patients. The optimal staffing level in an A&E relies on the calculation of time-varying patient demands and the A&E capacity. Previous papers have studied the application of the time-series method, queuing theory, and discrete event simulation to determine the optimal staffing level (29) (30) (31) .

This is not because PPE is ineffective but as a control measure it means the hazard has not been eliminated or replaced, and protection is required. 10 PPE guidelines have been in place in the realm of health careassociated infection and isolation care with little modification for over a decade. 11 Despite this guidance, the lack of standards for design and performance of gowns in particular came to light after the experience of treating patients with EVD in 2014. 12 The Nebraska Biocontainment Unit has described the protocols used for protection of health care workers for EVD care in the literature. 13 The initial standards and procedures set by the hospitals that cared for patients with Ebola in the United States eventually became a guidance resource for managing patients with EVD worldwide. 14 ",22.048155874074435,11.636621166786876

Matthews and colleagues [41] analyzed Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from 30 developing countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America to determine indicators of maternal health care among the urban poor, as compared with the rural population. Their purpose was to see if there was an ''urban advantage'' or ''urban penalty'' for women. The investigators recognized a gap between different urban populations and speculated that the urban poor in many countries were at a disadvantage from their previous rural neighbors who did not migrate to the city. They found massive inequality in both urban and rural areas but greater inequality between slum urbanites or nonslum urbanites. The inequalities arose from exclusion; the urban poor did not have access to health care services and in some cities the slum dwellers were treated as if they did not even exist. However, there was a vast difference in the service gap among different countries. In some, the exclusion was not limited to the poor; services were insufficient for all strata of wealth. In others, it was primarily the poor who were excluded. And in some countries the urban population was well served without wealth or class distinction; a goal to strive for! Even when governmental programs to provide public clinics are established in a country, few of these are constructed in slum areas because of their tenuous nature [42] . Health care access is minimal at best in urban slums and is often predominated by private for-profit clinics [43] . Government investment in health care infrastructure in slums is limited. A study in Nairobi slums indicated that of 503 clinics serving what is reportedly the largest slum community in all of sub-Saharan Africa, only 6 (1%) were public and 79 (16%) were private not-forprofit clinics. Nearly all of the private for-profit clinics 418 (83%) in Nairobi slums are of dubious quality [44, 45] . The more qualified practices are expensive, forcing the use of cheaper private facilities that are often not licensed and operate out of small shacks and maternity homes without complying with any standards of care. Despite the poor quality, it is the less expensive private facilities that are the ones most often used by the residents. Women residing in slum areas, as elsewhere, prefer to deliver their babies in health care facilities where access is easy and quality is perceived to be high [46] . Given the difficulties already illustrated in transportation, access to public and nonprofit clinics of higher quality outside the slum areas is problematic; however, a lack of health care facilities is not apparent in all slum areas. In Chennai, India, slum residents were satisfied with their access to health care facilities with a mix of both government and private clinics within close proximity to residents; however, government clinics here were also somewhat limited, and individuals preferred the private clinics, considering them to provide better services [47] .",21.9174209750267,9.267503191610201

This document highlighted concerns associated with the potential increased risk of generating infectious aerosols in the course of this method of respiratory support. 27 Research using experimental lung models demonstrated that exposure to exhaled air from patients receiving NIV with face mask occurs within 1 m. 28 Likewise, guidelines for the acquisition of ventilators to meet the demands for pandemic flu and mass casualty incidents, published in 2006 by the American Association of Respiratory Care, recommended the avoidance of NIV in case of contagious respiratory diseases due to contamination risk. 29 The Task Force on Mass Critical Care voiced similar opinions regarding noninvasive ventilation during their summit meeting in January 2007. Their suggestions regarding interventions for emergency mass critical care and the use of mechanical ventilation during a disaster recommended only the ""provision of a basic mode of sustained, positive pressure ventilation"" without any reference to NIV. 30 The task force further declared NIV a high-risk procedure due to the potential for air flow from the mask to increase the risk of infectious transmission to the staff and to other patients. 27, 29 Since 2009, however, some published documents have mentioned NIV as a possible procedure during an epidemic. In a position statement, the Australian Society for Infectious Diseases recommends ""reserving negative-pressure ventilation rooms (if available) for intensive care patients, especially those receiving non-invasive ventilation."" 31 The UK Department of Health, in ""Guidance for infection control in critical care for pandemic influenza,"" approved the use of NIV under strict infection control measures. Emphasis was given to staff training in infection control and the use of personal protection by gown, gloves, eye protection, and a filtering half mask with exhalation valve (FFP3) respirator; negative pressure rooms; nonvented mask or helmet; applying and fitting the mask before turning on the respirator; and removing the mask after turning off the respirator. 32 The recommendation for NIV use during an epidemic is also consistent with the Institute of Medicine's 2012 ""Crisis standards of care: a systems framework for catastrophic disaster response.""

High patient volume in acute care limits the ability to place patients suspected of requiring single rooms in these until a diagnosis is confirmed. This creates a potential reservoir of infection for both patients and healthcare workers alike. It has also been shown that health care workers can be reluctant to implement transmission based precautions until a diagnosis is confirmed due to perceived and real imposts on time and resources, plus administrative patient flow pressure. Human factors may lead to a situation where the healthcare workers are cognitively overloaded and as their regular practice may be less than 100%, small breaches can occur that they themselves do not identify as breaches. The 'To Err is Human' report in 2000 identified the gap between what is recommended practice and actual practice [9] . Consistently this gap is identified in the application of transmission based precautions as well as other infection prevention strategies potentially leading to health care acquired infections in patients and health care workers [10] . The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Dr Tom Frieden was recently quoted as saying ''There are 75,000 deaths each year from infections spread in hospitals in the U.S. We know no matter how good our recommendations for hand washing and personal protective equipment are, we have to have a large margin of safety for how they will actually be implemented in the field'' [11] suggesting that the CDC acknowledges that clinicians are not always going to follow IPC guidelines, and this is largely unintentional. Yet, accepting standards that put patients, staff and visitors at risk goes against legal and ethical responsibilities of health care staff. This reinforces the need for practices to be second nature for health care workers to ensure that as the potential for harm increases small errors do not have fatal consequences. The practice of infection prevention and control is not an optional extra for clinical practice and patient management, it is essential to both patient and healthcare worker safety. The ability to recognise infectious conditions and implement the appropriate TBP at all times and not only at times of heightened awareness is therefore particularly relevant in the ED context.",23.165636867920362,10.548732353969346

It has been proposed that these marshaled personnel may be from a nontraditional disaster responder profession. 3, 5 Optometrists have been historically involved with community service dating back more than 100 years 6 and responded to the Hurricane Katrina disaster. 7 In this tradition, optometrists, with their medical and clinical background supplemented with additional training, can serve as surge reserve personnel, e.g., they are competent in diagnosing and treating certain casualties. 8 The eye is particularly vulnerable to injury during disasters because it is exposed, easily penetrated by sharp objects, and subject to rupture or contusion from blunt trauma. 9 Eye injuries often occur in association with head trauma or multiple systemic injuries, which require expert triage and staging of care to preserve both life and sight. Airborne chemicals or smoke can cause debilitating eye pain and vision loss, which can affect both civilian victims and the ability of first responders to work. An important health care practitioner to provide emergency treatment for these disaster-associated injuries can be the optometrist, allowing other medical personnel to apply their skills and tend to other injuries. To accomplish these diagnostic and treatment tasks, it is important that optometrists are well informed of the signs and symptoms of biological agents, radiologic effects, and traumatic injuries. Thus, additional training of optometrists may enable them to be a valuable resource in disaster management when properly integrated into disaster response plans. Additionally, optometrists can serve as an element in epidemic surveillance. Severe acute respiratory syndrome, influenza, and certain biological terrorism agents can produce flulike symptoms, which commonly involve the eye. Optometrists may attend to such patients before other clinicians and, therefore, should be knowledgeable of the signs and symptoms of these infectious diseases. 8, 10 A primary barrier to optometrists participating in a disaster surge response is the scope-of-practice laws and regulations. These legal parameters of care are being modified for disasters after a 2004 conference of experts in the fields of bioethics, emergency medicine, emergency management, health administration, health law and policy, and public health 11 ; that meeting's purpose was to examine how standards of care may need to be altered in the event of a mass casualty incident.

Simply stated, the goal of mass critical care is to provide a few key interventions (those with the highest impact and potential to save lives) to many people rather then providing very resource intense interventions to a few [40, 46, 47] . All processes and procedures are open to modification and must be considered from a new perspective including standards of care, staffing, equipment, and the allocation of resources. Although there certainly is a need to modify the standard of care during a pandemic, one must always keep in mind the primary objective of ensuring that the maximum number of people possible, survive. Thus, caution must be exercised when expanding clinical roles or modifying management to ensure that care is not compromised beyond the point where more harm is being done than good. For instance, it is of little use to move to a ventilation strategy such as long term manual ventilation with bag-valve-masks that may allow many more people to be ventilated but results in an increased number of deaths due to barotrauma than would have occurred if fewer patients were ventilated using a less harmful ventilation strategy. Striking an appropriate balance requires monitoring treatment outcomes during the response. In order to comply with medicolegal and ethical standards, plans to alter the standard of care during a pandemic should be publicly discussed and documented in advance with clear, objective criteria defined for the institution of mass critical care [44] .

Financial realities must be considered. It is important to address the cost of care and give clients a schedule and treatment plan (including a cost estimate) for upcoming visits so that they can plan for these expenses. The AAHA strongly suggests that all pet-owning families consider their ability to meet unexpected expenses that may be incurred for veterinary care (Box 8-1). The expenses may be met through existing savings, credit card reserves, Care Credit or other medical payment cards, monthly budgeting for pet care expenses, or pet health insurance policies. Pet health insurance has become a good method of mitigating health care expenses. The proportion of cats insured varies greatly among different countries, but it is almost invariably lower than the proportion of dogs insured. Pet insurance can provide excellent value for the cost and allow patients to receive highly expensive urgent care and crisis management that may not be feasible otherwise. Many policies now offer preventive health care coverage. Each insurance company works differently, and clients are encouraged to review policies carefully. Few clients are aware of pet insurance without a specific veterinary recommendation; the veterinary team should explain benefits and possible limitations of pet insurance.

Even as many researchers have cautioned that unions need to move with care in scaling up their actions lest they lose local power, most unions have made at least sporadic attempts to engage in some form of labour internationalism. Few unions have moved as aggressively as the US-based Service Employees International Union's (SEIU). SEIU leadership has declared that the labour movement must ''jump scale"" to match the global strategies of capitalism. The stated goal of the SEIU is to organize workers across borders under the same union banner and negotiate multi-national labour agreements with global corporations. Aguiar and Ryan (2009) examine the prospects for the SEIU's efforts to 'export"" their successful Justice for Janitors (JfJ) campaign. Aguiar and Ryan discuss how the JfJ model is being exported to Canada and Australia to organize cleaners and assess the prospects for ''going global."" The authors conclude that JfJ is, in fact, a complex and multiscalar campaign which involves local negotiation and is flexible enough to adapt to diverse contexts. Anderson (2009) proposes that unions can exploit the uneven global economic landscape in much the same way as capital does. In his research on the Driving Up Standards campaign (a public transport sector initiative involving the American SEIU and IBT, and the British T&G), he argues that when unions expand the scale of their activities, they can create multiple networks and nodes for activism which in turn, results in multiplying the number of corporate vulnerabilities that can be targeted. Drawing upon the Deleuzian notion of lines of flight to explore the multiple sites for activism, Anderson contends that just as labour faces uneven support and expectations from states, consumers, workers, and shareholders, so do TNCs. He finds, however, that the ability of unions to create and maintain transnational networks and sustained activism is a difficult prospect as unions have difficulty ''unlocking powers"" that are more often rooted in national and local contexts. Though he concludes that unions can be successful in challenging capital by ''bending scales"", he maintains that they must use supple strategies that recognize the temporal and spatial aspects of their challenges and any challenge to global capital will ''require the capacity to exert pressure from a variety of angles over a sustained period of time.""",18.987676743613363,7.571656763249475

Pearson and Clair (1998) for example, define crisis as ''a low-probability, high-impact event that threatens the viability of the organization and is characterized by ambiguity of cause, effect, and means of resolution, as well as a belief that decisions must be made swiftly'' (p. 60). This definition highlights three important aspects of a crisis. First, a crisis is a major, unpredictable event that is likely to interfere with normal business operations and has the potential to threaten organisational survival (Pearson, Misra, Clair, & Mitroff, 1997) . Second, a crisis has a low probability of occurring and includes an element of surprise. Finally, a crisis is characterised by time pressures, requiring a quick response in order to minimise its impact. Faulkner (2001) argued that 'crisis' describes a situation ''where the root cause of an event is, to some extent, selfinflicted through such problems as inept management structures and practices or a failure to adapt to change'' (p. 136). Hence, crises represent situations where the cause of the problem is internal and associated with certain actions (or inactions) of the organisation, while situations ''where an enterprise y is confronted with sudden unpredictable catastrophic changes over which it has little control'' were termed a ''disaster'' (Faulkner, 2001, p. 136) . Therefore, in his view, disasters are caused externally, either by natural phenomena or external human actions. Prideaux, Laws, and Faulkner (2003) argued ''there is a need to examine complex situations where numerous crises, disasters and political system failures act in unison to create one or more shocks'' (p. 477). They offer a classification of shocks based on severity, probability and level of certainty. The most severe types of shocks are those that ''are not anticipated and may be the result of a crisis or disaster'' (p. 484).",18.888995737660725,7.208437100341001

It has positioned WHO as a global regulatory agency and has greatly shaped the world's generic markets, driving down costs while ensuring the quality of products. 244 It has also become an important training ground for regulators and inspectors, paving the way for regional harmonisation. 245 The Commission believes that the WHO/UN Prequalifi cation Programme can and should evolve to address a wider range of essential medicines, at least until international standards have been established and the global generic market has developed suffi cient capacity to produce and distribute adequate supplies of quality, safe medicines. For example, assessments of new generic versions of fi rst-line antiretrovirals can now be left to stringent national authorities or regional networks. The focus of WHO's programme should then shift to other priority medicines, such as generic insulin, other biosimilars, and newly developed essential medicines that still pose challenges to NMRAs. The programme's quality standards and public reports should be used as the basis for regulatory convergence and reciprocal recognition; its Public Assessment Reports and Public Inspection Reports can serve as examples for all NMRAs. The transparency initiatives of the European and Australian regulators can also serve as exemplars in this regard. 246 A multilateral fi nancing mechanism would enable the prequalifi cation programme to evolve in this way-not merely increasing its existing activities but moving towards the analysis of selected new essential medicines independently from individual donors and manufacturers alike.",22.48249727947863,10.267267464222243

Health care that involves invasive procedures is not without risk even in developed countries. The recent investigation of hepatitis C at an endoscopy clinic in Las Vegas has demonstrated how standards are necessary but not sufficient, even in developed areas. 77 Recognition of the common source and subsequent gaps in basic infection-control practices were possible because, as a result of vaccination, rates of hepatitis in the United States have declined to the point where individual cases can be investigated. 78 These public health and legal checks and balances provide valuable insight but also add to health care costs, 79 and although outbreaks receive wide attention, the majority of cases of hepatitis in the United States are now imported by travelers from developing parts of the world. 78 It has been said we live in a global village. Medical tourism demonstrates how dynamic the boundaries of the village seem to be and how transit between countries, particularly between country of birth and country of residence, affects health in both areas.

Alcohol seems mandatory in antisepsis solutions due to its rapid activity; chlorhexidine gluconate ensures a prolonged bactericidal effect. There are actually some important certainties/recommendations on prevention of CRI like: (1) application of sterile 2% CHG-alcohol to disinfect the skin prior to insertion of a vascular catheter, (2) no need for cleaning the skin with soap or detergent before antiseptic application when it is not obviously dirty or contaminated, (3 )rinsing with sterile water is not recommended after antiseptic application, (4) single-use vials of disinfectant solutions are preferable to multiple-use bottles, (5) daily evaluation of the necessity of retaining central line(s) and removal if they are clinically no longer necessary, (6) non-adherent, soiled, or moistened dressings should be promply replaced, (7) a subclavian site of insertion is preferable unless otherwise contraindicated, (8) full barrier precautions should be used at insertion, (9) hand hygiene with alcoholic solution is mandatory before every manipulation, and (10) every unit should adopt a written protocol for catheter insertion and maintenance. Certainly, there is room for improvement, with behavioral approaches requiring welldesigned multinational trials. However, mortality and CRI rates were not reduced in a prospective randomized controlled study from Brazil employing a behavioral approach for retention or withdrawal of central lines; the rather short evaluation period might have contributed to this.

Berg and Appelbaum 101 have outlined four main standards for determining decision-making competence based on a framework developed by Appelbaum and Grisso. 102 The first standard, most widely used by courts and legislatures, is the ability to communicate a choice. Many potential subjects fail to reach this standard because they are unable to coherently communicate, whether due to chronic schizophrenia, various levels of consciousness due to psychotic episodes, or other disorders. The ability to communicate choice does not necessarily translate into the capacity to make a choice autonomously. Comatose, mute, catatonic, or severely depressed persons, individuals with manic or catatonic excitements, and persons with severe psychotic thought disorders or severe dementia will fall under this category. A second standard used is the ability to understand relevant information. This understanding means that the potential subjects have the ability to comprehend the concepts involved in the informed consent disclosure. Understanding itself is not enough; if a person understands the information, but is not able to retain the information long enough to make a decision, they are not competent enough to consent. Impairments of intelligence, attention, and memory can all affect this ability. A third standard is the ability to appreciate the nature of the situation and its likely consequences. The subject must be able to apply the information to his or her own situation. Denial, delusions, and psychotic levels of distortion can all impair this ability.

Think about the discussion of standards in serology, or even virus culture. However, if we focus on the implementation of molecular diagnostics in clinical virology, the fact is that we have to implement new assays on a regular basis. Assays have recently been introduced for the detection of SARS coronavirus, the new coronavirus NL-63, the human metapneumovirus, the detection of influenza H7N7 or H5N1. The list is long, and we are also improving assays all the time. But looking at the current literature in this journal or equivalents in the US, many authors do not use yet the entire possibilities for standardisation inherent to molecular diagnostics techniques. One particular aspect is the implementation of internal controls throughout the whole test process from nucleic acid isolation until quantitative detection. But working in clinical virology, we have to be confident in generating accurate and reliable results. Yet the lack of standards for realtime technology is not inevitable. It is fascinating to observe that investigators still focus so frequently on the use of plasmid standards for the generation of external standard curves needed for quantification of clinical samples. We have characterised extensively these external plasmid standards, while we know so little about the clinical samples we are analysing. Why are not all processes monitored internally, and why are these external plasmid standard curves not treated the same way as clinical material?

The widespread application of computer-based records in health care was recommended as early as 1991 by the IOM, which called them ''an essential technology for patient care.'' 10 This report was updated in 1997 11 and followed by the IOM's ''To Err Is Human'' report in 1999, which focused the nation's attention on the problem of medical errors. 2 Since then, several additional national expert panels have advocated widespread application of health IT. 3, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] Health IT should deliver complete medical information immediately for patient care when and where needed, including both patient-specific information and relevant decision support based on the latest scientific findings and guidelines.

Indeed, while global standards might initially be seen by some as intrusive, they can also be beneficial to industry by minimizing unfair differences and market distortions between countries. Global standards that ban the use of antimicrobials as growth promoters, for example, would ensure that all producers of animal products face the same regulatory requirements and constraints.

EUAs also raise particular questions of what role, if any, investigational drugs should play in a communicable disease outbreak (33). Communicable diseases often present urgent needs by patients, because outbreaks are usually acute in nature, with high transmissibility and potentially high community morbidity and mortality. Determining benefits and risks of an investigational drug or biologic in the setting of a public health crisis involves a certain amount of duress on investigators, health care providers, and patients, with limited time for a considered decision. Thus, EUAs may not be appropriate for drugs that are in very early-phase testing, where reasonable risk/benefit ratios are almost entirely unknown, and a potentially large number of subjects will be exposed to the drug. With regard to benefits, infectious disease emergencies also carry a unique consideration: treatment of an index patient has potential to both benefit the individual, but also the community at large, by containing the outbreak.

It is painful to admit that standards do not come overnight. The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (US-CDC) has invested tremendous effort in collecting nationally notifiable data since 1961 [5].

This leads to medically undesirable and unnecessary health care utilization and increased costs.1) The recent outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in South Korea was also related to the failure of the Korean primary care system.

In particular, most of these studies used genomic DNA prepared from graded doses of persistently infected cell lines such as 8E5 (34) , U1 (10), ACH-2 (10, 29) , or mixtures of such lines (37) as their standards. The problem with these cell lines is that they are clonal and contain one (19) , two (18) , or two (11) nonrandom HIV-1 integration sites, respectively. Standards prepared from these lines are likely to under-or overestimate the number of integration events in nearly all types of unknowns, since the proviruses these cell lines harbor are integrated at specific, nonvariable distances from the Alu repeats within their genomes. Single integration events can be detected in these clonal DNA standards, presumably arising from integration sites relatively close to the nearest Alu element. However, in assigning numbers to these signals, an implicit assumption must be made that all integration events in the unknowns must also be detectable by PCR (7) . Due to the random nature of both HIV-1 integration and Alu retroposition, each Alu-gag integration site in a nonclonal collection of infected cells will be amplified with a different efficiency. It is likely that significant (and unknown) numbers of proviruses are inserted too far away from an Alu site to be efficiently amplified. A corollary to this assertion is that the frequencies of integration within resting CD4 ϩ T cells that were previously determined using clonal PCR standards are likely to have been underestimated.",21.53031820036709,8.953606818538992

Prior reports of the hospital course of care for COVID-19 patients showed that the vast majority of those admitted to the ICU were critical and only one-in-five of those who were critical survived, mostly because of ICU care. Thus, the percentage of critically ill patients that should have gone to the ICU but did not and survived should be much lower, likely only 5%; we therefore assumed a 95% mortality for patients that would have been placed in a critical care bed but did not because their local critical care bed capacity had been exceeded. 33",18.27054797799109,9.366219213771338

As of March 26, 2020, the United States had the highest number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV2, of any country in the world. 2 Multiple areas in the US are seeing dramatic increases in cases of COVID-19 and concerns are mounting that local medical system response capacities will be quickly exceeded. Hospital critical care is perhaps the most important medical system choke point in terms of preventing deaths in a disaster scenario such as with the current COVID-19 pandemic. 3, 4 A spectrum of critical care, from intensive care units to other serviceable hospital critical care structures, can be drafted in the event of mass disasters, potentially doubling hospital capacity in a crisis care surge situation. 5, 6, 7, 8 However, whether the nation's potential hospital surge capacity is exactly double, or perhaps more or less than that, in the context of rapidly growing cases of COVID-19 in the US, remains unclear.

Our objectives in doing this was to highlight US counties that are at risk of exceeding their critical care surge capacity limits within one month, indicate the typical time it would take these counties to exceed their critical care surge capacity limits, and estimate the excess mortality that would potentially result from exceeding critical care surge capacity limits in these counties. These objectives speak to the capabilities of the US medical system under disaster conditions and the usefulness of social distancing and other prevention strategies for slowing the presentation rate of severe COVID-19 cases to a point where the US critical care system can adapt in minimizing preventable mortality. 11, 12 ",19.762158742351755,9.186134955069619

The needs and capabilities of both schools and healthcare systems vary drastically across the United States, so county-level simulations of healthcare worker absenteeism and school closures could be far more impactful and targeted for local communities than state or national-level simulations. China's CDC reports that patients with comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes had higher rates of fatality from COVID-19 (0.9% case fatality with no reported comorbidities, 10.5% and 7.3% for comorbidities of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, respectively). 6 The prevalence of these comorbidities also varies geographically in the US, further highlighting the importance of regional analysis. [7] [8] [9] To maintain healthcare systems in the event of a school closure, it could be beneficial to assist healthcare workers with child care. Previous work has shown that increased wages are associated with lower absenteeism, so it is possible that child care subsidies could reduce absenteeism by alleviating the financial burden of child care for healthcare workers as well as further incentivizing them to remain at work. 10, 11 Furthermore, the costs of child care (which is the main barrier to finding child care) and the salaries of healthcare workers vary regionally, so the necessity of child care subsidization for healthcare workers could also vary regionally. 12 Here, we provide county-level microsimulation analyses on the potential effects of COVID-19 school closures on healthcare worker absenteeism and hospital bed demand across the entirety of the United States over a range of plausible scenarios. We estimate projected healthcare worker absenteeism, county-level associations between absenteeism and severe COVID-19 risk factors, and the effectiveness of school closures on reducing hospital bed demand; we also identify child care subsidies as a potential solution to help maintain healthcare systems during a pandemic.

We experimented with the release time point of 150 days after the occurrence of patient zero, which is Apr. 27 th , 2020 (Figure 4b) . Results showed that, at that time the epidemic seemed to be under control with only 168 infected with symptoms and 2,912 with medical care on Apr. 27 th , 2020 ( Figure 4c ) and kept decreasing until Mar 9 th , 2020, in which the status number of infected with symptoms and 2,912 with medical care was 178 and 2,201 respectively. However, the number of exposed people increased from 863 on Apr. 27 th to 1,085 on Mar 9 th , 2020, with the epidemic rapidly rebounded. After 120 days of releasing the city, on Aug. 25 th , 2020, 11,203 exposed, 2,315 infected with symptoms and 20,516 with medical care were predicted (Figure 4d ). The beds in hospitals would not be enough again on Oct. 2 nd , 2020 with over 256,730 accumulated infections.",11.31231257866289,2.4494907323783934
