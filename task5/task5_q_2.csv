Severe respiratory illness is a significant symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection Volume 11, Number 2; 462-464, April 2020 because the ACE2 receptor is widely expressed in the lung alveolar type II cells and capillary endothelial cells. Besides, alveolar cells express TMPRSS2 [1, 7] . Infection of the lung by this virus leads to a cytokine storm with elevated levels of multiple proinflammatory cytokines, which causes edema, air exchange dysfunction, acute respiratory distress, secondary infection, which may result in death [1] . ACE2 expression is also seen in other tissues such as the heart, liver, kidney, and digestive organs. Such expression pattern explains why infected ICU patients are afflicted with not only acute respiratory distress syndrome but also other complications such as myocardial injury, arrhythmia, acute kidney injury, shock, and death from multiple organ dysfunction syndromes [1, 8] . The World Health Organization has proclaimed this epidemic as a global public health emergency [3] .

Management of complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, hypoxemia, pleural effusions, pneumothoraces, disseminated intravascular coagulation, renal dysfunction, and multi-organ disease requires excellent intensive care [4, 51] . It is possible that improving and standardizing optimal intensive care unit (ICU) care for patients with H5N1, including ensuring adequate oxygen delivery and optimizing ventilator management, might result in lower mortality-even among patients who are admitted with severe disease. Collection of comprehensive clinical data detailing how patients with H5N1 are cared for, and training in standard ICU care and ventilator management of patients with H5N1 for clinicians in H5N1affected countries, might lead to improved clinical management with higher patient survival. Infection control must be emphasized among health care workers and family caregivers [59] [60] [61] . In the setting of a disease with very high mortality, with no available controlled human clinical data to guide clinicians, in which most patients present with severe disease, a number of combined strategies should be considered for therapy of H5N1 patients. These include both pharmacological strategies (combination antiviral treatment, anti-inflammatory agents, and immunotherapy), and non-pharmacological strategies (standardization of optimal ventilator and fluid management, especially for acute respiratory distress syndrome, and management of other complications). Collection of detailed clinical data is needed to inform optimal management of patients with H5N1, with defined clinical and virological outcomes.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is a negative regulator of angiotensin II in the renin-angiotensin system, has been reported to have a crucial role in ALI. Downregulation of ACE2 is always associated with the ALI or ARDS induced by avian influenza virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus and sepsis. However, the molecular mechanism of the decreased expression of ACE2 in ALI is unclear. Here we show that avian influenza virus H5N1 induced the upregulation of miR-200c-3p, which was then demonstrated to target the 3′-untranslated region of ACE2. Then, we found that nonstructural protein 1 and viral RNA of H5N1 contributed to the induction of miR-200c-3p during viral infection. Additionally, the synthetic analog of viral double-stranded RNA (poly (I:C)), bacterial lipopolysaccharide and lipoteichoic acid can all markedly increase the expression of miR-200c-3p in a nuclear factor-κB-dependent manner. Furthermore, markedly elevated plasma levels of miR-200c-3p were observed in severe pneumonia patients. The inhibition of miR-200c-3p ameliorated the ALI induced by H5N1 virus infection in vivo, indicating a potential therapeutic target. Therefore, we identify a shared mechanism of viral and bacterial lung infection-induced ALI/ARDS via nuclear factor-κB-dependent upregulation of miR-200c-3p to reduce ACE2 levels, which leads increased angiotensin II levels and subsequently causes lung injury.",43.09015035944769,17.08735241404331

The cytometric analyses of COVID-19 patients showed reduced counts of peripheral CD4 and CD8 T cells, while their status was hyperactivated. In addition, an increased concentration of highly proinflammatory CCR6+ Th17 in CD4 T cells has been reported, and CD8 T cells were found to harbor high concentrations of cytotoxic granules, suggesting that overactivation of T cells tends to contribute to the severe immune injury of the disease [17] .

The current understanding of the pathogenesis of ARDS suggests that the degree of inflammatory response and its sustained leukocyte activation may determine the clinical evolution of ARDS. During the lung inflammatory events, the alveolar compartmentalization could be lost, allowing the passage of cytokines released to the bloodstream by any other organ to the pulmonary endothelium or inversely from the lung to the bloodstream. These cytokines, especially IL-1, TNF-a, and IL-8, have important roles in the lung dysfunction. 7 In this study, patients with viral ARI had increased serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1b and TNF-a), Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-5), and chemokines (MCP-1 and RAN-TES), suggesting complex immune interactions during viral respiratory infection. The source of those cytokines may be cells localized in lung tissue. In this regard, epithelial cells, mast cells, basophils, monocyte/macrophages, and lymphocytes could secrete diverse types of cytokines and chemokines (IL-1, TNF, IL-4, IL-5, IL8, MCP-1, RANTES) during lung tissue-virus interactions. [8] [9] [10] However, in this study, monocyte cultures infected by RSV, adenovirus, or parainfluenza virus were capable of reproducing a similar cytokine and chemokine profiles to those observed in virus-infected patients, suggesting that in part, circulating monocytes could be the source of serum cytokines and chemokines. Accordingly, the chemokine and chemokine receptor inducer effect of RSV on monocyte/macrophage cultures has been reported. 11 As alveolar compartmentalization could be lost during viral-induced lung injury, 7 a combination of both lung and circulating monocyte cytokine and chemokine productions can contribute to the increased serum levels found in this study.",42.804163845243075,14.427581410757409

These substances originate not only from pathogens, but also from injured host cells. At the molecular level, these substances have various sizes and biochemical characteristics, classifying them as protein substances and non-protein substances. Immune cells and immune proteins may recognize and act on these substances, including pathogenic proteins and peptides, depending upon the size and biochemical properties of the substances (this theory is known as the protein-homeostasis-system hypothesis).

Recently, Dellamonica and colleagues [2] presented a method to predict alveolar recruitment. We hypothesised that the amount of recruitable volume allows the discrimination between ARDS patients and patients with healthy lungs (HL). Methods We recalculated the recruited volume (RV) in 25 patients with ARDS [3] according to the method proposed by Dellamonica and colleagues during an incremental PEEP manoeuvre (PEEP increased until the plateau pressure reached 45 cmH 2 O). RV was calculated as the change in end-expiratory lung volume minus total respiratory system compliance times the PEEP change (RV = ΔEELV -CTOT×ΔPEEP). For comparison, 12 patients with HL undergoing elective surgery in general anaesthesia were measured using the same protocol. Results Both ARDS and HL patients exhibited typical P-V curves and stepwise recruitment ( Figure 1 ). By raising PEEP from 0 to 12 cmH 2 O, ARDS patients recruited 331 ± 195 ml (mean ± SD) and HL patients 435 ± 43 ml. There was a strong correlation (R 2 = 0.88) of the total RV with the end-inspiratory volume at a plateau pressure of 45 cmH 2 O in both groups; that is, recruitment was found to the same extent in both groups ( Figure 2 ). Conclusion The relative contribution of RV to lung volume gain is similar in ARDS and in patients with healthy lungs.

The exact reasons why some individuals succumbed to the infection while others remained relatively unaffected have not been clarified. Aging, an important risk factor in SARS-CoV-associated disease, is associated with changes in immunity [1, 2, 3] . Consequently, elderly individuals are at greater risk of contracting more severe and longer lasting infections with increased morbidity and mortality, exemplified by respiratory tract infections caused by influenza A virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus [4, 5, 6] . The clinical course of SARS-CoV-induced disease follows a triphasic pattern [5] . The first phase is characterized by fever, myalgia and other systemic symptoms that are likely caused by the increase in viral replication and cytolysis. The second phase of the disease is characterized by a decrease in viral replication that correlates with the onset of IgG conversion. Interestingly, it is also in this phase that severe clinical worsening is seen, which can not be explained by uncontrolled viral replication. It has been hypothesized that the diffuse alveolar lung damage in this phase is caused by an over exuberant host response [5, 7, 8] . The majority of patients recovers after 1-2 weeks, but up to one-third of the patients progress to the third phase and develop severe inflammation of the lung, characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [9] . The clinical course and outcome of SARS-CoV disease are more favorable in children younger than 12 years of age as compared to adolescents and adults [10, 11, 12] ; elderly patients have a poor prognosis, with mortality rates of up to ,50% [5, 6] .",50.44585387277691,19.257979983377762

SARS-CoV infection causes acute lung injury (ALI) that may develop into life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with advanced age correlating positively with adverse disease outcome. The molecular pathways, however, that cause virus-induced ALI/ARDS in aged individuals are ill-defined. Here, we show that SARS-CoVinfected aged macaques develop more severe pathology than young adult animals, even though viral replication levels are similar. Comprehensive genomic analyses indicate that aged macaques have a stronger host response to virus infection than young adult macaques, with an increase in differential expression of genes associated with inflammation, with NF-kB as central player, whereas expression of type I interferon (IFN)-b is reduced. Therapeutic treatment of SARS-CoV-infected aged macaques with type I IFN reduces pathology and diminishes pro-inflammatory gene expression, including interleukin-8 (IL-8) levels, without affecting virus replication in the lungs. Thus, ALI in SARS-CoV-infected aged macaques developed as a result of an exacerbated innate host response.

A trained team, careful patient selection and optimal choice of devices, can optimize outcome of NIV Non invasive ventilation (NIV) may be considered as one of the most important advances in respiratory medicine over the past 20 years, [8, 9] and is increasingly being utilized world-wide [10] . A PubMed search from January 1966 to March 2015 with the term ""non invasive ventilation"" defines NIV as ""any form of ventilatory support applied without endotracheal intubation (ETI)"". There is strong evidence (Level A) for the use of NIV to prevent ETI in acute on chronic respiratory failure, acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, and to facilitate extubation in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Less evidence supports the use of NIV for patients with severe acute asthma exacerbations, post-operative or post-extubation acute respiratory failure (ARF), pneumonia, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [8, 9] . Nevertheless, many other potential applications have been proposed [12] . This review will focus on potential new indications for NIV. Although potentially risky, bronchoscopy may be required for some severely hypoxaemic patients [13] . In the past, the American Thoracic Society (ATS) did not recommend flexible bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in such conditions when supplemental oxygen cannot correct an arterial oxygen tension (PaO 2 ) at least to 75 mmHg or an arterial oxygen saturation (SaO 2 ) to 90 % [14] . On the other hand, non-use of bronchoscopy in these high risk patients may result in less effective, empiric treatment. Until recently, when bronchoscopy wws needed in hypoxaemic conditions, only ETI and mechanical ventilation were available to provide adequate ventilation and oxygenation. Unfortunately, invasive mechanical ventilation is associated with complications related to ETI, baro-or volutrauma, and the loss of airway defense mechanisms. NIV has the potential to avoid these complications while ensuring a similar level of ventilatory efficacy and control of hypoxemia.",54.594209896442244,18.52108809623463

This clinical case presents the history of a woman hospitalized for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). A 62-year-old woman, with regular physical activity and no history of respiratory disease or smoking, was hospitalized for moderate ARDS with bilateral pneumonitis. Fourteen days later, she was discharged from the intensive care unit and received respiratory physical therapy. One month later, she experienced exertional dyspnea. A regression of alveolar condensation with persistent sequelae at the pulmonary bases was noted. Three months later, the patient continued daily physical activity with satisfactory tolerance. A reduction in alveolar-capillary transfer, inappropriate hyperventilation upon exercise, and impairment of gas exchanges at maximal effort, suggestive of pulmonary shunt, were demonstrated. At the 6-month evaluation, the patient displayed exertional dyspnea with residual bilateral basal consolidations. Six months later, the dyspnea had ceased. The persistence of bilateral basal interstitial syndrome associated with bronchial dilatation and pleural-based consolidations was noted, as well as a stable impaired alveolar-capillary diffusing capacity. Discussion. Upon discharge from intensive care, pulmonary follow-up should be proposed to ARDS survivors. Moreover, pulmonary function testing at rest and exercise is advised as soon as possible to evaluate the respiratory sequelae. This will help to limit the severity of complications through adapted exercise rehabilitation and then regular physical activity.",40.987855551632904,16.630366545217665

We describe the use of lung ultrasound imaging and findings in two cases of severe respiratory failure from avian influenza A (H7N9) infection. Methods: Serial lung ultrasound images and video from two cases of H7N9 respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in a tertiary care intensive care unit were analyzed for characteristic lung ultrasound findings described previously for respiratory failure and infection. These findings were followed serially, correlated with clinical course and chest X-ray. Results: In both patients, characteristic lung ultrasound findings have been observed as previously described in viral pulmonary infections: subpleural consolidations associated or not with local pleural effusion. In addition, numerous, confluent, or coalescing B-lines leading to 'white lung' with corresponding pleural line thickening are associated with ARDS.

Among the prominent features of this infection, a minimal intranasal inoculum (30 -100 pfu) results in robust virus replication within bronchial epithelial cells that is accompanied by profound granulocyte recruitment. In the absence of pharmacologic intervention, PVM infection progresses to pulmonary edema and respiratory compromise, similar to the more severe forms of RSV infection experienced by human infants [10, 11] . In our earlier studies, we identified the chemokine CCL3 (MIP-1α) as a crucial component of this inflammatory response. PVM not only elicits production of CCL3 by infected bronchial epithelial cells [12] , mice devoid of CCL3 or its receptor, CCR1, recruit dramatically fewer neutrophils to airways [13] . Blockade of the CCL3/CCR1 proinflammatory signaling pathway in conjunction with antiviral therapy resulted in improved survival in response to an otherwise lethal virus inoculum [14, 15] . As CCL3 is only one of several major pro-inflammatory signaling pathways activated by PVM infection [12] , there is certainly the possibility of additive, synergistic, or hierarchical means to promote and to amplify the ongoing inflammatory response.",34.87364137877846,12.717558500403547

Endothelial heterogeneity is governed by endowed molecules in the endothelium and tropism in different types of pathogen determines the invasiveness of pathogen in each patient. Unique expressivity in the host endothelium and specific affinity of the pathogen to different host organs appears to create variable organ syndromes. Figure 4 summarizes the examples of MODS in various organs that had been known to occur in EA-VMTD. The organ examples showing affinity to pathogens could be the brain with encephalopathy [94] due to various encephalitis viruses, lungs with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [70] due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV or middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, kidneys with hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) [29] due to STEC, and others. Currently the pathophysiological mechanism of organ dysfunction is thought to be the results of the direct invasion of pathogen into the tissue of the involved organs. This mechanism may lead to combined compromise of the endothelium and SET/EVT, triggering cellulitis or abscess and macrothrombsis. However, this endothelial breach occurs uncommonly because although sepsisinduced endotheliopathy is universal, typically SET/EVT is not compromised in sepsis. MODS occur as a result of microthrombosis that causes reversible hypoxia in organs unless it advances to terminal multiorgan failure. Organ dysfunction syndrome in sepsis, including fulminant hepatic failure (FHF)/acute liver failure [92] , acute necrotizing pancreatitis [93] , myocardial infarction [95] , acute adrenal insufficiency [50, 96, 97] , and rhabdomyolysis [98] may be reversible with improvement of sepsis unless necrotic and gangrenous change develops as seen in tissue gangrene [90] and peripheral digit ischemic syndrome [91] . More serious combined phenotypic syndromes, which underlying pathogenesis is still being debated, include hepatic encephalopathy [92] , hepato-renal syndrome [99, 100] , hepatic coagulopathy [1] [2] [3] 101] , and cardio-pulmonary syndrome [102] .

Perhaps, this oversimplified designation of organ phenotypes has impeded detecting the underlying etiology of organ syndromes. In modern medical literature, for example, many authors claimed one organ phenotypic syndrome causes several other organ dysfunctions such as acute renal failure, [47] [48] [49] . In sepsis, the concept of endothelial heterogeneity and organotropism for organ localization and the phenotype of VMTD as expression of underlying pathology support that biorgan or multiorgan manifestations are just different phenotypes of the same disease EA-VMTD [29] . Likewise, additional organ phenotypes that are often designated as extra-organ manifestations (e.g., extrarenal phenotypes in HUS, extra-pancreatic phenotypes in pancreatitis and extra-pulmonary phenotypes in acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]) are expression of the same hemostatic disease EA-VMTD. Indeed, extraorgan phenotypes are misrepresentation. The organ phenotype expression associated with EA-VMTD is determined by combined mechanism of underlying endothelial heterogeneity of each host [29, 38, 39] and organ/tissue tropism of each pathogen/toxin [40] . For examples, the phenotypes of STEC-HUS [29, 41] are the combined results of genotypic endothelial heterogeneity of the host and genotypic tropism of STEC on the gastrointestinal tracts, kidneys, lungs, brain and others. Likewise, the phenotypes of Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome [50] associated with Neisseria meningitides are expressed as a result of combined endothelial heterogeneity of the host and tissue tropism of the bacteria in the adrenals and meninges.

The role of steroids in the management of pneumonia remains controversial. On the one hand, steroids might have the potential to decrease intrapulmonary inflammation and thus to reduce some ARDS-related pulmonary lesions. But, on the other hand, steroids might increase immunosuppression, favor persistent viral replication, and promote superinfection. Based on the results of two randomized controlled trials, the benefit-to-risk ratio argues for its use Patients who received steroids were matched in a 1:6 ratio to a control group of patients who did not receive steroids. Matched controls were screened from the current cohort with the following four matching criteria: age, year of ICU admission, SOFA score at day 1, and ARDS criteria according to the Berlin definition ARDS acute respiratory distress syndrome, ICU intensive care unit, PaO 2 :FiO 2 ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen, SOFA Sequential Organ Failure Assessment in severe Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [42, 43] . A recent meta-analysis reported that it may decrease the risk of ARDS as adjunctive therapy in community-acquired pneumonia [44] . On the other hand, no benefit has been demonstrated with the use of steroids in influenza pneumonia [45] . In 1998, Mer and Richards [39] reported on 15 adult patients treated for VZV-CAP, six of whom received steroids in addition to antiviral therapy and supportive care. These six patients experienced clinical improvement, a significantly shorter ICU and hospital length of stay, and no mortality when compared to those who did not receive steroids. However, the study design precluded any robust conclusion. Another study from Saudi Arabia reported improvement in oxygenation parameters in 10 adult patients treated for VZV-CAP with steroids as adjunctive therapy [40] . This was not our experience in the present study. Ten patients received steroids 4.5 (1-15) days after ICU admission. We compared these 10 patients to 60 matched controls who did not receive steroids. There was no difference between the steroid group and the nonsteroid group in ICU and hospital mortality. However, patients treated with steroids had a longer duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, more bacterial superinfection, and an increased ICU and hospital length of stay than control patients not treated with steroids. Thus, our data did not report any benefit associated with the use of steroids as adjunctive therapy in severe VZV-CAP. Our study has several limitations. First, given the retrospective design over a long period of time, supportive care practices may have changed throughout the study period and influenced the results. However, we report the largest study on the severe forms of VZV-CAP and we believe that it adds valuable data to the current knowledge. Second, we had no biological identification of VZV for all patients included our study. Nevertheless, clinical signs and symptoms of chickenpox are obvious in most cases and laboratory diagnosis is restricted to unusual cases. Thus, we can reasonably assume that the patients included in the present study had VZV-CAP. Third, due to the limited number of death we were unable to identify independent predictors of hospital mortality. However, we report predictors of invasive mechanical ventilation that conceivably may be related to mortality. Fourth, for the diagnosis of VZV-CAP we used a database encoded by physicians at patient ICU discharge and we cannot exclude that some patients with VZV-CAP had been missed.",30.61122374998282,12.81898136181993

Lopinavir and ritonavir are antiretroviral protease inhibitors used in combination for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and have limited side effects [20] . The combination of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra®, Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL, USA) has also been used for the treatment of SARS. In one study, the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir used in 41 patients with SARS was associated with significantly fewer adverse clinical outcomes (acute respiratory distress syndrome or death) 21 days after the onset of symptoms compare to ribavirin alone used in 111 historical controls (2.4% versus 28.8%, p = 0.001) [21] . However, the historical nature of the control comparison does not allow for a valid estimate of efficacy. In a high-throughput screening for antiviral compounds, lopinavir inhibited the replication of MERS-CoV at levels below those that occur in the circulation after a single oral dose of lopinavir/ritonavir (400 mg lopinavir with 100 mg ritonavir), suggesting that the drug can achieve therapeutic levels in vivo [16, 22] . The effects of lopinavir/ritonavir, IFN-β1b and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), all of which have shown viral inhibitory effects in vitro, have been tested in common marmosets with severe MERS-CoV infection [23] .

By contrast, treatment with MMF resulted in severe or fatal disease, with higher mean viral loads than in untreated animals.

By doing so, ACE2 may well be able to regulate the net level of Ang II present in tissues, and to antagonize hypertrophic and fibrotic effects resulting from Ang II binding to the AT 1 receptor (red pathway in Figure 1 ) [99, 102] . This counter-regulatory role of ACE2 might also be crucial in maintenance of lung RAS homeostasis [99, 136] . Improperly regulated and increased ACE and Ang II levels have been specifically associated with pathogenesis of different forms of lung diseases, including pulmonary hypertension, sarcoidosis, pulmonary fibrosis and acute respiratory stress syndrome (ARDS) [137] [138] [139] [140] . Most notably, in vivo studies confirmed a functional association between pulmonary RAS and ARDS severity and outcome [141] . ARDS is regarded as the most severe form of acute lung injury, characterized by pulmonary edema, accumulation of inflammatory cells and severe hypoxia [142] . Multiple pathogenic conditions can trigger development of ARDS, including sepsis, gastric juice aspiration, pancreatitis and trauma [143] . Several studies in the past have been pointing towards the importance of pulmonary RAS during the pathogenesis of this type of acute lung injury. Increased levels of ACE are detected in bronchoalveolar fluid of individuals suffering from ARDS [140] . Furthermore, ACE antagonists (i.e., AT 1 receptor blockers) have been demonstrated to delay the onset of ARDS in a rat model with acute lung injury [144] . ACE is thought to negatively contribute to ARDS pathogenesis via a number of mechanisms, including an increase in vascular permeability and reduction of pneumocyte survival [145] .",26.439253873689168,9.667204433155177

To infect its target host cells, SARS-CoV utilizes ACE2, the RAS component now known to orchestrate protection from acute lung failure/ARDS [23, 24, 150] . Notably, after engagement of viral spike proteins with ACE2, the amount of cell surface-expressed ACE2 is reduced [24, 151] . This phenomenon of ACE2 receptor downregulation has been shown to provoke a worsening of lung failure in a SARS-CoV-infected mouse model [145] . By possessing a remarkable higher level of systemic Ang II, SARS-CoV-treated wild-type mice resemble the phenotype observed in ace2 knockout mice, once again emphasizing the key role of ACE2 during ARDS [150] . The worsened ARDS symptoms observed in infected mice could be partially reversed by AT 1 receptor blocker treatment, proving that continuous Ang II binding to AT 1 receptors promotes exacerbation of lung injury during SARS-CoV infection [24] . Thus, SARS-CoV can deteriorate acute lung failure through dysregulation of pulmonary RAS activities. It is worth noting that studies analyzing the role of human ace2 gene polymorphisms in progression of lung injury during SARS-CoV infections did not confirm such a correlation [152, 153] . Other unknown factors are possibly involved in the overall mechanism of lung damage induced by SARS-CoV [154] .",23.799875452680084,9.13627135663921

Methods: This prospective observational cohort study enrolled 63 ventilated adult patients with ARDS; 50 as septic and 13 as non-septic, and followed them for 28 days in intensive care units at a university hospital in Taiwan. Serial serum sTREM-1 levels and cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-α, on days 1, 3, 5, 7 and 14 were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The association between biomarkers and clinical infectious diagnosis/outcome in ARDS was explored. Results: Serum sTREM-1 and cytokine levels could not differentiate septic from non-septic ARDS. Serum log sTREM-1 and inflammatory cytokine levels were correlated positively (r = 0.325 for IL-1β; r = 0.247 for IL-8; r = 0.480 for tumor necrosis factor-α). As prognostic factors, higher serum sTREM-1 level on day 1 and increasing levels over time, especially in the first 5 days, were independent predictors of mortality on day 28, using a multivariate Cox regression model. Serum sTREM-1 levels remained stable or even increased in the non-surviving patients, but decreased in the survivors. Conclusion: Serum sTREM-1 level might not be a reliable marker for infection in ARDS patients. However, as an inflammatory marker, initial serum sTREM-1 level and its trend over time, especially in the first 5 days, could be predictive of short-term mortality. A progressive decline in serum sTREM-1 levels during followup indicates a favorable outcome, whereas persistently elevated sTREM-1 indicates a poor prognosis and should lead to a re-evaluation of therapy.",35.41154735574784,12.442862602088669

They noted that these patients had features similar to infantile respiratory distress syndrome, and that they did not respond to standard treatment. Over the years, many different definitions for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) have been proposed, with the American European Consensus Conference (AECC) most commonly used in the past and the Berlin definition (Table 26 .1) being the most commonly used presently. The Berlin definition of ARDS was published in 2012 and was endorsed by the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM), the American Thoracic Society (ATS), and the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) [2] . They defined ARDS as new or worsening respiratory symptoms within 1 week of clinical insult with bilateral opacities on CXR (Fig. 26 .1) or computerized tomography (CT) scan ( Fig. 26. 2), not fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload. They further classified ARDS into three categories (Table 26. 2) based on the arterial oxygen tension: fractional inspired oxygen ratio (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ) and with a minimum positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5. The Berlin definition is notably different from prior definitions in that it recognizes that a CT scan can be used in lieu of a chest radiograph, acknowledges that diagnosis can occur in the presence of cardiac failure, and includes a minimum PEEP of 5 cm H 2 O (or CPAP for mild ARDS). The Berlin definition simplifies the prior definition by removing the classification of acute lung injury (ALI) and instead utilizing mild, moderate, and severe ARDS classifications. These classifications remain important to the definition of ARDS due to differences in mortality, as well as treatment options.",59.70072813596651,22.292291814269756

Seasonal viruses spreading among the human population cause annual epidemics that lead to approximately 500 000 deaths per year. One of the major health complications of IV is viral pneumonia, which can result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 1 In the acute phase of ARDS, symptoms are characterized by cyanosis, hypoxemia, pulmonary edema, and respiratory failure, which may ultimately lead to multiple organ failure and a low survival rate. 2 Respiratory failure in the acute phase of ARDS can be attributed to damage to the epithelial-endothelial barriers of pulmonary alveoli, where gas exchange takes place. 3, 4 Damage to these barriers leads to the flooding of proteinaceous edema fluid containing fibrin, erythrocytes, and inflammatory cells into the alveolar lumen. Although the pathogenesis of ARDS is only partially understood, it is thought that the key determinants of ARDS are endothelial barrier dysfunction and subsequent pulmonary microvascular endothelial leakage. Clinical analysis showed that mortality remains high among patients with severe influenza despite the use of anti-viral therapeutic strategies, which suggests that microvascular leakage may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of viral infections. 5 Xijiao Dihuang Decoction combined with Yinqiao Powder (XDY) is a classic compound formula originally prescribed by Jutong Wu, an ancient Chinese physician from the Qing Dynasty.

Xijiao Dihuang Decoction was beneficial in treating syndromes where toxins intrude into the blood, a phenomenon that occurs in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). 8 For example, modified Xijiao Dihuang Decoction was used to treat fire-toxin syndrome caused by viral pneumonia by virtue of its abilities for clearing heat, cooling blood, nourishing yin, and dispelling phlegm. 9 In previous studies, we showed that XDY treatment clearly reduced the mortality rate, decreased pulmonary permeability, and alleviated pulmonary edema in mice with viral pneumonia. 10 The results from in vitro studies demonstrated that XDY could protect the endothelial barrier by reversing permeability increases in PMVECs caused by IV infection. 11 However, the mechanisms by which XDY mitigates hyper-permeability in IV-infected PMVECs requires further investigation.",49.4849665987951,20.416411261753424

A fall in mortality has been observed recently, although there are studies in different healthcare systems which cite a mortality of 25%---31% 4 or even 58%. 5, 6 Apart from causing ARDS, the severe hypoxaemia which characterises the syndrome means that patients have to be ventilated mechanically to increase arterial oxygenation. Currently, as well as protective mechanical ventilation it is recommended that these patients be placed in the prone position (PP) as a coadjuvant to ventilation strategy, optimising the distribution of the ventilation-perfusion ratio. 7 In 1974 Bryan 8 described the technique of ventilating patients in the PP for the first time, showing an improvement in arterial oxygenation in patients with pneumonia and ARDS. Different studies were published after this showing an improvement in oxygenation but not that this postural treatment reduced mortality. 9---11 Recently, several studies undertaken in the sub-group of patients with severe hypoxaemia (PaFiO 2 : 150) have suggested the opposite, and the study by Guérin et al. 12 confirms the increase in survival of patients diagnosed severe ARDS who are placed in the PP at an early stage.",46.20119592783256,18.104084517887145

Pulmonary or nonpulmonary infections with sepsis are the most common causes of ALI and ARDS, although gastric aspiration, massive transfusions, trauma, and other factors contribute. 1 The diversity of causes and the stereotyped physiologic and pathologic responses have made modeling human ALI and ARDS difficult, but new themes are evolving from experimental studies, some of which are reviewed in this article.",53.92831207400016,21.666283468205812

It is associated with SARS-CoV infection and characterized by pulmonary oedema, accumulation of inflammatory cells and resulting severe hypoxia. ARDS can initiate the activation of local inflammatory mediators that eventually spill over into the general circulation and resulting a systemic inflammatory response (SIR) (Bhatia and Moochhala, 2004) . As a consequence of SIR, an excessive cytokinemediated systemic leukocytes activation will lead to the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Owing to the development of ARDS, SARS-CoV infected patients often suffered from MODS, thus explaining its high mortality. Therefore, it is crucial to elucidate the key inflammatory mediators in ARDS to characterize novel therapeutic targets ultimately aiming to stop or ameliorate the disease progression.",55.46917783393646,21.191030675281727

In a study by Guignabert et al. guinea pigs were given mustard gas intratracheally [61] . A group of animals were pre-treated with DOX resulting in decreased gelatinase activity, decreased inflam-mation and notable decrease in histological lung epithelial lesions. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in the setting of diseases such as sepsis. With ARDS an infiltration of the lungs by neutrophils can lead to a massive activation of the cells yielding local tissue destruction and possibly the death of the subject. The destruction of lung tissue can be documented in bronchial lavage by the presence of protease such as elastases, MMP, collagen and elastin fragments. The emergence of new epidemics where ARDS may be an important cause of severe disease or death augments the spectrum of the possible use of tetracyclines to prevent or limit the development of respiratory system complications. Such is the case for H1N1 influenza and SARS (severe acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by a coronavirus). A potential scenario may be where there is high risk of exposure and contamination by a mutated version of a virus (such as in the case of the H1N1 influenza) by medical personnel where the use of tetracyclines may be justified as a means of preventing serious complications from developing upon exposure and infection.",50.803965114711374,17.089904317488795

In the largest ARDS epidemiologic study in adults (LUNG SAFE), 20.8% of patients with ARDS were identified as having some form of immunocompromised state [10] . These patients had proportionally more infections as the etiology of the ARDS and had worse outcomes, including higher ICU and hospital mortality. In pediatrics, much of the early data on immunodeficiency came from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Most recently, Dr. Kitchin and colleagues published their experience in 90 children with HIV admitted to the PICU in South Africa meeting AECC criteria in 2008-2009 in which the authors identify high rates of opportunistic infections (33% with P. jirovecii, 38% with cytomegalovirus) and overall 30% mortality [11] . Another significant population with immune dysfunction is patients with cancer or immunosuppression related to chemotherapy. In the Pediatric Acute Respiratory Distress syndrome Incidence and Epidemiology study (PARDIE), 8% of all PARDS patients were identified as having cancer and 13% had immune suppression [12] . The outcomes for the groups were a disheartening 51% and 46% mortality, respectively. Dr. Rowan and colleagues have focused on the outcomes of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients in the ICU (see Chap. 15) . Their work has shown that HSCT patients who have respiratory failure often meet PARDS criteria (91% in the first week of mechanical ventilation) and their disease is often severe, with longer ventilation courses and increased mortality [13, 14] .",42.660888306849536,16.470584229025906

Early appropriate parenteral antibiotic administration has been demonstrated to improve patient outcomes, particularly in patients at a higher risk of death. 8 The majority of patients that die with severe CAP tend to do so from complications of multiorgan failure rather than from primary respiratory failure alone and often require renal replacement therapy, invasive circulatory monitoring, and support. Adherence to protocols such as those produced by the BTS or IDSA/ATS is associated with a reduction in overall mortality. 2, 9 Respiratory Patients with respiratory failure despite high-flow oxygen therapy can be managed with non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or invasive ventilation. 10 NIV is of particular benefit in those patients who are immunosuppressed, have underlying obstructive lung disease or Pneumocystis jiroveci infection. A lower Pa O2 =FIO 2 ratio and bilateral alveolar infiltrates suggesting acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are independent predictors of NIV failure and in such patient groups, progression to invasive mechanical ventilation should be considered at an early stage. Early Severe community-acquired pneumonia identification of a failed NIV trial is important as several trials have demonstrated poorer outcomes in patients requiring intubation after a prolonged unsuccessful NIV trial. Most patients with severe CAP will require intubation and mechanical ventilation, particularly in the presence of persistent hypoxaemia, severe acidosis, depressed consciousness, or progressive hypercapnia. These patients should be managed with a lung-protective ventilation strategy using low tidal volumes (6 ml kg −1 predicted body weight) and plateau airway pressures <30 cm H 2 O. Although high PEEP levels may improve oxygenation, there is no mortality difference in comparison with ventilation using low PEEP except in ARDS with a Pa O2 =FIO 2 ratio <200 mm Hg. 11 Advanced respiratory rescue techniques including prone ventilation, extra-corporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO 2 R), and extra-corporeal membranous oxygenation (ECMO) should be considered in cases of refractory hypoxaemia or symptomatic hypercarbia. 12",40.36174593046189,15.673717770836832

These ""direct"" PARDS cases had lower mortality than ""indirect"" causes like sepsis and non-septic shock [12] . Primary pulmonary infections leading to ARDS can be related to a viral etiology, bacterial etiology, or both as in the case of influenza leading to a Staphylococcus aureus infection. Much attention has been paid to pandemic viruses that can lead to drastic increases in ARDS patients: influenza, including H1N1; Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus; and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [43] . Interestingly, the extreme virulence of these coronavirus infections is now thought to be immune mediated, with very early and exaggerated activation of the complement cascade [44] . More commonly, viral etiologies are those that cause the upper respiratory infections and bronchiolitis cases commonly encountered in the pediatric intensive care unit: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, rhinovirus, and human metapneumovirus [43, 45] . Similarly, bacterial causes of PARDS are often the common pathogens that cause community-acquired pneumonia including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus [46] . As expected, immunosuppression also places patients at greater risk for fungal and parasitic causes of ARDS, including Pneumocystis jirovecii [46] . These patients retain a higher mortality regardless of ARDS severity [10] . Finally, as the PALICC definition now also allows for patients with chronic lung disease to be diagnosed with PARDS, we may see an increase in pathogens specific to technology-dependent and chronically ventilated patients as important PARDS etiologies soon.",37.85142904529193,15.604171982439622

In the ICU setting, SARS is essentially ARDS plus intensified respiratory isolation. 25 The clinical presentation and radiologic features of SARS bear some resemblance to the syndrome commonly referred to as 'atypical pneumonia'. The high incidence of altered liver function, leucopenia, severe lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and subsequent evolution into adult respiratory distress syndrome suggest a severe systemic inflammatory damage induced by this human pneumonia-associated coronavirus. 26 The constellation of absence of upper respiratory symptoms, the presence of dry cough, and minimal auscultatory findings with consolidations on chest radiographs may alert the clinician to the possible diagnosis of SARS. However, the clinical and radiographic characteristics of atypical pneumonia are not useful in differentiating these pathogens from usual bacterial pathogens such as S. penumoniae and H. influenzae. Clinical diagnosis also becomes particularly problematic once the association with travel or case contact is lost. The difficulty of making a firm diagnosis until chest radiographic changes appear has important implications for healthcare personnel and for surveillance.",39.86999984471908,15.55990599305549

One of primary pathology of SARS is the tissues infiltration of monocyte, neutrophil, and lymphocyte, especially in lung (37, 38) , so it is reasonable to speculate that PBMC respond actively to the SARS-CoV infection, and that free radicals with cytotoxic properties released by these immune cells and infected cell participate in the tissues injury in SARS. Furthermore, the extreme manifestation of SARS is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), while many investigations have showed that oxidant stress contributes to the development of ARDS (39) .

Early in the disease, when loss of pulmonary epithelial cells contributes to pathology, enhancing cell division likely is of value. However, unchecked cell division also enhances coverage of the intra-alveolar exudate by ATII cells and can lead to fibrosis. Furthermore, the overabundance of ATII cells might interfere with differentiation of ATII cells into ATI cells. The rate at which ATII cells proliferate appears to be a key determinant of this balance between repair and fibrosis.

In terms of pathogenesis of SARS, viral load in the first phase may in turn result in host inflammatory response during the second phase. The SARS complications are associated with severe inflammatory tissue destruction due to excessive activation of the innate immune system and a notable proportion of the patients progressed to septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ dysfunction (MODS) in the later phase of viral infection (Li et al., 2003) . Considerable clinical and experimental evidence implicated that complement appears to be involved in the pathogenesis of these late post-viral complications, which could even be predicted by increased complement activations (Sahu and Lambris, 2000; Abe, 2006; Sarma et al., 2006) .

In these situations, the difficulty lies in the interpretation of the chest X-ray. Problems arise from differentiating pneumonia from pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, atelectasis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]. Computerized tomography [CT] scan may or may not be able to differentiate these conditions. Bedside ultrasonography has been used for diagnosing pneumonia but is less reliable than radiography, with sensitivity ranging from 57% to 100% and specificity of 54% to 99% [37] . Ultrasound is more useful for defining the presence and severity of associated pleural effusion. Investigators have also assessed the value of molecular biomarkers in severely ill patients to differentiate CAP from noninfectious cause of lung infiltrates. In a study of 234 patients admitted to the intensive care unit [ICU] with suspected CAP genome-wide transcription profiling of blood leucocytes was investigated. Expression of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory pathways was similar between patients with and without CAP, and blood concentrations of biomarkers such as procalcitonin, interleukin [IL]-6, and interleukin IL-8 were not discriminatory [38] . Further analysis revealed that the ratio of two genes, FAIM3 and PLAC8, was best for distinguishing CAP from no-CAP. The FAIM3:PLAC8 ratio provided a positive predictive value of 83.1% and negative predictive value of 81.3%.

These were related to diseases, procedures or complications that may produce gastrointestinal ischemia, infection or altered digestion. Mucosal injury following a combination of these risk factors was thought to produce NEC. Ischemic risk factors included birth asphyxia, respiratory distress syndrome, hypoxia, hypotension, patent ductus arteriosus, polycythemia, anemia, umbilical artery, catheter placement and exchange transfusion. Because these risk factors were identified as part of a profile among affected infants, they were thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of NEC. Although each may contribute to mucosal injury, case-control studies suggest that these processes are equally prevalent among affected patients and unaffected controls. 1 Therefore, these risk factors merely describe the low-birthweight population and are no longer thought to be direct contributing factors in the pathogenesis of NEC (see below). Epidemiologic investigations emphasize that the predominant risk factor is prematurity, with associated immature host defense and gastrointestinal function.",34.735436073341575,13.493363586057734

However, PBMs usually fold as β-strands (Ye and Zhang 2013) , which suggests that a β-structure conformation may be induced by target binding. Another similar Y2H study that used the same bait described a similar PDZ domaincontaining binder, the syndecan-binding protein (syntenin) (Jimenez-Guardeño et al. 2014) . Syntenin is a scaffolding protein that can initiate a signaling cascade resulting in the phosphorylation and activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38-MAPK), leading to expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The authors showed that the proposed C-terminal PBM in SARS-CoV E protein is a determinant of virulence. Since SARS-CoV-infected patients show an exacerbated inflammatory response that leads to epithelial and endothelial damage, edema, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the disruption of this pathway may have therapeutic implications. Overall, an involvement of this PBM in E protein in epithelial integrity and inflammatory responses is likely.

However, large-scale trials on ARDS have not found effective pharmacologic therapy for improving the clinical outcome. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a key role in maintaining blood pressure homeostasis, as well as fluid and salt balance [7] . Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 share homology in their catalytic domain. ACE activity triggers vasoconstriction by generating angiotensin II from angiotensin I, while ACE2 counterbalances with ACE and functions as a negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) [8] .

Various kinds of pathogenic factors can cause acute lung injury (ALI), such as severe infection, shock, thoracic trauma, disseminated intravascular coagulation, gastric acid, smog, and toxic gas aspiration clinically characterized by rapidly progressive dyspnea and intractable hypoxemia (Gattinoni et al., 1998; Atabai and Matthay, 2002) . ALI may develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) characterized by damage to the alveolus-capillary interface, usually secondary to an intense inflammatory response of the host lung to infectious or noninfectious invasion (Levy et al., 2005; Bernard, 2005) . It has been shown that severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus and avian influenza A H5N1 virus infection could result in high mortality due to the complication of ARDS. Therefore, infectious pathogens, in which that the majority are viruses, have become one of the most important causes of ARDS (Headley et al., 1997; Chen et al., 2005; Subbarao et al., 1998) . Thus, it is intriguing to note that HP-PRRSV infection might be associated with ALI which may have the responsibility for the additional morbidity and mortality of the infected pigs.",40.390686141009326,13.977175049279449

Other investigators judge the lung injury and subsequent acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS] and pulmonary fibrosis as the primary events leading to adverse outcome and death. Using multiple modes of investigation, modeling with gene sets, proteomic analysis, and histopathology correlation, these investigators conclude that the urokinase and the extracellular fibrinolytic pathways are the primary mechanisms involved in lung damage and overall SARS-CoV infection pathogenesis [22] . Events driven by these pathways result in imbalance between the host coagulation and fibrinolysin pathways, ultimately leading to diffuse alveolar and acute lung damage.

These authors detailed the clinical course of 12 patients treated in Denver for respiratory failure who did not respond to usual therapeutic modalities of respiratory support. The patients had an acute onset of tachypnea, hypoxemia, panlobular infiltration on chest X-ray, and loss of lung compliance. The investigators thought the syndrome resulted from surfactant deficiency, and found positive end-expiratory pressure helpful in treating the atelectasis and hypoxemia. They also thought that corticosteroids were helpful for patients in whom the syndrome resulted from fat embolism. In 1971, the same investigators coined the name adult respiratory distress syndrome. 2 Since its initial description in 1967, ARDS has been the focus of intense scrutiny and attempts to improve outcomes. The European-American Consensus Conference on ARDS developed a uniform definition for ARDS to aid clinical trial design. 3 The conference attendees agreed that ARDS was a severe form of ALI, and recommended that the syndrome be called ""acute"", rather than ""adult"", respiratory distress syndrome. They defined ALI and ARDS as being characterized by an acute onset, bilateral infiltration on chest X-ray, hypoxemia, and no evidence of left atrial hypertension (pulmonary artery occlusion pressure 18 mmHg). The degree of hypoxemia is more severe in ARDS (partial arterial oxygen pressure [PaO 2 ]:fractional inspired oxygen [FIO 2 ] ratio 200 mmHg) than ALI (PaO 2 / FIO 2 300 mmHg). The severity of ARDS can be scored (Murray lung injury score) using several easily measured clinical variables. 4 ARDS occurs in various clinical settings with direct or indirect respiratory insults (e.g. acute pneumonia or pneumonitis, aspiration of gastric content, near-drowning, acute pancreatitis, sepsis syndrome, massive emergency transfusions, environmental toxin exposure), severe multiple trauma (e.g. pulmonary contusion, multiple long bone fracture with fat embolism syndrome), or extensive tissue injury or destruction during major surgical interventions (e.g. cardiac surgery with prolonged extracorporeal bypass). The mortality rate from ARDS remains high (45-92%), but outcomes have improved over the last decade. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] How did the term SARS originate? Before the mid-1990s, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and public authorities stipulated that sentinel hospitals or clinicians should report suspected or definitively diagnosed cases of respiratory illness in which there were associated public health concerns. However, public authorities derived important information from a rodent-borne hantavirus infection in 1993: an outbreak of an unexplained respiratory illness with high mortality occurred in the US southwest, and the cause was unexpectedly proved to be hantavirus. This contradicted the previous belief that human hantavirus infection only caused the hemorrhagic-fever renal syndrome described in Asia and Europe. Hence, the US outbreak led to the first description of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), identified as a seemingly new human infectious disease caused by hantavirus variants including Sin Nombre and Black Creek Canal viruses; HPS has an influenzalike prodromal stage, but can progress to catastrophic hemodynamic failure and pulmonary edema. [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] Thus, public health authorities understood that the casereporting system was inadequate in this setting. In May 1995, the World Health Assembly amended international infectious disease regulations, and in 1998, the World Health Organization (WHO) arranged for 21 countries to conduct a clinical trial of a new case-reporting system for acute hemorrhagic fever syndrome, acute diarrhea syndrome, acute neurologic syndrome, acute respiratory syndrome, acute jaundice syndrome, and other notifiable syndromes.",46.4661115270821,18.922112495868276

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the principal cause of respiratory failure associated with severe influenza.

Nevertheless, based on the assumption that viral RNA load correlates with high levels of viral replication, 5 there are important insights to be gained from this time-course analysis. Currently, our understanding of the relationship between viral RNA load kinetics and disease severity in patients with COVID-19 remains fragmented. Zou and colleagues reported that patients with COVID-19 with more severe disease requiring intensive care unit admission had high viral RNA loads at 10 days and beyond, after symptom onset. 4 Unfortunately, it is unknown when in the course of their disease these patients deteriorated. By contrast, Lescure and colleagues report the viral RNA kinetics of two patients who developed late respiratory deterioration despite the disappearance of nasopharyngeal viral RNA. It would be interesting to know whether viral RNA load in lung tissue, or a surrogate sample such as tracheal aspirate, mirrors the decline in nasopharyngeal shedding. Nevertheless, this observation suggests that these late, severe manifestations might be immunologically mediated and has obvious implications for the potential to use immune-modulatory therapies for this subset of patients. This finding is consistent with recent reports that corticosteroids were beneficial for acute respiratory distress syndrome, 6 and possibly those with COVID-19. 7 With more detailed data such as those provided by Lescure and colleagues, the use of viral RNA load to suggest potential clinical strategies to treat COVID-19 could be exploited.",27.611711583806407,11.970929776425825

Objectives: Describe the kinetics and pattern of viral excretion in two infected patients. Study design: After the initial diagnosis, blood, urine, rectal and respiratory samples were collected regularly, aliquoted and stored at −80 • C. Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay targeted the UpE and Orf1a regions of the MERS-CoV genome. Results: In patient 1, who died of refractory ARDS and renal failure, MERS-CoV RNA was detected in pharyngeal and tracheal swabs, as well blood samples and urine samples until the 30th day. Rectal swabs were negative. Patient 2 also developed multiple-organ failure, but survived, with persisting renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance at 30 mL/min) and persistent interstitial syndrome albeit weaned off mechanical ventilation and no longer requiring oxygen. Tracheal aspirations were positive until the 33rd day, while nasopharyngeal swabs were negative. All other biological samples were negative. Discussion: Lower respiratory tract excretion of MERS-CoV could be observed for more than one month. The most severely ill patient presented an expression of the virus in blood and urine, consistent with a type-1 interferon mediated immunological response impaired in patient 1, but developed by patient 2.

Survival in ARDS is improved when patients are ventilated with a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg of ideal body weight (IBW). A low tidal volume mechanical ventilation strategy is now the standard of care for ARDS. Lung injury is presumed to arise from repetitive opening and closing of alveoli. Barotrauma may be limited by low tidal volumes. This can be achieved by delivering limited size tidal volumes, minimizing plateau pressure, optimizing PEEP, and reducing FIO 2 to less than 0.6. Ideal body weight rather than actual body weight should be used. Use caution in patients who are overweight or edematous.

Chemotherapeutic agents most commonly implicated in lung injury include bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, nitrosureas, cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, methotrexate, procarbazine, mitomycin, cytarabine, vinca alkaloids, and alkylating agents such as busulfan [11] . Of these, bleomycin, busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and the nitrosureas are most commonly implicated in pediatric patients [11, 12] . Toxicity from radiation therapy is dose dependent with patients receiving fractionated doses having less risk for toxicity than patients receiving the same total dose given at one time. Patients typically develop symptoms within 1-3 months of receiving radiation therapy and present with cough, dyspnea, and pink-tinged sputum during the inflammatory phase. This can progress to the fibrotic stage which progresses over 1-2 years.

Among these, coronavirus infection may cause life-threatening severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). In this review, we present animal models and techniques for the study of ARDS, and discuss the roles and possible mechanisms of various chemical factors, including nitric oxide (NO). Our early work revealed that cerebral compression elicits severe hemorrhagic pulmonary edema (PE), leading to central sympathetic activation that results in systemic vasoconstriction. The consequence of systemic vasoconstriction is volume and pressure loading in the pulmonary circulation. Vasodilators, but not oxidant radical scavengers, are effective in the prevention of centrogenic PE. In isolated perfused lung, exogenous and endogenous NO enhances lung injury following air embolism and ischemia/reperfusion. In contrast, NO synthase (NOS) inhibitors reverse such lung injury. Although NO is important in maintaining vasodilator tone, hypoxiainduced pulmonary vasoconstriction is accompanied by an increase instead of a decrease in NO release. In animal and isolated lung studies, endotoxin produces acute lung injury that is associated with increases in cytokines and inducible NOS mRNA expression, suggesting that NO is toxic to the lung in endotoxin shock. Recently, we reported several rare cases that indicate that ARDS in patients with Japanese B encephalitis, lymphangitis with breast cancer and fat embolism is caused by different mechanisms.

For example, an increase in the number of circulating EPCs in patients with COPD was associated with more abnormal spirometry (78) , although a different study showed that levels of circulating EPCs were inversely correlated with COPD disease severity (79) . Increased numbers of circulating EPCs also portended worse survival among those with non-small cell lung cancer (81, 82) . In asthma, numbers of circulating EPCs were increased compared with nonasthmatic controls, but this did not correlate with clinical outcomes (75) .",39.17112924108896,15.982849990402636

In contrast to older literature that described ""bronchitic"" and ""pneumonitic"" malaria, there is no evidence that malarial infections are associated with a true pneumonitis. More recent studies have demonstrated the development of pulmonary edema during the treatment of falciparum malaria, especially more severe cases. Malaria-associated pulmonary edema is noncardiogenic (high cardiac index and low systemic vascular resistance) and is considered by most authorities to be consistent with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and related to the malaria-associated increase in pulmonary permeability. 50 While pulmonary edema occurs in less than 1% of all cases of falciparum malaria, it was found in 42% of a series of U.S. soldiers in the Second World War who died of severe malaria. 51 More recently, three of five Marines who returned from Liberia in 2003 with more than 10% falciparum parasitemia developed ventilatory failure and an ARDS-like presentation 48 to 72 hours after initiation of antimalarial treatment and clearance of parasitemia (unpublished personal data). Malaria-associated pulmonary disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of those returning from a malarious region with unexplained pulmonary edema.",44.6105591550332,15.061076127807457

While infection of the upper respiratory tract is common and results in subclinical or mild disease, infection of the lungs can result in severe, potentially lethal diseases, including viral pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). These severe diseases can result from infection by currently circulating viruses, including influenza viruses and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), or by new viruses that emerge in the human population from animal reservoirs, such as new strains of influenza A virus (IAV) and SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Murine models have been invaluable in the identification of virus and host determinants of disease pathogenesis during respiratory viral infections. While these models provide a complex view of host-pathogen interactions, there is a critical need to have physiologically relevant in vitro models that can be used to delineate cell type-specific mechanisms that contribute to disease pathogenesis in the lung. The goal of this study was to develop such an in vitro model, from which data can be correlated to well-established in vivo models of respiratory viral pathogenesis.",45.32012634879066,13.878559366782502

The clinical signs and tolerance of hypoxaemia are usually a function of respiratory symptom duration. For instance, an acute hypoxaemic episode can lead to respiratory distress within a few hours, whereas a subacute or non-acute lung insult of similar magnitude can result in deep hypoxaemia without signs of respiratory distress. Overall, degree of hypoxaemia reflects the extent of lung involvement. Hypoxaemia, measured directly as the PaO 2 on room air or assessed on the basis of the oxygen flow needed to achieve an peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) of 95% or the estimated or calculated ratio of partial pressure arterial oxygen and fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio), has been used for many years to risk-stratify patients and guide ICU admission decisions. Increased oxygen flow has been associated with the need for ICU admission, 10 need for IMV, 10,16 and hospital mortality. 17 Similarly, lower PaO 2 /FiO 2 has been associated with mortality in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, 40 the need for non-invasive ventilation (NIV), 41 or failure of high-flow nasal oxygen therapy (HFNO). 42 Persistent tachypnoea has also been associated with failure of standard oxygen, 42 NIV, 41 or highflow nasal cannula, requiring the imple mentation of another strategy (eg, intubation). 43 No study has evaluated the impact of hyperoxygenation in this setting. 44 Associated organ dysfunctions are best depicted by the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, which has consistently been identified as a determinant of mortality, with higher scores associated with increased mortality. 5, 13, 45 Delayed ICU admission has been associated with increased mortality in immuno comprom ised patients, 14 particularly in those with acute respiratory failure. 10,13,17 Benefits from earlier ICU admission might be the result of the careful clinical assessment, optimal oxygenation strategy, avoidance of potentially harmful investigations, and selection of the least invasive diag nostic tests in ICUs. The characteristics of the underlying immuno suppressive condition are not usually associated with hospital mortality following ICU admission, 46 although variations occur depending on ICU admission policies. A higher proportion of patients admitted to ICU with do-not-resuscitate or do-not-intubate status results in stronger associations between variables reflecting characteristics of disease status and mortality. 47, 48 Performance status and comorbidities have been associated with increased mortality. 13, 14, 49, 50 The effects of initial oxygen ation and ventilation strategy on mortality are discussed later in this Review.

Predictors of failure for non-invasive ventilation for hypercapnic respiratory failure are no improvement or a fall in pH, no change or a rise in breathing frequency after 1-2 h, high-acuity illness at admission (simplifi ed acute physiology score II >34), and lack of cooperation.

It has been estimated that up to one third of solid-organ transplant (SOT) recipients may travel to resource-limited countries within the first year post-transplant. 1 In a survey in North American transplant centres, up to 44% of haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients reported travel outside the USA and Canada after transplantation. 2 A International Journal of Infectious Diseases 48 (2016) 104-112 significant number of immunocompromised patients may also be migrants who may return to their countries of origin to visit friends and relatives, and may acquire travel-associated infections. The increased use of monoclonal antibodies for therapy in immunological and oncological diseases has created another at-risk population, although the actual risk of travel-associated infection in these patients is not well established. 3 Data on the real risk of infection in immunocompromised travellers relative to the general travel population are scarce, 4 and particularly the risk of developing an illness severe enough to warrant admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). The repatriation of immunocompromised patients from hospitals in destination countries also carries the risk of contamination of the receiving hospital with multidrug-resistant (MDR) microorganisms, which requires specific infection control measures. 5 This article also addresses certain specific syndromes, such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurring after travel.",35.397701320074916,11.660004884738992

It declines thereafter to a risk of 2% per day for days 6 to 10 and to a rate of 1% per day or lower after this. 30 Noninvasive ventilation for respiratory failure is associated with a much lower risk of pneumonia than endotracheal intubation. The relation between pneumonia and ARDS is particularly interesting. As many as one third of all cases of ARDS may be the result of pneumonia, and in some series pneumonia is the most common cause of acute lung injury. Not only can a variety of CAPs serve as a cause of ARDS, but secondary NP is the most common infection acquired by patients with established ARDS. [31] [32] [33] However, it has been shown that when patients with ARDS develop pneumonia, it is generally a late event, occurring after at least 7 days of mechanical ventilation. 32 Pneumonia also presents a particular problem in the postoperative patient, particularly after elective thoracic, cardiac, or abdominal surgery. Other surgical groups that are at high risk for pneumonia include the victims of major trauma, particularly those suffering head injury and blunt chest trauma.

As a consequence protective mechanical ventilation is not always implemented in patients who are not identified as having ARDS. Another key point is that there are various forms of ARDS with potential differences regarding their management (i.e. positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP] setting, prone positioning use, neuromuscular blockade and occasionally corticosteroids). Furthermore, adequate treatment of the responsible cause is a crucial element in ARDS outcome.

Although the prevalence of ARDS is about 10% of ICU admissions, this syndrome appeared to be underrecognised and undertreated and associated with a high mortality rate. Essential in recognition of the ARDS is to identify all patients with AHRF breathing with the aid of a ventilator [1] . AHRF which represents a common end-point to multiple pathological processes either local or systemic may have many medical conditions as aetiology. We can divide more or less the main determinants into two categories: pulmonary and extrapulmonary [2] . Table 11 .1 listed the common causes of AHRF. Between pulmonary determinants, pneumonia and bacterial and virus infection diseases are the most frequent disease associated with AHRF [3] . The extrapulmonary sepsis, blood transfusions pancreatitis, and drug reaction are more frequent as extrapulmonary causes [4] . On the other side, chronic disease such as diabetes has been associated with a lower occurrence of ARDS [5] . Moreover, some demographic and environmental risk factors are related to the development of ARDS. These include older age and specific genetic variants [2, 6] .

ARDS can be triggered by a variety of insults including acid aspiration, peritoneal sepsis and acute pancreatitis, and has a high mortality rate due to associated pulmonary oedema, inflammation and hypoxia. A recent study by Kuba et al. [35] identified a protective role for ACE2 in mice in which ARDS had been experimentally induced by distinct insults. In this study, Ace2 knockout mice developed more severe ARDS than wild-type littermates, an effect which was reversed in mice in which the ace gene had also been disrupted, or upon treatment with recombinant ACE2 protein. In addition, at1R knockout mice also had less severe disease and both Ace2 À/y and wild-type mice responded positively to AT1 receptor antagonists, suggesting the involvement of Ang II in ARDS progression. It can therefore be postulated that ACE2 exerts its protective role by metabolising Ang II and thereby abrogating its deleterious effects. In 2003, the surprising discovery was made that ACE2 is a functional receptor for the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the SARS coronavirus [36] . SARS achieved widespread notoriety for its high mortality rate (approaching 10%) in infected individuals due to an atypical pneumonia resulting in respiratory failure due to ARDS [37] . ACE2 was serendipitously identified as a receptor for SARS-CoV in vitro using co-immunoprecipitation techniques [36] and has subsequently been shown to be essential for SARS infection in vivo [35] . Interaction of SARS-CoV with ACE2 occurs via trimers of the SARS spike protein, a loop of which extends into a hydrophobic pocket of ACE2; here a methyl group of threonine 487 of the spike interacts with lysine 353 of ACE2 [38] . The acquisition of a threonine at position 487 appears to have been critical in the adaptation of the SARS virus to humans; in the civet (believed to be the source of the outbreak), this position is occupied by a serine residue which renders it unable to bind human ACE2 [39] .",43.25971385574619,16.556447029686947

Crude ICU and hospital mortality rates were 22.6% and 32.7% (p<0.001) for mild ALI and 49.4% and 57.9% (p=0.0005) for ARDS. Initial mean tidal volume and positive end-expiratory pressure were 8.3€1.9 ml/kg and 7.7€3.6 cmH 2 O in ARDS patients. Air leaks were detected in 15.9% of subjects. In multivariate analysis mortality was associated with age, immunoincompetence, Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II, logistic organ dysfunction score, and early air leak. The authors concluded that ALI is frequent, that there is a continuum between ALI and ARDS, and that there is a substantial difference in mortality, being much higher in ARDS.

The authors specifically studied the accuracy and precision of the method. A simple rebreathing gas was used to deliver at least ten usual tidal volumes. The agreement between the two methods was found very acceptable for clinical purposes. It was noted, however, that the higher the amount of hyperinflated tissue, the greater was the underestimation of lung volume by the helium dilution method. It has been well demonstrated that a frequent cause of repeated lung volume loss is endotracheal suctioning. This can induce derecruitment in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The effects of such maneuver were tested in ten patients with only mild to moderate lung failure by Fernandez et al. [2] . Three techniques were compared with or without preoxygenation.

Despite the extensive work that has emerged over decades, we continue to lack effective treatments for this syndrome. It continues to be associated with significant mortality, most recently estimated as high as 44% (2). To date, the most widely accepted effective intervention with a significant impact on mortality is low tidal volume ventilation (3). A category of therapies receiving recent attention is a group termed ""rescue therapies"", named such for their role in treating hypoxemia that is refractory to standard management strategies for ARDS. These include high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV), inhaled epoprostenol and nitric oxide, prone position ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Traditionally, these are interventions reserved for patients whose hypoxemia progresses despite recognition and treatment of ARDS.

Patients who are bridged to heart transplant with MCS are at increased risk for perioperative RV failure because of the technically more challenging surgical approach, increased blood product requirements, and prolonged ischemic time. Focal cardiac tamponade, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and the presence of pulmonary hypertension can all cause acute RV failure. The failing RV often results in worsening venous congestion and subsequent renal, hepatic, and intestinal dysfunction. Treatment of RV failure includes volume optimization, inotropic support, afterload reduction, and mechanical circulatory support. Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) is commonly used postoperatively for heart transplant patients with elevated pulmonary pressures and RV dysfunction. The normal dose of iNO is 20 to 40 ppm and is typically weaned off prior to extubation. iNO can be very effective in the short term but has limitations with longer-term use. Therefore, other modalities to unload the right ventricle (such as milrinone, isoproterenol, nesiritide, and sildenafil) are also utilized.",40.15995197136783,13.853754897155902

There is growing evidence that the ACE/Ang-II/AT1R axis, which promotes the injury and fibrosis, plays a dominant role in the pathogenesis of VILI and ARDS, while the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/MasR axis exerts anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects. Given the lack of effective pharmacologic treatments for ARDS, the patho-physiological role of RAS in VILI and ARDS is an area that warrants further investigation. It's quite common Table 1 Summary for evidence of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) pharmacological agents in the prevention of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and ventilatorinduced lung injury (VILI). that many pharmacological candidates against ARDS have been shown less effective despite identification of potentially promising candidates in preclinical studies. In particular, multiple RAS components have been experimentally assessed, but only two targets and the related compound (rhACE2 and C21) have shown promis and have progressed to further evaluation of clinical trial. For this discrepancy of results between clinical trial and preclinical research, a frequently mentioned reason is heterogeneity of ARDS. Some studies had clearly shown heterogeneity of ARDS and the variability of ACE activity have a potential effect on the outcome of ARDS patients. Importantly, since ARDS is a sort of highly-heterogeneous disease, subgroup analysis based on two biological phenotypes, which indicate different responses to treatment, was increasingly considered to be highly applicable for evaluation of treatment responsiveness. Similarly, Ace I/D genotype offers a possibility to predict the risk of ARDS occurrence. Thus, consideration with an emphasis on biological phenotypes of ARDS and Ace I/D genotype open perspectives to precision medicine with target therapy for ARDS. While some experimental, and a limited number of clinical trials have shown that the RAS is a promising therapeutic target, large scale, welldesigned clinical trials, in parallel with mechanistic studies, are required to determine whether these treatments will benefit these critically ill patients.(see Table 1 )",33.81566937097808,13.136593918652483

ARDS severity can be categorized as mild (200 mm Hg < PaO 2 /FIO 2 ≤ 300 mm Hg), moderate (100 mm Hg < PaO 2 /FIO 2 ≤ 200 mm Hg), or severe (PaO 2 / FIO 2 ≤ 100 mm Hg) [1] . Approximately 10% of patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) are diagnosed with ARDS according to the Berlin Definition, representing nearly 3 million patients with ARDS globally per annum [1] [2] [3] [4] . Different from the classification in Berlin definition, recent studies have suggested that ARDS can be stratified into two biological phenotypes, 'hypo-inflammatory' and 'hyper-inflammatory' (also referred to as 'reactive'). The hyper-inflammatory phenotype has more severe clinical features but responds to a range of treatments including PEEP, fluid management and pharmacotherapy [5] [6] [7] . Despite significant insights into the pathophysiology, once ARDS is established, patient mortality is high (up to 45%), and evidencebased therapeutic options are limited [1] [2] [3] [4] . Mechanical ventilation, which supports adequate gas exchange, is a life-saving intervention for critically ill patients with respiratory failure. Unfortunately, mechanical ventilation can also contribute to lung injury via a process known as ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), also termed as ventilator-associated lung injury (VALI), with a prevalence of 6.2% among mechanically ventilated patients [8] . Historically, the application of potentially injurious mechanical ventilation using large tidal volumes (V t ) and high peak airway pressure (P peak ) increased the risk of development of ARDS both the ICU (odds ratio 2.6 for V t > 700 mL and 1.6 for P peak > 30 cm H2O) and during surgical ventilation (odds ratio 1.56 for each mL/kg increase of intraoperative V t ) [8, 9] . VILI is characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration in the lungs, loss of the epithelial and endothelial integrity, increased capillary permeability, deposition of extracellular matrix and interstitial pulmonary edema and fibrosis [10, 11] . To improve the clinical relevance, a two-hit model, with the LPS challenge (intratracheal or intraperitoneal) followed by injurious ventilation, has been applied in preclinical studies to mimic pre-existing sepsis which is the most common cause of ARDS [12, 13] . VILI, which can occur in previously normal lungs or worsens pre-existing ARDS, can occur via a range of mechanisms (1) including tissue stress caused by over-distension of lung alveoli exposed to increasing transpulmonary pressures (baro-volutrauma), (2) causing high local shearing forces (atelectrauma), (3) these mechanical responses trigger recruitment of leukocytes and the release of chemokines/cytokines leading to pulmonary and systemic inflammatory response (biotrauma) [10, 11] . Accordingly, various artificial ventilation strategies, such as a small V t to avoid lung alveoli over-distension as well as a higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at end expiration, are employed to minimize the impact of injurious ventilation [10, 14, 15] . However, there have been few improvements in patient outcomes in recent decades and no pharmacological therapies have been developed that have been shown to be beneficial in large-scale, randomized, controlled clinical trials (RCTs).",30.111006251398518,12.701201823352106

Angiotensin II, the main effector substance of the RAAS, with potent vasoconstrictive, pro-inflammatory, and pro-fibrotic properties is inactivated by ACE2. As a result of diminished ACE2 expression severe acute lung failure may develop through hampering angiotensin II cleavage, causing pathological changes due to angiotensin II type 1a receptor activation [49] . Interestingly, binding of the SARS-CoV spike protein to ACE2 does trigger internalization, down-regulating enzyme activity from the cell surface [50*].

ECMO has been used in the ordinary surge circumstances of the 2009 Influenza A/H1N1 Pandemic, although the adult task force did not address the use of ECMO as an option for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome/hypoxic respiratory failure during a mass critical care situation. Despite this, it was extensively used in adults during the 2009 Influenza A/H1N1 epidemic in Australasia (7). ECMO is offered in the treatment of single-system pulmonary disease, unresponsive to conventional treatment, in many tertiary care pediatric centers. The overall survival of 48% where it was used in pediatric patients during the 2009 pandemic will continue to make this a controversial issue (www.elso.med.umich.edu/H1N1Registry). The accepted standard for staffing of one ECMO patient is one nurse and one ECMO specialist per patient, as well as the immediate availability of a senior specialist in pediatric critical care. This could be altered to a single-caregiver model in the event of a surge situation. However, unlike the 2009 pandemic surge, mass critical care involves a tripling of PICU capacity with altered levels of care, which would involve one PICU nurse supervising non-PICU supplement providers caring for perhaps three to six patients. It is therefore unlikely that ECMO would be available as a therapeutic option.

CXCL10 may not be a bystander to the severe virus infection but may directly contribute to the pathogenesis of neutrophil-mediated, excessive pulmonary inflammation. Objectives: We investigated the contribution of CXCL10 and its receptor CXCR3 axis to the pathogenesis of ARDS with nonviral and viral origins. Methods: We induced nonviral ARDS by acid aspiration and viral ARDS by intratracheal influenza virus infection in wild-type mice and mice deficient in CXCL10, CXCR3, IFNAR1 (IFN-a/b receptor 1), or TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-b (TRIF). Measurements and Main Results: We found that the mice lacking CXCL10 or CXCR3 demonstrated improved severity and survival of nonviral and viral ARDS, whereas mice that lack IFNAR1 did not control the severity of ARDS in vivo. The increased levels of CXCL10 in lungs with ARDS originate to a large extent from infiltrated pulmonary neutrophils, which express a unique CXCR3 receptor via TRIF. CXCL10-CXCR3 acts in an autocrine fashion on the oxidative burst and chemotaxis in the inflamed neutrophils, leading to fulminant pulmonary inflammation. Conclusions: CXCL10-CXCR3 signaling appears to be a critical factor for the exacerbation of the pathology of ARDS. Thus, the CXCL10-CXCR3 axis could represent a prime therapeutic target in the treatment of the acute phase of ARDS of nonviral and viral origins.",43.85127130220662,17.24051238173858

A large proportion of patients infected with MERS-CoV are either asymptomatic or have mild illness and complete recovery occurs due to effective innate and acquired immune responses which eradicates the infection. 31 No comprehensive immunopathogenesis studies have been conducted to date. The protective and deleterious human response to MERS-CoV remains to be determined. Pneumonia and multiorgan involvement is a common feature in patients with MERS. 32 The high mortality seen in MERS-CoV could be attributed to acute lung injury, development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 33 ARDS is associated with leaky alveolar-capillary interfaces with pulmonary oedema, hypoxia, polymorphonuclear leucocytic or lymphocytic cells with upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and gamma interferon and an aberrant immune response, which results in further tissue damage and deterioration of lung function. Sixty percent of MERS patients with acute lung injury or ARDS either recover after receiving intensive care and 40% of MERS patients succumb to the disease. 34 A large majority of patients who die due to infection with MERS-CoV may have some form of immunosuppression due to old age or having co-morbid conditions (diabetes, chronic lung, renal, cardiac or liver disease or have an underlying immunosuppressive condition). 35 It appears that the outcome of MERS patients may represent a precarious balance of both host-and MERS-CoV-induced immune signaling events. 36 It is not known whether mortality is a reflection of an ineffective host response to MERS-CoV or whether an aberrant host immune response contributes to pathogenesis and poor prognosis. Interventions that could manipulate this hostpathogen relationship via modulation of the host response to MERS-CoV infection may help improve mortality rates in patients with MERS. 37 For instance, genome analysis suggest that immune signaling modulation may affect outcome, 38 and adenosine deaminase may prevent MERS-CoV entry into host cells. 39 A range of Host-Directed Therapies (HDTs) have the potential for improving the treatment outcomes of severe lung infections. 40 ",40.98121706216946,16.303048110497944

VAE surveillance has a quality metric character and appears to identify potential safety opportunities to improve care and outcomes for patients. 19 Theoretically, interventions most likely to prevent VAEs are those that help patients avoid intubation, minimize the duration of MV, or prevent the conditions that most commonly trigger a VAE (pneumonia, volume overload, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and atelectasis). 20 Use of high-flow nasal oxygen for hypoxemic and noninvasive ventilation for hypercapnic respiratory failure may avoid intubation. Minimizing sedation, performing daily coordinated SATs and SBTs, and perhaps early mobility are strategies to decrease the duration of MV. Strategies to prevent pneumonia, volume overload, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and atelectasis include HOB elevation, conservative fluid management, conservative blood transfusion thresholds, low tidal volume ventilation, and early mobility. 14 These interventions are consistent with the best care practices advocated by the ABCDEF bundle, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America's recommendations to prevent VAP.

In examining influenza epidemics and pandemics in the United States since 1918, elderly patients had higher excess flu mortality rates than nonelderly patients with the exception of the 1918 to 1919 pandemic. The ratios of excess deaths of elderly versus nonelderly in some influenza seasons were as high as 131 to 1. 17 Although major concerns about influenza revolve around respiratory problems (including death from respiratory failure), there are ocular components of the disease. Certain strains of influenza are marked by conjunctivitis as a presenting sign. 18, 19 In another published study of influenza aboard a commercial airliner, half of the patients complained of photophobia. 20 The conjunctiva and other mucous membranes are recognized to be portals of entry of influenza virus for avian-to-human and human-to-human transmission in some cases. 18, 21 During flu vaccinations in 2000, a small series of vaccines developed a purported adverse reaction to the vaccination (distinct from a true allergic reaction to the vaccine itself) that manifested as respiratory symptoms accompanied by a follicular conjunctivitis with hyperemia and discharge within 4 hours of receiving the vaccine. 22 A smaller number of cases were reported in subsequent years. 23",37.754096360839334,14.104973351849042

As a rule, intensive care is based on mechanical ventilation often requiring high doses of sedatives and narcotics. Despite major progress in intensive care medicine the rate of mortality is still very high. Whereas in the past the level of medical progress has been rated based on the mortality rate alone, the many negative somatic and psychological sequelae in long-term-survivors of ARDS are only now being appreciated. From a perspective of C/L psychiatry persisting cognitive dysfunctions, anxiety and mood disorders, posttraumatic stress disorders (PTSD) in their negative impact on health- In the etiopathogenesis of PTSD associated with ALI/ ARDS, many influences have to be discussed, e.g., increases in CO 2 triggering panic affects, a mismatch of norepinephric overstimulation and cortisol insufficiency, negative effects of high doses of benzodiazepines resulting in oversedation, prolonged phases of weaning and more frequent states of delirium. Consolidation and retrieval of traumatic memories of the ICU stay are influenced by complex factors. From a clinical point of view prophylactic stress doses of hydrocortisone may reduce the major risk of PTSD associated with ALI / ARDS. [27] .",51.01706478550177,18.30641763104945

Limited clinical studies indicate that humans infected with MERS-CoV exhibit pathology consistent with the late stages of ARDS, which is reminiscent of the disease observed in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Models of MERS-CoV-induced severe respiratory disease have been difficult to achieve, and small-animal models traditionally used to investigate viral pathogenesis (mouse, hamster, guinea-pig and ferret) are naturally resistant to MERS-CoV. Therefore, we used CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing to modify the mouse genome to encode two amino acids (positions 288 and 330) that match the human sequence in the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 receptor, making mice susceptible to MERS-CoV infection and replication. Serial MERS-CoV passage in these engineered mice was then used to generate a mouse-adapted virus that replicated efficiently within the lungs and evoked symptoms indicative of severe ARDS, including decreased survival, extreme weight loss, decreased pulmonary function, pulmonary haemorrhage and pathological signs indicative of end-stage lung disease.

While symptoms may improve or subside in some patients, the second phase of immunopathological damage occurs in the majority, and is reflected by pulmonary manifestations with varying degrees of clinical severity about 10 days after symptom onset. This phase corresponds to peaking of the viral load followed by it fall subsequent to the onset of IgG seroconversion. It is characterized by the recrudescence of fever, oxygen desaturation and radiological progression of pneumonitis, as well as intense macrophage activation in the lungs [2] .

This syndrome presents as acute hypoxaemia with bilateral pulmonary infi ltrates on chest imaging, which are not wholly due to heart failure. As a syndrome, it is characterised by the presence of several criteria. Since the original description by Ashbaugh and colleagues in 1967, 1 four defi nitions have been used to determine the presence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (table) . [2] [3] [4] [5] The American European Consensus Conference defi nition, 3 which was published in 1994, was the fi rst agreed and widely used defi nition. However, it had numerous limitations across all four diagnostic criteria (panel), and, as a result, the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine engaged in a consensus process to generate an improved defi nition for acute respiratory distress syndrome. The Berlin defi nition, 5 which was published in 2012, was validated in over 4000 patients' data: on the basis of hypoxaemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome is classifi ed as mild (ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen [PaO 2 /FiO 2 ] of 200-≤300 mm Hg), moderate (PaO 2 /FiO 2 100-≤200 mm Hg), or severe (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ≤100 mm Hg). The most important updates to the defi nition are the stipulation of a minimum positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cm H 2 O, (PEEP can increase oxygenation, which is a key criterion of the syndrome-this update was to establish a minimum standard for mechanical ventilation); the acknowledgment that acute respiratory distress syndrome can be diagnosed in the presence of cardiac failure; a requirement for new respiratory failure, or worsening of chronic respiratory disease, within 7 days; and the inclusion of chest CT as an alternative form of imaging for the demonstration of lung infi ltrates.",57.35703181805321,22.429300989247736

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), lung failure, and fulminant pneumonia are major lung diseases in H7N9 patients. Transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is a promising choice for treating virus-induced pneumonia, and was used to treat H7N9-induced ARDS in 2013. The transplant of MSCs into patients with H7N9-induced ARDS was conducted at a single center through an open-label clinical trial. Based on the principles of voluntariness and informed consent, 44 patients with H7N9-induced ARDS were included as a control group, while 17 patients with H7N9induced ARDS acted as an experimental group with allogeneic menstrual-blood-derived MSCs. It was notable that MSC transplantation significantly lowered the mortality of the experimental group, compared with the control group (17.6% died in the experimental group while 54.5% died in the control group). Furthermore, MSC transplantation did not result in harmful effects in the bodies of four of the patients who were part of the five-year follow-up period. Collectively, these results suggest that MSCs significantly improve the survival rate of H7N9-induced ARDS and provide a theoretical basis for the treatment of H7N9-induced ARDS in both preclinical research and clinical studies. Because H7N9 and the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) share similar complications (e.g., ARDS and lung failure) and corresponding multi-organ dysfunction, MSC-based therapy could be a possible alternative for treating COVID-19.",41.17370935928252,14.836517340222986

This is in line with a recent report that identified severe acute respiratory distress syndrome as an independent factor associated with post-transplant mortality.118 Improvement or stabilization in OFs in the immediate pretransplant period has been associated with favourable post-LT outcomes in patients with ACLF, suggesting that the evolution of OFs should at least be controlled, if not improved, before considering an LT.[98], [115]",23.619995517187206,10.878984823751956

The most common clinical features in severe cases are fever (71%), cough (68%), dyspnea (66%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (32%) (9). Laboratory abnormalities commonly associated with severe MERS-CoV infection include leukopenia, lymphocytopenia and thrombocytopenia, in addition to elevated serum levels of creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase and liver enzymes (9). Initial chest radiographs are abnormal in the majority of symptomatic patients. Findings range from minimal abnormality to extensive bilateral infiltrate consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome patterns (9). Respiratory samples in suspected patients should be tested using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Lower respiratory tract specimens have been found to be more sensitive than upper respiratory tract specimens for the detection of MERS-CoV (11). Rapid progression to hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation usually occurs within the first week and it is notable that it has been associated with acute kidney failure (12).",26.805019797030305,9.936523469189925

Distinctions have been made between “mere” acute decompensation and ACLF regarding their respective outcomes. “Mere” acute decompensation is associated with an acceptable 28-day and 3-month mortality (5% and 14% respectively)26 and is defined by either the absence of organ failures (OFs) or the presence of cerebral failure with a serum creatinine level < 1.5 mg/dl or the presence of 1 “non-kidney” OF with serum creatinine level < 1.5 mg/dl and no encephalopathy (Table 1). The median MELD of patients hospitalized in this setting is 16.27 Patients with very high MELD scores are more likely to be admitted in the context of ACLF. The World Gastroenterology Organization defined ACLF as a syndrome in patients with chronic liver disease with or without previously diagnosed cirrhosis which is characterized by acute hepatic decompensation resulting in liver failure (jaundice and prolongation of the international normalized ratio) and 1 or more extrahepatic OFs that is associated with increased mortality within a period of 28 days and up to 3 months from onset.28 By definition, 28-day and 3-month mortality in this setting is high (respectively around 35% and 50%).[26], [29] Three types of ACLF were defined according to absence (Type A) or presence (Type B) of cirrhosis and history of previous hepatic decompensation (Type C). The latter 2 are the most prevalent in western countries.28 Despite agreement on the definition, exact implications of concepts such as “acute” and “failure” remain debated among the different learned societies.[26], [30], [31], [32]",20.07402008074059,9.335522676052022

However, survival rate was higher in NIMV than invasive ventilation. We used full-face mask in all patients for NIMV. Noninvasive ventilation has been used an alternative therapy for patients with acute respiratory failure with hopes of obviating intubation and mechanical ventilation. The results of NIMV in hypoxemic respiratory failure have been conflicting, and the etiology of hypoxemia appears to be an important determinant of its success. Ferrer et al. 22 compared NIMV to conventional venture oxygen delivery in patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure and found that NIMV decreased the need for intubation. This benefit was observed in the subgroup of patients with pneumonia, but not in those with ARDS, in which the intubation rates were high in both groups. A meta-analysis suggests that NIMV does not decrease the need for intubation, so there is not enough evidence to support its use in ARDS 23. Of all patients, 56 (91 %) were mechanically ventilated on the first day of ICU admission; 14 (23 %) invasively and 42 (68.8 %) noninvasively. Fifteen patients (24.5%) who received noninvasive ventilation ultimately required invasive ventilation. Dominguez-Cherit et al. 24 reported that invasively ventilation was used in 82.7% of patients. In Kumar's study 18, invasive ventilation was used in 81% of patients with swine flu associated respiratory failure. In our study, we used noninvasive ventilation in 68.8% of critically patients with 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) on admission ICU. In critically ill patients with 2009 influenza A (H1N1) infection, high levels of PEEP were often used to achieve adequate oxygenation. In our study, patients with ARDS were often had PEEP refractory hypoxemia. It was also noted that once patients improved and the weaning process was started, oxygenation was sensitive to small decrements in PEEP.

First, the “definitive” contraindications responsible for an immediate and irreversible arrest in the LT process at the local level. Some contraindications are widely accepted and might be illustrated by metastatic solid neoplasia, severe cardiac or pulmonary insufficiency (not related to liver disease), or even pre-hospitalization bedridden states. However, these “definitive” contraindications are definitive at a specific time in a specific transplant centre as their appreciation varies between LT centres depending on local expertise and the potential change over time within each centre.117 Second, the “dynamic” contraindications are responsible for a short temporary inability to perform liver transplantation. These “dynamic” contraindications are represented by numbers of diseases or failures that could evolve positively after appropriate therapeutic management: uncontrolled bacterial infection, active fungal infection, active gastrointestinal bleeding, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, severe haemodynamic instability, severe coagulopathy. The “dynamic” contraindications are often represented by precipitating events of ACLF syndrome.[26], [56] Occurrence and resolution (or control) of “dynamic” contraindications in the context of stabilization or improvement of OFs define the “transplantation window”98 (Fig. 3). As discussed earlier, the optimal transplantation window should be identified as soon as possible after the admission of patients with very high MELD scores, considering their poor expected outcome and the risk of them developing adverse events (other “dynamic” contraindications in a short timeframe).[29], [120] Due to the lack of data in this field, the exact timeframes within which LT is contraindicated by “dynamic” contraindications are often transplant centre and local expertise dependant.",21.147142425582352,8.955487056124399

There is enhanced expression of ACE-2 in those with cardiovascular conditions, possibly accounting for the apparent greater severity of COVID-19 related illness in these patients. In one study, a majority (58%) of those with severe infection had a background of hypetension, and non-specifically 44% had a history of 'arrhythmia'. 13 Binding of the virus to ACE2 receptors in the lung and the heart initiates the acute inflammatory response.

In particular, chemokines are released following viral infection, which leads to the invasion of neutrophils and macrophages and release of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, replication in the lower airways and exposure of endothelial cells may further amplify the inflammatory response 32 . Collectively, this leads to extensive tissue damage and depletion of epithelial cells, which may be connected to lethality 41 . Within the alveolar tissue, and systemically, the feedback between viral load, adaptive and innate immune response and tissue damage is clearly a complex system.

Once damage is inflicted, lung cells trigger a host response which can include inflammation, matrix remodeling and different forms of cell death, including apoptosis (1) . Although a limited host response may help to clear the injurious agent and repair lung tissue (2) , an overexuberant host response can lead to severe injury and impairment in gas exchange. Therefore, therapeutic strategies aimed to limit lung damage and interference with lung repair are important. Lungs are exposed to mechanical load during every breath. In pathologic conditions, generation of the pressure gradients necessary for ventilation may cause an excessive cell stretch and lead to organ dysfunction. This is especially relevant during mechanical ventilation with high pressures, which can lead to the so-called ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) (3, 4) .

Knowledge of the interplay between molecular-scale virus-receptor interactions, single-cell viral replication, intracellular-scale viral transport, and emergent tissue-scale viral propagation is limited. Moreover, little is known about immune system-virus-tissue interactions and how these can result in low-level (asymptomatic) infections in some cases and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in others, particularly with respect to presentation in different age groups or pre-existing inflammatory risk factors like diabetes. A critical question for treatment and protection is why it appears that the severity of infection may correlate with the initial level of virus exposure. Given the nonlinear interactions within and among each of these processes, multiscale simulation models can shed light on the emergent dynamics that lead to divergent outcomes, identify actionable ""choke points"" for pharmacologic interactions, screen potential therapies, and identify potential biomarkers that differentiate response dynamics. Given the complexity of the problem and the acute need for an actionable model to guide therapy discovery and optimization, we introduce a prototype of a multiscale model of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in lung and intestinal tissue that will be iteratively refined. The first prototype model was built and shared internationally as open source code and interactive, cloud-hosted executables in under 12 hours. In a sustained community effort, this model will integrate data and expertise across virology, immunology, mathematical biology, quantitative systems physiology, cloud and high performance computing, and other domains to accelerate our response to this critical threat to international health.",29.29690172484531,12.530648036538112
