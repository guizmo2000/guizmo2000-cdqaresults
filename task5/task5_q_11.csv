While influenza transmission can be halted with the use of antiviral medications, mutations in the virus necessitate that a new vaccine be produced for each new flu strain. Vaccination production can take up to six months to complete, with the burdens of delays, likely shortages, and virus mismatch reducing the potential impact of the vaccine. Furthermore, pharmaceutical interventions often require consultation with a physician or, in more severe cases, hospitalization. These requirements reduce the potential impact of pharmaceutical interventions due to the fact that many people do not have access to health care or refuse to be seen by a health care provider. Additionally, it is often impossible to satisfy this requirement during a pandemic influenza outbreak because the demand for staff, facilities, and equipment often exceeds the supply [5] . The limitations of pharmaceutical interventions during pandemic influenza outbreaks highlight the importance of also incorporating non-pharmaceutical interventions in public health campaigns aimed at limiting respiratory infectious disease spread.",26.93006147184699,14.70241664482708

These interactions highlighted differences in the selection and use of PPE across the organizations. Early on in the outbreak, when the cases of health worker transmission were numerous and confusion about the best available equipment was wide-spread, WHO was asked to provide technical guidance in a short period of time. When a public health emergency involves a new disease, or a known disease with a different presentation, there may be scarce or no evidence on the benefits and harms of potential interventions. Indirect evidence (e.g., from related diseases such as other blood-borne pathogens and simulation), expert opinion, and data acquired and analysed in real-time may become the best available evidence for the guideline panel. In addition, factors other than the effectiveness of interventions may have a significant influence on the direction and strength of the recommendations. Such was the situation in 2014 during the height of the EVD outbreak in West Africa; a rapid review of the effectiveness of different types of PPE for protecting health workers revealed insufficient evidence upon which to draw conclusions about optimal PPE 8 .",24.914090015293553,10.966518731147536

First, births are increasingly concentrated in large, well staffed, and well equipped county hospitals, whereas smaller township hospitals focus on antenatal care and screening of women at high risk. This concentration of births in high-volume facilities ensures an efficient organisation of obstetric care, including training, supervision, and the maintenance of skills. Second, the huge investment in human resources has resulted in a density of licensed doctors that is close to the 2·5 per 1000 population threshold that is deemed necessary by UN health agencies to achieve a high coverage of skilled attendants at birth. 59 China does not officially have a midwifery cadre, but the doctors and nurses who routinely attend deliveries are effectively the so-called midwifery workforce. 60, 61 Although the level of training is variable and many providers only have a basic medical or nursing degree, 62 the strict system of birth attendant certification ensures that most staff have the minimum skills to ensure safe childbirth. Third, an effective referral system ensures that women developing unexpected complications or those found to be at high risk antenatally can reach the hospital in time and receive a timely response once admitted. Screening for social and medical factors allows women without family support to go to hospital before labour starts-effectively a maternity waiting home strategy. 63 Fourth, financial barriers have been reduced through a system of social health insurance and extra childbirth subsidies in remote parts of the country. Antenatal care has also been recognised as one of the essential public health services that should be free at the point of care. Fifth, the Chinese Government's commitment to rigorous health infor mation systems across the country has ensured that most child and maternal deaths are counted. 64 Such a reporting system not only enables direction and evaluation of ongoing strategies, but also provides a mechanism to hold health-care providers and administrators accountable. Responsibility for maternal health lies with the highest authorities within the province or county, and achieving a specified maternal mortality target is one of the key performance indicators for government officials. We focused our analysis on western China because its relative poverty, remote geographical location, low literacy, and ethnic diversity pose difficult challenges. Although the western region is not homogeneous in terms of socioeconomic development, variation in maternal mortality and coverage of maternal care is relatively small. By 2014, the maternal mortality ratios between provinces were remarkably similar, except for Tibet, which was still lagging behind. Despite undoubted success, maternal mortality remained higher in the western region than in the eastern and central regions, and socioeconomic inequalities in access to maternal care persisted at the individual level. The reasons why western China remains behind is not entirely clear. Total health expenditure and human resource density differed between the western and eastern provinces, but these factors did not explain the excess mortality in the western region. Indeed, in our regression model the only factors that partly explained the regional differences were the proportion of ethnic minorities and female illiteracy, although their effect was small. The variation in access to antenatal and delivery care at the individual level by education of the mother in the western provinces was surprisingly large and much greater than previously reported. 65 beyond the financial reach of poor farmers. 67 County hospitals might be too far away and too reliant on advanced technology for uneducated women to choose to give birth there. Whether traditional customs add further barriers to facility delivery among ethnic minority populations is uncertain, although results from studies among Tibetan and Yi minority populations suggest that this might be the case. [68] [69] [70] The stark contrast between inequalities in access to maternity care and the relative equality in immunisation coverage might provide further insights. Immunisation is offered in township hospitals close to the woman's home, is entirely free of cost, is being actively promoted by village doctors, and is organised at times when women gather together such as on market days. 71 Although many township hospitals are poorly equipped for delivery care, strengthening their obstetric capacity might be one way of making delivery care more accessible to women in remote rural areas. Notwithstanding China's success, the facility-based, doctor-led model of maternal health care comes at a cost. Large county hospitals are replete with the most advanced technology and costly interventions, and many women have highly medicalised pregnancies and births, including unnecessary ultrasound, fetal monitoring, antibiotic use, and caesarean sections. [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] China has one of the highest caesarean section rates in the world, 77 although the difference in caesarean section rates between the richest and poorest provinces (63% in urban Beijing vs 5% in rural Tibet), or between the highest and lowest education level (44% vs 8%) in rural western China suggests that extreme excess goes hand in hand with unmet need. The problem of overmedicalisation is not unique to maternal health. 36, 78 The Chinese Government is well aware of these problems and has recently taken measures such as monitoring of caesarean sections in hospitals, setting up a midwifery cadre to conduct deliveries, strengthening obstetric training, and offering health education to communities. 79 Whether these measures will have an effect remain to be seen.",25.67773978069978,11.437580903912037

The demographics, clinical and laboratory characteristics and clinical outcomes of patients with RT-PCR confirmed MERS-CoV infection was compared with those testing negative MERS-CoV PCR. Health care workers (HCW) with MERS were compared with MERS patients who were not health care workers. One hundred and fifty nine patients were eligible for inclusion. Forty eight tested positive for MERS CoV, 44 (92%) being hospital acquired infections and 23 were HCW. There were 111 MERS-CoV negative patients with acute respiratory illnesses included in this study as ""negative controls"". Patient with confirmed MERS-CoV infection were not clinically distinguishable from those with negative MERS-CoV RT-PCR results although diarrhoea was commoner in MERS patients. A high level of suspicion in initiating laboratory tests for MERS-CoV is therefore indicated. Variables associated with adverse outcome were older age and diabetes as a co-morbid illness. Interestingly, co-morbid illnesses other than diabetes were not significantly associated with poor outcome. Health care workers with MERS had a markedly better clinical outcome compared to non HCW MERS patients.",26.0205110819796,12.658643114475481

First, the variance of incubation period distributions can strongly modulate screening outcomes: the median incubation period for SARS-CoV is similar to influenza viruses, but because its distribution has a long right tail, the expected incubation time is longer. Thus, despite a short, influenza-like median incubation time, screening outcomes for SARS-CoV are filovirus-like and less favorable. Second, epidemiological knowledge is required to implement risk factor screening. Our results show that for pathogens with long incubation periods, early characterization of exposure risk factors is a powerful screening tool at the beginning of an outbreak; for these pathogens, robust characterization of and screening for specific exposure risk factors can contribute more to case detection than rapid implementation of fever screening (Figures 3-4) . However, risk factor screening cannot improve screening effectiveness if factors that increase risk of exposure are not well characterized.

During the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, many health care workers contracted Ebola, some fatally. However, no members of the Chinese Anti-Ebola medical team, deployed to provide vital medical care in Liberia were infected. This study aims to understand how this zero infection rate was achieved. Methods: Data was collected through 15 in-depth interviews with participants from the People's Liberation Army of China medical team which operated the Chinese Ebola Treatment Center from October 2014 to January 2015 in Liberia. Data were analysed using systematic framework analysis. Results: This study found numerous bio-psycho-socio-behavioural risk factors that directly or indirectly threatened the health of the medical team working in the Chinese Ebola Treatment Center. These factors included social and emotional stress caused by: (1) the disruption of family and social networks; (2) adapting to a different culture; (3) and anxiety over social and political unrest in Liberia. Exposure to Ebola from patients and local co-workers, and the incorrect use of personal protective equipment due to fatigue was another major risk factor. Other risk factors identified were: (1) shortage of supplies; (2) lack of trained health personnel; (3) exposure to contaminated food and water; (4) and long working hours. Comprehensive efforts were taken throughout the mission to mitigate these factors. Every measure was taken to prevent the medical team's exposure to the Ebola virus, and to provide the medical team with safe, comfortable working and living environments. There were many challenges in maintaining the health safety of the team, such as the limited capability of the emergency command system (the standardized approach to the command, control, and coordination of an emergency response), and the lack of comprehensive international protocols for dealing with emerging infectious disease pandemics. Conclusions: The comprehensive and multidisciplinary measures employed to protect the health of the medical team proved successful even in Liberia's resource-limited setting. The global health community can learn valuable lessons from this experience which could improve the safety of health care workers in future emergencies. These lessons include: establishing capable command systems; implementing effective coordination mechanisms; providing adequate equipment; providing training for medical teams; investing in the development of global health professionals; and improving research on ways to protect health care workers.",29.862972817681257,13.956383602471856

Training and certification of vast number of health care providers to use POC diagnostics, and ensuring an effective supply chain for tests and drugs across the country present an enormous challenge to health systems that are already suffering from a critical shortage of human resources. Quality assurance systems, that include providing proficiency testing, sites visits, and corrective action, are essential to ensure that accurate results are being used to guide treatment decisions, and to ensure that control strategies are based on accurate surveillance data. Studies have shown that deployment of POC diagnostics can be an opportunity to improve health outcomes and strengthen health systems [29] [30] [31] . Overcoming challenges will in turn motivate health care workers and increase capacity and efficiency to test and treat appropriately. RDT introduction and implementation must be culturally sensitive and accompanied by an inter-connected system to monitor the necessary processes.

Investigations of the initial phase of this epidemic, as well as previous outbreaks, have highlighted the potential role of within-hospital transmission before or shortly after Ebola is identified as the causative agent [37, 38] . Here we found that hospitalisation, defined broadly as anything from visiting a clinic to admission to an ETU, reduced transmission risk, showing that prompt hospitalisation may be an effective intervention as long as appropriate control measures are applied. However, hospitalisation did not eliminate transmission risk, indicating that improvements in infection control are needed in many health care settings. It should be noted that the meaning of date of hospitalisation may be different among cases, depending on how many and which types of facilities they visited in the course of their disease, and furthermore that there is potential for misclassification in the recording or interpretation of information on hospitalisation. In particular, while the health care facility of first admission was commonly reported, patient transfers to other facilities may not have always been recorded. Thus, there may be ambiguity about the type of health care facility a case was in at a particular time. Such missing information reduces our ability to resolve differences between types of facilities in their effectiveness at implementing case isolation, which could lead to underestimation of differences between facility types in isolation effectiveness. However, our results are broadly consistent with analyses of the outbreak in Conakry [29] . Half of reported non-funeral exposures where the matched contact was eventually hospitalised occurred after the reported date of hospitalisation. These results underscore the importance of further improving infection control in all health care facilities, but particularly in non-ETUs. However, in contexts where hospital bed capacity is insufficient or infection control in health care settings is imperfect, greater consideration might be given to measures to reduce within-family exposure-for example, via education and/or providing a home protection kit with hand disinfectant, protective equipment, and clear guidance for those caring for sick family members.",23.63010116603732,10.684617035243571

Regulatory and public health agencies are increasingly interested in 'real-world' evidence of disease dynamics and the effect of antivirals and vaccines on the individual. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) takes the position that interventions should elicit a 'positive, clinically meaningful effect on how an individual feels, functions or survives.' Elektra Papadopoulos (FDA, Silver Spring, US) provided insight into criteria and pathways for the development of clinically relevant outcome measures from a regulatory viewpoint, including for patient reported outcomes. The session continued with a presentation by Barbara Rath (Vienna Vaccine Safety Initiative (ViVI)/ ISIRV, Berlin, Germany) on the integration of a mobile health (m-health) tool, the ViVI Disease Severity Score, to determine clinical outcomes in routine clinical settings. The Partnering for Enhanced Digital Surveillance of Influenza-like Disease and the Effect of Antivirals and Vaccines (PEDSIDEA) project offers the opportunity to gather real-time information on individuallevel disease severity across different settings and age groups, including children [4] . Daniela Paolotti (Institute for Scientific Interchange Foundation, Turin, Italy) explored the use of voluntary self-reporting as a means to monitor influenza disease activity in populations, linking data from various participatory networks (e.g. Influenzanet). She discussed the challenges of self-reporting, which may be impacted by numerous factors, including awareness of symptoms in self and others, variability of access to and time for reporting, individual interpretations and lack of objective comparators. In the absence of unbiased laboratory confirmation, self-reported symptoms may be triggered by other pathogens or confounded by latent symptoms and underlying conditions. George Milne (University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia) presented epidemiological methods used in Australia to account for population mobility, household/school/work and transmission. He was able to show that high-dose and adjuvanted vaccines are effective in reducing health outcomes in older adults and that vaccination with these vaccines is cost-effective in comparison to a quadrivalent influenza vaccine [5] .",25.018355167325197,10.40437485947763

Elderly people have a significantly higher risk of influenza-associated death compared with non-elderly people. 48 Additionally, the 2009 pandemic in NZ revealed that the risk of hospitalization and death was markedly higher for Maori and Pacific people, and those from the most deprived socioeconomic groups. 3, 42, 49 However, it is not clear whether these sociodemographic factors are independent risk factors for influenza. Furthermore, some chronic health conditions (high body mass index, asthma and pregnancy) have been shown to increase the risk of having a poor outcome from influenza infection.

The household setting (crowding, housing conditions) may influence transmission of influenza, but these effects remain poorly understood. 57-59 SHIVERS will provide a multifaceted understanding of influenza risk that considers organism, host and environmental factors and opportunities for intervention.

VFR travelers typically take longer trips, stay in local homes or accommodations, eat locally prepared meals, and take fewer pretravel precautions. Many VFR travelers return to their country of origin with children who were born at the new place of residence and lack the immunity their parents acquired before migration. These migrant-related populations of VFR travelers have been identified as being associated with increased adverse health outcomes. 116, 117 Education and training in health and migration Processes of migration and population mobility have complex ethical, legal, administrative, and social components that relate to the health of the migrant and host communities.

Secondly, we have shown through our predictive model that there is a vast and real difference in the risk of transmission between different index patients. In the majority of cases, with no risk factors, the predicted probability of secondary transmission is small, whereas in those with a combination of the various factors, the risk of transmission is many times greater. Moreover, as Lloyd-Smith and colleagues pointed out, this variability in transmission risk amongst cases is not restricted to SARS, but may be common to other infectious diseases [8] .

Burden of disease is a crucial input into health policy, because it provides an account of health loss due to different risks through a disease-by-disease analysis [7] . Most health analyses concentrate on mortality, thereby omitting nonfatal, chronic diseases that affect quality of life [8] . At the same time, a focus on noncommunicable or chronic diseases has gained support as the morbidity and comorbidity of chronic diseases in the general population have increased [9] . The measurement of the burden of diseases, or Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD), was initiated in 1992, with three major goals: (1) to provide information on nonfatal health outcomes, as most of the health policies are generally focused on mortality; (2) to develop epidemiological assessments for major disorders without bias; and (3) to quantify the burden of disease with a measure that could also be used for cost-effectiveness analysis [10] . Research is currently being conducted in different countries for diverse risk factors, such as recent analyses of the global burden of disease due to ischemic heart disease, and to determine if there is epidemiological convergence across countries [1, 11] . Different approaches have been taken in burden of disease studies, including disability weights to cover the burden of disease more elaborately [12] . The foremost milestone, one of the most important milestones, of the GBD study was the development of the composite indicator disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), which is being used throughout diverse academic research as a summary measure of the overall burden of disease and is expressed as the number of years lost due to ill-health, disability, or early death [8] .",24.945760335347504,12.140686172284193

Denmark's system, which is one of the most advanced in the world (Rothstein 2008) , has reportedly failed to realise its potential to improve healthcare service delivery, in part because of failure to develop common technical standards for health information exchange (Kierkegaard 2013) . Wherever such systems have been proposed, there are unresolved controversies about privacy, effects on doctor/patient relationships and trust, whether individuals can opt out, who controls or can have access to data and when consent is required, how to protect data from unauthorised use or accidental loss (Fairweather and Rogerson 2001) , and use of ""de-identified"" data for ethically approved research. Many of these issues were widely canvassed in recent debates about Australia's (limited) My Health Record system (Bragge and Bain 2018; Gillespie 2018) . A universal EHR system could have major benefits for healthcare research and delivery. For example, ""de-identified"" aggregate data can be used to monitor the use, outcomes and quality of health services and inform improvements or generate new knowledge about disease epidemiology, such as spatiotemporal distribution or socioeconomic, environmental or ""lifestyle"" risk factors. This information would support the development and evaluation of new treatments, preventive strategies or decision support systems and help to address social determinants of disease (Hunter 2018; Marmot 2001) .

Immunofluorescence test for virus and anthropometric assessment were performed. Outcomes were length of oxygen-use, length of hospital stay, and type of hospital unit needed. Seventy-three percent of the infants were well-nourished, 6% undernourished, 8.6% at a nutritional risk, 10.9% overweight, and 1.7% obese. Eighty-one percent of the undernourished and nutritionally at-risk infants and 72% of the well-nourished, overweight, and obese infants did not receive exclusive breastfeeding. The median length of hospital stay was four days and of oxygen-use was 60 hours. The nutritional status did not affect the clinical course of previously-healthy infants with acute viral brochiolitis. The duration of exclusive breastfeeding, but not type of breastfeeding, was inversely related to the length of oxygen-use and the length of hospital stay. Shorter exclusive breastfeeding was observed in infants who were assigned to a paediatric ward or to an intensive care unit.

This should begin with an unbridled global joint signaling structure which encompasses syndromic surveillance and risk surveillance for emerging zoonoses. The signaling structure should foster a regular rapid flow of information between veterinary and medical health sectors, give early warning of pathogen emergence, and focus on determinants of disease emergence. Parallel systems of processing evidence regarding the proposed diagnosis, interventions, medical measures, and other public health strategies to assist decision making, emergency preparedness, and response should evolve in the lines of the existing evidence updates resources. Emerging zoonoses causes serious health threats and global economical losses. Countering them mandates the adoption of a one-health approach involving various stake holders, including ecologists, to understand the hostÁ parasite interaction in the natural reservoir and to understand the ecological constraints, often limiting adaptation to other hosts. Providing early warning of zoonotic pathogen emergence requires a one-health surveillance system at local, regional, and global levels. Evidence updates on diagnostic, preventative, and therapeutic interventions; antimicrobial resistance; and public health policies would support clinicians, public health practitioners, scientists, and policy makers to prevent and control emerging zoonoses.

CHWs have increasingly become part of healthcare systems in most developing countries due to limited numbers of formally trained professional health workers, and are recognized as being the cornerstone in the system in order to deliver strong primary care particularly in rural communities. The human resources for health crisis is one of the factors underlying the poor performance of health systems to deliver effective, evidence-based interventions for priority health problems. This crisis is more critical in developing countries like Uganda which have registered a high rate of health workers migrating to work in developed countries in recent years [10] . CHWs can add significantly to the efforts of improving the health of the population, particularly in settings with the highest shortage of motivated and capable health professionals [13, 14] . In addition, where CHWs programmes exist, they are expected to increase equity and coverage of health services compared to alternative service delivery models [15] . Studies in developing countries, including Uganda, have also illustrated cost reduction and cost-effectiveness of community based tuberculosis care offered by CHWs [16, 17] .",27.610388126301746,12.494802654002898

To implement a successful POC diagnostics programme, the engagement of policy makers, stakeholders and partners to ensure buy-in and align necessary resources is a critical first step. Training and certification of vast number of health care providers to use POC diagnostics, and ensuring an effective supply chain for tests and drugs across the country present an enormous challenge to health systems that are already suffering from a critical shortage of human resources. Quality assurance systems, that include providing proficiency testing, sites visits, and corrective action, are essential to ensure that accurate results are being used to guide treatment decisions, and to ensure that control strategies are based on accurate surveillance data. Studies have shown that deployment of POC diagnostics can be an opportunity to improve health outcomes and strengthen health systems [29] [30] [31] . Overcoming challenges will in turn motivate health care workers and increase capacity and efficiency to test and treat appropriately. RDT introduction and implementation must be culturally sensitive and accompanied by an inter-connected system to monitor the necessary processes.

For example, in 2009, there was much interest in whether morbid obesity (or obesity in general) was predictive of worse outcome in infection with the novel pandemic strain of influenza A/H1N1 [34] .The primary goal was to improve estimates of clinical prognosis, although observations about prognosis could later be used to generate causal hypotheses for further testing. Similarly, observations of disparate rates of severe outcomes by geography within New York City did not initially involve causal judgments about why certain areas had worse outcomes, although they could be used to guide enhancement of services in areas with worse outcomes [35] . Even for a well-understood disease like polio, it may be necessary to identify unusual demographic patterns of mortality in order to understand and respond effectively to an outbreak [36] . Prognostic exercises such as these cannot suffer from confounding bias because no causal interpretation is attached to the conclusions. They can, however, suffer from selection bias. Returning to the Ebola context, one might wish to know whether pregnant women infected with Ebola are at greater risk of death from Ebola infection than other cases [37] , for example, in order to give them greater supportive care. If the probability of entering the database depends on whether an Ebola patient is pregnant and on whether she ultimately dies of the infection, then the probability of death given pregnancy will likely differ in the database from the value in the population of direct interest for a clinical or public health decision maker. If the goal of analysis is to inform public health decision makers on the value of efforts to prevent infection in pregnant women, then the population-wide CFR among pregnant women is the value of direct interest. If, on the other hand, the goal of analysis is to inform health care providers at a treatment center to make a better clinical decision based on an accurate prognosis of the patient presenting to them, the quantity of direct interest is the probability of death among pregnant women in the population they encounter-those admitted to the treatment center.

Teleman and others [25] showed that hand washing and use of mask can reduce the transmission of Influenza in health care settings. The use of PPE such as safety boots and hand gloves was found to be associated with a low prevalence of Influenza-A by ELISA. It has been reported that piggery workers' risk of high antibody titer to swine H1N1 virus was reduced almost to that of non-exposed controls if the piggery workers reported using gloves [26] .

These additional interventions include the use of household protection kits, designed to reduce transmission in the community; improvements in infection control protocols in health care settings that reduce transmission among health care workers; and the impact of rapid diagnostic kits in Ebola treatment centers, which reduce the time to isolation for infectious individuals seeking hospitalization. Increasing awareness and education of the population about the disease could have also yielded further reductions in case incidence by reducing the size of the at-risk susceptible population (Fig. 3) [27] . Nevertheless, some of these effects could have been indirectly captured implicitly by the time-dependent safe burial rate parameter in their model. Importantly, prior models of EVD transmission [23, 28, 29] and the model by Drake and colleagues have not incorporated spatial heterogeneity in the transmission dynamics. In particular, the EVD epidemic in West Africa can be characterized as a set of asynchronous local (e.g., Figure 5 . Epidemic growth in two populations characterized by two different underlying contact networks. Random mixing leads to a rapidly disseminating infectious disease that spreads exponentially fast. By contrast, disease spread is significantly slower in a highly clustered contact network because the contacts of recently infected individuals are likely to be already infected by other infectious individuals. The contact networks are shown for illustration and are composed of a set of nodes (individuals) denoted by red dots while blue lines (links) between nodes denote static contacts. Each solid blue curve of cumulative cases corresponds to a stochastic epidemic realization of the simple SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed) [16] , while the dashed red curve corresponds to the average of 100 stochastic realizations.",20.980095462330368,10.322010186031326

However, research of this type can be helpful in formulating and evaluating policies aiming to improve the provision of care, suggesting what factors may help or hinder the dissemination of good practice and how effectively new initiatives are introduced throughout a health system. For example, complex systems such as health services rely on large and expensive infrastructures and on the provision of trained staff that are difficult to move once they are in place, and considerable effort is often required to achieve universal changes in professional practice. Services therefore develop in a way that is 'path dependent'; the history of development of a service can influence the potential for new development in the future. Investigations of this type include studies of the diffusion of: tomography scanners in the US (Baker, 1979) ; abortion facilities in the North-eastern US (Henry, 1978) ; the administration of antipsychotic olonzapine to urban and rural children in Michigan (Penfold & Kelleher, 2007) ; alternative chiropractic and naturopathic practices in Canada (Williams, 2000) , and the international diffusion of yoga (Hoyez, 2007) . Diffusion of innovations in health policy and health promotion has also been studied from a geographical perspective. Shannon, Bashshur and Metzner (1971) analysed the spatial diffusion of a prepaid group practice health plan and Nykiforuk, Eyles, and Campbell (2008) studied the diffusion of smoke-free spaces in Canada using Roger's (2003) framework for the diffusion of innovations and classic geographical diffusion models.",30.488448091175517,13.757600688675272

Lack of positive health-related behavior, education, and poverty is an underlying cause of many neonatal deaths, either through increasing the prevalence of risk factors such as maternal infection, or through reducing access to effective care. Attempts to reduce LBW births at the population level have had limited success. Many deaths in preterm and LBW babies can be prevented with extra attention to warmth, feeding, and prevention or early treatment of infections. In developing countries, 90% of mothers deliver at home without skilled birth attendants present. Simple low-cost interventions, notably tetanus toxoid vaccination, exclusive breast feeding, counseling for birth preparedness, and breast-feeding promotion through peer counselors and women's groups have been shown to reduce newborn morbidity and mortality. Postnatally 'kangaroo' mother care for LBW infants (where babies are carried next to the mother's chest for warmth), hand washing and decreased congestion in medical facilities, attention to environmental hygiene and sterilization, and antibiotics for neonatal infections are additional health system measures. Alcohol-based antiseptics for hand hygiene are an appealing innovation because of their efficacy in reducing hand contamination and their ease of use, especially when sinks and supplies for hand washing are limited. Creation of a 'step-down' neonatal care unit for very-low-birth-weight babies with mothers providing primary care has been shown to lead to early discharge and reduction in hospital-acquired infection rates in Pakistan. These interventions can be delivered through facility-based services, population outreach, and also family/community strategies.",25.754385395102695,13.619460341471978

Users with visual impairments usually rely on voice-based instructions. However, this is not possible in some situations such as meetings, crowded places, and noisy environments. To overcome this challenge, Porzi et al. [42] combined the use of a smart watch and a smart phone to develop a gesture recognition system for visual impaired users. When the smart watch detects a gesture made by the user, it will then transmit a signal to the smart phone to activate certain devices such as the screen or a camera. Where the camera is used to capture an image, the image could then be compared with several predefined images, representing certain risk, a specific location, or a facility. After that, the result is transmitted to the user via smart phone vibrations.",28.141826417522,13.352852461006968

As a result, the program for providing health care must include detection and care of individual mice that are ill, routine colony surveillance to guard against the undetected entry and spread of previously excluded infectious agents, and a response plan if such agents are detected.

However, accurate, real-time assessment of both critical care needs and available resources remains outside the capability of most US jurisdictions that contain more than a few hospitals. In recognition of these informational shortcomings, the tiers suggested by the Task Force are based on criteria that are more likely to be known and rapidly assessed in the middle of a response: (1) expert staff assessment of current risk for harm to critically ill patients at hospitals, (2) hospital response actions, and (3) external response actions (health-care coalition 19 through federal response actions [ Table 3 ]). The tiers were designed to be consistent with a wellaccepted framework for disaster medical response. 19 The real-time data problem is not the only reason the Task Force does not define response tiers by ratios of patients to resources (eg, ICU beds). Simple counts of critical care patients and resource availability may not accurately reflect whether hospitals are functioning in a normal manner or are dangerously overwhelmed. Not reflected in the numbers is the clinical acuity of patients as well as the need for resource-intensive procedures (eg, renal replacement therapy) and specialized care (pediatrics and burn care), all variables that can significantly influence critical care resource requirements. Five patients with multiorgan system failure and hemodynamic instability may have greater critical care resource requirements than 15 patients with respiratory failure and no other organ dysfunction. Similarly, capability provided by critical care resources cannot be completely defined by simple counts of staff, treatment space, or medical equipment.

These models also often require assumptions about the parameters used to run the models, which are likely to differ by country and time period. Sometimes sufficient data are unavailable to parameterise a model and generalisations need to be made that may not always be appropriate. The majority of the existing publications use mathematical compartmental models, which are not often ideal for statistical inference and estimation due to strong assumptions for the model structure and parameters used to run the models. While these models have the flexibility of using different compartments to evaluate the impact of policies, they are not ideal for real-time analysis where the appropriate model structure and parameter values required fitting the model may not be clear. The complexity of the natural history of TB and important factors such as HIV and drug resistance complicate these models and require additional parameters for which the data are sometimes not available. We believe that it is important to develop, as a complementary approach to compartmental models, likelihood-based data-driven analytic tools. Ideally, these estimators can be used with datasets using minimal assumptions. In addition, as WGS data become more ubiquitous [82] , it will be important to develop methods that use these data to estimate the reproductive number (Fig. 5 ). This review found that the reproductive number estimates for TB are very divergentin reality, we would expect different results in different parts of the world, reflecting diversity in TB epidemics geographically. Therefore, it is important to have estimates from a wide range of settings.

They avoided health facilities and health care workers due to their associations with the disease and its spread. Avoidance of facilities and distrust of health care workers thought to have almost certainly been exposed to Ebola led to the almost complete erasure of previous gains in maternal health outcomes. In a mutually reinforcing cycle, health care workers feared and shunned pregnant women and pregnant women avoided providers and facilities. These forms of stigmatization had fertile ground in which to prosper due to the preexisting health system weaknesses in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, compounded by the rapid spread of the epidemic. Gender inequalities meant women had, at least during the first part of the epidemic, a greater risk of contracting Ebola and worse outcomes when they became infected. Pregnant women, both in 2013-2015 and moving forward in time, perhaps suffered the greatest burden through near 100% fatality when infected, but also through the reduction in obstetric services of any kind. It will doubtlessly take these countries several years to recover from the impact of the epidemic and pregnant women will continue to suffer the consequences via a decimated health care profession and weakened networks of care and services. In what was perhaps the most shocking example of the stigma related to pregnant women, health care workers, and EBV infection, one of TIME Magazine's ""People of the Year"" from 2014, an ""Ebola Fighter,"" Salome Karwah, who was a nursing assistant and herself an Ebola survivor, died on February 21, 2017, due to complications following the Cesarean delivery of her third child (Baker 2017) . Karwah used the lasting immunity from her previous Ebola infection to care for patients during the epidemic whom no one else would touch. The outbreak also claimed many of her immediate relatives, including her father who was also a physician (Baker 2017) . Of Salome's death following her son's birth, Baker (2017) writes, ""Within hours of coming home, Karwah lapsed into convulsions. Her husband and her sister rushed her back to the hospital, but no one would touch her. Her foaming mouth and violent seizures panicked the staff. 'They said she was an Ebola survivor,' says her sister by telephone. 'They didn't want contact with her fluids. They all gave her distance. No one would give her an injection.'"" Salome's sister directly pointed to stigma associated with Ebola as a cause of Salome's death. An MSF health promoter, Ella Watson-Stryker, who worked with Salome during the outbreak said, ""To survive Ebola and then die in the larger yet silent epidemic of health system failure… I have no words"" (Baker 2017) .

Women typically have different gender-assigned roles than do men-even when they are pregnant. They prepare meals, are caregivers for the sick, and often help to prepare the dead, in addition to the daily work of childcare, and, in many areas of Africa, fetching water and firewood, washing clothes, and ensuring the availability of daily provisions for the family, as well as engaging in subsistence farming (Avotri and Walters 1999; WHO 2007) . Broader structural factors and power relations influence women's ability to access health care services even under normal conditions. Women who are pregnant are at an especially high risk for becoming infected with EVD, and then having poor clinical outcomes, for several reasons. Depending on the community norms of their particular ethnic group, women, and pregnant women perhaps even more so, typically have less mobility than do other members of the society, are often dependent upon men or more senior women for decisions related to seeking health care, are poorer than men, and have less access and control over economic resources (Coulter 2009 ). There are frequently concomitant biological factors which may make pregnant women even more susceptible such as anemia, altered immunity due to pregnancy or reduced health over their life course, low body mass index (BMI), malnutrition and poor nutritional quality of the diet, and other complications of pregnancy including diabetes and hypertensive diseases. Pregnant women may spend more time in health care settings, such as clinics and hospitals, due to the pregnancy itself or due to monthly visits with their young children, or as they accompany others seeking care, and thus have greater exposure to nosocomial transmission of all diseases, not simply Ebola. Pregnant women may also have fewer treatment options or choice of medications because of potential teratogenic effects on the fetus and, if postpartum, due to breastfeeding. As was seen in previous Ebola outbreaks in Uganda and Democratic Republic of the Congo, women are often placed at greater risk for infection due to gender specific roles and activities, particularly those related to funerary practices, which have been well-studied in these previous outbreaks and have taken on a prominent role in gender-specific risk (Anoko 2014; Barbato 2014; Hewlett and Amola 2003; Segers 2014; World Health Organization 2007) .",28.860968703370823,12.078621337830558

Data from these surveys are used for myriad purposes. One clear goal is to use these data to improve the quality of the care and services provided to patients. Continuous process improvement activities in hospitals are driven by the information provided by patients about their perceptions of the care and services they received. 72 The literature is replete with examples of improvements in clinical care driven by feedback provided by patients. Some of the most notable examples include: enhancing communication among the health care team to improve patient outcomes and processes, 73, 74, 75, 76 improving pain management, 66, 77 and providing useful and timely discharge instructions. 78, 79, 80 Patient survey data also are used to inform state and federal health care policy and as a measure of the quality of care delivered for hospital reimbursement purposes. The Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS), a survey tool administered by most hospitals in the United States, is used to guide Medicare reimbursement, as well as for public reporting of the quality of individual hospitals. 81 Accrediting organizations such as the Joint Commission, the College of American Pathologists, and the American Association of Blood Banks require that some aspect of the patient experience be evaluated as part of their accreditation programs. Recent advances in the science of patient-focused survey techniques, coupled with the maturation of hospital-based quality improvement strategies, have led to improvements in clinical outcomes as a result of patient survey activities. 68, 82 Historically, patients' interactions with the health care system were assessed using tools that asked a patient to rate his/her satisfaction with the care and services provided. Surveys that elicit a person's satisfaction are designed to measure the difference between a person's expectations and/or needs and her or his experiences. 73 Crow and colleagues describe satisfaction as a relative conceptd where satisfaction is wholly dependent on the individual's construct and perspective. 83 The fact that these perceptions may be highly disparate can be illustrated by the following example. Two patients arrive at the emergency room, both with severe upper respiratory symptoms. Each patient waits 3 hours to be seen. The care provided to each patient is comparable and the clinical outcomes of the visits are identical. However, despite the similarities of their clinical experiences and outcomes, each patient's relative satisfaction with the encounter may differ substantially. One patient, who has prior experience with the system and perhaps has private insurance and ready access to the health care delivery system, reports a very low satisfaction with the encounter because, in his view, he had to wait too long to be seen by a physician. The other patient, uninsured, inexperienced with the system, and who has had infrequent access to medical care, rated the interaction as highly satisfactory because he expected that he would be denied care and, even if not denied care, that his wait would be lengthy. In this example both patients received the same care, both had effectively identical clinical outcomes, but their perceived experiences were vastly divergent, due entirely to individual expectations.",28.473158283903636,11.737343228217018

Transition of care should begin around 10 to 12 years depending on the developmental maturity of the patient and is a multifaceted process that addresses the medical, psychosocial, and educational needs of the adolescent as they prepare to move from pediatriccentered health care to adult-centered health care. 48 Before transfer of care to the adult health care system, the patient must achieve transfer readiness, which includes understanding the illness, self-management skills, and the ability to assume responsibility of his or her health care. In addition, it is helpful to identify an adult health care provider or group at least 6 to 12 months before the transfer and work closely with them during the transfer. This may include joint clinic appointments or scheduled appointments with the adult care provider to become familiar with the practice and expectations of the adult health care system while still following with the pediatric health care provider. Transition preparation is a continuous process and should incorporate interventions to promote self-management skills and adherence as pediatric patients prepare to move from child-centered care to adult-centered care to ensure a successful transfer of care.",27.573316287194302,13.660614473539702

Our findings suggest that ICIs in developing countries may be beneficial to PT students both because the skills and experiences gained in these internships can contribute positively to their personal and professional development and because students develop more interest in and gain a better appreciation of health issues affecting developing communities. Similarly, research has demonstrated that international health experiences help students in other health disciplines to acquire knowledge and skills relevant to appreciating patients' cultural differences, the multi-factorial influences on health, problem-solving skills, and evidence-based medicine. 17, [19] [20] [21] Research also suggests that international education opportunities foster an appreciation for the impact of globalization on health care delivery and help strengthen the commitment to practice in under-served areas. 18, 21 Our findings suggest that whether students worked alongside or were supervised by members of other health professions, ICIs incorporating IPE were positive learning experiences. Research has demonstrated that IPE has led to improved communication among health professionals, which facilitates goal setting and clarifies patient objectives, ultimately improving patient care. 29 Collaboration between professionals can also increase cultural knowledge and provide solutions in situations where cultural differences affect health care delivery. 30, 31 ICIs allow student exposure to global health issues in settings where inter-professional relationships can enhance the successful delivery of health care.

These methods of respiratory support, medications, and health care delivery are all potential targets to prevent the development of ARDS in at-risk patients. A large study by the Practice of Ventilation in critically ill adults without ARDS at onset of ventilation (PRoVENT) study group attempted to identify these factors [63] . This international, multicenter cohort study identified patients undergoing mechanical ventilation who were at risk of ARDS defined as a Lung Injury Prevention Score of 4 or higher. Ventilator variables such as tidal volume, PEEP, and driving pressure were not associated with the development of ARDS in those at risk and those not at risk, but interestingly FiO 2 was higher in patients who developed ARDS. A noted limitation of this study as well as other efforts to prevent ARDS is the large number of patients who have ARDS at the time of intubation [64] . Raymondos and colleagues tested whether outcomes differed between ARDS patients managed at German university and nonuniversity hospitals and found a survival benefit in patients treated at university hospital [65] . Differences were seen in the use of higher FiO 2 , lower PEEP, and higher driving pressure in the nonuniversity hospitals at the time of the study. Interestingly, this finding corroborates that of Noah et al. from 2011 wherein transfer to an ECMO center, even if the patient was then not cannulated for ECMO, conferred a survival benefit for those adults with H1N1-associated ARDS compared to matched non-ECMO referred patients [66] . While these observational data do not point towards clear reasons for the improved survival, they suggest that differences in our routine and supportive care of patients at risk for ARDS development can affect progression of disease.",29.78044300645397,13.304532194926662

Those with low income received lower health system coverage than those with higher incomes but had an increased probability of either not seeking health care when ill or undergoing catastrophic medical spending. With mortality analysis showing a parallel transition in the major causes of death in the past 3 decades in China from communicable diseases and maternal and perinatal infectious conditions to noncommunicable chronic diseases, respectively accounting for 41% in 1973% and 74% of mortality in 2005, there was a staggering pace of increased age-standardized mortality of 10% from noncommunicable disease between 1991 and 2000. 22 Modification and prevention of behavioral risk factors, diet, hypertension, obesity, tobacco use, and the response to chronic disease have, thus, claimed center stage in China. Xiao and Kohrman 23 suggested integrating medical anthropological solutions in conjunction with legislation banning smoking in public places, uniformly high cigarette prices, and tobacco advertising bans 24 in arriving at a solution to tobacco use in China citing that smoking has been encouraged in Chinese society among men as a means of development, both economic and personal. 25 Since 1978, after China adopted reform policies and opened up to the global community, the medical care system and health of residents have improved. Nevertheless, the main orientation of health care reform in the 1980s and 1990s was to render autonomy to government-owned public hospitals without contribution of public expenditures. With the emergence of for-profit privately owned hospitals, health care expenditures increased along with disparities between urban and rural areas and different provinces increased at the expense of health care coverage and access to services for most of its citizens, most of whom were the poorest. By absorbing and integrating experiences domestically and abroad, the new guidelines for China's health care reform have addressed core issues of equity and accessibility with strong public support. 26 According to Chen, 27 China's 2009 plan for health care reform marked the first phase toward achieving comprehensive health coverage by 2020. There are 5 essential components: first, systematic reform and affirming the government's role in wide medical research coverage for more than 90% of Chinese citizens; second, a national essential-drug system to meet the basic needs for treatment and prevention of diseases and to ensure safety, quality, and supply; third, improved grassroots-level medical care, with emphasis in rural areas on infrastructure and human resources in a 3-tier network at county, town, and village levels, and urban CMCs to alleviate overcrowding in city hospitals and foster a gatekeeper system led by family doctors and nurses; fourth, promotion of basic public health services; fifth, pilot program reforms to direct substantial increases in public investment, restricting of hospital management, and correction of commercialization and skewed financial incentives.",30.41217436417289,13.291705341225082

The combination of shrinking budget allocations for social services and the entry of private actors into health care resulted in a contraction of service provision (Armada et al. 2001; Oppong 2001) . While ideally private competition would create more effective, competitively priced service delivery, such a theory was based upon a notion that all markets are equally attractive. This simply did not prove to be the case. For example, in some rural areas sparse population and the low income levels meant that economies of scale for health care delivery could never be realized, and that people would not be able to pay for medical care (World Bank 2004) . These two factors alone would be enough to dissuade private health care providers from operating in the area. It would be difficult to get a single private enterprise to provide services, let alone allow for competition. 3 With the lack of private entrants in the high cost, high risk areas, provision falls to the public sector. However, with constrained fiscal and human resources, and in some cases the loss of more profitable markets to the private sector, the public sector proved not capable of providing adequate levels or types of health services (Oppong 2001; Smith-Nonini 2000; World Bank 2004) .

Although in our previous study (Abu-El-Noor et al., 2016) we called for immediate interventions from health care policy makers and hospital administrations and to offer adequate treatment and counselling for those affected by the war stress and to take further interventions to improve their mental health, to reduce the incidence of chronic PTSD and other possible psychiatric disorders, improve their job satisfaction and reduce burn out to retain them in their professions, but on the ground, there were no actions taken. The only actions that were taken were sporadic interventions that were taken by international organizations, such as Doctors of Spain. We believe that this was not enough. There are several possible reasons that health policy makers did not intervene to offer help and counselling to health care providers affected by the war. First, it is possible that health policy makers are not aware of the impact of PTSD. A second possible reason is lack of financial resources. Gaza Strip passes through crises and under siege for the last decade. Financial resources are very limited; therefore, priorities are in a continuous dramatic change. Meeting physical needs such are water, food, and electricity supplies come first in the priority list of the government. A third possible reason is that international health organizations are not engaged in offering such help as they are also considering meeting physical needs as a priority. Only a few number of organizations had offered counselling to health care professionals after the war. A final possible reason could be related to the gap between research and policy makers as some policy makers don't take seriously the results of research studies into their considerations. The literature described the gap between research and practice in health care and public health as large and troubling (Glasgow & Emmons, 2007; Lenfant, 2003) .

Hospital staff are necessarily aware of an ongoing exercise on the day of the drill. This awareness could have skewed isolation practices and biased case finding, resulting in different triage documentation for drill patients. Alternatively, it is possible that, in a busy emergency department, the volunteer patients may not have received the same intensity of medical attention as their real counterparts, as they did not appear to be ill and were not able to realistically simulate sick patients. For this reason, the drill could have underestimated the capacity of the emergency departments to correctly record clinical symptoms in the triage log and registration system. Both of these factors may contribute to a lack of accuracy in the electronic chief complaints, which could then translate into misclassification of individual cases by the NYC-DOHMH. In addition, drills and simulations do not take account of the notification efforts of individual health care workers. As was the case in our drill, a clear epidemiological link existed between the participants. In a real outbreak, an astute health care worker would hopefully notify the local department of health directly. Furthermore, even if the drill had generated a signal from the NYC-DOHMH, it would not have been recognized until the data were analyzed the next day. Syndromic surveillance is not intended as a replacement for traditional provider-based reporting of unusual disease manifestations or clusters. Syndromic surveillance is a fast, inexpensive, and flexible adjunct to traditional public health monitoring. As currently designed and used, however, these systems may not be sensitive enough to detect smaller syndrome clusters. Using information from drills and computer simulations, refinements in these networks may improve them and lead to better detection of distributed and smaller clusters.

In addition, although quasi-experimental studies are more feasible and practical to conduct, the lack of randomization is a threat to the internal validity and limits the generalizability of the results to larger populations. 11 Although simpler non-mechanistic modeling approaches, such as statistical models and analytical models, have also been used to evaluate IPC interventions, they cannot capture the complexity and dynamics of HAI transmission and the health care contexts in which the interventions are implemented. Therefore, a more comparable, reliable, and easy-to-use planning tool is needed to assess interventions and their impacts. 12 Modeling is increasingly being used to improve the understanding of epidemiological patterns of HAIs and to facilitate decisions on IPC intervention. Mechanistic simulation modeling that captures the dynamics between patients, pathogens, and the environment is particularly useful for studying complex systems such as the health care system. 13 A simulation model can be used to understand the dynamics of HAIs and IPC and how various complexities influence these dynamics or to predict outcomes of IPC interventions. The latter can only be done credibly provided we understand the system. Simulation modeling provides a risk-free environment in which ideas on IPC strategies can be tested in a systematic manner without the time, costs, and risks associated with experiments conducted in a real-world setting. It is a valuable tool to guide the selection of the most appropriate empirical research to pursue and to examine the effects of IPC strategies, serving as a ""virtual policy laboratory"" for decision support by researchers, policy makers, public health officials, hospital managers and administrators, and other health care decision-makers. 14 Like other modeling methodologies that try to predict outcomes, simulation modeling does not necessarily provide precise results that are completely reliable (eg, the exact number of infections or the precise course of an epidemic). Perfect prediction using simulation can rarely be achieved because it is impossible to build a model that fully replicates the real world, particularly when we describe a stochastic system as complex as infection transmission, which is influenced by human behavior, pathogen and host biological characteristics, and the health facility structure among many factors. Nonetheless, simulation modeling can help us to understand the relative effectiveness of different interventions, identify the risk of HAIs for different population groups, provide confidence intervals on the epidemic behaviors and, therefore, aid with decision making. IPC decision-makers using simulation models for decision-support must consider model assumptions and their relevance to the particular context in addition to carefully weighing the predicted benefits of interventions against the inconvenience, stigmatization, and costs they might engender.",34.20477632635974,16.653945340553424

For the most common RVIs, immunization is only available for influenza, as discussed later. Vaccines for many of the other RVIs are still under development and not commercially available. In addition, interventions at the level of the health care system decrease the incidence of RVI, including the appropriate use of respiratory or contact precautions, screening of visitors, and immunization of health care staff. 30,31 These interventions are included in the general US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations to reduce health care-associated pneumonia. 32 Prevention of RVI in HSCT recipients is also addressed in the joint CDC, Infectious Diseases Society of American (IDSA), and American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation guidelines as well (http://asheducationbook.hematologylibrary. org/content/2001/1/392.long). 33 Other interventions, such as universal mask use for all health care staff and visitors on an HSCT unit, strict isolation of all patients, mandatory hand washing, and visitor restriction for children less than 12 years of age, have been shown to significantly reduce the incidence of RVIs and are used at some centers.

The UI population is often of lower socioeconomic status, which adds to the difficulties accessing health care. Given that most of the federal insurance plans are unavailable to the UI population, UIs are susceptible to higher out-of-pocket costs for care. In addition, because of undocumented status, they may not have sick leave days and may have difficulty negotiating time off from work to seek care. 8 Decreased proficiency in the language of the host country and fear of deportation may also present barriers to health care for UIs. Studies have shown that patients with limited English language proficiency (LEP) are at higher risk of poor health and have decreased access to health care. Patients who have LEP had increased difficulty in understanding their health status as well as accessing preventive services. 9 Fear of deportation may lead to the avoidance of seeking care and risk of severe health complications, 8 and this also affects health care for US-born children of UIs. In addition, shame and discrimination are common feelings experienced by the UI population and contribute to poor access to health care globally. 8 Many of these issues in health care are not unique to the United States. In a study by Chauvin and colleagues, 10 22% of the UI population in Europe had access to health coverage, and, of those, only about 36% had true access because of barriers such as administrative difficulties, limited language proficiency, and lack of awareness of available services.

Health-care funders facing these facts might focus spending on primary and preventive care. The present global recession and heightened disparities are drawing attention to decades-old questions. How eff ective is critical care? How cost eff ective is critical care? How can we ration a service perceived to rescue lives at imminent risk of death? 92 Despite these realities, US clinicians perceive little or no resource restraints on their ability to deliver intensive care. 93 Data for structure, casemix, care processes, and outcomes of critical care in least developed countries (as by the UN defi nition based on low income, human resource weakness, and economic vulnerability) are restricted to descriptive studies suggesting few beds in intensive care, infrastructure, personnel, and equipment. Patients are thus admitted to ICUs with very high illness severity, and, not surprisingly, narrative reviews suggest that clinical outcomes are poor. 94 Maximising use of this scarce resource (table 2) implies attention to regionalisation and integration, based on prevailing local realities. 39 Some have argued that fi nancial inequities and cultural expectations make the notion of considering intensive care in developing countries misguided, and a universally applicable critical care ethic impossible. 95 Mitigating arguments emphasise philosophical principles of universal justice and harm to national economies 96 of untreated critical illness.

IHD is a case in point. It is probable that about half of the substantial reduction in deaths from IHD were related to improvements in health behaviours (attributable largely to public health), with the remaining half attributable to medical care. 61 Both medical care and public health have reduced income-related disparities in IHD, and much of the remaining income-related disparity could be reduced by either public health or medical care interventions. Canadians of lower socioeconomic status are known to have a higher prevalence of various cardiovascular disease risk factors. 49 62 Recent studies have reaffirmed the role of these risk factors for IHD. 63 64 For medical care, the Polypill may substantially reduce IHD 65 and if socioeconomic groups were to adhere equally to the recommendations, income-related IHD disparities could diminish as well. However, it should be noted that differentials in Polypill use and adherence might lead to an increased income-related IHD mortality disparity. Studies conducted by Alter et al 5 66 and Kapral et al 6 have shown that Ontarians from lower income neighbourhoods were less likely to receive specialised health services for acute myocardial infarction and stroke, respectively. However, in both studies, lower income was shown to be associated with mortality independent of medical service characteristics, suggesting that patients of lower socioeconomic status experience greater disease severity owing to factors stemming from outside the medical care setting as well.",27.718329485861403,13.611190958631813

Specifically, CDC makes recommendations for ambulatory care settings that include dental offices. Challenges may exist when adapting Transmission-Based Precautions to dental offices rather than to inpatient facilities. For example, dental office staff members may not be able to identify patients with infections immediately, patients frequently remain in common waiting areas for prolonged periods and treatment rooms may be turned around quickly with limited cleaning. 8 Transmission-Based Precautions were mentioned in CDC's 2003 infection control guidelines for dental health care settings, 1 but not to any great extent.

This may be because patients usually do not seek routine dental outpatient care when they are acutely ill with diseases that require Transmission-Based Precautions. 1 Nonetheless, a general understanding of precautions for diseases transmitted via all routes is important, because some dental health care personnel (DHCP) are hospital based or work part time in hospital settings, patients infected with these diseases might seek urgent treatment at outpatient dental offices, and DHCP might become infected with these diseases. 1 Also, recently, several diseases requiring precautions beyond Standard Precautions (for example, MRSA or 2009 H1N1 influenza) have received extensive media coverage, and some dental professionals have inquired why there were not specific infection control recommendations to cover these conditions in ambulatory care dental settings.",29.681940405783948,12.390247185256346

Those in opposition maintain that using taxpayer-funded services to support individuals who enter and remain in the United States illegally undermines the legal system. However, some scholars and legislators have argued that it is both unethical and impractical to deny access to health care services for illegal immigrants living in the United States. 16 They view health care as a basic human right and an obligation of a just society to provide health care for everyone. Leading medical professional societies such as the American Medical Association (AMA), American College of Physicians (ACP), the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), and the American Nurses Association (ANA) reaffirm the position that all individuals living in the United States, regardless of their immigration status, should have access to quality health care, including the opportunity to purchase insurance. These leaders maintain that providing this population with access to health insurance is an evidence-based way to reduce health care costs. [17] [18] [19] Another argument, from a cost perspective, is that many UIs will benefit from preventive care and early treatment of chronic diseases before they advance to lifethreatening and costly complications. 20, 21 Proponents of this strategy advocate for improving health literacy and vaccination rates, and offering health screenings to the UI population to try to prevent long-term adverse health outcomes and control cost. Moreover, UIs may harbor infections such as tuberculosis (TB), which, when undetected, can easily be transmitted to the general public, thus posing a public health risk. 22 In contrast, some have argued that treating UIs creates more expenditures for the United States while saving their countries of origin the costs of providing health care. 23 Furthermore, they argue that sharing inadequate health care resources with UIs will reduce the availability of those scarce resources for US citizens. In the last 2 decades, several states have attempted to advance legislation designed to deny UIs access to publicly funded health services. One such initiative was California's Proposition 187. This law, later deemed unconstitutional, required health care professionals to verify immigration status and report UIs to authorities. 24 In addition, some believe that continued unabated treatment of UIs is an incentive for persistent violation of the immigration laws and threatens national security in the post-9/11 era. 25 Proponents of this argument suggest that denying health care to UIs will discourage others from attempting to immigrate without proper documentation. 24 ",26.349167182156982,11.366453303832152

Would intensive care treatment offer any benefit to patients with Ebola infection? At the time of a UK national policy meeting in late 2014, many felt that interventions such as mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy would pose a risk to staff without making any difference to the patient's eventual death. There were a few dissenting opinions, including those expressed by staff at the Royal Free Hospital. Not long after the UK meeting, a report was published of successful ventilation and dialysis of a patient in the USA, suggesting that the policy of not offering advanced treatment in the UK was unnecessarily nihilistic. 11 On this background, one of the biggest worries for doctors, nurses, and other workers travelling to assist in West Africa was whether we would be repatriated to the UK if we contracted the disease we were treating. It was clear that although in our tented facility in the jungle south of Freetown we were able to provide a higher level of care than that available elsewhere in Sierra Leone, we did not have the equipment for respiratory or renal support. 12 One of the factors in whether health-care workers volunteer is probably how they think they will be treated if they develop an infection that has a 70% patient fatality rate in Africa but a 95% survival rate in Europe or the USA. One could argue on ethical grounds that volunteers who were encouraged to travel to West Africa by the NHS to assist in the epidemic should be supported to the full extent possible by the UK, including evacuation for care in a specialist unit. By the end of the outbreak, two UK civilian nurses and one military nurse had contracted Ebola infection in the course of their work.

The epidemiology, risk factors and outcomes of viral respiratory tract infections (vRTI) are not well described in patients with multiple myeloma managed with novel agents, the current standard of care. Methods Patients with myeloma from 2009 to 2012 who tested positive on respiratory virus multiplex polymerase chain reaction had clinical, radiological and microbiological records reviewed. The Fourth European Conference on Infections in Leukaemia (ECIL-4) definitions of RTI were applied. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis of risk factors was performed using vRTI as the evaluable outcome. Results Of 330 patients, 75 (22.7 %) tested positive for a total of 100 vRTI episodes. All patients received thalidomide, lenalidomide or bortezomib in combination with myeloma therapies (median of three treatment regimens). vRTI occurred most commonly in patients with progressive disease, and receipt of more than three lines of myeloma therapy was associated with an increased risk of vRTI (p<0.01). Amongst key respiratory pathogens, influenza was associated with the highest hospital admission rate (66.7 %), ICU admission rate (41.6 %) and mortality (33.3 %) whilst RSV was associated with prolonged hospital stay. Conclusion Patients with multiple myeloma and advanced disease managed with multiple lines of therapy are at risk for vRTI, and targeted interventions for prevention/treatment are required.",27.55634938243817,14.818287147058314

COPD contributes to morbidity and mortality and to a signifi cant use of health-care resources and expense on a global scale; this is especially true in developing countries. 2-4 The burden of COPD in China is currently greater than that found in developed countries. This is probably due to greater exposure to epidemic risk factors, an imbalance in economic development, and health-care disparities between urban and rural areas. The reported prevalence of COPD Although, to our knowledge, there has been no exhaustive or credible review of the evidence of the disease burden of COPD in China, COPD has become an increasing public health concern to the Chinese medical community. The purpose of this article is to review the evidence and evaluate and clarify the disease burden of COPD in China with the aim of improving effective management. We reviewed previous studies of COPD in China, which included data on prevalence, mortality, disease burden, risk factors, diagnosis, and management by searching related Web sites, including PubMed, ProQuest, and Thomson Reuters' Web of Knowledge, as well as major Chinese databases and government Web sites. Reported COPD prevalence varied between 5% and 13% in different provinces/cities across China. In 2008, COPD ranked fourth as a leading cause of death in urban areas and third in rural areas. In addition, COPD accounted for 1.6% of all hospital admissions in China in that year. The high prevalence of smoking and biomass fuel use acted as major contributors to the high occurrence of COPD in China. Management of COPD in China should focus on adjusting the distribution of medical resources and on addressing public health policies to facilitate earlier diagnosis in rural areas, aim to reduce smoking prevalence, improve patients' self-management, and keep physicians' knowledge up to date and consistent with current guidelines. COPD is one of the most challenging medical issues facing China because of its infl uence on both personal and public health and its impact on the economy. Optimal management strategies should be adopted and strengthened immediately.",28.24136684413795,12.702087705598428

The recommended test to confirm the diagnosis of pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus is real-time RTPCR for influenza A, B, H1, and H3. Isolation of pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus using culture is diagnostic, but culture is usually too slow to help guide clinical management. 5, 6 A negative viral culture does not exclude infection by H1N1 influenza A. Clinicians may consider using rapid influenza antigen tests as part of their evaluation of patients suspected of having pandemic H1N1 influenza A, but results should be interpreted with caution. 7, 8 A large number of RTPCR tests have been reported, and they use various chemical and multiplexing formats. 9 -16 However, in the current scenario, the only realtime RTPCR validated by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is the one approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) for confirmation of pandemic novel swineorigin H1N1 infection. This CDC real-time RTPCR is based on a panel of oligonucleotide primers and duallabeled hydrolysis probes that use the Superscript TM III Platinum one-step quantitative kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) with four sets of primers and probes for universal influenza A, swine influenza A, swine H1(new H1N1), and housekeeping gene (RNase P) for testing the quality of the RNA template (http://www.who.int/csr/resources/ publications/swine flu/CDC real-time RTPCR protocol). One of the limitations of the existing WHO-approved CDC real-time RTPCR is that the test system is very expensive, considering the large number of primer and probe sets that must be used. In addition, the requirement of expensive real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) instruments also restricts the system's application to a few referral laboratories that have good financial resources. Overall, the real-time RTPCR test system is expensive and time consuming-it requires 3 to 4 hours. Therefore, real-time RTPCR is not the method of choice in basic clinical settings in developing countries for clinical diagnosis of novel S-OIV.

In this case, it is a study of how social factors (e.g., class, race, gender, religion, ethnicity, kinship network, marriage, educational status, age, place, and cultural practices) influence human health. The idea of social patterning indicates that these social factors could be the determinants of human health status (see Chap. 4). It is in this sense that some diseases may be referred to as diseases of poverty (e.g., malaria and TB) because they are much more prevalent in poor regions or among the poor. For example, a person residing in a slum is at a higher risk of being exposed to certain diseases which a person in affluent area may have lower risk of being exposed to. Medical sociology is distinct in its approach because it considers the ""import that social and structural factors have on the disease and illness processes as well as on the organisation and delivery of health care"" (Hafferty and Castellani 2006, p. 334 ). Hafferty and Castellani further observed that these factors also include culture (e.g., values, beliefs, normative expectations), organisational processes (e.g., hospital setting), politics (e.g., health care policy, health budget, political ideology), economic system (e.g., capitalism, the costs of health care), and microlevel processes such as socialisation and identity formation.",31.115393618570593,13.840182058949658

In fact, facts and knowledge change as time, experience, and circumstances evolve. At one time, for example, antibiotics were mixed in soaps and product surfaces to eradicate germs, but we have come to realize that excessive or incomplete use of antibiotics has given rise to dangerous generations of antibiotic-resistant germs. Even rules of thumb, like the IV Therapy's ""Five Rights"" may inevitably be reconsidered as we realize we have overlooked, or might improve outcomes if we add more rights (Federico, 2015) ! Perhaps last, but certainly not least, there are significant ethical and societal issues being exposed in the development and deployment of AI systems in all applications (health care included). One of the simplest medical ethics issue is the right of the patient to choose to accept, decline, or cooperate with treatment. How, for example, should an AI healthcare system deal with a patient with liver disease who cannot/will not stop drinking alcohol or injecting illegal narcotics? Or consider the conundrum that faces the self-driving car industry: no-win choices and decisions provoked by circumstances. For example, if a car must choose from harming a child on one side of the street, a group of adults crossing the street, a pregnant mother on the other side of the street, or risk harming the passenger by running into an oncoming bus, what is the ""best"" decision (Silva, 2019) ?

They remain important in defined settings and become most cost effective when the indications for their use are most clearly defined. Although vertical and horizontal approaches are not mutually exclusive, there is evolving evidence that horizontal interventions in endemic situations may represent a best use of HAI prevention resources. 6 Recent well-designed studies of chlorhexidine bathing and decolonization as well as expanded use of contact precautions in ICUs seem to have significant potential for HAI reduction, at least in certain settings. 6 Furthermore, the use of vertical interventions has recently been shown of critical value in optimizing safety with emerging pathogens, such as Ebola virus and the Corona virus associated with MeRS. 7, 8 To facilitate discussion of the many elements necessary to optimize health care hygienic cleaning, it is useful to put these interventions into a defined construct of HAI prevention activities. As indicated in Fig. 1 , hygienic cleaning and hand hygiene as well as interventions related to instrument reprocessing, air quality, water quality, and physical setting design are all horizontal interventions. All these horizontal interventions represent elements of health care hygienic practice. Although these elements have traditionally been discussed independently, their effectiveness in clinical settings is substantially interrelated, in particular environmental hygiene and hand hygiene, as discussed later. The term, environmental hygiene, with respect to health care, can be defined as cleaning activities directed at removing and/or killing potentially harmful pathogens capable of being transmitted directly from surfaces or indirectly to susceptible individuals or other surfaces. As such it consists of both the physical cleaning of surfaces as well as surface disinfection cleaning (see Fig. 1 ). Although liquid chemistries are well established as the most clinically useful approach to surface disinfection, innovative approaches that may have the potential for complementing traditional liquid chemistry have been developed over the past several years. Each of these aspects of environmental hygiene is discussed in detail whereas the other components of health care hygienic practice (see Fig. 1 ) are addressed in other articles of this issue.",28.75409584015346,10.639168195619263

We conclude that although UVGI is microbiocidal, it is not ''ready for prime time'' as a primary intervention to kill or inactivate infectious microorganisms; rather, it should be considered an adjunct. Other factors, such as careful design of the built environment, installation and effective operation of the HVAC system, and a high level of attention to traditional cleaning and disinfection, must be assessed before a health care facility can decide to rely solely on UVGI to meet indoor air quality requirements for health care facilities.

Widmer, M. Lang, R. Frei (Basel, CH) Introduction: S. aureus (MSSA) carriage is common among health care workers (HCWs)and might be associated with type of care provided and other potential risk factors. Transmission of MSSA has been observed by ''cloud adults''. Objectives: To determine risk factors for MSSA carriage in HCWs, and the percentage of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in a tertiary care centre. Methods: Retrospective review of all data of staff health department and the microbiology laboratory. All HCWs who were working in a high MRSA prevalence country were routinely screened at the time they were hired by the institution. In addition, data were generated from MRSA screenings of HCWs if there was evidence for nosocomial transmission of MRSA in patients. MRSA was defined as S. aureus being oxacillin-resistant and expressing the PBP2' and/or being positive for the mecA gene by PCR. Data of HCWs were collected by chart review in a case-report form that included demographic data, work place, skin diseases and other variables. Data were compared by univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses. Results: A total of 3474 swabs were taken from 1217 HCWs between Jan 1997 and Dec.2001. Data were available from 1182 HCWs:50% originated from Switzerland, 27% from Germany, 4% from France, and 19% from other countries. The overall prevalence of MSSA and MRSA was 53% and 1%, respectively. More than one sample was available from 332 individuals: Of the repeat samples, 38% were negative, 32% were negative, but had one single positive culture, and 30% were consistently positive. Sex, profession, work place, number of years at the institution was not associated with S. aureus carriage (p > 0.2). The only significant risk factor for S. aureus carriage was young age, defined <35years (p = 0.02). The prevalence of MSSA increased from 51% (1997) to 63% (2001) . Eight HCWs were carriers of MRSA: they were young and half of the them reported skin diseases. Conclusion: S. aureus carriage among HCWs is common: Only young age remained a risk factor even after adjusting for other variables. MRSA was rare among HCWs.",27.06789787359164,13.850786593670588

While these visions are perfectly realistic in the developed world, they are quite unrealistic in many parts of the globe. However, with the growth of cellular telephony, particularly in Africa, tremendous opportunities exist for nurses to creatively apply telehealth modalities to long-standing patient care issues. For example, Elder and Clarke cite the following examples for the potential use of cellular telephones and Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) for telehealth in Africa and Asia: 33 • Automation of demographic surveillance activities such as those at the core of pioneering health care initiatives (e.g., the Tanzanian Essential Health Interventions Project) • Testing of the use of SMS (short message service) reminders in the treatment of tuberculosis in Cape Town, South Africa • Delivery of continuing medical education and professional development via PDA • Delivery of time-sensitive alerts to patients and health care workers • Maintenance of patient records for HIV-positive patients' lifelong drug treatments • Management of specific health care initiatives such as the roll-out of antiretroviral therapy and tuberculosis treatment initiatives Again, realizing the numbers of nurses who are in the frontline of primary care around the globe and in light of the massive growth of ICT for health, tremendous opportunity awaits those who are primed to capitalize upon these factors. Making the application of telehealth/telenursing successful in developing countries will require strong nursing partnerships and leadership, however. Nurses are in a position to drive the development of science in this area, since many aspects of nursing care are naturally amenable to virtual delivery, especially in areas of assessment, patient teaching, decision support, and early identification of problems. 34 ",31.898231369907766,13.776099967886296

Therefore, while there is acknowledged need for ICT in the coordination and monitoring of treatment, surveillance, response, education, and communication in health care, in reality there are significant barriers in the application of ICT that slow progress. These barriers are in no way restricted to the developing world. The United States and other more technologically advanced nations have their own sets of challenges. Cost, misalignment of incentives, resistance, an unskilled workforce, concerns about impact on productivity, lack of standards and interoperability, and other issues contribute to a poor level of healthcare ICT adoption in the industrialized world. 16 The digital divide has resulted in large segments of low income and/or other underserved groups being excluded from online health resources. 16 Economic hardships and difficult tradeoff decisions in the US healthcare industry have further inhibited healthcare information technology growth. 17 In developing nations, the problem of ICT uptake is even further compounded. A lack of local expertise and decades of well-meaning but non-sustainable ICT projects in the developing world have left a legacy of skepticism in their wake. Systems built for Westernized health care delivery often do not match the local context, resulting in a misalignment between need and technology.

The health-care system is less a true national system than a decentralised collection of provincial and territorial insurance plans covering a narrow basket of services, which are free at the point of care. Administration and service delivery are highly decentralised, although coverage is portable across the country. In the setting of geographical and population diversity, long waits for elective care demand the capacity and commitment to scale up effective and sustainable models of care delivery across the country. Profound health inequities experienced by Indigenous populations and some vulnerable groups also require coordinated action on the social determinants of health if these inequities are to be effectively addressed. Achievement of the high aspirations of Medicare's founders requires a renewal of the tripartite social contract between governments, health-care providers, and the public.

In addition, the Institute of Medicine issued a report that proposed a strategy for prolonging the useful life of N95s through the use of a surgical mask overlay that is intended to provide barrier protection for the N95. 6 Research examining potential physiologic impacts of long-term N95 use has been limited. Most has been laboratory based, 7, 8 meaning that work conditions were approximated by walking on a treadmill and/or involved young, healthy subjects. 9,10 Only 1 study has examined long-term N95 use among health care personnel in an actual work setting, 11 and that study only assessed perceived intolerance. In addition to physiologic factors, researchers indicate that subjective symptoms/conditions, such as perceived comfort, headaches, or difficulty communicating with patients, may affect health care personnel's tolerance of long-term N95 use. In retrospective studies, researchers reported that long-term use of N95s during the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak was associated with an increased frequency of headaches 12 and physical discomfort. 13 In addition to examining tolerance, it is important to assess staff compliance. Noncompliance with N95 use can put staff at risk from infection, a factor believed to be associated with the high rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome among health care personnel. 14 A study using self-reported compliance found that less than half of all health care personnel reported being compliant when using an N95, and that study only examined the practice of touching the N95 when measuring compliance. 15 Other noncompliant behaviors, such as adjusting the N95 during use or touching under the N95, were not assessed. In addition, researchers indicate that N95 compliance may decrease over time; the longer N95s are worn, the less compliant staff become. 16 A prospective study examining tolerance and observed compliance with long-term N95 use among health care personnel providing routine patient care in an actual work environment has never been conducted.",25.68774168535109,11.640291046057268

Because the results were consistent across the study period, however, this is likely not a significant factor. The Charlson comorbidity index is formed from ICD coding, but it has been shown that the change in coding did not affect its performance in capturing comorbidity.

Our results support the crosssectional relationship between short-term outcomes and higher-volume centers. In addition, we show that, over time, there has been an improvement in short-term mortality, and this change is in part due to more cases being done in higher-volume centers rather than within-hospital improvement. These results support the idea that services should continue to be regionalized to high-volume centers. However, regionalization is clearly more than just volume and includes other processes of care that we have not measured, such as specialized services, staff, and experience.

For instance, a number of health care professionals had to impose quarantine restrictions on themselves. This resulted in them not taking part in normal household activities and not being involved in any intimate relationships with spouses. A significant number isolated themselves within the hospital premises for extended periods of time. An understanding of the risks to themselves and their visiting clients is important for effective practice. Given the possibility that asymptomatic individuals could transmit SARS to others, stringent precautionary and infection control measures must be maintained. Our experience in Hong Kong showed that patients were afraid to contact health care professionals, following media reports of the high prevalence of infection in health care settings. Therefore, proper preventive measures (Table 1) should be taken to ensure that the travel health clinic is safe for patients to visit and that there are no or only minimal risks of infecting patients in the clinic.

These common risk factors include vector-related risk factors, disease-related risks, drug treatment and development challenges, social determinants of health-related risk factors, environmental/ climate change risk factors, and disease control-related challenges (Table 5) . Primarily, the diseases within the EReNTD category are largely widespread, they impact millions worldwide, they disproportionately impact impoverished, resource-poor communities, and they recently have spread to higher-income, developed country settings through globalization, primarily via migration and importation through international trade and travel (8, 278) .",24.953976406072815,12.570160870448086

ED physicians see the results of inadequate education, social services, and health care. Multiple studies have demonstrated inequities in the delivery of health services attributable to gender, race, and age [77] [78] [79] . There is a need, however, for investigation into the causes of these differences and interventions to correct the disparities. Moreover, inequities in health care do not only exist outside of emergency medicine: we also need to examine our own practice. While most emergency physicians agree that the same high quality of care should be available to all patients, prior research suggests that this may not always be the case [80] . For instance, African Americans and Hispanics are less likely to receive analgesics for painful conditions [81] . Research is needed to assess the degree to which such disparities exist for other emergency conditions. When inequities in care are documented, there is need for investigation into the patient and provider factors that may contribute to differences so that interventions to close these gaps can be designed and evaluated. As an example, we can explore the influence of time pressure and complex cognitive tasks on medical decision making to see if bias exists in the treatment of critical conditions (eg, chest pain, respiratory failure, end-of-life care, pain management) in need of immediate assessment and treatment. It has been suggested that these conditions increase the likelihood that providers will use stereotypes or prejudice as they provide clinical care [80] . When systematic health disparities are identified by race or socioeconomic status, there is a need to look at the broader educational, health, and social welfare systems to identify the sources and mechanisms of these disparities, not only to document these inequities but to help develop and assess new polices designed to ameliorate such disparities.",28.634715086409305,12.525989022022584

Many of these patients who are at risk for gramnegatives would now be reclassifi ed as having health care-associated pneumonia (HCAP). 2,13 Some ICU patients are at risk for pseudomonal infection, whereas others are not, and the risk factors for P. aeruginosa infection are structural lung disease (bronchiectasis), corticosteroid therapy (>10 mg prednisone/day), broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy for more than 7 days in the past month, previous hospitalization, and malnutrition. 2 Although aspiration has often been considered a risk factor for anaerobic infection, a study of severe CAP in elderly patients with aspiration risk factors found that this population is likely to have gram-negative infection and, using sensitive microbiologic methods, anaerobes were uncommon. 71",28.59437705231929,12.440248117880309

These models also often require assumptions about the parameters used to run the models, which are likely to differ by country and time period. Sometimes sufficient data are unavailable to parameterise a model and generalisations need to be made that may not always be appropriate. The majority of the existing publications use mathematical compartmental models, which are not often ideal for statistical inference and estimation due to strong assumptions for the model structure and parameters used to run the models. While these models have the flexibility of using different compartments to evaluate the impact of policies, they are not ideal for real-time analysis where the appropriate model structure and parameter values required fitting the model may not be clear. The complexity of the natural history of TB and important factors such as HIV and drug resistance complicate these models and require additional parameters for which the data are sometimes not available. We believe that it is important to develop, as a complementary approach to compartmental models, likelihood-based data-driven analytic tools. Ideally, these estimators can be used with datasets using minimal assumptions. In addition, as WGS data become more ubiquitous [82] , it will be important to develop methods that use these data to estimate the reproductive number (Fig. 5 ). This review found that the reproductive number estimates for TB are very divergentin reality, we would expect different results in different parts of the world, reflecting diversity in TB epidemics geographically. Therefore, it is important to have estimates from a wide range of settings. An ultimate goal of methods to estimate the reproductive number should be to use routinely collected data (including potentially WGS data) to be able to monitor the reproductive number in 'real-time' and evaluate interventions through this process.",30.633451735639007,15.199420607569017

Of course, during such times of civil crisis, the general population's need for health care services may also be expected to rise significantly. 2, 7 Within the profession of pharmacy, there has been some literature published related to disaster preparedness.

Text messages are an easy way to communicate between people at different locations in real-time. Frontline SMS uses text messaging to distribute and collect health information. The system enables users to connect a range of mobile devices to a computer to send and receive SMS text messages. The software works without an internet connection by connecting a device such as a cell phone or modem to a local phone number, thus creating an easy way to send and receive messages, group contacts, respond to messages and trigger other events. Since the platform works anywhere there is a mobile signal, it does not need the internet, a major advantage for many grassroots non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and a benefit to detection in remote places. An example of this effort is in Cambodia, where FrontlineSMS is being used to help convey information about malaria detection. Volunteers previously received three days of training in the early diagnosis of malaria and treatment, a bicycle, a pair of boots, a bag, a flashlight and a cooler box for medicines, as well as a small travel allowance.

Using the phone, the volunteers can report in real time all malaria cases in their villages, including patient and disease information, to a collective alert system.

A Danish populationbased study of 63,000 deliveries found a cumulative incidence of 0.85 in 1000 deliveries from 1984 to 1994. 74 In this study, the incidence of detected venous thromboembolism increased to 1.23 in 1000 deliveries after the introduction of ultrasonography, demonstrating that its reported incidence may depend on the adequacy of diagnostic procedures employed. Other studies have reported rates of 0.6 to 2 per 1000 pregnancies. 75 The risk for thrombosis is increased in pregnancy, partly because of the increase in coagulation factors, particularly V, VIII, X, and von Willebrand factor antigen, and partly because of a marked fall in protein S. 76 Venous stasis, an important contributor to thrombosis, is caused by uterine compression of the inferior vena cava and the left iliac vein. Local trauma to pelvic veins at the time of delivery probably accounts for the peak incidence of thromboembolism in the postpartum period, especially after cesarean section. Specific risk factors for thromboembolism include previous thromboembolism during pregnancy or while taking oral contraceptives, prolonged bed rest, a complicated or cesarean delivery, age, thrombophilia, obesity, and smoking.

This technology uses clinical triggers to signal the presence of potential errors or adverse events.

FMEAs, or other risk assessments, identify process points that are associated with increased risk to the patient/participant, to involved providers, and/or to the scientific integrity of the study. As illustrated in the example above, these risks can be addressed by myriad clinical and organizational interventions that are aimed at reducing those risks. The next step in mitigating risk is the deployment of strategies to assess the effectiveness of interventions, and to survey the research and care environments continually for other risks to the participants and to the study. Measurement is fundamental to assessment efforts and improvement in the quality of care. The history of health-care quality improvement and measurement dates to Florence Nightingale's collection of mortality data and infection rates during the Crimean War, as well as to the work of Ernest Codman in establishing standards for hospitals in the early 1900s, including his provocative ""end results hypothesis"" that led to a Semmelweis-like estrangement from the health-care establishment (see Chapter 1). 32, 33 In a classic paper in 1968 Avedis Donabedian recommended measuring health-care quality in three areas: structure (the characteristics of a health-care setting); process (what is done in the health-care setting); and outcomes (the status of the patient resulting from specific interventions). 34 This paradigm remains the mainstay of modern health-care performance measurement programs and is the basis for the local, state, and federal programs designed to measure the quality of clinical care and identify health care-associated risks and adverse events. Clinical research programs, too, should implement processes to assess the performance of the clinical research enterprise systematicallydprimarily to assess for risks to the participants, investigators, and care providers, as well as for threats to the integrity of the study. Collecting and reporting adverse events that occur during the course of a research study is a mandatory component of both the research process and the protection of human subjects. However, event reporting in clinical research focuses on individual protocols, not on how the system of clinical research is performing as a whole. This ""protocolcentric"" focus fails to identify clinical care and clinical research system failures that potentially might impact participant safety across multiple studies. Murff and his colleagues 35, 36 have described the need for research teams to develop reporting systems that collect data about reportable adverse events, as well as ""near misses"" or ""latent failures"" in the clinical care and clinical research environments. Near misses or latent failures are errors that do not result in patient/participant harm; however, these events do have the potential to do harm if the circumstances of the event were somewhat different. Identifying and analyzing near misses or system failures provide the care and research teams the luxury of designing and implementing interventions to interrupt the error cycle prior to the occurrence of a serious error. Surveillance for errors, adverse events, and latent errors in the clinical care or research setting can be accomplished using a variety of strategies including 1 event reporting systems 2 ; electronic surveillance systems that utilize clinical triggers to identify errors; and 3 analysis of clinical performance measurement data.",30.41336540233731,14.200873656551776

As was the case with the SARS protocol, this process can be daunting. Focusing an organization's finite resources to assure that attention is paid to the most critical and potentially riskiest care processes is a challenge for most organizations. A variety of tools exist to guide the objective prioritization of what may ultimately be a very long list of critical issues that must be addressed. FMEA is a powerful risk assessment tool that provides a systems-based, human-factors-focused, and objective methodology for identifying and prioritizing risk, with the ultimate aim of reducing patient harm and enhancing clinical research. 19,21e28 Historically, FMEA has been used in the engineering environment to assess high-risk processes associated with power generation in the commercial nuclear power industry; in aviation to assess the acceptability of aircraft designs; and in the automotive industry to establish manufacturing requirements for cars and trucks. 19, 22, 24 DeRosier and colleagues at the Veteran's Administration's Center for Patient Safety are credited with moving the techniques of FMEA to the bedside, applying the concept of prospective risk analysis to health-care processes. 29, 30 In 2002, the use of FMEA in health care further expanded with the issuance of a Joint Commission requirement that all health-care organizations seeking accreditation conduct at least one proactive risk assessment on a high-risk clinical process every 18 months. 31 Clinical care practitioners as well as clinical research professionals can use FMEAs to identify risk and to avert adverse events, errors, and other system failures in a variety of health-care settings. 19, 20, 22, 23, 27, 28 In a complex care environment, where risk is compounded by the interplay of clinical medicine and clinical research, FMEA is a useful tool to guide risk mitigation by identifying critical risk points in clinical care and clinical research processes. In 2016, investigators at the National Institute of Mental Health initiated a clinical research protocol at the NIH CC to study the neurobiology of suicide and to identify risk factors for short and long-term suicidality. One of the study phases involved admitting actively suicidal patients. In response to this research protocol, the NIH CC set in motion a rigorous risk mitigation initiative. An interdisciplinary team comprised of patient safety professionals, research investigators, nurses, social workers, and hospital leadership used FMEA to evaluate potential risk points throughout the clinical research and patient care processes. The analysis was facilitated using QI Path, an FMEA software package.

Several actions have been taken in response to COVID-19 outbreak. According to a survey of 2216 GI doctors from all over China early in the outbreak of COVID-19, the awareness of digestive system damage and involvement in COVID-19 was low, ranging from 31% to 35% [3] . To counteract this, the CSG rapidly organized a group of experts including gastroenterologists working in the forefront of COVID-19 patient care to discuss and reach a consensus on management of digestive disorders involved in COVID-19 (Table 1 ) [4] .This consensus includes recommendations regarding transmission route, clinical manifestation spectrum of digestive system involvement, practical guidelines on treatment based on the latest publications, and precautions regarding endoscopic procedure. In addition, cautions for GI outpatient clinic have been proposed [4] . The CSG is comprised of 25 committees of sub-specialty depending on the disease spectrum. As a response to the increasing concern and inquiry about COVID-19 risk from the community of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in China, the Chinese IBD Committee affiliated to CSG has issued timely recommendations for managing IBD patients in early February 2020, which is probably the first guideline regarding IBD and COVID-19 in the global community [5] . The guideline includes practical recommendations regarding immunosuppressive agent and biologics use, diet, Epidemics and public health crises pose great challenges to health care delivery. To minimize the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection by avoiding close contact with infected patients in public areas such as hospitals, telemedicine has also been widely applied in our non-COVID-19 patient care including virtual clinic visits online clinic consultancy and nurse-led care support based on interactive social care app such as WeChat.

Product evaluation tests typically involve only components of the PPE (eg, the penetration of fluid through the textile, not the seams in the garment or performance in the field), 18, 19 and federal agency representiatives and others have been called on to test the permeability of textiles to specific infectious agents. 37 Although there is room to improve the realism of this type of product testing, it is equally important to evaluate how PPE ensembles perform in the field, where human behavior and individual pieces of PPE influence protection. The 2014-2015 EVD outbreak motivated substantial research about the potential for self-contamination associated with doffing complex PPE ensembles, 26 and more work about ensemble performance during care activities. Hall et al 38 evaluated 5 PPE ensembles intended for use with suspected EVD patients, using a complex health care activity simulation with fluorescent simulated body fluids, and found contamination under the PPE and other flaws with all ensembles tested. Herlihey et al 14 evaluated 7 PPE ensembles designed for use with highly infectious diseases, using a human factors lens, and found problems with protection, comfort, and function of all ensembles testing during simulated care activities or doffing. This research highlights that existing pieces of PPE are imperfect and should be evaluated for performance before implementation. Although sophisticated, formal research methods can be used, a lot of information can be gained with fewer resources. For example, in the Chicago area, HCP used visual inspection and colored liquids (eg, Kool-Aid [The Kraft-Heinz Co]) to evaluate dermal coverage and fluid impermeability of PPE, respectively, to increase confidence in PPE selection decisions during EVD preparations. 5 Implementation of a systematic risk-based process for selection of a PPE ensemble to protect HCP from infectious diseases benefits from a team with expertise in occupational health, infectious diseases, human factors, and health care activities. The questions in Table 1 are intended to help ensure that PPE ensembles are evaluated holistically, but may not be complete. Ensemble selection and evaluation should be iterative, changing as new knowledge and perspectives are acquired through discussion and evaluation, and it is unlikely that there is a single best answer for every health care activity or health care setting. Therefore, it is important that the rationale used to select PPE ensembles be documented and transparent.

Substantively, Sen's notion of ""basic capabilities"" provides guidance since this formulation generally implies that societal efforts be made to bring each individual's health functioning as close as possible to (or above) a certain level of minimal normal functioning (in so far as an individual's circumstances permit). ""Basic capabilities"" include the ability to avoid escapable morbidity and premature and preventable mortality. Premature mortality implies placing special emphasis on efforts to avert deaths from preventable causes that do not allow individuals to live a life of normal length (eg, a child dying of AIDS). On the question of how much priority should be given to society's worst-off individuals, this view promotes the use of ""public reasoning"" to forge a compromise between strict maximisation and prioritisation. Fourth, this ""process aspect"" of freedom in the capability approach has implications for how healthrelated policy is made. It emphasises an individual's ability to participate in broad public-policy decisionmaking (eg, in prioritising between environmental and health care programmes) and in health policy decisionmaking (eg, in prioritising domains of health and health care for resource allocation). A democratic process can help define a comprehensive package of health benefits to which all should have equal access, and it can help prioritise different types of health care in efforts to maintain and improve health with the fewest possible resources. Such a process is not merely instrumental, however, since its justification lies in the concept that individuals should have the capability to participate in decision-making that affects them, such as about the goods and services that society will guarantee to them.",30.502979901440078,14.17287582502017

The UI population is often of lower socioeconomic status, which adds to the difficulties accessing health care. Given that most of the federal insurance plans are unavailable to the UI population, UIs are susceptible to higher out-of-pocket costs for care. In addition, because of undocumented status, they may not have sick leave days and may have difficulty negotiating time off from work to seek care. 8 Decreased proficiency in the language of the host country and fear of deportation may also present barriers to health care for UIs. Studies have shown that patients with limited English language proficiency (LEP) are at higher risk of poor health and have decreased access to health care. Patients who have LEP had increased difficulty in understanding their health status as well as accessing preventive services. 9 Fear of deportation may lead to the avoidance of seeking care and risk of severe health complications, 8 and this also affects health care for US-born children of UIs. In addition, shame and discrimination are common feelings experienced by the UI population and contribute to poor access to health care globally. 8 Many of these issues in health care are not unique to the United States.

The integration of thumb loops may be beneficial in securing complete protection of the wrist area. The WHO guidelines recommend against the use of tape to attach gloves to gowns/coveralls because this may increase the risk of tearing the gown/coverall and complicate the doffing procedure at a time when health care providers are potentially most vulnerable. 35, 37 The use of a waterproof or impermeable apron worn over the gown/coverall is recommended to provide further protection against infectious body fluids.

Those in opposition maintain that using taxpayer-funded services to support individuals who enter and remain in the United States illegally undermines the legal system. However, some scholars and legislators have argued that it is both unethical and impractical to deny access to health care services for illegal immigrants living in the United States. 16 They view health care as a basic human right and an obligation of a just society to provide health care for everyone. Leading medical professional societies such as the American Medical Association (AMA), American College of Physicians (ACP), the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), and the American Nurses Association (ANA) reaffirm the position that all individuals living in the United States, regardless of their immigration status, should have access to quality health care, including the opportunity to purchase insurance. These leaders maintain that providing this population with access to health insurance is an evidence-based way to reduce health care costs. [17] [18] [19] Another argument, from a cost perspective, is that many UIs will benefit from preventive care and early treatment of chronic diseases before they advance to lifethreatening and costly complications. 20, 21 Proponents of this strategy advocate for improving health literacy and vaccination rates, and offering health screenings to the UI population to try to prevent long-term adverse health outcomes and control cost. Moreover, UIs may harbor infections such as tuberculosis (TB), which, when undetected, can easily be transmitted to the general public, thus posing a public health risk. 22 In contrast, some have argued that treating UIs creates more expenditures for the United States while saving their countries of origin the costs of providing health care. 23 Furthermore, they argue that sharing inadequate health care resources with UIs will reduce the availability of those scarce resources for US citizens. In the last 2 decades, several states have attempted to advance legislation designed to deny UIs access to publicly funded health services. One such initiative was California's Proposition 187. This law, later deemed unconstitutional, required health care professionals to verify immigration status and report UIs to authorities. 24 In addition, some believe that continued unabated treatment of UIs is an incentive for persistent violation of the immigration laws and threatens national security in the post-9/11 era. 25 Proponents of this argument suggest that denying health care to UIs will discourage others from attempting to immigrate without proper documentation. 24 ",27.78910901101454,11.870432943932297

Health promotion is a guiding concept involving activities intended to enhance individual and community health and well-being (Box 2.8). It seeks to increase involvement and control by the individual and the community in their own health. It acts to improve health and social welfare, and to reduce specific determinants of diseases and risk factors that adversely affect the health, well-being, and productive capacities of an individual or society, setting targets based on the size of the problem but also the feasibility of successful intervention, in a cost-effective way. This can be through direct contact with the patient or risk group, or act indirectly through changes in the environment, legislation, or public policy. Control of AIDS relies on an array of interventions that promote change in sexual behavior and other contributory risks such as sharing of needles among drug users, screening of blood supply, safe hygienic practices in health care settings, and education of groups at risk such as teenagers, sex workers, migrant workers, and many others. Control of AIDS is also a clinical problem in that patients need antiretroviral therapy (ART), but this becomes a management and policy issue for making these drugs available and at an affordable price for the poor countries most affected.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently released guidance for nonpharmaceutical interventions during a pandemic that focuses on isolation of ill persons, voluntary quarantine of households with ill persons, and social distancing techniques (e.g., avoiding crowded settings, closing schools and child care centers) to limit exposure to ill persons (32) . However, these recommendations present special challenges for pregnant women. For example, pregnant women will need guidance on how to protect themselves from becoming infected (e.g., use of protective devices) if they are quarantined with or directly providing care for ill persons. Responsibilities of pregnant women as members of the workforce and as caregivers of their children and other family members may further complicate their adherence to public health recommendations. In addition, because healthy pregnant women will continue to require both outpatient prenatal care and inpatient delivery services during a pandemic, they might be more likely to be exposed to clinical settings where ill persons are receiving care. Given the potential risk to women in clinical settings, guidance will need to be developed regarding whether some routine prenatal care visits could be omitted. Healthcare facilities need to develop plans to ensure that pregnant women receive necessary care, but with minimal exposure to ill persons or their contacts. In addition, plans for care and delivery of pregnant women with confi rmed infl uenza or recent exposure must ensure that these women receive appropriate care without unduly exposing other healthy pregnant women and their infants to illness. An appropriate strategy to address these issues might include designating a location and staff for care of pregnant women and their newborns, separate from those used by patients with infl uenza. Another strategy could include developing an algorithm that triages pregnant patients on the basis of pregnancy stage and symptoms to ensure that pregnant women most in need of attention receive care, but avoid the risk of infl uenza exposure when that risk might be greater than the benefi t of care. Consideration of these strategies as part of overall community pandemic planning activities will be essential.",27.675507932436695,13.069042186276395

The government of Ontario declared a state of emergency on March 26, 2003 , and gave the authority to manage the outbreak to an emergency management instrument, the Provincial Operations Centre (POC). 8 Plans and protocols in the form of government ""directives"" were developed and sent to all Ontario health-care facilities on a regular basis. A scientific advisory committee to the POC drafted directives relating to infectious-diseases control. These highly detailed protocols were meant to be implemented immediately upon receipt. Since SARS was a novel pathogen, and there was no preconceived blueprint to deal with an infectious-diseases outbreak of this magnitude, outbreak-management protocols were developed in ""real time"". This meant the protocols could not be widely disseminated for discussion before release, and potential problems were often not detected until attempts were made by facilities to put them into practice.

A checklist of the level of fatigue accumulation developed by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare in Japan was used. Items of questionnaire were degree of a burden of working hours, work contents, eye strains, sleeping hours and situations of daily life. A description of entry by voluntary agreement was attached to questionnaires. We obtained approval from respondents because of submitting their questionnaires. Results: Responses were obtained from 120 people (75%). One hundred (83%) people for men and they had most 30 s in 59 people (49%). The number of people with 45 hours or more overtime work in month was 26 people (22%). The number of low risk group of fatigue accumulation was 53 people (44%) and highrisk group was 67 people (56%). The high risk group had a significantly higher percentage of 60 minutes or more of commuting time, seconded staff and 45 hours or more of overtime hours than low risk group. The high risk group had a significantly higher percentage of the burdens in working hours, amount of work, difficulty of work, time pressure on the appointed date of delivery, troubles after the delivery of the order, communication problems, uncomfortable setting, eyes or neck pain and fatigue. Conclusion: This study revealed that the level of fatigue accumulation of Japanese system engineers related their work environment. It was suggested that nurses in business setting need to approach the level of fatigue accumulation depending on characteristics of the work condition and environment of system engineers. Objectives: The aim of this longitudinal study is to evaluate wellness effects of a tailored problem solving process intervention program for health care employees. Methods: Socio demographic variables, work conditions, higher order goal facilitation as well as health related outcomes were assessed from the experimental group (N=461) as from the control group (N=246; Total: N=707) at a first measurement moment (T1) and a second T2 (3 years later).

A six-month study was conducted in March to September 2008. Literature reviewing from both national and international articles provided a conceptual framework and a process for developing risk communication model which was preparing, assessing and working with the community. Stakeholders were approached to involve in all steps of the study. The setting of the study was in Mugdhaharn Province, Thailand. The conceptual framework of the risk communication was developed from literature review comprising two major components: 1) risk assessment and 2) risk management. In relation to risk assessment, qualitative and quantitative techniques were applied. The target groups of risk assessment were people at risk of diabetes mellitus, family members, and related persons. The issues to be assessed covered risk factors, risk perception, strengths and weaknesses of self care and risk contexts. The results of the risk assessment led to the guidelines and strategies for coping with the risk factors. Regarding the risk management, the guideline and strategies were initially implemented by focusing on the engagement of the stakeholders which resulted in learning and better understanding among related people. The proposed model reflecting two significant components and its process was accepted by stakeholders and further implemented by local health care team in the study area.

Ma and colleagues 34 found that patients admitted with pneumonia coming from a nursing home are at high risk for viral pneumonia, which emphasizes the need for testing for respiratory viruses to allow for appropriate antibiotic stewardship. Others argue that geographic MDR prevalence is an important factor to take into account as one study found that using HCAP criteria to guide antibiotics led to overtreatment in areas with low MDR prevalence and undertreatment in areas of high MDR prevalence. 35, 36 Some elements of the HCAP criteria have been shown to be predictive of MDR organisms, particularly the receipt of intravenous antibiotics, as this was included in the more recent 2016 HAP guidelines. Although the HCAP classification may not identify individuals at high risk of MDR pathogens, patients with HCAP do have worse outcomes than those with community-acquired pneumonia and this is thought to be due to the higher prevalence of comorbidities in the HCAP population. Another group conducted a large study and found risk factors for MDR organisms including prior hospitalization, immunosuppression, previous use of antibiotics within the last 90 days, use of gastric acid-suppressive agents, tube feeding, and nonambulatory status. They suggested having 3 or more of those risk factors was when physicians should use broad-spectrum antibiotics. 37 Our knowledge in this field continues to develop and will, it is hoped, lead to better antibiotic selection and ultimately improved patient outcomes.

In this section, we propose a way forward, taking into account what China has already embarked on, what is feasible in view of existing institutional constraints, and supplemented by international experience. We take as a starting point that the government will continue to fund basic health care, mainly through SHI, with some direct funding to primary health-care facilities and that it is highly unlikely that the government will reverse course to directly pay hospitals from government budgets; and that the for-profi t private hospital market share will continue to grow as a result of government policies and increased demand from a population with rising income. Therefore, the question is how to introduce systemic changes that would make the best use of these conditions, bearing in mind ongoing reform eff orts described in table 1. Figure 1 shows the systemic framework followed in our proposal. We fi rst discuss what the government might do to improve the organisation of health-care delivery and then how fi nancing and provider payment incentives could be used to further enhance improvements of delivery. Figure 1 provides a schematic representation of the various policy levers that could aff ect health-care delivery decisions, either independently or in combination with one another. The organisational features of the health sector-such as ownership, governance, market competition, level of integration, and norms of practice-all aff ect health-care delivery practices. Additionally, how health care is fi nanced and how providers are paid substantially aff ects treatment decisions because they create diff erent incentives for providers. Regulation could also be used, but its eff ect is often dampened by poor enforcement.

In this Review, we discuss how China's health-care system would perform if hospital privatisation combined with hospital-centred fragmented delivery were to prevail-population health outcomes would suff er; health-care expenditures would escalate, with patients bearing increasing costs; and a two-tiered system would emerge in which access and quality of care are decided by ability to pay. We then propose an alternative pathway that includes the reform of public hospitals to pursue the public interest and be more accountable, with public hospitals as the benchmarks against which private hospitals would have to compete, with performance-based purchasing, and with population-based capitation payment to catalyse coordinated care.

Furthermore, the term ''nosocomial infections'' is replaced by ''health care-associated infections'' (HAIs), to reflect the changing patterns in health care delivery and difficulty in determining the geographic site of exposure to an infectious agent and/ or acquisition of infection. 2. The emergence of new pathogens (eg, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [SARS-CoV] associated with SARS avian influenza in humans), renewed concern for evolving known pathogens (eg, Clostridium difficile, noroviruses, communityassociated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [CA-MRSA]), development of new therapies (eg, gene therapy), and increasing concern for the threat of bioweapons attacks, necessitates addressing a broader scope of issues than in previous isolation guidelines. 3. The successful experience with Standard Precautions, first recommended in the 1996 guideline, has led to a reaffirmation of this approach as the foundation for preventing transmission of infectious agents in all health care settings. New additions to the recommendations for Standard Precautions are respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette and safe injection practices, including the use of a mask when performing certain highrisk, prolonged procedures involving spinal canal punctures (eg, myelography, epidural anesthesia). The need for a recommendation for respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette grew out of observations during the SARS outbreaks, when failure to implement simple source control measures with patients, visitors, and health care workers (HCWs) with respiratory symptoms may have contributed to SARS-CoV transmission. The recommended practices have a strong evidence base. The continued occurrence of outbreaks of hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses in ambulatory settings indicated a need to reiterate safe injection practice recommendations as part of Standard Precautions. The addition of a mask for certain spinal injections grew from recent evidence of an associated risk for developing meningitis caused by respiratory flora. 4. The accumulated evidence that environmental controls decrease the risk of life-threatening fungal infections in the most severely immunocompromised patients (ie, those undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [HSCT] ) led to the update on the components of the protective environment (PE). 5. Evidence that organizational characteristics (eg, nurse staffing levels and composition, establishment of a safety culture) influence HCWs' adherence to recommended infection control practices, and thus are important factors in preventing transmission of infectious agents, led to a new emphasis and recommendations for administrative involvement in the development and support of infection control programs. 6. Continued increase in the incidence of HAIs caused by multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) in all health care settings and the expanded body of knowledge concerning prevention of transmission of MDROs created a need for more specific recommendations for surveillance and control of these pathogens that would be practical and effective in various types of health care settings.",27.03670385025173,12.430806389349502

Despite these risks, compliance with protective equipment has remained suboptimal. 1 The safety of emergency department (ED) personnel, often the first to encounter an ill patient, is an important area to target for improvement. The risk factors for those individuals include the emergent nature of the care provided and the unknown circumstances that initially led to the patient's utilization of health care. 2 Despite the emphasis on standard precautions training for health care workers (HCWs), the consistent use of personal protective equipment (PPE) remains poor. 3, 4 Various descriptions and analyses of the 2002-2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak reported lack of basic preemptive infection prevention and control strategies. As the outbreak grew, attention was paid to use of protective equipment, including respiratory protection, as symptomatic patients were identified. The experiences of HCWs confronted with suspected or confirmed SARS cases revealed an often inadequate and incorrect use of PPE. 5, 6 A fundamental flaw in the preventive process seemed to involve failure to recognize quickly the key signs, symptoms, or risks that might have led to the early implementation of protective equipment. Although there is little research concerning changing HCW behavior when providing care for patients with respiratory illness, there was some evidence from the SARS outbreak that pointed toward the benefits of training programs and availability of adequate PPE. 7 The workplace practices identified as problematic during the SARS epidemic mirror those identified by Jagger et al at the International Healthcare Worker Safety Center of the University of Virginia. Jagger et al's work has focused on injuries and exposures involving blood and body fluid exposures among HCWs. In 2001, as part of the EPINet Surveillance Program, 8 a total of 463 blood-body-fluid exposures were reported from 49 participating health care facilities. Of these exposures, over 13% occurred in the ED. Less than 10% of the exposed HCWs reported wearing appropriate eye protection, and fewer than 20% reported wearing some sort of mask or other facial barrier. 9 Clearly, the need still exists for effective training techniques to promote the use of PPE as a way to minimize such workplace exposures. Traditional infection prevention and control training for HCWs has involved a review of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) bloodborne pathogens training, 10 as outlined in the current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) isolation guidelines, 11 with emphasis on transmission-based precautions. When we conducted an informal telephone interview with infection control professionals (ICPs) from 10 US hospitals chosen at random, results indicated that this type of training involved a classroom setting (80%) and/or written handouts (20%). A pretest and posttest process typically assessed competency.

So, for example, if an individual had a prodromal disease state duration of 10 days, then the probability of seeking care at the instant of entering the disease state would be zero, and the instantaneous probability of seeking care would increase linearly to 0.2 at ten days, with a mean time to seeking care of 6.7 days. 1 This approach to modeling visits effectively limits individuals to a single visit in each disease state.

Numerous factors must be considered when a minor patient requests confidential health care, including the best interest of the patient, future patient attitudes toward health care, concerns of the parents, federal and state laws, and public health issues. [59] [60] [61] Physician attitudes about issues of adolescent confidentiality show considerable variation in different health care settings. 62, 63 For minors who do not meet criteria for emancipation or ''mature minor'' status and whose conditions do not receive statutory confidentiality protection, issues of confidentiality can be difficult. For example, parents may request health information about their child, but the minor patient may, for a variety of reasons, request that the information not be disclosed to them. Ideally, education of minor patients about the importance of parental involvement in their health care may bridge the gap between the parties. In most such cases, minor patients should be encouraged to be open about health care decisions with their parents. If consent cannot be obtained from the minor patient, the issue of disclosure to parents becomes more controversial. Some argue that parents have a right to receive health information about their dependent children. Others believe that minor patients have the same rights of privacy and confidentiality about health care as adults, particularly because adolescent minors are more likely to seek health care when confidentiality is ensured. 64, 65 In general, decisions about disclosure without consent of a minor patient should be made in the best interests of the patient and his or her parents, with careful consideration of state and federal law.",25.144836205045976,11.59453282975178

Inequity is usually described in economic terms, most frequently as wealth quintiles, based on possessions owned by the household. 71 This is a convenient approach that can be applied to information such as the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data to analyse income or consumption. In many settings, wealth quintiles eff ectively indicate other inequities within a society. They draw attention to diff erences in key markers of access and outcome between those who do and do not have material assets, which provide a mechanism to examine diff erences between countries in terms of how these assets are distributed. Some specifi c measures of inequalities in wealth have been developed, such as the Gini coeffi cient which measures the extent to which distribution of wealth is uneven. Other measures are the ratio of the incomes of the richest 10% or 20% of the population compared with the poorest 10% or 20%. 72 The use of wealth quintiles as a means to measure equity has featured explicitly in only one MDG target, MDG 1 target 1A, for which indicators include measurement of a poverty gap ratio (between lowest and highest wealth quintiles) and the share of the poorest quintile in national consumption. However, wealth quintiles have been used extensively in analyses of healthrelated MDGs undertaken by the World Bank, UNICEF, and others, 73,74 and very recently in work into the distribution of education enrolment rates. 9 But wealth, income, or consumption are not the only features of inequity. Factors such as geography and ethnic origin might be more important in identifi cation of inequities, both in access and outcome of health interventions. 75 In rural Papua New Guinea and Ethiopia, the most important determinant of access to health care, and health outcomes, may be geography. Asset indices do not always predict health outcomes. In some settings, geography, ethnic origin, or other factors might be more dominant factors. But the absence of measures that capture these other factors across diff erent societies means that these features of inequity in distribution are overlooked.",26.294303843491917,13.74971582312363

High risk is not the same as HTR, although there appears to be substantial overlap; whereas not all at high risk are hard-to-reach, many in the HTR population are at high risk. While no uniform definition of HTR populations exists, HTR populations have typically been defined from the perspective of linkage with the health care system, i.e., persons who do not seek treatment in traditional care settings such as provider offices or clinics. The size of hard-to-reach populations, whereas hard to estimate, is not trivial; some examples of constituent groups are as follows: 11.5-12 million undocumented immigrants nationwide, 18 1.5 million injection drug users in 96 large U.S. metropolitan areas 19 and 744,000 homeless persons nationwide, 20 as well as a proportion of the elderly and minorities. Overall, the percentage of U.S. residents at high risk for influenza but who are not immunized has been estimated to be as high as 65%. 3 Failure to be immunized is related to lack of health insurance and to having a regular provider; 21 this may be a particular concern for specific HTR groups. For example, mobile elderly differ from the majority of the other population groups in that they are covered by Medicare and generally frequent a health care provider. Thus, whereas the elderly as a high-risk group may differ from other groups in terms of access to health care as an entitlement, a proportion is not connected to care and is therefore HTR. The lack of a regular health care provider is correlated with race and ethnicity. 7 While 80% of White adults have a primary care provider, the percentage is closer to 70% for Asian-Americans and Blacks, and only 57% for Hispanics. 22 As reviewed elsewhere, other barriers to accessing care include culturally derived attitudes and belief systems, negative experiences with past treatment, language and other barriers in patient-provider relationships, and legal status (e.g., undocumented immigrants). [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] Some groups harbor substantial myths about and distrust of the medical system; previous research has shown that their attitudes appear to be strong predictors of being immunized. 28 VLAHOV ET AL. 616",26.171084083648907,12.706830258306201

What does this week mean for the future of infection prevention and patient safety in emerging health care systems? How will infection prevention professionals and organizations participate in shaping future health care systems? 3 Historically, IPC has provided a systematic, unbiased method for identifying infections and infectious risks for patients and health care workers. In 1986, the year of the first ''Infection Control Week,'' most acute care occurred in hospitals, and although hospital IPC programs included ''prevention'' as a function of the program, the emphasis was on surveillance, with most of the program resources devoted to this area. During the 1980s, most health care involving invasive procedures or devices was provided in acute care facilities, HAI rates were not shared with persons or agencies outside of the hospital, and in most cases IPC was performed by designated ICPs, not multidisciplinary teams. At that time, bioterrorism belonged in science fiction, AIDS was an ''emerging disease,'' methicillin-resistant Staphyloccocus aureus was starting to migrate from academic tertiary care centers to mainstream community hospitals, and health care workers practiced using information from specialized disciplines. 4 Health care was evolving from a reliance on structures and processes that were more appropriate for organizations with predictable, discreet knowledge areas to the use of processes for complex adaptive system in which services and departments built on separate and unique knowledge areas were integrated and interactive. This newer environment was also one in which performance improvement was mandated and cost reductions were expected. 5 In 2009, complex, invasive health care procedures and technologies are not limited to acute care facilities, but occur in a variety of settings, including long-term care, ambulatory care, and patient homes. There are also discussions about providing some types of postoperative care at hotels located near surgery centers. IPs are challenged to institute IPC programs in these new practice settings but often lack a sufficient evidence editorial base to support their recommendations. In many nonacute care settings, infection criteria are not established, infections are not investigated, antibiotics are prescribed empirically, and denominators are not standardized. In addition, IPC staff are expected to provide strategies to control emerging biological challenges, such as multidrug-resistant organisms, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and such infections as pandemic influenza. IPs are key leaders in the application of intervention bundles that when instituted with other multidisciplinary health care workers, synergistically produce unexpected and welcome improvements in outcomes for patients with a central vascular line or on a ventilator. Furthermore, today there is a growing awareness that although health care involves complex, sophisticated, highly technical processes and devices, the basics still count, and isolated independent actions can impact other processes and parts within health care systems. There is an appreciation of the fact that successful outcomes require synergy among elements of care, including the mechanical-physical, psychological, social, emotional, and spiritual aspects.",27.825542241763046,12.184723042101501

Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen that can persist in relatively harsh environments, frequently has been associated with HAIs and outbreaks in NICUs.

The estimation strategy for risk factors involved a counterfactual approach that quantifies the level of exposure to the risk factor in a population and the relative risk of LRI given exposure. Typically, the exposure in a population is modelled on the basis of surveys and scientific literature and the risk of LRI is derived from published metaanalyses. Childhood growth failure risks were estimated as a continuous exposure of the height or weight Z scores. Likewise, air pollution was considered a continuous exposure of the amount of fine particulate matter smaller than 2·5 μm in diameter. Other risk factors, such as low vaccine coverage, are modelled when the exposure is a population prevalence of being exposed to that risk factor (eg, the population prevalence of being unvaccinated for low vaccine coverage). Descriptions of the riskfactor exposure models and relative risks are provided in the appendix (pp 13-66). Risk factors in GBD are part of a comparative risk assessment framework and are modelled independently. 8 Therefore, in our study, the burden associated with each risk factor can be considered as the LRI mortality that could be averted if exposure to that risk factor was eliminated. Since they were modelled independently, our analysis does not quantify the potential impact of combined interventions and combining riskfactor burden by summing risk factors is not appropriate and could lead to greater attribution than disease burden.",23.88022370826254,12.761899647035872

It is based on using fluorescent labelled probes to detect, confirm, and quantify the PCR products as they are being generated in real time. The real time PCR, which has three novel features as temperature cycling occurs considerable faster than in standard PCR assays, hybridization of specific DNA probes occurs continuously during the amplification reaction and a fluorescent dye is coupled to the probe and fluoresces only when hybridization takes place. Lack of post PCR processing of amplified products makes this technique convenient. The production of amplified products is observed automatically by real time monitoring of fluorescence. Depending on the amount of target gene, a small signal can be produced within 30-45 min. Since the tubes do not have to be opened at the time of reaction, the risk of carry over contamination gets considerably reduced. In recent years, some commercial automated real-time PCR systems have been available (Light Cycler & TaqMan). In these systems, such as the Light Cycler TM and the Smart Cycler Ò , these systems perform the real-time fluorescence monitoring by using fluorescent dyes such as SYBR-Green I, which binds non-specifically to double-stranded DNA generated during the PCR amplification.

[50] [51] [52] [53] All these pathogens have been demonstrated to persist in the environment for days (in some cases months), frequently contaminate the environmental surfaces in rooms of colonized or infected patients, transiently colonize the hands of health care personnel, be transmitted by health care personnel, and cause outbreaks in which environmental transmission was deemed to play a role. Importantly, a study by Stiefel and colleagues 54 demonstrated that contact with the environment was just as likely to contaminate the hands of health care personnel as was direct contact with patients. Further, admission to a room in which the previous patient had been colonized or infected with MRSA, VRE, Acinetobacter or C difficile has been shown to be a risk factor for newly admitted patients to develop colonization or infection. [55] [56] [57] Improving room cleaning and disinfection and demonstrating the effectiveness of surface decontamination in reducing health care-associated infections Investigators have reported that intervention programs aimed at improving surface cleaning and disinfection reduced HAIs. 58 Such interventions have generally included multiple activities: disinfectant product substitutions and interventions to improve the effectiveness of cleaning and disinfection (eg, improved housekeeper education, monitoring the thoroughness of cleaning [eg, by use of ATP assays or fluorescent dyes] with feedback of performance to the environmental service workers, and/or use of cleaning checklists). [58] [59] [60] [61] Health care facilities must also allow adequate time for room processing to ensure adherence to all steps recommended by institutional policies and professional organization guidelines. The authors have found that collaboration between infection prevention and environmental services staff, nursing, and management is critical to an effective environmental cleaning program. This collaboration includes ensuring that environmental services staff recognize the significance and relationship of adhering to proper work procedures to reduction of microbial contamination. The assignment of cleaning responsibility (eg, medical equipment to be cleaned by nursing; environmental surfaces to be cleaned by environmental service) is also important to ensure all objects and surfaces in a patient room are decontaminated, especially the surfaces of medical equipment (eg, cardiac monitors). Improved environmental cleaning has been demonstrated to reduce the environmental contamination with VRE, 61 MRSA, 62 and C difficile. 63 Further, all studies have only focused improvement on a limited number of high-risk objects.

Before the Ebola-virus-disease epidemic, the formal public sector was the most common source of care for febrile illness in children (57%), with the most common alternatives being traditional healers (13%) and private pharmacies (8%). 8 The two major avenues for delivering life-saving medicine to patients with malaria-public health facilities and community health workers-have been substantially compromised by the Ebola-virusdisease epidemic. Eff orts to reinforce malaria care delivery in Guinea should be focused on reconnecting health-care workers and health facilities with the communities they serve and whose trust they need to regain. Similarly, community health workers who are currently inactive or have left their unpaid malaria case management duties to be paid Ebola-virus-disease contact tracers should be incentivised and provided the means to continue safely delivering malaria care in the community even as they continue their Ebola-virusdiseases-related activities. These interventions cannot wait until the last case of Ebola virus disease. Already, a substantial number of malaria cases have gone untreated or inappropriately treated. Although subject to much uncertainty, according to the estimations from expert opinion surveys the risk of an untreated and uncomplicated malaria case progressing to severe malaria ranges from 3% to 30% (depending on age and malaria endemicity) and then dying from severe malaria ranges from 45% to 73%. 13 Assuming the estimated 74 000 malaria cases not receiving malaria care at health facilities due to the Ebola-virus-disease epidemic (likely to be an underestimate because of the incompleteness of the weekly surveillance system) received no care or inappropriate care outside the formal health sector, excess malaria deaths are likely to greatly exceed the number of deaths from Ebola virus disease, consistent with fi ndings from recent mathematical models. 14 Moreover, untreated malaria cases are likely to have contributed to an excess number of febrile episodes in the community and a greater number of suspected cases of Ebola virus disease requiring triage and isolation at over-burdened transit centres and Ebola treatment centres where uninfected people might have been exposed to Ebola virus disease. Malaria control eff orts and malaria care delivery must be sustained and even heightened during an Ebola-virus-disease epidemic. ",31.205308026061246,16.72342733054859

But there is far more to develop to benefit significantly from the amount of available data. Progress has been fairly slow in general and mostly due to the fragmentation or nonexistence of data repositories. The contribution of major players in the field of technology (including the GAFA) may help fasten this process. Recently Catalia Health developed a humanoid robot named Mabu, a personal health-care assistant for patients suffering from congestive heart failure. Beside doing an accurate follow-up of medication compliance, it supports an adaptive conversation with the patients regarding the overall health status. Such systematic follow-up in intensive care unit, however, combining conversation with the medical personnel should enable them to better track and reduce the transmission of infections (Fig. 5) . The University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics have used machine learning to reduce surgical site infections by 74% over the past 3 years. Using DASH analytics systems, the hospitals is using the high-definition care platform (HDCP), which integrates with the hospital's electronic health records to assess the risk for individual patients. Focusing on surgery-derived infections, the system uses the WHO surgical safety checklist. The checklist comprises three phases of the surgery: (1) before the induction of anesthesia, (2) before the first incision of the skin, and (3) before the patient leaves the operating room. This should ensure the correct care protocol has been followed. Once this data and that from the existing electronic health records is collected the DASH system inputs it all into a prediction model and identified potential risks. This enables us to provide costly treatments only to patients who need them. This is a precision medicine approach. In another hospital, a new algorithm could predict a patient's risk of contracting Clostridium difficile, a life-threatening nosocomial infection. Every year in the United States, >400,000 people contract a C. difficile infection following hospitalization and about 30,000 of them will die because of the infection. Medical doctors and computer scientist from the Massachusetts General Hospital worked together to use AI for prediction. Using a dataset from >300,000 patients admitted and the knowledge that C. difficile spreads through physical contacts, every possible interaction between patients was taken into account when developing the algorithm. Another tool developed by Royal Phillips (Connected Care) enables to reduce by 87% the time for identification of nosocomial infection in hospitals, suggesting that wider utilization of such application could significantly reduce hospital-acquired morbidity and mortality.",28.58120617652647,13.088874205794427

Recent data from China, by Chang et al, revealed the greatest risk of COVID-19 exposure to health care workers during early stages of the pandemic when testing was not yet widely available. 61 In a JAMA report published from Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan, 29.3% (40 of 138) of COVID-19 infected patients were health care workers who presumably had hospital-acquired infections. 27 Among 493 health care workers caring for hospitalized patients, 10/493 health care workers became infected with COVID-19; all 10 were unprotected health care workers (no mask) caring for patients on medical wards with a low risk of exposure (no known or suspected COVID-19 patients). In contrast, none of the 278 protected health care workers (N95 mask) caring for high risk patients (known or suspected COVID-19) became infected (aOR 464.82; 95% CI: 97.73 to infinite). 62 One study, evaluating health care worker exposure in the care of one COVID-19 positive patient, revealed that none of 41 health care workers (surgical masks only) developed infection despite absence of N95 mask, although studies evaluating health care workers in context of larger cohorts of COVID-19 positive patients are not yet available. 63 The decision to extend the recommendation to lower GI procedures is based on evidence of possible aerosolization during colonoscopy especially during the insertion and removal of instruments through the biopsy channel. 53 and the uncertain risks associated with evidence of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in fecal samples.

This will be done by introducing two translations of the word threat in Dutch: dreiging and bedreiging. They mark a difference that does not exist in the same way in English. Bedreiging is used if an actor is threatening to act in a certain way, e.g. with using violence. Threat as bedreiging looks at a situation from the perspective of the subject making a threat. Dreiging on the other hand focuses at the perspective of the person or group that is or feels threatened. The dreiging perspective of threat does not have to coincide with that of bedreiging. Someone can feel threatened while in fact there is no real threat, because no one has the intention to commit an action against this person. The reverse is also possible: someone does not feel threatened, while in fact a real threat exists, because an actor has the intention to commit a crime or a terrorist action. There are indications that the aspect of dreiging is most influential in the recent debates on biosecurity. Because of that the chance exists that in declaring an activity as dual use an emphasis is laid on the dual use potentiality and that there is an underestimation of the aspect of intentionality (bedreiging).",15.16132986131278,7.760204277972763

Of course, it is worth emphasizing that there is still large uncertainty about the combined impact of our available interventions on the spread of COVID-19. The speed with which COVID-19 initially overwhelmed health systems in many countries, as well as the ability of several countries, to drive cases down successfully, suggests that the current best approach is to implement all feasible interventions against COVID-19 to suppress the disease. As the situation is monitored, it will become clear if we can accomplish elimination. If this is unlikely, and we are in a situation where interventions cannot be sustained long enough to prevent a resurgent epidemic, some interventions should be relaxed.

Unfortunately, data on health care capacity is rel atively scarce and we have to rely on data from 2017,2018 or even older. Data availability is even worse for critical care beds, on which we rely on multicountry data from 2010. Remuzzi & Remuzzi report ICU capacity of 5200 beds for Italy as a whole, which is lower than the 7550 critical care beds reported by Rhodes et al. [1, 5] . It is likely that other EU countries have downsized their critical bed capacity too. In terms of curative beds per 100 000 population as reported by Eurostat, for most countries (all except Ireland, Bulgaria, Poland and Romania), we observed a downward trend in the past 10 years. Moreover, hospital capacity strain was recently found to be associated with increased mortality and decreased health outcomes [10] . Note that if we would assume the same extent of downsizing in Italy and other EU countries, our relative comparisons would not change. Note that we compare these countries by their base capacity, while clearly many countries have expanded their base capacity to differing degrees (eg, additional beds, mobilizing volunteers or retired Physicians x critical care beds (Physicians + nurses) x critical care beds health care workers). We therefore will track at which relative pressure individual countries can no langer handle the volume of critical patients and which pressure on their base capacity they experience at the peak. Note also that we do not account for health care workers' incapacitation from COVID-19 or other causes as the epidemic unfolds. Our analysis shows that many European countries are soon to be confronted with a health care pressure that will exceed current healthcare capacity. Based on the intensity-approach and the composite measures, we believe that the healthcare pressure in Spain is already at very high levels. For The Netherlands and France the pressure on healthcare systems will soon reach Italy's levels. Where this is not yet done, policymakers should urgently expand their health care capacities to avoid pressure as experienced in Italy. Our analysis informs policy makers on how far their country is removed from an overloaded healthcare system. As such, this information can be useful to plan ahead in order to relieve pressure on their national healthcare system. Moreover, the evolving healthcare pressure, especially the pressure experienced by each country at the peak, will be useful to plan future outbreaks and a timely expansion of health care capacity.",22.041737003385247,11.15292645408782

Based on the simulation results, we recommend the following: (i) decrease the rate of patient encounter per frontline health care worker, e.g., maximum of three encounters per hour in a 12-hour work shift duration; (ii) decrease the interaction time between the frontline health care worker and the patients, e.g., less than 40 minutes for the whole day; (iii) increase the clean and safe space for social distancing, e.g., maximum of 10% crowd density, and if possible, implement compartmentalization of patients; and/or (iv) provide effective protective gears and facilities, e.g., 95% effective, that the frontline health care workers can use during their shift.

Furthermore, countries with residual circulating virus would have to be completely isolated to avoid reintroduction. Still, prolonged intensive control could be a means to gain time until the development and large-scale availability of a vaccine. However, the amount of time this will take is unpredictable. An alternative approach is to develop herd immunity through natural infection while keeping the number of cases within the limits of the health care system. Until recently, the UK has advocated this approach, 4 but it was heavily criticized for obvious reasons: it will be practically impossible to perfectly tune actual interventions without exceeding or undershooting health care capacity.

The strengthened community level surveillance and verbal autopsy to detect unusual deaths can be a good approach to detect lower level health events and provide timely response [26] .
