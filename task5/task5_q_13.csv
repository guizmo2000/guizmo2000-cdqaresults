Theoretically, meticulous provision of contact precautions (hand washing, the use of gloves and a gown along with protection against mucus membrane (eyes, nose, and mouth) exposure, and proper donning and doffing of all personal protective equipment (PPE)) should be sufficient to prevent nosocomial EBOV transmission. In nonclimate-controlled West African Ebola treatment facilities (Fig. 1) , the heat and humidity prevent optimal functioning of medical masks and some duckbill N-95 respirators (humidity and sweat cause them to sag and collapse). Tight fitting goggles often fog, reducing visibility. Face shields afford improved visibility but must provide sufficient coverage without risk of splash-related facial exposure. Half-sphere, semi-rigid respirators tend to be more resistant to moisture-related collapse and deformation. However, concern about the high mortality of EVD has led to IPC and PPE choices in the field that sometimes do not follow traditional infection control recommendations or guidance from international technical organizations. This has often resulted in PPE that cannot be safely tolerated by healthcare personnel for more than 45-60 min due to excessive heat and humidity [21] , risking syncope, potentially dangerous behaviour (e.g., adjusting fogged facial protection with soiled gloves), and inability to safely perform tasks such as insertion of intravenous catheters. In West Africa, Ebola virus transmission likely also occurs among healthcare personnel during informal healthcare provision in the community to patients or colleagues, without appropriate infection prevention and control practice [22, 23] . Nosocomial EBOV transmission in Spain [24, 25] and the USA [26] similarly reinforces the importance of rigorous Ebola IPC practices and healthcare personnel training, irrespective of the healthcare system [27, 28] .

Infectious disease surveillance should enable (i) the timely detection of outbreaks, (ii) the quantification of health problems, (iii) the identification of subpopulations at risk, and (iv) the assessment of temporal trends including the impact of control strategies [3, 4] . National surveillance systems typically collect data from patients seeking care at sentinel hospitals or other healthcare facilities and can provide useful information for public health purposes. However, hospital-based surveillance generally underestimates disease burden since only a proportion of cases visit a hospital for care [5] . Low case detection may also undermine the value of hospital-based surveillance for outbreak detection.

In particular, sex, socioeconomic status, or distance can affect healthcare seeking at hospitals, especially where access to care is limited [6] [7] [8] [9] . Surveillance evaluation guidelines, such as those established by the US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, list sensitivity and representativeness among the attributes that a public health surveillance system should possess and that require assessment [10, 11] .

Thus, vaccinating patients with chronic illnesses may prove challenging and in the absent of a readily available vaccine, however, results from clinical trials would provide some insight into the matter. The potential impact of vaccines in the control of MERS will remain unknown until the vaccines under study move beyond the preclinical stage and into clinical trials. Considering that MERS is a continuing threat among the Gulf countries, the use of the Infection Prevention & Control Manual for GCC countries aids in the implementation of the first and second vaccination strategies across these countries in the Middle East, if HCW vaccination were to be undertaken. Again, before implementation, without an available vaccine for MERS to study, cost-effectiveness remains unknown.

Therefore, pandemic strains with R 0 , 3.6 could be controlled, but this would require a drug stockpile of 56 doses per member of the population for only 8 wk of protection, which would likely not be long enough and is currently unfeasible. However, even in circumstances when an outbreak is not controlled, the impact of public health interventions that reduce R E 0 would still be substantial. Using a very simple model of disease spread, a precise relationship between IAR and R E 0 can be defined (see Figure S3 ). For high values of R E 0 , IAR is close to one, but for values of R E 0 closer to one, IAR is much lower. Any policies that significantly reduce infectivity and/or susceptibility, over and above what would be the natural reaction of the population, will have a similar effect.

However, most countries lack regulatory frameworks that permit the use of unapproved interventions on humans outside of systematic research conditions (including in ""compassionate use"" circumstances) and lack reciprocal recognition agreements with major regulatory agencies, such as the US FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA), both of which permit use of such interventions in prescribed circumstances. Such regulatory deficits could stymie time-sensitive efforts to contain public health threats when no efficacious curative, therapeutic, or preventive interventions exist to counter the threat in question. When no other efficacious intervention exists, national authorities globally have an ethical duty to create enabling regulatory frameworks to facilitate the accelerated provision of unapproved investigational interventions in humanitarian contexts to those who may derive benefit therefrom. In settings in which national authorities lack the capacity to devise and enforce such mechanisms, regional structures, such as the African Union (AU), should take an early lead in devising model regulatory templates for countries to adopt. A pledge by African authorities at a meeting of the WHO-led African Vaccine Regulatory Forum (AVAREF) in Pretoria, South Africa, to establish a collaborative mechanism for fast tracking approvals for clinical trials and registration of Ebola-related products in affected countries [8] is thus welcome. The utility of prospectively having such mechanisms in place in the context of public health emergencies is evident in the US, which offers a range of existing regulatory access pathways, including under the country's medical countermeasure development, preparedness, and response initiative. Some of these regulatory mechanisms are now being postulated and utilised to facilitate time-sensitive access to investigational interventions in Ebola-affected countries. These include (a) the use of unapproved drugs through the Emergency Use Investigational New Drug regulatory pathway and the Emergency Use Authorisation regulatory pathway, (b) the use of approved drugs for unindicated uses, (c) the partial lifting of suspended or halted clinical trials involving investigational drugs, and (d) the approval of new interventions when human efficacy studies are not ethical or feasible.

By contrast, calls for unity over invasions (e.g. [113] ) have so far largely failed to produce effective agencies. There is, for example, no equivalent to public health organizations such as US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Public Health Agency of Canada and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control that has prime responsibility for the detection and control of invasive species. This contrast is probably due to a number of reasons, including the local, regional or national (versus international) scope of many invasions, the often long time lag between biological invasions and detected impacts, and the generally slower nature of invasions, which together result in fractionated efforts that may be ineffective. Responsibilities for coordinating responses to EIDs of public health significance always lie with public health organizations, but responsibilities for responding to invasive species vary depending on the impact or location of the invasive species and may be organizations responsible for agriculture, fisheries, environment, natural resources, transport or local government entities [114] . 4) .

Flaviviruses are transmitted among a wide variety of mammalian and avian hosts, with sylvatic cycles that perpetuate new outbreaks through spillover into humans and hinder disease prevention and control efforts. Migratory birds are hypothesized to have spread WNV in temperate areas of the Old and New World, and human WNV outbreaks in North America have been associated with corresponding WNV outbreaks in wild birds 2, 3 . Flaviviruses such as yellow fever virus (YFV) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) have well-recognized sylvatic cycles that maintain viral circulation in wild reservoirs between outbreaks in human populations 4 . Therefore, improved understanding of the potential wildlife host involvement in the transmission of emerging flaviviruses is essential. For instance, data about the transmission of ZIKV in South American wildlife are critical to inform on maintenance of the virus in the region, as sylvatic hosts can serve as a source of recurring epidemics and impede efforts for long-term disease prevention 5 .",36.08777377795956,13.953841842483715

First, prevention and control efforts should target individuals with the highest likelihood of transmitting the disease. Our results justify the interventions directed towards investigating and monitoring the introduction and subsequent spread of diseases by highly infectious super-spreaders. To mitigate the super-spreading of the MERS among people in homes and in communities, home care for patients with mild symptoms should be provided under close medical observation, after patients and family caregivers must have received appropriate training on personal hygiene, basic infection prevention, and control measures. However, patients with worsening conditions should seek prompt medical attention following a monitor of their health status for 14 days after the exposure event 41, 42 . Secondly, our analysis reveals that relatively large tertiary hospitals have higher rates of MERS transmission than small community hospitals, because, in addition to poor disease control facilities, they typically have large numbers of patients and visitors who are engaged in doctor shopping 43, 44 . Therefore, it is necessary to put effective quarantine and adequate facility ventilation on the agenda. Furthermore, to improve the response activities of hospital staff in infection prevention and control, timely education and training must be provided 43 . It is also necessary that, regardless of the diagnosis, healthcare facilities should always share essential information in a timely manner with other facilities at the early stage of the outbreak. Finally, until more is understood about MERS, the government should provide reliable and timely information to the public, and establish an efficient disease-control system as preventive measures against the initial spread of MERS.",48.44634238510169,20.235634154777653

A meager understanding of the natural history of the virus hinders the estimation of transmission and severity parameters in real time. Estimating the transmission potential of an emerging infection early on is important as it would help determine whether control measures should be varied and whether more stringent measures are required to control or mitigate an outbreak. 24, 25 In several publications, the transmissibility and natural history of influenza have been estimated at the household, school, or community level using observational data. 26, 27 However, data are typically unavailable or incomplete during the early stages of an outbreak resulting from a novel influenza virus. The disease severity, which is another important measure, is commonly estimated based on case fatality, hospitalization rates, and clinical attack rates. Approximations of case fatality and hospitalization rates could be underestimated due to subclinical and asymptomatic cases. Although clinical attack rates could be estimated at the community level, data on laboratory-diagnosed cases might be delayed. Nevertheless, studies conducted during the 2009 pandemic suggested that estimates of severity and transmissibility improved as the pandemic progressed. 27, 28 Data Traditional systems for monitoring ILI and acute respiratory tract infections rely on reports from general practices, family doctor clinics, diagnostic test laboratories, and public health departments for influenza surveillance. 3, 4, 14 There is typically 1-2 week lag(s) in the publishing of reports, and reported cases are sometimes retrospectively adjusted.

Further, there are limits to how quickly diagnostic information about an emerging infection can be obtained and disseminated to health care providers. This is not the first model to consider the effect of changes in the removal rate (e.g., [14, 15] ).

Our model also more realistically represents the ramping up of intervention in contrast to models that simply have ''before control'' and ''after control'' regimes (e.g., [13] ). We showed that the final outbreak size decreases rapidly with a modest investment in learning. We also found strong evidence of learning in data from the 2003 outbreak of SARS in Singapore. Public health interventions for SARS include encouragement to report to hospital rapidly after the onset of clinical symptoms, contact tracing for confirmed and suspected cases, and quarantine, monitoring, and restricting the travel of contacts [25, 30] .

The threat of an emerging public health event is especially burdening for the executive branch of the local state. Decision-makers are pressured to act early, at best before the expected cascading of an infection gets out of control. This expectation makes it tempting to base a decision on the syndromic signals as they are readily available and -through the included mapping tool -often clearly localized. While those signals are explicitly handled as an additional but clearly undiagnosed source of information among epidemiologists and public health experts, for the executive branch they have a tempting appeal of providing a near real-time situational awareness and as such an actionable grasp on the emerging public health event. Importantly, using ESSENCE as a base for decision-making approaches the signal as if it was an authoritative medical fact instead of just an indicator for the clustering of certain syndromes. The danger of misinterpretation as the algorithmically generated knowledge travels contexts may result in wrongly employed public health interventions with negative social effects. Besides the problem of false positives prevalent to those systems (Fearnley 2008) the system always suggests a spatialized source of the problem that may or may not be medically justified.

The all-hazards approach is viewed as essential for public health systemlevel readiness, enabling effective and efficient preparedness that accounts for the difficulty in predicting the type and severity of events [14, 22, 23] . The conventional cycle of emergency management includes four phases which are (1) prevention/mitigation, (2) preparedness, (3) response and (4) recovery; public health agency activities relate to all four phases [24] . In this study, we focus on preparedness as upstream activities and actions that promote enhanced public health system capacity and resilience throughout all four phases. It is important to note that in Canada, PHEP addresses population-level preparedness, distinct from clinical care and health care facility preparedness. Communication and integration of preparedness activities between sectors like health care, government and the community is, however, often a responsibility of public health agencies. Relevant levels of the public health system in Canada are local or regional (varies by province/territory), provincial/territorial, and federal.

The burden of morbidity and mortality from emergencies and disasters can be severe, resulting in public health systems investing substantial time and resources toward preparedness [1] . The public health system is the lead in responding to outbreaks and in minimizing the impact of diverse emergencies on health [2, 3] . Public health sector activities in infectious disease emergencies include leading other emergency management organizations during outbreaks, conducting surveillance and investigation, implementing control measures, developing guidance for health-care practitioners, and communicating risks [3] . In addition, public health is the lead sector in preparing for the population health effects of non-infectious events incited by natural or anthropogenic hazards. Emergency preparedness levels have been a concern globally in past emergencies; for example, Canada's response to the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak raised a number of issues: lack of surge capacity in the clinical and public health systems, difficulties with timely access to laboratory testing and results, and weak links between public health and the health care system were clear gaps in preparedness [3] . Recognizing complex and system-level challenges that affect emergency preparedness efforts globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) has called for all countries to create resilient integrated systems that can be responsive and proactive to any future threat, although this remains a knowledge gap [4, 5] . While risks vary for different communities, disaster and emergency preparedness is recognized as essential for all nation-states [4, 6] . Local and regional public health agencies aim to mitigate risks and protect population health; however, they face challenges to ensure readiness for potential emergencies ranging widely in likelihood and impact. Further, investments change over time with economic and policy priorities, which can influence the resources available for this purpose.

Our results show that the epidemiological consequences of uncertainty in natural history parameters can often be highly significant since these are important for interventions such as reducing transmission through quarantine or medication, as well as prediction of long-term disease behaviour and clinical outcomes.

The shifting sociocultural meanings of facemask in Hong Kong since the SARS outbreak, as demonstrated by the participants, can explain this preventive health behavioral change on the community level.

This is an understandable consequence of engrained disciplinary divisions and regulatory frameworks but is inefficient given that the ultimate aims of all groups are to improve patient outcomes and control the epidemic. Under even a cursory examination, it is clear that the boundaries between the public health, clinical and scientific response are blurred, with the necessary evidence overlapping and being collected from the same patient. What distinguishes research from clinical or public health practice is often difficult to define, and rather than trying to draw arbitrary boundaries, we should aim to integrate the data needs of all disciplines. The quality of evidence could then be improved by designing unified data and sample collection protocols that are driven by an explicit link to the public health and clinical decisions that need to be taken. Rather than using inferential techniques such as mathematical modelling to compensate for suboptimal data, analysis-ready datasets that provide meaningful information to support individual and population-based practices could be generated by working forwards from a suite of public health and clinical decisions, to evidence needs, and finally to data needs (Fig. 2) .

The biggest remaining challenge for clinical research on EEIDs is uncertainty: emerging infections are often relatively rare; understanding of the clinical presentation and natural history is usually limited; and outbreaks are unpredictable in timing, location and size. Classical clinical trial designs that require predictable and often large case numbers to test hypotheses are not well suited to this epidemiological uncertainty.

The West Africa Ebola outbreak stimulated some innovative thinking in the design of clinical trials [27, 28] and this needs to continue. It should encompass designs for descriptive clinical studies, and prophylactic, therapeutic and vaccine trials under a variety of epidemiological scenarios.",40.17210929561103,15.425313701619263

Through the increasing use of molecular techniques for the study of the ARDS disease process, we have gained a great deal of knowledge related to the development, progression, and resolution of this devastating condition. One major hope for the application of this knowledge is to further characterize subpopulations within what is widely regarded as an extremely heterogeneous disease, which may then lead to the development of specific therapies tailored toward the pathophysiological changes found in each subpopulation. Preliminary steps in this process were realized recently with the description of a biomarker ""panel"" for ARDS (83) and the publication of a latent class analysis of two ARDS clinical trials by Calfee et al. who described two subphenotypes, hyper-and hypo-inflammatory, with differential clinical responses to the trial interventions (189) . These findings were based on the analysis of clinical characteristics and multiple biomarkers and hold promise that further subphenotyping might be used to guide the design of future clinical trials, such as those targeting Th2 high vs. Th2 low populations in asthma (190) . Though no clear ARDS subphenotypes have yet been identified in pediatric patients, it would seem that the same principles could reasonably be applied. It is also important to recognize that information from biomarkers in pARDS may provide value both in terms of their ability to improve risk stratification and also to better define the pathophysiology of this heterogeneous condition. Better risk stratification will allow for well-designed trials of pARDS therapies and improved prognostication for families. In counterpoint, improved understanding of the pathological mechanisms that lead to pARDS and regulate its resolution may form the bases for the development of novel therapies.",36.07918699305971,14.939120635416126

For effective control of rabies, for example, it is increasingly clear that sustained, contiguous and large-scale programmes are needed, as even small pockets of low vaccination coverage (involving less than 0.5% of the dog population) can significantly hamper progress [75] . Even where the cost-effectiveness of One Health strategies has been demonstrated, for example, in relation to mass rabies vaccination of dogs in Africa [76, 77] , sheep and goat vaccination against brucellosis in Mongolia [62] and control of human African trypanosomiasis in Uganda [13] , barriers remain to scaling-up. Increasing attention is being paid to opportunities for integrating platforms for delivery of health interventions, with international health agencies focusing on the importance of strengthening health systems to achieve equitable delivery of health services, rather than developing multiple vertical programmes for specific diseases [78] . It is recognized that establishing independent delivery efforts for specific diseases can lead to fragmentation, and that coordination across sectors is needed to strengthen health systems. In Tanzania, these ideas are being explored through a programme investigating whether the reach and cost-effectiveness of MDA targeting soil-transmitted helminths in children and mass vaccination of domestic dogs against rabies can be improved through integration. Adopting One Health approaches, the project aims to break down traditional barriers that exist between veterinary and human health interventions, and build on the community trust achieved through the provision of a common good (effective control of rabies) in order to achieve cost savings, develop synergies and improve the effectiveness of both interventions. Further opportunities to establish co-delivery across a range of health interventions exist, not only for integrating control measures against several different zoonoses [73] , but also for cross-linkages with public health interventions, such as water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programmes, and joint delivery of public health and veterinary services, particularly in remote or nomadic rural communities [79] .",39.63866002014325,16.84812780547009

Big data-based electronic surveillance, by commercial bodies and government agencies (for profit or population control), which draws on a plethora of internet-and mobile device-based sources, has been widely accepted, if not universally welcomed. Similar anonymous digital sources also contain syndromic information, which can be analysed, using customised algorithms, to rapidly predict infectious disease outbreaks, but the data are nonspecific and predictions sometimes misleading. However, public health authorities could use these online sources, in combination with de-identified personal health data, to provide more accurate and earlier warning of infectious disease eventsincluding exotic or emerging infections-even before the cause is confirmed, and allow more timely public health intervention. Achieving optimal benefits would require access to selected data from personal electronic health and laboratory (including pathogen genomic) records and the potential to (confidentially) re-identify individuals found to be involved in outbreaks, to ensure appropriate care and infection control. Despite existing widespread digital surveillance and major potential community benefits of extending its use to communicable disease control, there is considerable public disquiet about allowing public health authorities access to personal health data.

The identified mode of hepatitis A infection in Korea are person to Third, the public health system in Korea is inadequate. Although Korea' s medical technology development is among the best in the world and the utilization of healthcare services and medical expenditures have increased significantly, the public health system has not correspondingly improved. Outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases are occurring worldwide and the threat of the importation of infectious disease and healthcare associated infection including antibiotic resistance is increasing. However, the public health system necessary to carry out effective countermeasures and the national budget allocated for public healthcare personnel and public health, in general, are inadequate. A typical consequence resulting from this vulnerability of Korea was the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome outbreak in 2015. Since then, the system and policies for recruiting epidemic intelligence officers and managing hospital infections have been introduced; however, the speed of the implementation is slow and fundamental issues such as the development of healthcare workers, healthcare delivery system, and consolidation of the public health organization system have not changed. The current hepatitis A outbreak was predicted from the 2009 outbreak. At that time, the low immunization rates of birth cohorts in the 1970s and 1990s were identified as the cause and catch-up vaccination was recommended as the most cost-effective measure to increase immunity level of the corresponding age groups [20, 21] . The actual policy was to increase the 1-year-old vaccination rate to 90% by including hepatitis A vaccination into NIP, from the approximately 50% rate as an optional vaccination. These policies were the most inefficient in modeling research. As a result, as of 2019, immunity levels in children up to age 7 have increased significantly, but the lower immunity levels in older children and adults have not been addressed. At the end of 2010, hepatitis A was designated as a class 1 notifiable infectious disease, which includes waterborne and foodborne infectious diseases, due to the need for epidemiological investigations and systematic prevention and control. However, we should review and evaluate the reported improvement in epidemiological investigations and systematic prevention and control of hepatitis A over the last decade. Although the number of waterborne and foodborne infectious diseases outbreaks has been increasing annually in locations such as group catering centers, we have focused only on the management of respiratory infectious diseases and infrastructure establishment; thus, we should review whether we have neglected the epidemiological investigation, management, and prevention of waterborne and foodborne infectious diseases.

For example, in 2009, there was much interest in whether morbid obesity (or obesity in general) was predictive of worse outcome in infection with the novel pandemic strain of influenza A/H1N1 [34] .The primary goal was to improve estimates of clinical prognosis, although observations about prognosis could later be used to generate causal hypotheses for further testing. Similarly, observations of disparate rates of severe outcomes by geography within New York City did not initially involve causal judgments about why certain areas had worse outcomes, although they could be used to guide enhancement of services in areas with worse outcomes [35] . Even for a well-understood disease like polio, it may be necessary to identify unusual demographic patterns of mortality in order to understand and respond effectively to an outbreak [36] . Prognostic exercises such as these cannot suffer from confounding bias because no causal interpretation is attached to the conclusions. They can, however, suffer from selection bias. Returning to the Ebola context, one might wish to know whether pregnant women infected with Ebola are at greater risk of death from Ebola infection than other cases [37] , for example, in order to give them greater supportive care. If the probability of entering the database depends on whether an Ebola patient is pregnant and on whether she ultimately dies of the infection, then the probability of death given pregnancy will likely differ in the database from the value in the population of direct interest for a clinical or public health decision maker. If the goal of analysis is to inform public health decision makers on the value of efforts to prevent infection in pregnant women, then the population-wide CFR among pregnant women is the value of direct interest. If, on the other hand, the goal of analysis is to inform health care providers at a treatment center to make a better clinical decision based on an accurate prognosis of the patient presenting to them, the quantity of direct interest is the probability of death among pregnant women in the population they encounter-those admitted to the treatment center.

However, we need a venue for considering new, complementary, integrative approaches that are especially pertinent to the zoonotic diseases. Zoonotic diseases require substantially different prevention and control strategies than is the case when the etiologic agent has long employed only human-to-human transmission for its survival. Acute infectious disease prevention and control strategies used in public health agencies were largely developed from experiences with the vaccine-preventable childhood diseases, sexually transmitted diseases, hepatitis, etc. With these diseases, traditional, clinically based or laboratory-based surveillance has provided the foundation for intervention activities such as vaccination or antimicrobial chemotherapy. For the zoonoses, prevention and control strategies have come from other amazingly diverse bases. At the heart of these strategies have been individual scientists who have spent whole careers accumulating highly specialized knowledge and experience. In fact, the work of these scientists might best be described as basic research-research that aims to understand the full context, the full ecology of the zoonotic disease of interest, while at the same time seeking the means for its control and prevention.

The healthcare system, which had been reformed to suit the market economy, 5 faced multiple challenges: limited financial support from governments; high rates of catastrophic out-of-pocket spending and impoverishment through health expenses; inequalities in health and healthcare utilization; and limited financial protection even among those with insurance (a small minority of the population). 6 Due to the above challenges, the old 'three-tiered' hospital system, which involved local neighbourhood hospitals, district-wide secondary hospitals and city-wide tertiary hospitals, was forced to rely on the sales of new drugs and technologies to boost income, which resulted in expensive and inefficient care and strained patientedoctor relationships. 7 The old public health system was the responsibility of dozens of disparate institutes, centres, agencies, bureaus and departments, which resulted in overlapping and sometimes conflicting mission statements and agency mandates. 8 With an increase in life expectancy, increased burden due to chronic diseases, and the challenges of emerging infectious diseases (e.g. severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003), the Chinese Government re-examined the public health infrastructure and saw the need for a new public health system to address the many health issues associated with these changes. 5 To minimize overlapping of functions and to increase efficiency, the Chinese Government consolidated existing institutions into a new agency: the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The goal of the CDC is to provide a central public health organization with responsibility for both community and individual health needs. The development of the CDC strengthened the Government's role in public health. 5 As public health and primary care share the common goal of improving the overall health of specific populations, it was decided to integrate the two systems by strengthening public health functions in primary healthcare settings. This approach could improve local public health surveillance and reinforce disease prevention and health promotion. 9 In order to resolve the problems of the increasing burden of healthcare expenses and limited access to health services, the Chinese Government initiated its CHS programme in 1997. 4 The 'threetiered' hospital system was replaced by the current 'twotiered' CHS centre system. The new system consists of ambulatory care in CHS centres and inpatient care in referral hospitals. 7 The main roles of the CHS centres are to provide high-quality, affordable, accessible primary health care and public health services to community residents.",34.67402802578402,13.18413299158342

Primary prevention occurs at the predisease phase and aims to protect populations, so that infection and disease never occur. For example, measles immunization campaigns aim to decrease susceptibility following exposure. The goal of secondary prevention is to halt the progress of an infection during its early, often asymptomatic stages so as to prevent disease development or limit its severity; steps important for not only improving the prognosis of individual cases but also preventing infectious agent transmission. For example, interventions for secondary prevention of hepatitis C in injection drug user populations include early diagnosis and treatment by active surveillance and screening (Miller and Dillon, 2015) . Tertiary prevention focuses on diseased individuals with the objective of limiting impact through, for example, interventions that decrease disease progression, increase functionality, and maximize quality of life. Broadly, public health efforts to control infectious diseases focus on primary and secondary prevention activities that reduce the potential for exposure to an infectious agent and increase host resistance to infection. The objective of these activities can extend beyond disease control, as defined by the 1997 Dahlem Workshop on the Eradication of Infectious Diseases, to reach objectives of elimination and eradication (Dowdle, 1998 ; Box 1). As noted earlier, the causation and spread of an infectious disease is determined by the interplay between agent, host, and environmental factors. For any infectious disease, this interplay requires a specific linked sequence of events termed the chain of infection or chain of transmission ( Figure 6 ). The chain starts with the infectious agent residing and multiplying in some natural reservoir; a human, animal, or part of the environment such as soil or water that supports the existence of the infectious agent in nature. The infectious agent leaves the reservoir via a portal of exit and, using some mode of transmission, moves to reach a portal of entry into a susceptible host. A thorough understanding of the chain of infection is crucial for the prevention and control of any infectious disease, as breaking a link anywhere along the chain will stop transmission of the infectious agent. Often more than one intervention can be effective in controlling a disease, and the approach selected will depend on multiple factors such as economics and ease with which an intervention can be executed in a given setting. It is important to realize that the potential for rapid and far-reaching movement of infectious agents that has accompanied globalization means that coordination of intervention activities within and between nations is required for optimal prevention and control of certain diseases.",37.747820174844264,15.675490183286787

Indeed in these countries, the impact of cryptosporidiosis on child development, and the appalling cost of antiviral chemotherapy for AIDS patients confer to cryptosporidiosis a sig-ni®cant public health importance. In this respect, a putative Cryptosporidium vaccine should be part of a multicomponent vaccine targeting C. parvum as well as other gastrointestinal pathogens of public health relevance.",36.58270440185231,15.474295417363015

Policies and guidelines will not have an impact unless they are observed. 177 Obstacles to ED infection prevention need to be understood, addressed, and overcome. Readily accessible PPE, alcohol-based hand rub dispensers, and other critical infection prevention supplies increase the likelihood that HCP will routinely use them in the course of patient care. Frequent reminders and feedback reinforce education and prompt HCP to perform key infection prevention practices at the bedside where competing clinical demands are high. Open communication among HCP about breaches in these practices foster accountability, trust, and a team mentality. Checklists and bundles ease our dependence on memory alone to complete complex tasks and promote high reliability care. Formal adherence monitoring and HAI surveillance provide concrete metrics by which performance improvement can be measured and relayed back to HCP. Finally, commitment and support from ED clinical and administrative leaders seal the foundation for a shared culture of safety. In this environment, ED infection prevention becomes both an organizational as well as an individual responsibility.

The emergency department (ED) is a complex and dynamic healthcare environment. Patients present with undifferentiated illnesses and variable acuity, ranging from the otherwise healthy to the critically ill. Risk recognition and medical decisionmaking are often based on limited and evolving data, under significant time and resource constraints. Patients await diagnosis, intervention, and disposition in close proximity of one another. With more than 129.8 million patient visits made to U.S. EDs in 2010 alone, the ED is a busy place subject to rapid patient turnover and even overcrowding. 1 The ED is a major gateway to inpatient medical care, contributing nearly half of all hospital admissions. 2 It also constitutes our healthcare system's frontline in the response to public health emergencies and disasters. Amidst these diverse roles and competing demands, infection prevention can easily be overlooked or superseded by other immediate and life-threatening issues. Yet, significant infectious disease risks exist in emergency care that can carry substantial clinical consequences for both patients and healthcare personnel (HCP). This article will address infection prevention in the ED through two central themes: 1) preventing the transmission of infectious diseases from ill patients to HCP and to other patients, and 2) reducing the risk of infection associated with receiving emergency care. We will review the existing literature behind ED hand hygiene, standard and transmission-based isolation precautions, HCP vaccination, and environmental controls. Next, we will examine the threat of healthcare-associated infections (HAI) related to central venous catheters, urinary catheters, mechanical ventilation, and other medical devices commonly used in the ED. We will conclude by identifying areas in which we can improve infection prevention in the ED today, as well as highlight gaps in knowledge that would benefit from further investigation as we look to the future.",36.00300791596745,14.566287533018798

Although these are separate programs that require their own infrastructure, each influences the success of the other. Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are among the leading causes of death in the United States, with 1 in 25 patients developing an HAI during their hospitalization and >200 Americans dying of HAIs daily [22] . Multiple studies have demonstrated the beneficial effect of ID physician-led infection prevention programs in effecting beneficial reductions in the incidence of HAIs, as reviewed elsewhere [2] . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published data in 2016 evidencing progress in infection prevention, noting a 50% decrease in central line-associated bloodstream infections, a 17% overall decrease in surgical site infections after 10 select procedures, a 13% decrease in hospital-onset methicillin-resistant S. aureus bacteremia, an 8% decrease in hospital-onset Clostridium difficile infections, and no change in catheter-associated urinary tract infections between baseline and 2014 [16] . While excellent infection prevention is essential for hospital systems to function, opportunities for infection prevention intervention span the continuum of care, from hospitals and long-term-care facilities to households and the community. Regional and global outbreaks involving agents such as SARS coronavirus, MERS coronavirus, Ebola virus, and Zika virus offer clear opportunities where ID physicians are ideally suited to lead biopreparedness and containment efforts in addition to their role in the early identification of pathogens of concern through surveillance efforts rendered via consultative services.

The use of outbreak data to model disease distributions raises methodological issues. Disease data are generally aggregated at coarse politicoadministrative levels (e.g., province, country), losing crucial information on the local natural history of the disease [1, 33] . Additionally, the geographic site of infection and the associated uncertainty are generally not reported and may instead refer to the health-care facility where it is diagnosed [1] , potentially misleading the identification of ecological conditions favoring disease occurrence. This could be further complicated by centralized health-care infrastructures and scarce epidemiological resources, resulting in predictions of the site of diagnosis instead of the site of infection and parasite persistence [34] . Lack of information on the ecology of a disease system may hinder proper identification of the parasite species (or strain in the case of viruses) causing the disease and/or the hosts involved in their transmission.

In addition, the team of investigators should identify, objectively and prospectively, steps in the research process that may place participants at risk. Health care performance improvement tools such as flowcharting, 14, 15 failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA), 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and clinical quality performance measures 15, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 can be applied effectively to the analysis and management of risk in the context of clinical research. We use these performance improvement tools for this purpose in our institution, the Clinical Center at the National Institutes of Health (NIH Clinical Center). The NIH Clinical Center occupies a unique position in the nation's biomedical research establishment. The NIH Clinical Center is a distinctive and complex hospital whose sole mission is the support of science. High-quality clinical care is provided at the NIH Clinical Center in the context of clinical research, but the primary driver of that care is science. The NIH Clinical Center provides clinical research support for, and clinical care to, the research participants enrolled in the more than 1,500 active clinical research protocols ongoing at the NIH Clinical Center. The NIH Clinical Center's research portfolio differs substantively from most academic medical centers. Of the NIH Clinical Center's approximately 1,500 studies nearly half of the protocols are designed to study the natural history and pathogenesis of rare, often genetically determined, diseases. The other half of the NIH Clinical Center's protocols is comprised of clinical trials. More than 90% of these clinical trials are Phase I or Phase II ""proof-of-principle"" translational science trials. This unique intersection of clinical care and clinical research has positioned the NIH Clinical Center to use myriad health care performance improvement tools creatively to manage the implementation of a broad spectrum of clinical research protocols effectively.",44.515662961819906,16.998732937143938

FMEAs or other risk assessments identify process points that are associated with increased risk to the patient/participant, to involved providers, and/or to the scientific integrity of the study. As illustrated in the example above, these risks can be addressed by myriad clinical and organizational interventions that are aimed at reducing those risks. The next step in mitigating risk is the deployment of strategies to assess the effectiveness of interventions, and to survey the research and care environments continually for other risks to the participants and to the study. Measurement is fundamental to assessment efforts and improvement in the quality of care. The history of health care quality improvement and measurement dates to Florence Nightingale's collection of mortality data and infection rates during the Crimean War, as well as to the work of Ernest Codman in establishing standards for hospitals in the early 1900s, including his provocative ""end results hypothesis"" that led to a Semmelweis-like estrangement from the health care establishment (see Chapter 1). 34, 35 In a classic paper in 1968 Avedis Donabedian recommended measuring health care quality in three areas: structure (the characteristics of a health care setting); process (what is done in the health care setting); and outcomes (the status of the patient resulting from specific interventions). 26 This paradigm remains the mainstay of modern health care performance measurement programs and is the basis for the local, state and federal programs designed to measure the quality of clinical care and identify health care associated risks and adverse events. Clinical research programs, too, should implement processes to assess the performance of the clinical research enterprise systematicallydprimarily to assess for risks to the participants, investigators and care providers, as well as for threats to the integrity of the study. Collecting and reporting adverse events that occur during the course of a research study is a mandatory component of both the research process and the protection of human subjects. However, event reporting in clinical research focuses on individual protocols, not on how the system of clinical research is performing as a whole. This ""protocolcentric"" focus fails to identify clinical care and clinical research system failures that potentially might impact participant safety across multiple studies. Murff and his colleagues at Vanderbilt 36,37 have described the need for research teams to develop reporting systems that collect data about reportable adverse events, as well as ""near misses"" or ""latent failures"" in the clinical care and clinical research environments. Near misses or latent failures are errors that do not result in patient/participant harm; however, these events do have the potential to do harm if the circumstances of the event were somewhat different. Identifying and analyzing near misses or system failures provide the care and research teams the luxury of designing and implementing interventions to interrupt the error cycle prior to the occurrence of a serious error. Surveillance for errors, adverse events, and latent errors in the clinical care or research setting can be accomplished using a variety of strategies including: (1) event reporting systems; (2) electronic surveillance systems that utilize clinical triggers to identify errors; and (3) analysis of clinical performance measurement data.

The best prospect for MERS prevention and control rests on basic principles of infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Balkhy argues that three pillars are necessary: policies and procedures, facility and human resources, and accountability and leadership [66, 67] . How these goals could be achieved is demonstrated, in part, in one study using a core group of nurses for an education programme consisting of an online skill module, donning and doffing of PPE, and hands-on practice to obtain nasopharyngeal swabs [68] . Another study called for the use of the '3Is' (identifyeisolateeinform) tool in the emergency department to rapidly identify and isolate suspected cases with any emerging infectious disease [69] .

These can be individualized incorporating strategies that include education, feedback and tackling facility-related issues [70] . In a survey of 607 HCWs, hospital infrastructure and design, staffing shortfalls, and absence of infection control training were cited as the primary contributing factors for the spread of MERS-CoV infection in healthcare facilities [71] . In a study from Saudi Arabia of 228 trainees, half of the respondents indicated that their hospital had a clear plan while 28% did not feel that they were well prepared for MERS [72] .

Public health programs and services emphasize the prevention of disease and administration of health needs to the population as an entity, versus the study and treatment of a single patient, as is found in the discipline of medicine.Today, public health is defined as ""the science and the art of preventing disease, prolonging life, and promoting physical health and mental health and efficiency through organized community efforts . . . and the development of the social machinery to ensure to every individual in the community a standard of living adequate for the maintenance of health."" 2 The mission of public health is to fulfill society's desire to create conditions so that people can be healthy. Public health is divided into the staple pillars of assessment, policy development, and assurance. 3 All three of these pillars are interdependent and cyclical. Two functions address the issues of assessment: (1) monitor health and (2) diagnose and investigate. Under policy development are the functions (1) inform, educate, empower; (2) mobilize community partnerships; and (3) develop policies. The following functions define assurance: (1) link to and/or provide care, (2) ensure a competent workforce, and (3) evaluate. 3 Like traditional programs in public health, ranging from maternal and reproductive health to injury control and prevention, the public health response to disasters also fulfills the same basic tenets of assessment, policy development, and assurance. This chapter introduces the reader to how public health integrates into disaster preparedness and response systems by highlighting some specific subjects relevant to those tenets.

One explanation for this is that these quality measures have not received a great deal of attention in prevention of outbreaks, for example. Only recently have catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) garnered increased attention outside of the hospital setting through national quality improvement initiatives. This is now changing, however. The Department of Health and Human Services National Action Plan for the prevention of HAIs in long-term care settings intends the focus to increase on various infections and their associated metrics, such as facility enrollment in the National Healthcare Safety Network, urinary tract infections/ CAUTIs, Clostridium difficile infection, resident influenza and pneumococcal vaccination, and health care personnel influenza vaccination. 27 Whereas education and professional training has been regarded as one method of increasing infection prevention and control knowledge, 9 this study did not show a significant difference between those IPs who were specially trained to the IPs who were not when examining the quality measures for infections. It is possible that infection control training focuses more on the prevention, control, and epidemiology of resident care management and less on the quality improvement strategies methodology. The quality measures that reflect the long-term effects of IP basic training have not been elucidated. When the Department of Health and Human Services plan begins to be implemented however, IPs will be the individuals to gather the surveillance data and enter it into National Healthcare Safety Network and to initiate any prevention modalities to prevent and/or reduce these infections. The future, therefore, may find that having IPs who have received basic training in infection prevention and control programs will significantly impact current and future quality indicators. Whereas many NHs may have IPs functioning in multiple roles (such as that of the director of nursing, charge nurse, or in-service nurse), 9 we did not account for this in the analysis.

The CIC is a complex certification which aims to ensure the IP is well-versed in the variety of issues that plague healthcare systems. Since the 2002 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and 2013-2016 Ebola virus disease outbreaks, infection preventionists' duties have increasingly involved high-consequence pathogens and emergency preparedness. Overall, infection preventionists are responsible for all manner of infectious disease threats within a healthcare facility, regardless of origin.",53.98116663188973,23.276878272314203

Infection prevention and control practices are existing guidelines and recommendations that seek to combat disease transmission during medical care. IPC programs within hospitals work to ensure staff are educated on and compliant with such practices to protect patients, visitors, and healthcare workers. These programs are also an integral source for infectious disease surveillance and a connective tissue within hospitals, making them a significant contributor to public health surveillance. Outbreaks of SARS, MERS, Ebola virus disease, and multi-drug resistant microorganisms, have all revealed the importance of IPC and the devastating consequences of poor compliance. Continued failure to prioritize IPC programs and practices, as well as the role they serve within outbreaks and growing biological threats, will only serve to weaken preparedness and response efforts. Defense against biological threats requires strong infection control practices, programs, and the ability to adequately employ these efforts prior to and during public health emergencies. Healthcare is a critical infrastructure, meaning that if hospitals are amplifiers for disease transmission and sources for negative patient outcomes, the impact can be devastating.

While IPC programs are frequently responsible for reporting hospital-associated infections within their facility, it is the responsibility for reporting communicable diseases that is relevant to defense against biological attacks. Communicable disease reporting requirements (also known as Infectious Disease Reporting) vary within each state and even county, but overall, there are state laws requiring medical providers to report notifiable disease to local public health departments [1] . While there is variation in the lists of notifiable diseases that states require healthcare providers to report, there is a general consistency of common and concerning microorganisms that includes all Category A agents and a majority of those listed within the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) bioterrorism agents page [2] [3] [4] [5] . Within hospitals and healthcare facilities, it is generally the IPC program that is responsible for reporting communicable diseases to local public health authorities. While laboratory reporting can and does happen, it is mostly incomplete information and commonly limited to the positive laboratory result and the name of the patient. The legal responsibility of reporting the communicable diseases ultimately tends to fall upon the infection prevention and control program, which must not only report such diseases with complete patient and laboratory information, but also within the required time frame. State reporting laws dictate the list of notifiable diseases and their required reporting time frame. For example, in California, the California Code of Regulations requires a report for West Nile virus infection be submitted by electronic transmission, telephone, or mail within one working day of identification, while a human or animal case of plague requires immediate reporting by phone [6] . These lists mirror that of the CDC's National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). In essence, the reporting structure commonly begins with the IP performing surveillance based off laboratory reports and daily reports of admitting diagnoses for newly admitted patients. From this surveillance, reporting is performed to the local health department, which will then report to the state health department, which then reports it to the CDC. In short, national diseases surveillance and reporting frequently starts with hospital IPC programs. IPC programs have a critical role in communicable disease reporting, which aids in public health response. The strength of the infection prevention and control program will be seen in their ability to perform more specific surveillance and real-time disease reporting. Poorly supported or minimally staffed IPC programs will likely rely solely on microbiology reports and might be delayed in their surveillance and reporting efforts. Some diseases, like Kawasaki syndrome, cannot be confirmed by laboratory tests, which can be challenging, but is overcome through daily chart review and a strong relationship with physicians and other clinical staff. Moreover, once a case is identified as a communicable disease that must be reported, the skilled IP will not only report the required information (e.g., laboratory results, demographics, contact info) but also relevant medical record information for the condition, which will include a timeline of illness, travel history, physician notes, etc. Such attention to detail facilitates a more rapid and efficient response from public health authorities. Overall, the infection prevention and control program within healthcare facilities is frequently the primary source of communicable disease reporting, which is a vital part of public health response during biological events.",46.01100123850172,19.87274793112956

There have been several reports and recommendations in recent years to strengthen biodefense efforts. The Health Sector Resilience Checklist for High-Consequence Infectious Diseases from the Johns Hopkins Center for Biosecurity points to the importance of infection control practices and their significance, but there is little overall mention of the programs within hospitals. This checklist focuses on the adherence to infection control practices, like that of the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense report, but tends to neglect the role of these programs. The same can be said of more recent pandemic influenza and hospital preparedness plans. Unfortunately, there tends to be a gap in the literature regarding IPC within biodefense efforts and although most focus on larger components (disease surveillance, PPE, medical countermeasures), the utilization of IPC programs should not go ignored. Hospitals already have this tool available and it behooves preparedness efforts to employ it. There is a continuous trend of pointing to infection prevention and control processes and neglecting the programs responsible for ensuring they are followed. The systemic gap in preparedness efforts citing infection prevention and control practices but failing to account for the program and role of infection preventionists reveals a fundamental lack of truly understanding the role of these programs and internal hospital operations. Biodefense efforts inherently include infection control practices as they are the foundation for preventing the spread of disease, but this gap regarding the inclusion of IPC programs does them a disservice.

A guideline was published for the medical staff, healthcare providers, and, public health individuals and researchers who are interested in the 2019-nCoV [29] . The early death cases of COVID-19 outbreak occurred primarily in elderly people, possibly due to a weak immune system that permits faster progression of viral infection [8, 12] . The public services and facilities should provide decontaminating reagents for cleaning hands on a routine basis. Physical contact with wet and contaminated objects should be considered in dealing with the virus, especially agents such as faecal and urine samples that can potentially serve as an alternative route of transmission [15, 16] . China and other countries including the US have implemented major prevention and control measures including travel screenings to control further spread of the virus [13] .

Current evidence suggests that camels are an important source of MERS-CoV in the community, and the pattern of disease reported in humans appear to be the result of repeated introductions of the virus from camels to humans. 6, 7 Although no sustained community transmission has been reported thus far, human-to-human transmission has been documented in several clusters associated with health-care facilities, households and workplaces. 8, 9 The overall basic reproduction number of MERS is less than one but can be higher in crowded healthcare settings where infection prevention and control measures are inadequate. 10,11 Visits to multiple healthcare facilities with increasing number of contacts has also been identified as a common feature of clustering events in the outbreak in the Republic of Korea. 12 Thus far, the possibility of transmission from asymptomatic polymerase chain reaction-(PCR) positive cases cannot be excluded, necessitating the need for close monitoring and investigation of all contacts, including asymptomatic contacts. 13 There has been no reported transmission during air travel, and the incidence of infection associated with large gatherings such as umrah and hajj was very low. 14 The largest MERS outbreak outside the Saudi Arabia occurred in 2015 in the Republic of Korea.

However, the reduction in gradients varied considerably between diseases. As others have done, 22 24 36 37 we have attempted to infer what health system factors contribute to disease mortality reduction. We grouped diseases into the most responsible healthcare sectors (public health or medical care). This task is difficult because mortality from most diseases is influenced by a reduction in both disease onset (largely within the mandate of public health) and progression of disease to death (largely the mandate of medical care). With this caveat noted, we found a striking difference between the potential contribution of medical care and public health in reducing socioeconomic gradients. It has been suggested that medical care has played a limited role in reducing health disparities and that future health policies should be oriented towards public health initiatives in order to improve health and reduce health inequalities at the population level. 3 38-41 Our results suggest that traditionally defined medical services such as physician and hospital care have contributed to reducing the income-related burden of illness from 1971 to 1996. For most causes of death considered amenable to medical interventions, income-related disparities in mortality were relatively small in 1996. The exception is IHD, which is largely amenable to both medical care and public health. Overall, there was little change in income-related disparities in mortality from causes amenable to public health interventions. Some specific mortality diagnoses, such as cirrhosis of the liver, contributed to a reduction in mortality differences between income groups, whereas for other diseases, most notably lung cancer in women, there were widening differences in income-related deaths. Canadian studies suggest that lung cancer mortality disparities are probably the result of differences in lung cancer incidence rather than survival. [42] [43] [44] [45] There seems to be considerable unrealised potential of public health for further reducing health disparities in Canada. Indeed, there exist remarkable socioeconomic differences in individual risk factors, such as smoking, sedentary living, poor diet, obesity, stress and physical inactivity. Knowledge about these risk factors has also been shown to differ between socioeconomic groups in Canada. [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] The most notable example is tobacco-related deaths. The causal relationship between tobacco and disease mortality is well described and these same diseases have a large contribution to socioeconomic disparities. There are large numbers of public health interventions to reduce smoking that are effective, but they are either unused or underused. [51] [52] [53] Criticism regarding the effectiveness of the public health sector compared with the medical care system should take into context the distribution of resources. The proportion of total Canadian public sector health expenditures allocated to public health was 4.4% in 1975 and 6.5% in 1996. 54 There is a growing concern that public health has been chronically underresourced, which has limited its potential to contribute to improving health and reducing health inequalities. 55 Concern regarding the ability of the public health sector to respond to severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2002 has resulted in public health reorganisation and reinvestment with the creation of a new national public health agency and a US$700 million increase in funding.",41.1572225953507,17.449771577405794

Although other passengers from Central America may come to the U.S. via connecting flights, these travelers would be so low in number as to present minimal risk, and to expend resources to address them initially may divert from more effective efforts with the bulk of travelers arriving on direct flights at a few U.S. locations.

This last aspect of epidemiologic study may be a legal obligation, but it should also be viewed as an opportunity for all practicing clinicians to participate in the practice of community-based epidemiology. Academic-based research centers are often settings for clinical trials, studies requiring newly developed laboratory methods, or studies derived from referrals to clinical specialty groups.

An early forerunner to the modern clinical trial was a U.S.-based smallpox trial conducted in 1800. 80 During the 1950s, several multicenter trials were developed to evaluate chemotherapy in the treatment of tuberculosis. 81 In 1953, the U.S. poliomyelitis vaccine trials were conducted in collaboration with the U.S. Public Health Service and state health departments. 82 Many considerations are necessary when designing a clinical trial. First, should the trial be conducted at all? Is enough known about the safety and biologic activity of the treatment or vaccine to allow it to be administered to patients? This consideration requires some knowledge of the immunogenicity of candidate vaccines or the in vitro activity of an antibiotic against specific pathogens. Second, would patients be harmed by withholding the treatment or vaccine?

In the absence of a known exposure, many symptomatic persons may not seek medical attention early, or if they do, they may be misdiagnosed as having a flu-like illness. Once beyond the early stages, many of these illnesses progress quite rapidly and treatment may be less successful. Most of the diseases caused by agents of bioterrorism are rarely, if ever, seen in clinical practice; physicians are therefore likely to be inexperienced with their clinical presentation. Additionally, these agents by definition will have been manipulated in a laboratory and may not present with the classic clinical features of naturally occurring infection. This was dramatically illustrated by some of the inhalational anthrax cases in the United States in October 2001. 10 Early recognition of bioterrorism is facilitated by the recognition of epidemiologic and clinical clues. Clustering of patients with common symptoms and signs, especially if these are unusual or characteristic of bioterrorism agents, is suggestive and should prompt expeditious notification of local public health authorities. This approach will also lead to the recognition of outbreaks of naturally occurring disease or emerging pathogens. The recognition of a single case of a rare or nonendemic infection, in the absence of a travel history or other potential natural exposure, should raise the suspicion of bioterrorism and should prompt notification of public health authorities. Finally, unusual patterns of disease such as concurrent illness in human and animal populations should raise suspicions of bioterrorism or another form of emerging infection.

The present study suggests that each university and its affiliated training hospital may have different infection prevention and control curricular content. Different curricula mean different teaching approaches and different clinical experience, which may effect students' perceptions (Bowser et al., 2017) . Furthermore, the BSN programs of the 6 universities have varying amount of time for clinical experience of the students. This might have also effected the different perceptions among the students from different universities. Baraz et al. (2015) found that clinical learning in a training hospital takes place in a complex social context of the clinical environment. Given the complexities, it may be implied that the hospital wherein each nursing student was trained may have different infection prevention and control protocol and policies. Hence, the respondents may have different degrees of awareness and practices of infection prevention and control. Cruz (2018) stated that the quality of clinical training given on nursing students is the most important factor that influences their infection and prevention and control learning. However, this finding should be interpreted with caution because the factors that influence students' infection prevention and control learning were not discussed.

It is a well-known fact from the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in the ROK that multibed rooms enable the spread of infectious diseases, and this represents part of the chronic problems of the Korean health care system. 8 In this study, the median number of single rooms in each hospital was 5 (range, 0-63). Patients with known or suspected infectious diseases acquired by contact or droplet routes or airborne droplet nuclei should be physically isolated from other patients. 9 The use of single-room isolation with adherence to the requirements of isolation can be a cornerstone in the prevention and control of MDROs in hospitals. 10 However, this practice is a challenge in the ROK where hospitals are largely organized in multibed rooms, with insufficient numbers of single rooms. A health care organization that is planning to expand its facility may now consider the need for single rooms. In 1999, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System recommended 1 full-time ICN per 100 hospital beds and 1 full-time ICN for each additional 250 beds. 1, 11 Actually, the average number of infection control professionals per 100 beds was 1.2 in U.S. hospitals enrolled in the National Health and Safety Network and 0.8 in Canadian acute care hospitals. 12, 13 Although infection prevention and control policies have largely improved the medical environmental on infection prevention and control, changes in the use of specialized personnel for infection prevention and control fell short of recommendations. For example, the ratio of the number of beds to ICNs in the ROK (1 fulltime ICN per 400.3 ± 154.1 beds) was lower than in other countries with established infection prevention and control programs. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] Our study found a wide variation in the training and experience of ICNs. To date, there is no formal certification process to assess the practice of ICNs and ensure a minimum level of competence.

These factors include mandatory public reporting of HAIs to federal and state agencies, adherence to performance standards associated with Joint Commission patient safety goals, decreases in Medicare reimbursement, and increased public accountability. 17 These increased demands are forcing each institution to evaluate current workflow and process patterns and identify new ways to streamline their activities. This involves carefully evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of performing surveillance using a PF versus a WBF (Table 1) . Each method has its advantages and disadvantages. For example, a PF requires extra transcription time and data entry time and has the potential for data loss from misplaced data collection forms or transcription errors from the PF to an electronic database or software package.

The exposure of populations to face masks prior to an outbreak is a particularly intriguing option, since they are inexpensive and easy to distribute. While the effectiveness of face-mask usage is currently under debate (MacIntyre et al., 2009; Cowling et al., 2010; Tracht, Del Valle, and Hyman, 2010) , their usefulness may go beyond their direct role in disease prevention and instead be a way to increase population compliance with other NPIs, such as quarantine. The effectiveness discussion is largely scientific; however, an individual may perceive an experience of face-mask usage as 'positive' with a much more simple perspective. This could happen when he/she does not become ill or does not make the family ill when wearing the mask, or simply when he/she finds the wearing of the mask to be non-burdensome. If face masks were shown to be completely ineffective or harmful in the future, though, this could lead to a negative gateway experience, potentially reducing future compliance.

Policy-makers have responded by increasing training and funding to these areas [18] [19] [20] . Similarly, planners within the public and private sectors have established tactics and procedures to respond to various emergency scenarios. These plans frequently consider methods to improve communications between various emergency responders and others who must have sufficient capability to contact each other in an emergency situation. Preparedness planning efforts targeting bioterrorism have occurred concurrently with initiatives to bolster public health infrastructure for other public health emergencies including natural disasters (e.g., hurricanes) and naturally occurring disease outbreaks (e.g., pandemic influenza).

In the context of pandemic influenza, it is considered that social measures authorized by law will be at least as important as medical interventions. 3 Evidence from the 1918 influenza pandemic suggests that compulsory home isolation and quarantine were not particularly effective disease control measures because of the difficulty in diagnosing mild cases. Nor were such measures likely to be feasible beyond the initial cases. 4 However, compulsory interventions such as school closures, closure of public places and restriction of mass gatherings, along with disease surveillance and hygiene improvement, have proved effective both in influenza outbreaks and in the SARS epidemic. 5 International and EU instruments require states to undertake such measures, many of which will require a legal underpinning. The requirement of compliance with the revised IHR and the globalization of disease information and exchange have prompted many states to revise their public health laws. Other states, which had no public health legislation, have now enshrined public health laws in legislative form. These initiatives were long overdue. Across Europe, as elsewhere, national public health laws tended to be old, based on flawed science, and to predate contemporary understandings and protection of human rights. 6, 7 The allocation of responsibility for public health practice and the role of the state in regulating private behaviours have very different histories across Europe. 8 Not surprisingly, states have adopted very different positions on the issue of the extent to which constraints can be placed upon individuals for the public benefit. Earlier research on European national public health laws in relation to tuberculosis 9 enabled the identification of four different 'families' of public health legislative models in Europe. These were: authoritarian (the enforcement of a high number of compulsory control measures); moderate (the enforcement of predominantly compulsory control measures without recourse to prevention powers such as compulsory vaccination or population screening); preventive (where compulsory provisions were oriented towards preventive measures, including screening, medical examination and/or vaccination, rather than compulsory treatment or detention); and the laissez faire model, where few or no compulsory measures existed.",34.93092221433348,15.018354348789147

A visible restaurant grading system, previously unfeasible due to almost certain opposition by the politically strong restaurant association, was now possible. We were able to develop a system that both changed the incentives for retail food establishments and protected the public's health. Restaurant letter grades (A, B, C), prominently posted at the entrance of all food establishments, quickly became an identifiable trademark of public health. These simple letter grades helped establish a public health ""brand"" and distinguished the field from the direct delivery of health care services. This event also illustrated the importance of our ability to respond rapidly to public health needs. Indeed, being nimble and politically sensitive are important keys to advancing public health programs, whether for health protection, disease prevention, or health promotion.",33.16844068758253,13.151491661641968

As technology and treatments have advanced to significantly diminish mortality and morbidity among critically ill neonates, especially infants of very low birth weight (less than 1500 g), this vulnerability has only increased, as a result of both more profound immune system immaturity and more frequent use of invasive interventions that bypass skin and mucous membrane barriers. ' Nosocomial infections in neonates carry high attendant morbidity and mortality and health care costs. Prevention and control of these infections, although highly desirable, present a formidable challenge to health care professionals. Because control over birth weight-the most significant predictor of nosocomial infection risk-is limited, proper NICU customs, environment, and procedures (e.g., hand hygiene, antimicrobial usage, catheter-related practices, skin and cord care, visitation policies, unit design, and staffing) can reduce the risk for infection in the NICU.

It is therefore possible that, like Ebola, SARS may re-emerge at intervals in the future. However, a number of epidemiological characteristics of SARS (see above) should allow it to be contained by public health interventions, once the disease is diagnosed. Indeed, the chain of community transmission arising from a laboratory escape of SARS CoV in February 2004 was contained by such public health measures and community transmission was aborted. However, if the dynamics of transmission of a re-emergent virus are different, and particularly if transmission occurs earlier in the illness and there are more asymptomatic infections, the options for control and the ultimate consequences may be very different. It remains important, therefore, to understand better the ecological and viral factors that predispose to interspecies transmission and the emergence of animal viruses with efficient competence for transmission in humans. Attention should be directed toward the adaptation strategies and the ecological factors that are important in determining interspecies transmission, rather than focus on the disease itself (i.e., SARS). Efforts to understand better the molecular basis for interspecies transmission that led to the genesis of SARS CoV will help us to prepare better for the next emerging infectious disease challenge; whether this comes from SARS CoV, avian influenza H5N1, or a yet unknown virus.",35.28421649068132,16.95212552006381

FMEAs, or other risk assessments, identify process points that are associated with increased risk to the patient/participant, to involved providers, and/or to the scientific integrity of the study. As illustrated in the example above, these risks can be addressed by myriad clinical and organizational interventions that are aimed at reducing those risks. The next step in mitigating risk is the deployment of strategies to assess the effectiveness of interventions, and to survey the research and care environments continually for other risks to the participants and to the study. Measurement is fundamental to assessment efforts and improvement in the quality of care. The history of health-care quality improvement and measurement dates to Florence Nightingale's collection of mortality data and infection rates during the Crimean War, as well as to the work of Ernest Codman in establishing standards for hospitals in the early 1900s, including his provocative ""end results hypothesis"" that led to a Semmelweis-like estrangement from the health-care establishment (see Chapter 1). 32, 33 In a classic paper in 1968 Avedis Donabedian recommended measuring health-care quality in three areas: structure (the characteristics of a health-care setting); process (what is done in the health-care setting); and outcomes (the status of the patient resulting from specific interventions). 34 This paradigm remains the mainstay of modern health-care performance measurement programs and is the basis for the local, state, and federal programs designed to measure the quality of clinical care and identify health care-associated risks and adverse events. Clinical research programs, too, should implement processes to assess the performance of the clinical research enterprise systematicallydprimarily to assess for risks to the participants, investigators, and care providers, as well as for threats to the integrity of the study. Collecting and reporting adverse events that occur during the course of a research study is a mandatory component of both the research process and the protection of human subjects. However, event reporting in clinical research focuses on individual protocols, not on how the system of clinical research is performing as a whole. This ""protocolcentric"" focus fails to identify clinical care and clinical research system failures that potentially might impact participant safety across multiple studies. Murff and his colleagues 35, 36 have described the need for research teams to develop reporting systems that collect data about reportable adverse events, as well as ""near misses"" or ""latent failures"" in the clinical care and clinical research environments. Near misses or latent failures are errors that do not result in patient/participant harm; however, these events do have the potential to do harm if the circumstances of the event were somewhat different. Identifying and analyzing near misses or system failures provide the care and research teams the luxury of designing and implementing interventions to interrupt the error cycle prior to the occurrence of a serious error. Surveillance for errors, adverse events, and latent errors in the clinical care or research setting can be accomplished using a variety of strategies including 1 event reporting systems 2 ; electronic surveillance systems that utilize clinical triggers to identify errors; and 3 analysis of clinical performance measurement data.",41.79210439868347,16.399496508058423

With these in hand, multiplexing testing to address a range of pathogen questions is a natural extension. Emergent data informs strategies for existing public health interventions, but could also contribute to help prioritise the launch of new vaccines. Successful templates for this approach were provided when prevalence of hepatitis surface antigen was used as an indicator of disease burden, 8 and age-specific prevalence of rubella antibody was used to estimate burden of congenital rubella syndrome. 9 Serological surveys in sentinel areas (focal areas for surveillance) could allow strategic deployment of vaccination or other interventions, maximising use of resources and timely intervention to benefit the entire population. For areas where immunity against a pathogen wanes, age profiles of serology can give insights into the rates of both waning and boosting of immunity from exposure to the infection (protective titres need to be known).

This provides a strong base for assessment of the need for preventive action. Epidemiologists also evaluate the effects of preventive or treatment measures and share the need to understand risk factors and the natural process of disease. Epidemiology studies a particular disease in a population, taking into account factors such as age, gender, ethnicity, exposure to known or suspected risk factors, and socioeconomic patterns, as well as the effect of various interventions. This study is undertaken to understand the natural history of disease and related diagnostic criteria, to identify risk groups and relevant target groups for intervention and, accordingly, appropriate methods of prevention or",44.78548686378598,17.321346919096406

For example, as described already, in relation to calculating the proportion of the whole population that might need to be vaccinated in order to stop transmission and eradicate a disease. As can be seen simplistically from Fig. 4 , the higher the estimate of R 0 for a particular infectious disease the higher the proportion of the population that needs to be vaccinated to create sufficient ""herd immunity"" to prevent transmission; that is to bring R E below one. For a pandemic of influenza with an R 0 value of 1.6, for example, this could be as little as around 37% of the population (43), but for smallpox with an R 0 value in the range of 3-6 this might need to be 67-80% or more, respectively (15) . As stated previously R 0 can of course depend on local conditions and can vary geographically; often being higher if transmission is promoted by overcrowding and lower socioeconomic conditions. A similar approach could also be simplistically extended to the concept of isolation or quarantine, to estimate what proportion of infected cases and contacts of cases have to be found and completely isolated before they themselves become infectious. This number is similar to the critical vaccination coverage if a simplistic view of case finding, contact tracing and efficient quarantine is assumed (5) . Model realism, and therefore complexity, can, however, be extended to investigate public health interventions more directly by allowing other states within the model schema and equations. For example, Fig. 2c shows an extension of the earlier SEPIR structure for smallpox to allow for a whole range of public health interventions, such as mass vaccination of some proportion of the population, case finding/ reporting, contact tracing, targeted vaccination, and so forth. The equations exemplified earlier would of course have to be extended to cover these other compartments. All of these processes of course have to be understood and parameterised accordingly; one example being what proportion of the contacts of cases might reasonably be expected to be found and at what point in the course of their disease. This might be based on previously recorded experiences with the disease or with a disease of similar natural history. For diseases such as smallpox, pneumonic plague, SARS CoV, and bacterial meningitis, for example, the finding of potentially infected contacts can be relatively efficient and can often be in excess of 80%, reflecting the relative ease of finding the majority of those who have had sufficient contact with a case to facilitate disease transmission. Those predominantly getting infected tending to be those in (or visiting between) households and those in health-care facilities (see later for a discussion of transmission of pneumonic plague in different settings and contexts). Alternatively, or more likely additionally, robust analysis to parameter uncertainty (sensitivity analysis) would be undertaken. Hence, the parameters related to public health controls, as well as those related to disease natural history, would be systematically varied within ranges considered to be plausible, ensuring appropriate sensitivity and/or scenario analysis was performed [e.g. as in the case of the smallpox studies referred to earlier (20, 23) ].",44.61823641536314,18.44102964746145

This can be 8. Introducing Better Descriptions of Disease Stages 9. Some Problems with Data and the Parameterisation of Disease Natural History important; for example, in relation to modelling public health interventions, which if applied early and before the peak infectiousness of each case will clearly have more impact on the control of the onward spread of an infection than if applied later. In which case it is important to better understand and appropriately capture the disease natural history in models (Figs. 5 and 6) . Thus, when modelling pandemic influenza, it is thought that if antiviral drugs (such as the neuraminidase inhibitors) are to have much impact on the onward transmission of disease (through minimising viral replication and viral loads in the secretions, as opposed to simply ameliorating the course of infection and reducing the probability of hospitalisation and death (41) the drugs probably need to be administered within (a challenging) 12-24 h of symptom onset because of the extremely short infectious period of influenza and the rapid rise and fall of viral titres and infectiousness (19, 22) . Whilst serial interval times are often more easily observed than some other intervals in the disease process, they are in themselves convolutions of the other intervals (periods), or parts of them. For example, as discussed previously, there is usually a period between the initial acquiring of infection by a case to the onset of symptoms (incubation period) and to the onset of infectiousness (latent period), which may or may not be coterminous periods and will vary between persons and the disease (Fig. 5) . This distinction between incubation and latent period can be extremely important since diseases that become infectious before the onset of symptoms can make them much harder, or impossible, to control through the traditional means of isolating cases and quarantining contacts. Thus, diseases that can be asymptomatic at points during infection or relatively mild overall, or chronic or recurring such as influenza, HIV, or tuberculosis can theoretically be much harder to control by these means than diseases such as SARS CoV or smallpox (18) . In this respect, the eradication of SARS CoV from the human population was highly dependent on (and blessed by), amongst other things, the fact that cases were generally not significantly infectious before showing symptoms and had a reasonably long incubation and infectious periods. Incubation/latent periods can often be followed by other defined periods that are relevant to the disease natural history, including: a symptomatic period, during some part of which cases are usually their most infectious (infectious period)though, infectiousness is likely to vary over time, often rising rapidly to a peak and tailing off more gradually. For some infections there may also be a prodromal period (involving non-specific disease symptoms) between the incubation and symptomatic periods that might also be infectious (Fig. 5) .",35.85179307355933,16.48596214853782

General guidelines for proper administration of rabies postexposure prophylaxis (RPEP) treatments have been published by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Guidelines stipulate that unvaccinated persons potentially exposed to rabies should be treated with human rabies immune globulin and a 5-dose series of rabies vaccine administered (CDCP, 1999) . Surprisingly, one study suggests that the use of RPEP is often inappropriate (Moran et al., 2000) . The authors urge the routine use of current published guidelines, physician education, and improved coordination with public health officials. The control of rabies through vaccination programs, animal control measures, and rabies surveillance efforts is an equally important factor in the prevention of rabies cases in the domestic animal population and therefore in humans. Whenever possible, animals brought into the laboratory should have histories that preclude their exposure to rabies or assure that they have been vaccinated for this disease. However, due to the potential for a long incubation in the natural history of the disease, the types of animal models utilized, or the prospect of vaccination failures, most institutions are likely to encounter situations where a rabies-free environment cannot be assured adequately. Thus, preexposure immunization to rabies should be available to personnel working in high-risk categories, such as veterinarians, people who are working with or involved in the care of high-risk or inadequately characterized animals, and field biologists who work in rabies-endemic areas.",36.97254221507786,13.620539021284454

Designated areas that allow for clear separation between donning and doffing is critical because doffing involves potential exposure to contaminated body fluids on the outside of used PPE. Moreover, clear delineation between high-and low-risk areas and when PPE is needed and not needed are paramount to ensuring that PPE is used appropriately to mitigate risks of exposure to sources of infection. Secondly, training in the use of PPE before providing care for suspect or confirmed patients is crucial because there is a learning associated with providing routine tasks in unfamiliar situations. In addition, the heat stress associated with the use of PPE in tropical climates is an occupational hazard that, in some instances, can increase the risk of accidents and thus exposure if not recognized early. Behavioral controls are also a fundamental aspect of infection control strategies. On average a person will touch his or her eyes, lips, and nostrils at a rate of 15.7 times per hour. 33 In Ebola endemic countries during this epidemic, there was a policy of no touch in which people do not hug, kiss, or shake hands to avoid potential transmission outside of Ebola treatment units.

In fi nancial terms, funding from diff erent partners is harmonised under one fi nancing plan with clear funding needs and gaps-another model for other programmes. Furthermore, the failure to control tuberculosis in the past-when tuberculosis services were not free-and the success in tuberculosis control over the past few yearswhen tuberculosis services have been free-have provided policymakers with arguments to increase funding for public health from the government. With regard to management, several features of DOTS-eg, directly observed therapy to manage treatment of patients and the management of logistics and drugs-are now used to tackle HIV/AIDS and in other public-health programmes. Furthermore, although many public-health workers are being trained to implement DOTS, setbacks caused by inadequate numbers of trained workers have shown governmental leaders the importance of such resources in public health, and thus they have increased planning for them.

Many public health practitioners distrust the law and the law-making process'. 12 Perhaps the most potent explanation for such distrust derives from the differentiation between the collective orientation of public health and the individualist inclinations of medicine. Law is much more clearly aligned with the goals of the latter. As Johnson notes, 'Western law and medicine developed as professions within the same historical context'. 13 The Enlightenment notion of the individual body as the subject matter for medical intervention and the site of disease was paralleled by the evolution, within legal theory, of a conceptualization of rights, duties and responsibilities which accrued to the individual. There was, therefore, a detachment of the individual from the collectivity -and a prioritization of the formerwithin both medicine and law, with the consequence that when the two disciplines coincided, the focus lay upon the individualized physician-patient relationship. A significant consequence of this has been the existence within the public health literature of an a The second part of the examination, which must also be passed for full membership of the Faculty to be awarded, consists of a series of scenarios in which candidates demonstrate their ability to apply relevant knowledge, skills and attitudes to the practice of public health.

Parenthetically, it should be noted that this need not necessarily be an electorally unpopular stance. Although, by definition, public health interventions impact broadly across the population, neglect of such concerns may be justifiable as reflective of a desire to avoid infringement upon individual autonomy and the free market. Such a strategy is, therefore, likely to prove especially attractive to governments of a conservative or neoliberal persuasion.",31.609570209657022,15.51842344260832

Although these tests have become substantially easier to implement, their performance is still dependent on specimen quality and technician training, because environmental contamination can easily confound accurate interpretation of results. Serologic assays-such as those based on immunofluorescence, immunochromatography, enzyme-linked immunosorbence and live-virus or pseudovirus neutralization-vary in their performance characteristics, but provide benefits over NAATs in the form of easier implementation and more functionally relevant readouts 8 . The performance of any assay, particularly with respect to MERS-CoV, depends on when it is administered during the natural history of disease. A more detailed understanding of the key features of the clinical course of MERS-CoV infection is, therefore, needed to inform the optimization of existing assays and the development of next-generation diagnostics. It was generally agreed that, even in the absence of these data, there is an urgent need 18 . One of the lessons learned from the Hendra experience is that preclinical development and animal-model testing in relevant smaller animal models should be extensive before efficacy trials are commenced in larger-animal target populations, such as horses, or in the case of MERS-CoV, dromedary camels. Downselection of vaccine candidates in smaller animals increases the likelihood of success in large animals, which is crucial because the costs are much higher and logistical challenges much greater in the latter models. An additional lesson to take from previous experiences with animal vaccines for human health is to engage affected populations and educate them on the potential benefits and risks of a vaccine for their animals (i.e., camels) and communities. One of the difficulties facing the development of effective vaccines for MERS-CoV is the absence of an animal model that recapitulates the pathogenesis and natural history of severe human disease.

High patient volume in acute care limits the ability to place patients suspected of requiring single rooms in these until a diagnosis is confirmed. This creates a potential reservoir of infection for both patients and healthcare workers alike. It has also been shown that health care workers can be reluctant to implement transmission based precautions until a diagnosis is confirmed due to perceived and real imposts on time and resources, plus administrative patient flow pressure. Human factors may lead to a situation where the healthcare workers are cognitively overloaded and as their regular practice may be less than 100%, small breaches can occur that they themselves do not identify as breaches. The 'To Err is Human' report in 2000 identified the gap between what is recommended practice and actual practice [9] . Consistently this gap is identified in the application of transmission based precautions as well as other infection prevention strategies potentially leading to health care acquired infections in patients and health care workers [10] . The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Dr Tom Frieden was recently quoted as saying ''There are 75,000 deaths each year from infections spread in hospitals in the U.S. We know no matter how good our recommendations for hand washing and personal protective equipment are, we have to have a large margin of safety for how they will actually be implemented in the field'' [11] suggesting that the CDC acknowledges that clinicians are not always going to follow IPC guidelines, and this is largely unintentional. Yet, accepting standards that put patients, staff and visitors at risk goes against legal and ethical responsibilities of health care staff. This reinforces the need for practices to be second nature for health care workers to ensure that as the potential for harm increases small errors do not have fatal consequences. The practice of infection prevention and control is not an optional extra for clinical practice and patient management, it is essential to both patient and healthcare worker safety.

After prompt measures were introduced in Beijing in response to the outbreak, opportunities for superspreading were greatly reduced. Thus there may have been many other patients with host or viral characteristics conducive to superspreading later in the Beijing outbreak, but successful infection control prevented these occurrences. As this transmission chain probably represents the natural history of SARS transmission before interventions were introduced, we can use these data to estimate the probability of superspreading in a given set of patients. Four (5%) of the 77 patients characterized in this transmission chain spread to >8 others. Thus, our data suggest that in the absence of interventions, superspreading is not a common event. However, the global experience with SARS in 2003 demonstrated that a single superspreading event can initiate a cascade of events that is difficult to interrupt. Improvement of laboratory assays to recognize SARS-CoV early in the clinical course may simplify infectioncontrol strategies for patients with suspected SARS. However at present, clinical and epidemiologic characteristics are the only factors that are initially readily available to caregivers, and these must be scrutinized carefully to assure appropriate isolation procedures.",34.46891234071303,13.323239738871028

Collective interventions such as policies will eventually affect individuals and often also need individual participation, whereas interventions for individuals add up to the totality of the society's effort although they could also directly affect the population, such as in the control of infectious diseases. Historically, public health concepts and practice originate from the prevention of communicable diseases, either at an individual level or population level, and have been included in public health practice. Prevention is thus usually considered a part of public health. However, prevention of chronic diseases such as treating hypertension for prevention of stroke and coronary heart disease is normally viewed as clinical medicine.

This is reflected in increasing demand, rising costs, and a return towards curative and hospital care, making re-exploration of the Alma-Ata principles both timely and relevant. 3 A better alignment of a population-based public health approach with personal health services is needed urgently, along with better integration of personal health care and public health. To quote van Weel et al., primary care needs to be organized on the principle of care for individuals in the context of the population, and the future of primary care, and health care in general, will depend on how effectively a community-oriented approach and its contribution to equity and social cohesion is achieved. 2 The recognition that health systems play a key role in public health has been endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in the report 'Primary Health Care -Now More Than Ever', published on the 30 th anniversary of the international conference of Alma-Ata. Arguing the need to revisit Alma-Ata, the report identifies four broad policy directions of improving health for all: tackling health inequalities through universal coverage; putting people at the centre of care; integrating health into broader public policy; and providing inclusive leadership for health. 4 This approach requires public health strategies as well as clinical skills in meeting the needs of populations, particularly the poor and vulnerable, and is congruent with the influential report from the Commission on Social Determinants of Health which stresses the relevance of an ecological approach to health, essential to achieving the millennium development goals. 5 The implicit need for stronger public health was again re-inforced by the 2009 WHO World Health Assembly resolution which calls for primary healthcare services to provide health promotion and disease prevention as well as curative care and palliative care, and for integration and co-ordinated practice to take account of the needs of populations and to promote active participation by all people. 6 The corollary to these global health policy developments is an increasing interest in appropriate educational strategies, and a growing recognition that public health education must change if it is to meet the needs of modern societies, the health threats they face and the challenge of developing equitable health systems.",35.37348423495582,16.95329844885212

The purpose of this study was to develop a list of competencies and measurable activities, or terminal objectives, for hospital-based health care personnel applicable for use during routine patient care activities as well as during natural and man-made disasters. Methods: Competencies and terminal objectives related to infection prevention and control were developed using an evidencebased approach comprising the following steps: (a) review of the literature, (b) review of existing competencies and published curricula/training objectives, (c) synthesis of new competencies and terminal objectives, (d) expert panel review and competency refinement using the Delphi survey process, and (e) delineation of competencies by occupation. The 8 disciplines addressed were nurses (RNs and LPNs), nursing assistants, physicians, respiratory therapists, physical and occupational therapists, environmental services, laboratory professionals, and ancillary staff. Results: An initial list of competency statements and terminal objectives were compiled and then vetted by a Delphi panel of experts in infection prevention and control until . 80% agreement was achieved on all competency statements and terminal objectives. Conclusion: The final matrix of competencies and terminal objectives developed through this process may be used as a content framework for educational curricula and training materials for hospital-based health care personnel.

Overall, the competencies identified in this study are very similar to those identified for Canadian health care workers. 6 Two advantages to the competencies identified through this study are the delineation of competencies by health care worker groups and the identification of terminal objectives that can be used to measure health care worker performance. Another unique finding in this study was the need for a competency that addresses health care preparedness for natural or man-made infectious disease disasters. Bioterrorism and pandemic preparedness efforts tend to focus on facility or community readiness, but often fail to identify the individual health care worker's role in preparing for such an event.

Although there is no known cure for Ebola virus, there is some evidence that the severity of the disease can be curtailed using plasma from survivors. Although there is a general consensus on the importance of research, methodological and ethical challenges for conducting research in an emergency situation have been identified. Performing clinical trials is important, especially for health conditions that are of public health significance (including rare epidemics) to develop new therapies as well as to test the efficacy and effectiveness of new interventions. However, routine clinical trial procedures can be difficult to apply in emergency public health crises hence require a consideration of alternative approaches on how therapies in these situations are tested and brought to the market. This paper examines some of the ethical issues that arise when conducting clinical trials during a highly dangerous pathogen outbreak, with a special focus on the Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa. The issues presented here come from a review of a protocol that was submitted to the Global Emerging Pathogens Treatment Consortium (GET). In reviewing the proposal, which was about conducting a clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of using convalescent plasma in the management of Ebola virus disease, the authors deliberated on various issues, which were documented as minutes and later used as a basis for this paper.

The greatest risk of infection transmission occurs during a disaster involving an infectious disease/agent (ie, an infectious disease disaster), such as a bioterrorism attack, outbreak of an emerging infectious disease, or pandemic. An infectious disease disaster can have a major impact on morbidity, mortality, and costs, regardless of whether it is an intentional event, such as bioterrorism, or a naturally occurring incident, such as a pandemic. For instance, the 2001 anthrax bioterrorism attack resulted in 22 cases of illness and 5 deaths and cost more than $2.5 billion. 1 Larger bioterrorism attacks or ones involving a communicable disease, such as smallpox, have the potential for an even greater public health impact. 2 The disaster that would likely result in the largest public health impact in terms of infectious disease-related morbidity, mortality, and costs would be a pandemic. The 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic caused 40 to 50 million deaths worldwide. 3 Estimated costs for a future pandemic range from $71 to $166 billion 4 and could require the need for 45 million additional outpatient visits to health care agencies and between 865,000 and 9,900,000 hospitalizations. 5 Even natural disasters can have a significant public health impact if infection prevention and control strategies are not implemented rapidly and appropriately. 6 Past natural disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina and other events requiring the sheltering of displaced individuals, resulted in infectious disease outbreaks because of overcrowding and the lack of hand hygiene or infection prevention procedures in shelters. 6, 7 Researchers who interviewed infection preventionists (IP) involved in past disaster response reported a variety of infection prevention issues that need to be addressed in future disasters. 6 Such topics include infection prevention for shelters; surveillance; occupational health during disasters; participation in the incident command structure; and need for patient, staff, and visitor education. 6 Historically, IPs have responded to health care-associated infections and public health infectious disease outbreaks. Toward the end of the 20th Century, many IPs expanded their role and became involved in bioterrorism preparedness planning. 8 More recent events, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Hurricane Katrina, have illustrated the importance of IPs becoming involved in emergency management for all types of disasters to decrease secondary morbidity and mortality. The IP's role in emergency management is considered to be essential, regardless of whether it is an infectious disease emergency or some other type of disaster. 6, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] What is lacking is a delineation of the IP's role in emergency management. 14 This is needed to help guide IPs as they are called to the emergency management table to help make important planning and response decisions.",40.70615566036428,17.139124352648494

Significant medical school debt can drive new physicians away from the ID specialty and public health. Targeted loan repayment opportunities would allow more physicians to pursue these critical career paths. In July 2018, in a move supported by IDSA, the US House of Representative's Energy and Commerce Committee passed legislation that would authorize the CDC to provide loan repayment for those who serve in the Epidemic Intelligence Services (EIS). More than 85% of EIS officers continue serving in public health roles, and this proposal would significantly help make this career path more financially feasible for physicians. Such loan forgiveness opportunities could also be broadened to support ID physicians who work in public health at the federal, state, or local level and face similar challenges around compensation and medical student debt. Establish financial compensation for ID physicians who work in public service (eg, local, state, and federal public health agencies) or who do ID work that provides broader public health benefits (infection control and antimicrobial stewardship). Physicians who perform infection control and antimicrobial stewardship work should be compensated for these activities. As part of hospital accreditation, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) mandates that every participating facility have an active infection control program [37] . States could attach an accreditation process to such mandates that would formally document ID clinicians who oversee hospital infection control and antimicrobial stewardship committees, with loan forgiveness or other financial incentives attached to this accreditation. Ensure that ID physician compensation reflects public health value added. As a cognitive specialty, many of the clinical services ID physicians provide are billed under Evaluation and Management codes, which have not been reevaluated in more than 20 years. The CMS should update these codes to reflect the increasingly complex care provided in inpatient and outpatient settings. Public and private payers, healthcare systems, and hospitals should also provide appropriate compensation and protected time for nonclinical services that are crucial to public health, including infection prevention and control, antimicrobial stewardship, and bioemergency preparedness and response.

Ebola, SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 all have nonspecific clinical presentations, but each emerged in a specific geographic area, and the epidemiologic links to these regions were key in guiding clinicians to implement proper barrier protections and patient evaluation. This led public health agencies, including the World Health Organization and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to recommend a systematic approach to patients presenting with a relevant exposure and symptoms of an acute respiratory viral infection, such as SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. Early recognition of potential cases was critical in limiting transmission by enabling enhanced prevention and control of infections and preemptive care. Mathematical models developed during the SARS and MERS outbreaks support the effectiveness of such strategies. Identifying patients with potential exposure or symptoms facilitated prompt isolation and, in health care settings, led to additional prevention and case-finding measures. Of note, it triggered health care personnel to use personal protective equipment, patient isolation, and hand hygiene. In the SARS outbreak, these measures prevented transmission of SARS-CoV even without the availability of effective vaccines and therapy. Indeed, these interventions have demonstrated superior efficacy over travel restrictions: Respiratory virus infections were reduced by 46% through hand hygiene, 77%through masks or respirators, and 32% to 33% through gowns and gloves (6) .",41.098627233026704,19.662737037968036

Although personalized treatments can help save the lives of sick people, prevention applies to all. ""Precision prevention"" may be helpful in using both science and limited resources for targeting prevention strategies. For example, recent data suggest that knowing the speed with which people metabolize nicotine, based on genetic and other factors, could lead to personalized smoking-cessation interventions. Another approach to precision prevention is increased screening of people at greater risk for cancer. Family health history is an inexpensive tool for identifying individuals and families that require earlier and more intensive screening for breast and ovarian cancer. 5 Although whole genome sequencing in healthy populations will require more evidence for its utility, there is an emerging list of genomic applications that merit a targeted public health approach to find people with selected genetic conditions (e.g., hereditary breast/ovarian and colorectal cancers and familial hypercholesterolemia). Collectively, these conditions affect around 2 million people in the U.S., with evidence-based interventions that are poorly implemented in health care. 6 In addition, new biomarkers promise to improve the understanding of disease natural history. For example, epigenetics 7 is providing insights into the impact of the environment on gene expression throughout life with the possibility of targeted interventions. There is also strong suspicion that cumulative epigenetic changes due to environmental stressors may explain population health disparities in the burden of various diseases among disadvantaged populations. 8 Measuring neighborhood-specific epigenetic alterations can potentially be used to investigate causes for health disparities. However, although the field of epigenetics is promising for public health, much more work is needed in developing, validating, and using the right platforms in population studies. 8 Biomarkers are only one of many avenues for identifying high-risk populations for intervention. Public health programs already use targeted approaches, for example, by recommending screening for hepatitis C in people born from 1945 through 1965, and identifying people with prediabetes. Public health policies that will enhance lower sugar intake, weight control, and increased activity levels across the population could be accompanied, but not replaced, by more-targeted efforts to find people with prediabetes based on age, family history, and BMI. As technologies mature, there will be increasing opportunities for additional targeting for a wide variety of disease-prevention efforts.",46.99884282571834,18.906190338313248

A human (or more than one) would be purposefully infected with the pneumonic plague, then undertake the mission of infecting as many people as possible, in a similar mechanism of a super spreading event (SSE). This could be modelled in a very similar way to the recent plague outbreak in Madagascar in 2017, 19, 34 where we saw an explosion in cases of pneumonic plague originating from a single source with multiple secondary infections. Computer modelling of the transmission dynamics of pneumonic plague demonstrated an R 0 of around 1.0, but described that in the beginning of the disease if there are super spreading events then the rate of secondary infection can be much higher (R 0 1.6) and propagate the disease in the population rapidly before public health interventions are initiated. 33, 34, 65 These models were described with the SSE expected to be like that in the natural transmission of pneumonic plague, but a suicide attack could theoretically infect many more cases than estimated in the model and spread the disease much faster. Furthermore, with advancements in the understanding of transmission of pneumonic plague we know that mammal-to-mammal transmission involves the transfer of organisms that have been growing at 37°C to an environment which is also at 37°C. 2, 66 We know that many virulence factors and genes in Y. pestis are activated once the bacteria move from 26°C to 36°C, from flea midgut to mammalian tissues. 67 Therefore, the bacteria when travelling from human to human, as would occur in a suicide attack, would transmit a more virulent and already adapted form of Y. pestis probably leading to a more severe clinical syndrome. 2, 67 These suicide attackers could also wreak havoc in the public health response by refusing to wear protective face masks and aim to purposefully spread disease in hospitals and other health care centers and maliciously infect healthcare workers before the threat of the disease is realized.",35.9530692603342,15.968132930711239

These include quarantine, isolation, and rationing of vaccines in short supply. Policy-makers and front-line care providers face difficult ethical questions in such cases which can be expected to occur with new challenges in the future. Support during the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014À16 and Zika spreading out from Brazil in 2016À17 has been criticized as bumbling and inadequate, but did indicate strong levels of international cooperation and shared global concern. This most recent Ebola epidemic was the longest and most deadly in history, resulting in nearly 29,000 cases and over 11,000 deaths in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Several potentially useful therapeutic agents were available in 2014 that had been tested on animals, and limited early studies of the safety of vaccine candidates for humans. However, the affected countries struggled to deal with the rapidly escalating epidemic and the growing number of patients. Médecins sans Frontiére (MSF) provided the front-line treatment and infection control, and warned that the epidemic was ""out of control"" and would require a massive international response. First responders in many settings show the way in ethical behavior in calamitous situations such as the Syrian civil war where civilians as well as medical facilities are bombed and gassed deliberately by government and foreign forces. National, international, and local representatives play a critical role in preparing the global community for unexpected epidemics. Research, with sound clinical trials based on best practices for improving clinical care and vaccines for prevention to protect at risk populations, are needed during and between public health emergencies. Research efforts to develop vaccines for these emerging infectious diseases and others such as malaria and dengue are impressive and will hopefully bring forth lifesaving vaccines on large scales in the coming decade. In the case of Ebola, none of the clinical trials have reached definitive conclusions about efficacy in the search for therapeutics, but vaccine trials have identified vaccines that are safe and effective. The availability of financial, organizational, and professional resources to tackle such issues is an underlying problem of priority decision-making with professional, ethical, and moral standards.",43.29060717959978,19.505747377762418

Zombie Pop Culture to Improve Infection Prevention and Control Practices,"Infection prevention and control is a key aspect of all undergraduate health professions and the delivery of patient care. It contributes to both patient and healthcare worker safety and is recognised as a global priority by the World Health Organization (WHO) and its member states, including Australia, with the First Global Patient Safety Challenge, Clean Care is Safer Care, launched in 2005. 4 An important part of this initiative is the education and training of healthcare workers in infection prevention and control. Infection prevention and control education is, however, notoriously 'vanilla,' in the sense that it mainly consists of annual staff training, inservice programmes, posters, reporting of audit results and online learning. Generally speaking, it is considered a chore and little attention is paid by healthcare workers. Allen, Currey and Considine state that 'Assessment must not be undertaken simply for the purpose of assessment. When used, assessment must contribute to the learning experience-i.e. be conducted for and of learning,' which is often not the case in practice where staff undertake annual competencies, increasingly in an online format, purely to meet an administrative requirement. 5 It is for this reason perhaps that there are approximately 200,000 healthcare associated infections reported each year from Australian health facilities, which makes them the most common complication for patients. 6 Even with these statistics well known, the situation remains that standard and transmission-based precautions are still not well complied with by healthcare workers. 7 The literature, and healthcare history abounds with examples of how infection prevention and control is not done, of which the most recent Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa and the percolating Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERs) are examples. 8 Before that, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the highly pathogenic avian influenzas, followed similar patterns. All of these infectious diseases have been amplified in the healthcare setting, primarily because of poor everyday infection prevention and control practice, and poor identification of infectious diseases.

First, staff should notify patients' relatives individually, via channels such as phone calls or WeChat, to refuse relatives from visiting a hospital or bringing over food and other items during the ongoing epidemic except for special circumstances. If they want to know the condition of the patient, they can contact the ward by phone. Second, the specific section ""food and item temporary storage"" should be set up outside Wards, and signs to inform visitors info, such as a phone number, should be opened. Patients' relatives who bring food and other items should contact the ward and wait at the visiting room outside the ward. Nurses should inspect food and items and sanitize the exterior packaging (spraying with alcohol or disinfectant) at temporary storage. During the whole process, nurses should try to avoid direct contact with patients' relatives. Third, doctors should send a proposal to patients' relatives to inform them of cancellation of leaving or visiting requests such as Chinese New Year and other holiday seasons, and to suggest communication by phone call or video chat. Fourth, all wards should track movement of all staff (including doctors, nurses, assistant attendants, and janitors) and assess the risk of infection daily. In addition, the ward should arrange staff with infection risk to quarantine at home or quarantine at work. Fifth, based on suggestions from practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), it is advisable to administer TCM herbal fumigation around the clock and prepare TCM preparation for all staff to enhance immunity. In summary, staff in psychiatric hospitals are burdened with a challenging administrative mission during this special period. We must follow the principle ""defense against the import, prevention of internal outbreak"", the health and interest of psychiatric patients and their relatives should be safeguarded to the maximal extent. Therefore, in terms of infection prevention and control at psychiatric hospitals, the actual status of the epidemic should be taken into full account. First, implementation of infection prevention and control must measure at the clinics, emergency rooms and wards where staff may come into direct contact with a patient. Second, it is also necessary to pay attention to infection prevention and control at supplementary divisions and departments that are involved in any step of the process. Third, psychiatric hospitals should assist the community in the management, treatment, and care of people with severe mental disorders at home.",40.552353138214755,17.952955160608134

Adequate preparation of necessary start up registries and follow up documents containing a detailed natural history of each patient is pivotal in order to accurately monitor beneficial and potential side effects of the drugs tested. Since the onset and clinical course of DMD is well described, emphasis by clinicians is currently given towards accurately monitoring disease milestones and progress (ability to walk, stand, climb stairs); therefore 6MWT test and timed function tests represent the current clinical endpoints [252,253].

Detailed outbreak investigations often include laboratory testing of close contacts and of health-care workers (HCWs), regardless of symptoms, and specialized serological investigations will include individuals thought to be at higher risk of infection, such as HCWs or those with occupational exposure to animal reservoirs. Estimates of the true prevalence of infection of high-risk pathogens are important to understand the populations required for vaccine candidates or specific therapeutic treatments as and when they become available. In addition, the role of subclinical or asymptomatic infection is critical in understanding chains of transmission missed by surveillance systems.

This is to fulfil “the duty to protect the population as a whole; a fiduciary obligation to realise the social value of the research; and the moral responsibility to distribute the benefits and burdens of research fairly across society”.31 Secondly, if the ultimate goal of clinical trials is to benefit the medical care of future patients, current patients ought to primarily enrol in therapeutic trials for the sake of advancing collective knowledge, and for the benefit of future generations of patients.32 Accordingly, in clinical trials the physician–patient relationship should not interfere with the relationship between physician–investigator and patient–subject. This separation of roles is needed to avoid any ‘therapeutic misconception’ from the patient's side, and to preserve the professional integrity of the investigator.32 Finally, to enhance the social value and the scientific validity of clinical trials, participants should be randomised.28",40.23486774484934,18.67611489357767

They can be used to treat cases early in their natural history and for post-exposure prophylaxis of case contacts. mAbs also carry the benefits of higher potency, greater specificity, more extensive pre-licensing evaluation and consequently a more vetted safety profile. Additionally, mAbs can help define immunogenic epitopes through crystallographic analysis, thereby providing atomic-level detail for the design of better immunogens. They also have been proven as effective therapies in the areas of cancer treatment and autoimmune disease management. Although there is only one pathogen, respiratory syncytial virus, for which a mAb is licensed for use, there are a number of other infectious disease indications—such as Ebola virus disease treatment and human immunodeficiency virus primary and secondary prevention—for which mAbs are being tested in advanced phase clinical trials (www.clinicaltrials.gov).

EID outbreaks, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, avian influenza, and Ebola virus disease (EVD), have shaped the course of human history and caused incalculable misery and death (3, 4). This issue was highlighted by the 2014 EVD epidemic crisis in West Africa, a total of 28,646 confirmed cases with 11,323 deaths, which was an explicit example of unpreparedness of the public health system (4). In particular, the risk of acquisition of an EID during the care of a patient is significantly high for health care workers (HCWs) (5). Although the HCWs did their best to control the recent EVD outbreaks, 852 HCWs were diagnosed with Ebola, and 492 of them died (6, 7). The infection incidence among HCWs became 100 times higher than that of the general population (7). To prevent the transmission of EID spread in a workplace, HCWs are advised to wear personal protective equipment (PPE), including face masks, bioprotective suits, and medical gloves, according to the standard infection prevention and control guidance (8, 9). Although these PPE can significantly minimize the pathogen transmission, the risk of infection cannot be entirely eliminated (9). EID pathogens can be effectively captured and intercepted by the relevant protective materials; however, the sustained infection activity of the pathogen could easily cause cross-contamination and postinfection, which might lead to increased risk of pathogen spreading (10, 11). Alternatively, antimicrobial active protective technologies by incorporating biocidal agents into PPE materials could be another strategy to provide promising bioprotection against EID pathogens because direct contact killing is achieved (12, 13). Various biocides, such as triclosan, nisaplin, essential oils, peptide, chitosan, and silver nanoparticles, have recently been incorporated for bioprotective applications (14–18). However, their immediate biocidal effect usually suffers from significant decline due to the irreversible consumption of the biocides (19). More effective, easy-to-use, field-deployable, and durable PPE materials to provide antimicrobial bioprotection from infection source to point-of-use are needed, particularly for the outdoor emergency medical services.",31.924645605642368,15.180331210330694

Early supportive management includes supplemental oxygen to all patients with signs of hypoxemia or respiratory distress, conservative fluid management, early endotracheal intubation in patients with laboured breathing or persistent hypoxemia, and a lung-protective ventilation strategy (13). Other adjunctive hypoxemic rescue therapies, such as early prone positioning and neuromuscular blockade, may be considered in patients with moderate-to-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (14).

Important for the current debate about the natural history of the disease, this policy would also work if there is a fraction of asymptomatic but infectious individuals in the population. Our results also show that from a practical point of view, a combination of all the analyzed contexts can have second order benefits. As already stressed, containment measures should not only be directed towards a full cutdown of the number of infected cases. Their efficacy is also given by other factors, such as delaying, even if only by a few days, the spreading of the disease. Such delays are always good for preparedness and to have more time for clinical research that can lead to new pharmacological treatments or vaccines. For instance, even if traffic restrictions are not effective on their own, they facilitate the control of the population and thus it would be easier to detect infected individuals and treat them. Similarly, self-protection measures and other social-distancing practices delay the spreading of the disease, freeing resources that would allow for a better management of the epidemic, in turn leading to an increase of the efficacy of individual isolation. Closing public places would, in practice, reduce the transmission, which again will lower the total number of infections and thus make them more manageable for the public health system. This also highlights the importance of having a coordinated response system, since simply adopting central measures like imposing mobility restrictions and closing public places is not effective in the middle-to-long term.",29.935391649995438,12.63300751535889

Furthermore, countries with residual circulating virus would have to be completely isolated to avoid reintroduction. Still, prolonged intensive control could be a means to gain time until the development and large-scale availability of a vaccine. However, the amount of time this will take is unpredictable. An alternative approach is to develop herd immunity through natural infection while keeping the number of cases within the limits of the health care system. Until recently, the UK has advocated this approach, 4 but it was heavily criticized for obvious reasons: it will be practically impossible to perfectly tune actual interventions without exceeding or undershooting health care capacity.
