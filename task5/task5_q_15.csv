However, data on the clinical outcomes of such patients is limited. Case presentation: We report the clinical outcomes of four patients who were admitted at the intensive care unit during the 2017-2018 influenza season with severe sepsis (SOFA score > 11) and acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring ECMO and mechanical ventilation. Two patients were immune-compromised. The A(H1N1)pdm09 genome was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on nasopharyngeal specimen swabs prior to administration of IV zanamivir at a dose of 600 mg twice daily. Weekly qualitative PCR analysis was done to monitor viral clearance, with zanamivir treatment being discontinued upon receipt of negative results. In addition, the patients were managed for concomitant multidrug-resistant bacterial infections, with infection resolution confirmed with blood cultures. The median time for zanamivir treatment was 10 days (IQR 10-17). The clinical outcome was favourable with all four patients surviving and improving clinically. All four patients achieved viral clearance of A(H1N1)pdm09 genome, and resolution of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. Conclusions: IV zanamivir could be a good therapeutic option in patients with severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection who are unable to take oral or aerosolised antiviral medication. We recommend prospective randomized control trials to support this hypothesis.",20.8976906463907,12.3520810160927

There continue to be sporadic flare-ups of EVD cases in West Africa. EVD presentation is nonspecific and characterized initially by onset of fatigue, myalgias, arthralgias, headache, and fever; this is followed several days later by anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Anorexia and gastrointestinal losses lead to dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, and metabolic acidosis, and, in some patients, acute kidney injury. Hypoxia and ventilation failure occurs most often with severe illness and may be exacerbated by substantial fluid requirements for intravascular volume repletion and some degree of systemic capillary leak. Although minor bleeding manifestations are common, hypovolemic and septic shock complicated by multisystem organ dysfunction appear the most frequent causes of death. Males and females have been equally affected, with children (0-14 years of age) accounting for 19 %, young adults (15-44 years) 58 %, and older adults (≥45 years) 23 % of reported cases. While the current case fatality proportion in West Africa is approximately 40 %, it has varied substantially over time (highest near the outbreak onset) according to available resources (40-90 % mortality in West Africa compared to under 20 % in Western Europe and the USA), by age (near universal among neonates and high among older adults), and by Ebola viral load at admission. While there is no Ebola virus-specific therapy proven to be effective in clinical trials, mortality has been dramatically lower among EVD patients managed with supportive intensive care in highly resourced settings, allowing for the avoidance of hypovolemia, correction of electrolyte and metabolic abnormalities, and the provision of oxygen, ventilation, vasopressors, and dialysis when indicated.

Lower thoracic lesions can cause paraplegia while lesions at cervical level are associated with quadriplegia (4) . SCI typically affects the cervical level of the spinal cord (50%) with the single most common level affected being C5 (1) . Other injuries include the thoracic level (35%) and lumbar region (11%). With recent advancements in medical procedures and patient care, SCI patients often survive these traumatic injuries and live for decades after the initial injury (5) . Reports on the clinical outcomes of patients who suffered SCI between 1955 and in Australia demonstrated that survival rates for those suffering from tetraplegia and paraplegia is 91.2 and 95.9%, respectively (5) . The 40-year survival rate of these individuals was 47 and 62% for persons with tetraplegia and paraplegia, respectively (5) . The life expectancy of SCI patients highly depends on the level of injury and preserved functions. For instance, patients with ASIA Impairment Scale (AIS) grade D who require a wheelchair for daily activities have an estimated 75% of a normal life expectancy, while patients who do not require wheelchair and catheterization can have a higher life expectancy up to 90% of a normal individual (6) . Today, the estimated life-time cost of a SCI patient is $2.35 million per patient (1) . Therefore, it is critical to unravel the cellular and molecular mechanisms of SCI and develop new effective treatments for this devastating condition.

Indeed, the severity of infection in ferrets can range from a sublethal infection with mild symptoms to lethality rates of 30-50% [5, 34, 35] ; this variability suggests the importance of the influences of both differences in viral strains and individual host variability on the severity of infection.",22.178154195127654,6.371670895489274

Pugh, S. Bhandari Glan Clwyd Hospital, Rhyl , UK Critical Care 2016, 20(Suppl 2):P220 Introduction: Nasal high flow oxygen (NHFO) is an attractive therapy for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF), with reported comfort, and theoretical wash-out of CO2 and generation of PEEP. However, its clinical efficacy is uncertain. We undertook a systematic review of current evidence to support its use in adults. Methods: Medline and EMBASE were searched using the terms: nasal AND (high-flow OR high flow) AND (oxygen OR oxygen therapy. RCTs were included if comparison was made between NHFO and standard O2 therapy, or NHFO and CPAP or NIV, for AHRF in adults, and primary outcomes (intubation and mortality) reported on. Results: We identified 468 potentially relevant studies. 4 RCTs met inclusion criteria. There were important differences in patient groups, interventions and outcome measurements, precluding meta-analysis. There were no significant differences in intubation rate or mortality between intervention groups, with the exception of Frat (2015) , who demonstrated significantly reduced 90d mortality in NHFO compared with standard O2 and NIV groups, and lower intubation rate on post hoc analysis of patients with lowest PF ratio. Conclusions: There is only limited evidence from RCTs at present to support use of NHFO rather than conventional therapy for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure in adults, and further study of patients at risk of requiring invasive ventilation is needed.",51.38010011914377,21.222761865268662

It may be concluded from this study that delivery of aerosol to adults at both high and low gas flow rates via NHF therapy is an efficient and highly reproducible means of administration. Introduction: Here we present an improved theoretical version of a valve for transtracheal ventilation as a bi-directional manual respiratory pump where a combination of low flow during inspiration, by reducing gas supply to the valve, and increased flow during expiration, by increasing gas supply to the valve, permits more effective venturi effect and efficient expiration, with low total gas consumption. Methods: The theoretical performance of the valve was modeled mathematically and the model was tested in vitro with a standard valve but by variable flow rates (Fig. 52) .",33.97461268991473,11.694932575502344

For many drug therapies, there is potential to use the respiratory system as an alternative route for drug delivery. Aerosol drug delivery can provide many advantages over conventional therapy. Given that respiratory diseases are the commonest causes of critical illness, use of aerosol therapy to provide high local drug concentrations with minimal systemic side effects makes this route an attractive option. To date, limited evidence has restricted its wider application. The efficacy of aerosol drug therapy depends on drug-related factors (particle size, molecular weight), device factors, patient-related factors (airway anatomy, inhalation patterns) and mechanical ventilation-related factors (humidification, airway). This review identifies the relevant factors which require attention for optimization of aerosol drug delivery that can achieve better drug concentrations at the target sites and potentially improve clinical outcomes.",26.654124669380955,11.144108629476815

Even though Jamaican males are generally known to have poorer health seeking behaviours [17] associated with worse health outcomes, the SCD males had similar rates of annual health maintenance visits but higher rates of annual total visits when compared to SCD females in this study. Males had [27, 28] ) and respiratory events. They also tended to have their first episode of significant pain crisis, respiratory event and leg ulcerations at lower ages than girls did. As most of these complications of SCD began in early adolescence, a hormonal role may be implicated in explaining this sex difference in clinical outcomes.Further studies are needed to continue to explore these differential outcomes between males and females. There are interesting weather related relationships discerned in this paper. Higher annual rainfall and higher temperatures were associated with lower prevalence of all three clinical outcomes examined. Persons who lived further distances from factories also had lower prevalence of painful and respiratory events. Further research would be needed to dissect the possible implications of this finding. The effects of higher altitude (as assessed by elevation above sea level) disappeared once temperature was added to the models. It has been widely reported that exposure to cold in persons with SCD results in higher pain experiences [7, 8, 10, 26] and our results corroborate these findings even within a narrow range of tropical temperatures between 25˚C to 30˚C. Environmental pollutants are increasingly being understood as being causative in disease, especially respiratory and allergic conditions [29, 30] . There may be direct effect of particle components on generating added reactive oxygen species and further driving oxidative stress and inflammatory responses [31] . As these latter mechanisms are already implicated as being patho-biological in SCD [32] , then the effect of environmental pollutants in SCD is probably multiplicative. These findings are critical in ongoing education among patients and families and advising preventative measures, especially in avoiding cooler temperatures and living close to factories and exposure to other means of air pollution. The effect of higher rainfall being consistently and independently protective against these clinical outcomes seems counterintuitive but will need greater study. Studies in the U.K. [33] and France [10] have found no influence of rainfall on outcomes whereas previous study in Jamaica has shown a positive association of rainfall with painful events [7] .",23.2119953185909,9.924471857419368

Oxygen cylinders provide pressurized oxygen at variably high flow rates but-depending on their size-only do so for a limited period. They do not require electrical power supply but do require pressure regulators and flowmeters to deliver oxygen safely to the patient. Oxygen cylinders are purchased or rented from supply companies and refilled at central distribution points, often making long transportation times to (remote) healthcare facilities necessary. They are generally easy to use, but problems include oxygen leakage from the adaptors (varying from 10 to 70% of the entire cylinder oxygen content), difficulty moving due to size and weight, and sometimes confusion with the local color coding system [74] . Oxygen concentrators are devices which purify oxygen (>90%) from ambient air by absorbing nitrogen onto zeolite membranes. Most concentrators deliver oxygen flow rates of up to 6 L/min. While this is typically enough to deliver oxygen noninvasively to (one to three) moderately unwell neonates or small children, it may not be enough in critically ill older children or adult patients. In contrast to oxygen cylinders, oxygen concentrators depend on a continuous electrical power supply. They also require technical maintenance including regular filter changes. Not all models of oxygen concentrators are technically suitable for sustained use in a tropical environment [75] . Centralized, piped oxygen systems typically deliver pressurized oxygen through wall outlets to bed spaces in the ICU. These systems are supplied by either a liquid oxygen tank, an oxygen concentrator, or several large oxygen cylinders. Proper functioning of centralized oxygen systems depends on adequate engineering expertise and technical maintenance. Specifically, pipeline conditions (presence and severity of gas leak) and diameter (to ensure adequate gas flow), compatible wall outlets, and the presence of shutoff valves must be considered. All three modes of oxygen supply to an ICU require the presence of a backup oxygen source in case of premature emptying (e.g., oxygen cylinders, centralized oxygen system supported by oxygen cylinders), electrical power cuts (e.g., oxygen concentrators), or technical defects (e.g., oxygen concentrators, centralized oxygen system). In many resource-limited settings, oxygen cylinders are used as backup oxygen systems.",24.97438093656693,11.058795237760126

Potential inhalation exposure to fugitive emissions during high-flow aerosol therapy was examined using adult and paediatric scenarios for both nasal cannula and tracheostomy interfaces. This study confirmed the release of fugitive emissions into the environment during aerosol high-flow treatment. The results showed that variations in interface type, patient (adult or paediatric) and gas-flow rates all impacted the quantity and characteristics of fugitive emissions. The highest aerosol concentration of 0.370 ± 0.046 mg m −3 was recorded from the paediatric tracheostomy with a gas-flow rate of 20 L/min, which also corresponded to the second highest inhaled dose across all the scenarios.

This is not surprising since human gene association studies have indicated that differences in an individual's genetics may govern susceptibility and clinical outcomes of respiratory viral pathogenesis (Everitt et al. 2012; Forton et al. 2009; Kenney et al. 2017; Mills et al. 2014; Pasanen et al. 2017; Patarcic et al. 2015; Zhou et al. 2012 ), including retrospective studies of SARS-CoV-infected patients (Chan et al. , 2006 Ching et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2008; Zhu et al. 2011 ). However, human genetic associations do not indicate cause-and-effect, which require the capacity to model the impact of host genetics on respiratory viral pathogenesis, in this case SARS-CoV pathogenesis. A recently developed, innovative resource for genetic mapping, called the Collaborative Cross (CC), comprises a panel of recombinant inbred mouse strains containing tractable genetic diversity that approaches the genetic diversity in the human population (Churchill et al. 2004; Threadgill et al. 2002) . Using an octo-parental breeding scheme that includes classical laboratory stains (A/J, C57BL/6J, and 129/SvImJ), mouse models for human diseases (NOD/ShiLtJ for diabetes; NZO/HlLtJ for obesity), and wild-derived mouse strains (CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhJ, and WSB/EiJ), the CC captures 90% of the genetic variation present in the three major mouse subspecies (Mus musculus musculus, Mus musculus domesticus, Mus musculus castaneus) (Roberts et al. 2007b) . Virus infection studies in CC mouse lines, including SARS-CoV, have led to mapping of high and low host response alleles as they relate to development of clinical signs of disease following viral pathogenesis (Bottomly et al. 2012; Brinkmeyer-Langford et al. 2017; Ferris et al. 2013; Gralinski et al. 2015 Gralinski et al. , 2017 Green et al. 2017; Rasmussen et al. 2014) . Rapid genetic mapping is most successful through comparative analysis of CC strains that show extreme phenotypes such as high versus low weight loss, or high versus low lung titers. Extreme phenotypes in select CC strains may reflect clinical outcomes observed in human disease, as observed in testing mouse-adapted Ebola virus in different CC strains . Applying the CC technology to SARS-CoV pathogenesis identified two CC strains (CC003/ Unc and CC053/Unc) with opposing susceptibility profiles . Genetic mapping revealed an adaptor protein (Ticam2) in the toll-like receptor pathway as a strong candidate driving severe respiratory disease phenotypes .

Previous studies have been conducted in children or with milder forms of pneumonia [24] . However, children have much higher rates of respiratory viral illnesses than adults and should be discussed separately, and severe pneumonia is of most interest in the ICU setting [6, 25] . Among the 23 patients whose management was changed, the most common change was in antiviral agents (n = 18). Currently, anti-influenza agents are the only actively used antiviral agents, and ribavirin is the only antiviral treatment option for non-influenza respiratory viruses [26] . Our study results emphasize the need for the development of novel antiviral agents against respiratory viruses. Apart from antiviral agents, respiratory viral detection in critically ill patients led to a reduction or cessation of immunosuppressant treatment in 3 patients. The use of high-dose steroids is known to be associated with a higher mortality rate and longer viral shedding in influenza A patients [27] . Therefore, it can be helpful to reduce the use of immune-modulating agents, including steroids, to improve patient outcomes. Two other patients stopped using empirical antibiotics, and their treatment focused on the respiratory viruses as pathogens. The long-term use of antibacterial agents in patients with viral pneumonia is known to increase the risk for developing multidrug-resistant pathogens and Clostridium difficile infection rather than improving clinical outcomes [28, 29] . The bacterial coinfection rate of the present study was similar to that of previous reports [8, 30] , which further supports the fact that patients with viral infection should be carefully examined for any additional bacterial infection. The most common bacterial pathogens of coinfection were common colonizers of the nasopharynx [31] . However, we failed to show a significant difference in mortality related to coinfection. This result is also consistent with previous reports, which showed comparable results for patients with and without bacterial coinfection [32] . The consequences of bacterial coinfection require further study.",24.472598011327424,10.569824106754286

Respiratory viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, and picornavirus play an important role in the etiology of respiratory diseases in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients, especially those undergoing myelosuppression and hematopoietic cell transplant [2] . PLOS Considerable advances have been made in predicting clinical outcomes for several systemic viral infections (e.g., HIV), and measuring viral load and markers of immune activation have become part of standard clinical care [3] . Unfortunately, this is not the case for influenza, RSV, and other viral respiratory infections. Despite the enormous global health impact of viral respiratory infections [4] , accurate viral and immune markers to predict clinical outcomes for patients are still lacking. Several methods have been used to precisely correlate viral copy number and disease severity [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Molecular quantitative assays have been suggested to detect and monitor clinical viral respiratory disease, particularly in immunosuppressed pediatric patients [10] . However, their results are conflicting and there continues to be a lack of clinical tests to accurately measure viral load [5, 6, 8, 9] . Furthermore, respiratory infections in these patients are associated with prolonged viral shedding and concerns for emergent antiviral resistance (for those in whom the viral infection is treatable). Quantitative determination of viral load may provide an important tool to directly evaluate the efficiency of antiviral therapy, to determine if changes in therapy are necessary and to assess need for further isolation to protect transmission to other highly susceptible hosts. These problems highlight the importance and potential value of developing assays for absolute, precise and reliable quantitative viral detection to improve the accuracy of clinical decision making in immunocompromised children with viral respiratory infections.",23.48910981949049,10.13953198082802

On one hand, they can mediate fungal clearance in the CNS, but on the other hand, they can induce inflammation that leads to neurological deterioration and death. This suggests a possible explanation for why inflammation is often a prominent feature of cryptococcal meningitis in HIV-uninfected, but not HIV-infected patients, and raises the intriguing possibility that the profound CD4 ϩ T cell deficiency, which portends risk for cryptococcosis, may actually limit inflammatory pathology in HIV-infected persons not on ART. This dichotomy may also provide insight into the failure of adjunctive steroid therapy to reduce mortality or improve morbidity in HIV-associated cryptococcosis (19) and the fact that cryptococcosis may have a better prognosis in immunosuppressed patients than in nonimmunosuppressed patients (20) (21) (22) . The detrimental effect of activated CD4 ϩ T cells in mice also suggests the possibility that antifungal therapy-induced fungal clearance and reduced levels of glucuronoxylomannan (GXM) (an immune suppressing molecule [23] [24] [25] ), could enhance CD4 ϩ T cell activation and damage.

MERS patients who were not HCW were older than HCW and those who were MERS-CoV negative. The presenting clinical features of patients with MERS were indistinguishable from those who were investigated for MERS but found MERS-CoV negative, with the exception that diarrhoea was more common in patients with MERS. This appears to be primarily because 11 of 23 (48%) HCW with MERS reported diarrhoea significantly more often than patients who were MERS-CoV negative (15/94; 16%) (p = 0006). However, there was no difference in the frequency of diarrhoea in non-HCW MERS patients and non-MERS patients. Notably, diarrhoea was also a prominent feature of SARS with evidence of virus replication in intestinal epithelium [15] . It is important to note that 25% of patients had normal chest radiographs at initial presentation and 15% never developed an infiltrate. This was reminiscent of the radiological presentation of SARS where a proportion of patients also did not have an infiltrates on chest radiography at presentation but many of these did have detectable abnormalities on computerised tomography scans [15] . The observation that the clinical features of patients with MERS-CoV infection is indistinguishable from those who are hospitalised for other ARI emphasises the need for a low threshold of clinical suspicion for initiating MERS-CoV laboratory testing in patients with severe respiratory disease. Exposure to hospital environments in the two weeks prior to clinical onset was one significant risk factor for infection. However, 62% of patients who were not MERS-CoV positive also had similar exposure to health care facilities, possibly because many of them had other co-morbidities. Exposure to animals, though significantly more common reported in the non HCW patients with MERS (10%) than in those without MERS (0%), was not elicited in the majority of patients with MERS. Some of the MERS-CoV infections (both HCW and non-HCW) were known to have been acquired nosocomially [7] and thus would not be expected to have zoonotic exposure as a source of infection. Patients with MERS who were non-HCW were more likely to > 50 years of age when compared to non-MERS patients (p = 0.0034) and MERS patients who were HCW (p = 0.0005). Patients with MERS who were non-HCW had significantly worse clinical outcomes than those who were MERS-CoV negative or HCW with MERS-CoV infection. This may be related, in part, to the fact that both HCW and non-MERS patient groups were younger and had fewer co-morbid conditions. In a previous report of MERS-CoV infection in HCW detected by active case finding of contacts, seven infected HCW were documented, two of whom were asymptomatic, while the other five had mild upper respiratory tract symptoms [13] . The age of the HCW with MERS-CoV infection ranged between 28-56 years with only one of them having underlying co-morbidity. Only 4 (17%) required ICU admission and one (4%) died. In other case series of MERS, significant proportions have been HCW, but the clinical features of the HCW and non HCW MERS patients have not been systematically compared [6, 8, 16] . It is clear that the overall clinical presentation and outcomes in HCW and non-HCW MERS is markedly different. When analysing clinical outcomes of MERS, it is important to distinguish between those in HCW and non-HCW, because they have markedly different clinical outcomes.",23.14581239110958,10.036553358637848

In our study, severity of illness characteristics were identified as being the primary factors associated with in-hospital mortality among patients with viral pneumonia. Interestingly, identification of multiple respiratory viruses was also associated with increased mortality. A potential explanation for this finding is that host characteristics enabling infection of multiple respiratory viruses may lead to worse outcomes. This finding may be a surrogate marker for immunocompromise or debilitation status of such patients and thus, their increased risk of death. However, it is also possible that coinfection with multiple viruses leads to a more pathogenic or detrimental respiratory process.

Second, our study only included public hospitals, which cover 73.7% of all admissions [4] and probably a greater fraction of acute admissions, but our study did not include antiviral use in outpatient settings, and therefore our estimates will be an underestimate of the total use of antivirals in Hong Kong.

For example, individual based interventions might focus on reducing fomite touching whereas centralized interventions change the surfaces available for contamination. In general, we found that R 0 for the fomite route was more sensitive to surface properties than to the rate of touching fomites. By extension, interventions that improve surface decontamination may be more effective than hand washing interventions when fomites are the primary transmission route. Specifically, when the proportion of accessible surfaces (λ) was low (such as in an office or subway scenario), touching rates were most important for determining fomite R 0 because surfaces were highly concentrated. However, at higher values of λ, touching rates did not contribute as much to fomite R 0 . Of the four venues considered, the highest values of R 0 for the fomite route occurred in settings like schools and daycares, where both the proportion of accessible surfaces and the touching rates were high leading to frequent exposure to surfaces with somewhat lower concentration of pathogen. Daycares may be an even greater source of risk for pathogens that have higher shedding rates among children. These venues are likely to be of particular interest for infection control efforts as non-pharmaceutical intervention and environmental microbiology studies have indicated that pathogen persistence on school and day care surfaces could be an important source of infections [31, 32] . Additionally, healthcare settings exhibit many features of high contact and high accessible surface venues.

Antivirals such as interferon and ribavirin that show strong inhibition of MERS-CoV in vitro have been used in the clinics with different degrees of success. Ribavirin is a synthetic guanosine nucleoside that interferes with the synthesis of viral mRNA. The best effect has been observed using a combination therapy of interferon (IFN) and ribavirin (Momattin et al., 2013) . Different type I interferons including IFN-α2b and IFN-β1b have been used in the management of patients with confirmed MERS-CoV infection (McIntosh, 2017) . In a study using macaques, animals were treated with IFN-α2b and ribavirin staring at 8 h after infection with MERS-CoV (Falzarano et al., 2013) . The infected animals were euthanized at 72 h post-infection which is the peak of disease in this model. The group that received the combination treatment did not developed overt clinical signs of infection, had reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, reduction in lung virus titers, and reduction in overall lung pathology compared to the group of macaques that did not receive treatment. Most of the data on the efficacy of this combination therapy are from retrospectives studies (Mo and Fisher, 2016; McIntosh, 2017) . In a study comparing infected patients that received this combination therapy in addition to support therapy, it was observed that these patients had a significantly better survival at day 14 post-laboratory confirmation of the infection (70%) compared to the patients that only received the supportive therapy (29%) (Omrani and Shalhoub, 2015) . In a case study report of a health worker infected with MERS-CoV, the use of IFN-α2b plus ribavirin was associated with his recovery as well as with a beneficial prophylactic effect in his spouse who only developed a mild respiratory illness (Khalid et al., 2015) . IFN-β has also been used in combination therapies for the treatment of MERS-CoV infection Arabi et al., 2018) . In a retrospective study that analyzed a small cohort of patients with laboratory-confirmed infection, it was observed that treatment with the combination of IFN-β1a and ribavirin did not significantly improve survival . In a different retrospective study, analysis of the data demonstrated that administration of IFN-β improved survival in treated patients. However, after a multivariate analysis, the positive effect was not significant (Al Ghamdi et al., 2016) . Results vary between different retrospective studies and this is in part due to the presence of comorbidities and most importantly the time for treatment initiation (Al-Tawfiq and , since it has been observed that the window of opportunity is very narrow and only effective when started within the first 48 h of confirmed diagnosis (Momattin et al., 2013; Al-Tawfiq et al., 2014; Widagdo et al., 2017) . A case study of a MERS-CoV-infected patient who received ribavirin in combination with lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra ® ), a human immunodeficiency virus antiviral, and IFN-α2a, reported that this regimen was effective to treat the patient (Kim et al., 2016) . The patient, a 64-year-old male with different comorbidities, started treatment on day 4 post admission and achieved viral clearance just 6 days after initiation of treatment and finally was discharged from the hospital on day 13 after admission (Kim et al., 2016) . In a recent study, a combination of ribavirin and lopinavir/ritonavir was used as a post-exposure prophylaxis in health care workers who had been exposed to MERS-CoVinfected patients and demonstrated a reduction of 40% in the risk of infection (Park et al., 2019) . A preclinical study in common marmosets infected with MERS-CoV showed that treatment with a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and IFN-β1b improved the clinical and pathological outcomes of the infected animals (Chan et al., 2015) . A phase 2/3 clinical trial NCT02845843 to determine the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of a combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir and IFN-β1b for the treatment of MERS-CoV-infected patients was initiated in 2016.

Lung involvement is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with CF [2] . It is known in older children and adults that pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) lead to lung function decline [3] . However, the effect of PEx on clinical outcomes in young children with CF is not fully understood. Previous studies have demonstrated that airway inflammation [4, 5] and bronchiectasis [6] [7] [8] occur in infants and preschoolers with CF indicating that lung damage occurs early in life. Additionally, newborn screening has led to earlier diagnosis and provides an opportunity for medical interventions to slow the progression of lung disease [9, 10] . Accordingly, we sought to examine the frequency of PEx in a cohort of infants and preschool aged children with CF and the relationship of these exacerbations to clinical outcomes, including Brasfield chest x-ray (CXR) scores and lung function at 7 years. Most PEx in children are treated on an outpatient basis with oral antibiotics [11] ; thus, we captured these events as well as hospitalizations. We employed oropharyngeal cultures, the standard of care in the United States for monitoring airway infections in non-expectorating patients, to determine airway microbiology. We hypothesized that those with more frequent PEx during the study period would have worse clinical outcomes at the conclusion of the study (CXR scores) and at school age (lung function).",29.466313867100155,11.167728076666421

It is sometimes difficult to differentiate between bacterial infections and viral infections, and thus the use of unnecessary antibiotics is common. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has been increasing worldwide, resulting in poor treatment responses and deplorable clinical outcomes [29] . The problem of AMR is an urgent and critical health threat and is directly associated with the overuse of antibiotics [30] . Antibiotic treatment does not improve the clinical outcomes of viral infections [31] . Decreasing the use of unnecessary antibiotics is the key to combating AMR, and accurate and rapid diagnosis is crucial to decrease antibiotic prescriptions with a minimized risk [9, 10, 32] . The present study demonstrates that PCR has higher detectability for respiratory viruses compared to traditional antigen tests and viral cultures. PCR-based viral detection may help physicians to make appropriate decisions and decrease unnecessary antibiotic use. Furthermore, the precise diagnosis of certain viruses may contribute to timely antiviral agent treatment, e.g., oseltamivir against influenza infections. We discovered that influenza is common among pediatric patients (11.6% of respiratory specimens) and is the most commonly detected pathogen in older children (27% in children aged 5-9 years and 16.7% in children older than 10 years). Rapid diagnosis of influenza viruses and early treatment with oseltamivir or peramivir is crucial. In addition, prompt diagnosis of respiratory viruses also contributes to appropriate infection control measures and isolation care [8, 27] . In recent years, the cost of PCR testing has decreased, and the availability and feasibility has been largely improved. Some commercialized PCR machines are increasingly available and may serve in point-of-care testing [18] . Hence, the widespread use of PCR-based detection of respiratory viruses is increasing and may become more practical.",23.492930781212984,10.936866883415616

To provide stable cardiac output in the VA mode and adequate oxygenation in the VV mode, adequate blood flow should be maintained. Therefore, clinicians raise the ECMO pump speed as much as possible to maintain adequate blood flow. The blood flow rate that was applied to 90% of our patients was less than 4.1 L/min. A high blood flow extracorporeal circuit that pumped up to 7 L/min [26] did not apply to our patients; however, 43.8% (141/321) of our patients were treated with a pump speed higher than the cut-off value of 2.19 x 10 3 rpm. For these reasons, we speculate that pump speed, but not a blood flow, is a predictor of death in this study. We compared the clinical characteristics of patients from the VA and VV ECMO modes. Patients with the VV mode had higher levels of CRP, showed higher mortality, and had longer stays in the hospital compared with those with the VA mode; however, the mortality within 2 weeks after ECMO insertion was higher in patients with the VA mode. We speculated that the patients with the VA mode deteriorated rapidly but recovered soon if they were not severe enough for death. In contrast, patients with the VV mode seemed to show slower but poorer outcomes than those with the VA mode. The different disease process of the patients treated with the VA and VV ECMO modes [27] might be related to these findings.

Programmatic interventions in children in low-resource settings based on improved oxygen supply using oxygen concentrators have been associated with a 35% reduction in mortality (40) . The lack of association between respiratory rate and mortality underlines the importance of expanding the availability of pulse oximetry in tandem. Similarly, the association of prepresentation symptom duration with mortality suggests that interventions to improve patient education to alter health care-seeking behavior or referral mechanisms within community healthcare centers should be considered. The continued substantial mortality rate beyond Day 30 also warrants further study to devise targeted interventions to enhance care following discharge from hospital. The use of objective CAP severityassessment tools has been shown to improve the recognition of patients with severe CAP likely to require intensive care support (41) and those with mild disease who can be safely managed as outpatients (42) . Current South African CAP guidelines recommend that CURB65 is used to inform site of care and initial antimicrobial treatment (43) . However, we found that CURB65 showed poor prognostic performance in predicting 30-day mortality in this cohort compared with its performance in CAP cohorts from well-resourced settings (44) . This variation likely reflects differences in microbial etiology, demographics, and comorbidity profiles between this cohort and the patient populations in which CURB65 was derived (29) , and underlines the importance of prospective validation of prognostic tools in relevant settings (29, 44) . The similarly poor performance of the SWAT-Bp score that was derived in a lower respiratory tract infection cohort from Malawi (28), however, highlights the challenges of developing a simple and accurate locally adapted tool. Rather than attempting to derive a single tool capable of accurately predicting mortality across the whole spectrum of disease severity, a tool with high negative predictive performance aimed at identifying those patients with a low risk of adverse outcome suitable for outpatient management may be more feasible and equally useful. In this respect, the SMRT-CO tool performed well with a negative predictive value of 96.8%, but the inclusion *Excluded from multivariable analysis because of prevalence <5%. † Excluded a priori from multivariable analysis because of assumed collinearity with systolic blood pressure. ‡ Excluded a priori because of assumed collinearity with MUAC.",26.31515278568127,10.663202567424282

CXR scoring systems have been explored as predictors of outcome in a variety of respiratory pathologies, however these studies generally included only patients with specific respiratory diagnoses and many were designed for outpatient longitudinal care, limiting their generalizability [12, [20] [21] [22] [23] . This study extends the use of CXR scoring systems to a broader ICU population and supports the association of worse clinical outcomes, such as increased in-hospital and 60-day mortality, with higher CXR scores, regardless of the underlying diagnosis.",23.817640415135145,9.87925575073172

The role of steroids in the management of pneumonia remains controversial. On the one hand, steroids might have the potential to decrease intrapulmonary inflammation and thus to reduce some ARDS-related pulmonary lesions. But, on the other hand, steroids might increase immunosuppression, favor persistent viral replication, and promote superinfection. Based on the results of two randomized controlled trials, the benefit-to-risk ratio argues for its use Patients who received steroids were matched in a 1:6 ratio to a control group of patients who did not receive steroids. Matched controls were screened from the current cohort with the following four matching criteria: age, year of ICU admission, SOFA score at day 1, and ARDS criteria according to the Berlin definition ARDS acute respiratory distress syndrome, ICU intensive care unit, PaO 2 :FiO 2 ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen, SOFA Sequential Organ Failure Assessment in severe Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [42, 43] . A recent meta-analysis reported that it may decrease the risk of ARDS as adjunctive therapy in community-acquired pneumonia [44] . On the other hand, no benefit has been demonstrated with the use of steroids in influenza pneumonia [45] . In 1998, Mer and Richards [39] reported on 15 adult patients treated for VZV-CAP, six of whom received steroids in addition to antiviral therapy and supportive care. These six patients experienced clinical improvement, a significantly shorter ICU and hospital length of stay, and no mortality when compared to those who did not receive steroids. However, the study design precluded any robust conclusion. Another study from Saudi Arabia reported improvement in oxygenation parameters in 10 adult patients treated for VZV-CAP with steroids as adjunctive therapy [40] . This was not our experience in the present study. Ten patients received steroids 4.5 (1-15) days after ICU admission. We compared these 10 patients to 60 matched controls who did not receive steroids. There was no difference between the steroid group and the nonsteroid group in ICU and hospital mortality. However, patients treated with steroids had a longer duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, more bacterial superinfection, and an increased ICU and hospital length of stay than control patients not treated with steroids. Thus, our data did not report any benefit associated with the use of steroids as adjunctive therapy in severe VZV-CAP. Our study has several limitations. First, given the retrospective design over a long period of time, supportive care practices may have changed throughout the study period and influenced the results. However, we report the largest study on the severe forms of VZV-CAP and we believe that it adds valuable data to the current knowledge. Second, we had no biological identification of VZV for all patients included our study. Nevertheless, clinical signs and symptoms of chickenpox are obvious in most cases and laboratory diagnosis is restricted to unusual cases. Thus, we can reasonably assume that the patients included in the present study had VZV-CAP. Third, due to the limited number of death we were unable to identify independent predictors of hospital mortality. However, we report predictors of invasive mechanical ventilation that conceivably may be related to mortality. Fourth, for the diagnosis of VZV-CAP we used a database encoded by physicians at patient ICU discharge and we cannot exclude that some patients with VZV-CAP had been missed.",31.04098832885161,11.784255705256335

S1P1R agonist AAL-R has shown to significantly reduce the release of inflammatory cytokines while maintaining protective antibody and cytotoxic T-cell responses in mice [21] . These preclinical data highlight the promise of these drugs for treating acute viral infections and suggest that S1P1R agonists could improve clinical outcomes and significantly reduce mortality of patients infected with the highly pathogenic or pandemic influenza by controlling the fatal CS side effects of disease. S1P1R agonists will now be required to undergo future development leading to safety and dose toler-ability testing in Phase I clinical trials before consideration can be given to their use in humans. However, if these potential drug products are found to have good safety profiles there will be a compelling justification for these candidate drugs to be taken forward for full regulatory approval.

The revival of old antibiotics (fosfomycin, colistin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole combination, tetracycline) against extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing and MDR Gram-negative pathogens, MRSA and VRE is already a reality in daily clinical practice (Table 1 ) [11] . Nebulized antibiotics are used as an adjunctive treatment to IV route in MDR/ ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ventilatorassociated tracheobronchitis (VAT) aiming to increase the antibiotic efficacy by delivering high doses to the lung, to reduce drug toxicity and to minimize the risk of resistance [12] . Currently available devices (jet, ultrasonic and vibrating mesh nebulizers) deliver to the lung parenchyma 15-60% of the antibiotic dose placed in the chamber. Several other factors (physicochemical/pharmacologic antibiotic properties, patient's parameters and variability, ventilator and circuit parameters) are important in order to maximize antibiotic delivery and reduce residual loss of the drug [13] . Currently, two randomised clinical trials on MDR/VAP treatment with nebulized antibiotics are ongoing: the amikacin inhale program (BAYER ® ) and the IASIS program (Cardeas Pharma ® ). The former program in the USA and Europe includes two identical, superiority phase III, prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled safety and efficacy trials. A specially formulated amikacin inhalation solution is used in combination with IV therapy, powered to demonstrate superiority over standard IV therapy through an on-ventilator or hand-held pulmonary drug delivery system (PDDS). The IASIS program (Cardeas Pharma ® ) includes a randomized placebo-controlled study adjunctive to IV antibiotics using a specially formulated amikacin (300 mg)-fosfomycin (120 mg) inhalation solution through an eFlow Inline Nebulizer system (PARI eFlow techology) aiming to improve the outcome of MDR/ VAP and to shorten ventilator days [14] . However, in this study the adjunctive aerosol therapy compared to standard of care IV antibiotics in patients with Gram-negative VAP was ineffective to improve clinical outcomes despite reducing bacterial burden. Today, a modern approach of treatment with antibiotics in critically ill patients is based on adequate exposure according to PK/PD properties aimed at a more personalized dosing and on prolonged or continuous infusion mainly of various beta-lactams. This treatment approach aims to reduce the mortality of infected patients, to increase the efficacy of antibiotics, to overcome the potential resistance and to minimize the toxicity associated with antibiotics [15, 16] .",29.76280425469578,12.10579581328407

There may be sufficient bulk oxygen source on site, but the flow of oxygen may become limited in some treatment spaces. For these situations, additional means to deliver oxygen to treatment spaces will be necessary. 41 Compressed oxygen, such as the commonly used E cylinder (644 L) or H cylinder (6,900 L) can meet short-term oxygen needs. However, it is logistically difficult to have enough oxygen for many patients provided by compressed gas cylinders. Each patient who uses 4 L/min of oxygen requires 5,760 L of gaseous oxygen per day, nearly an H cylinder per day.

In our recent study of airflow around oxygen masks during oxygen therapy, exhaled air from the mask can travel up to 0.4 m on each side of the patient [29] . In the present study, both the use of oxygen therapy and BIPAP ventilation imposed a significant risk for nosocomial spread of SARS in the final combined model (cutoff value, 3 cases), and use of oxygen therapy also significantly increased the risk in models with higher cutoff values. We did not have enough details about oxygen therapy modalities given to the index patients to allow a more refined analysis regarding the types of masks or cannulae and flow rate of oxygen supply in this study. Proper capturing (enclosure, containment, and local exhaust) and filtering (high-efficiency particulate air filter) of exhaled or expelled air should be imple- mented if oxygen and BIPAP ventilation must be used for clinical reasons. The mechanical maneuvers and procedures associated with resuscitation can generate large amounts of aerosols that are potentially infectious, especially during intubation of the airway and manual ventilation.

Data from these surveys are used for myriad purposes. One clear goal is to use these data to improve the quality of the care and services provided to patients. Continuous process improvement activities in hospitals are driven by the information provided by patients about their perceptions of the care and services they received. 72 The literature is replete with examples of improvements in clinical care driven by feedback provided by patients. Some of the most notable examples include: enhancing communication among the health care team to improve patient outcomes and processes, 73, 74, 75, 76 improving pain management, 66, 77 and providing useful and timely discharge instructions. 78, 79, 80 Patient survey data also are used to inform state and federal health care policy and as a measure of the quality of care delivered for hospital reimbursement purposes. The Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS), a survey tool administered by most hospitals in the United States, is used to guide Medicare reimbursement, as well as for public reporting of the quality of individual hospitals. 81 Accrediting organizations such as the Joint Commission, the College of American Pathologists, and the American Association of Blood Banks require that some aspect of the patient experience be evaluated as part of their accreditation programs. Recent advances in the science of patient-focused survey techniques, coupled with the maturation of hospital-based quality improvement strategies, have led to improvements in clinical outcomes as a result of patient survey activities. 68, 82 Historically, patients' interactions with the health care system were assessed using tools that asked a patient to rate his/her satisfaction with the care and services provided. Surveys that elicit a person's satisfaction are designed to measure the difference between a person's expectations and/or needs and her or his experiences. 73 Crow and colleagues describe satisfaction as a relative conceptd where satisfaction is wholly dependent on the individual's construct and perspective. 83 The fact that these perceptions may be highly disparate can be illustrated by the following example. Two patients arrive at the emergency room, both with severe upper respiratory symptoms. Each patient waits 3 hours to be seen. The care provided to each patient is comparable and the clinical outcomes of the visits are identical. However, despite the similarities of their clinical experiences and outcomes, each patient's relative satisfaction with the encounter may differ substantially. One patient, who has prior experience with the system and perhaps has private insurance and ready access to the health care delivery system, reports a very low satisfaction with the encounter because, in his view, he had to wait too long to be seen by a physician. The other patient, uninsured, inexperienced with the system, and who has had infrequent access to medical care, rated the interaction as highly satisfactory because he expected that he would be denied care and, even if not denied care, that his wait would be lengthy. In this example both patients received the same care, both had effectively identical clinical outcomes, but their perceived experiences were vastly divergent, due entirely to individual expectations.",21.943281255038627,9.944163011168655

HCT recipients appeared to be more affected than patients with HM. Although respiratory copathogens were frequently detected, the clinical outcomes of these patients were similar to those without copathogens. The mortality rate of HCT recipients by day 90 after developing HCoV LRTD was similar to rates seen with established respiratory pathogens including RSV, influenza virus, and PIV ( Figure 3 and Table 6 ) [16] [17] [18] . All 4 HCoV strains were identified in BAL samples regardless of the presence of copathogens, and at least 2 HCoV strains were present nearly half of the year. SARS and MERS are recognized as highly human-pathogenic coronaviruses, causing acute, severe, frequently fatal LRTD [20] [21] [22] . Although 4 other strains of HCoV (229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1) are also human pathogens, the clinical impact of HCoV LRTD remains unclear, especially in immunocompromised patients [4, 14, 23] . A previous prospective study with weekly nasal surveillance sampling during the first 100 days after HCT demonstrated prolonged HCoV shedding in the upper respiratory tract (>3 weeks) in half of subjects including asymptomatic patients [8] . In addition, respiratory copathogens were identified in more than half the episodes in this study (57%). Given the prolonged asymptomatic shedding and frequent detection of respiratory copathogens, attributing poor clinical outcomes to HCoV in the lower respiratory tract may be difficult. In the current study, follow-up BAL procedures were not performed to assess prolonged shedding in the lower respiratory tract; however, a prior study that included only 4 patients with cancer demonstrated that only 1 of 10 cases had HCoV detected in follow-up BAL specimens, arguing against asymptomatic prolonged shedding in the lower respiratory tract [14] . More data are needed to define shedding duration in the immunocompromised population. In our study, clinical outcomes including intensity of respiratory support, days alive without hospitalization, and mortality were not significantly different between patients with and without other copathogens, suggesting that HCoV in the lower respiratory tract can contribute to severity of LRTD regardless of copathogens. Lung tissue from 1 patient was positive for HCoV by RT-PCR. This patient subsequently developed prolonged oxygen requirement, which also supports the potential pathogenicity of HCoV.",21.015549626915117,8.574546403128863

The decision to place the ventilators with end users accomplished the goals of having the ventilators in the field where they would be readily available and maintained and could be utilized in day-to-day emergent interfacility and intrafacility transports. The supplemental oxygen component of the program provides low-flow oxygen within the community-based alternate care facilities that are supported by state legislation during mass casualty events and public health emergencies. Critical to this effort was state support and legislation as well as the effective use of sub-state public health regions to support planning and command and control response activities. Within the regions, coalitions supporting this effort included a core group of critical partners providing medical control and subject matter expertise and multiple supportive agencies and NGOs. Space included public schools, college facilities, community centers, and NGO facilities. Staff comprised community volunteer groups, the state Metropolitan Medical Response System (MMRS) team, hospitals, private practices, and other practitioners. Supplies included a combination of state-purchased equipment and supplies, with an emphasis on high-priority coordination with state and local vendors for oxygen equipment and supplies.

Early appropriate parenteral antibiotic administration has been demonstrated to improve patient outcomes, particularly in patients at a higher risk of death. 8 The majority of patients that die with severe CAP tend to do so from complications of multiorgan failure rather than from primary respiratory failure alone and often require renal replacement therapy, invasive circulatory monitoring, and support. Adherence to protocols such as those produced by the BTS or IDSA/ATS is associated with a reduction in overall mortality. 2, 9 Respiratory Patients with respiratory failure despite high-flow oxygen therapy can be managed with non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or invasive ventilation. 10 NIV is of particular benefit in those patients who are immunosuppressed, have underlying obstructive lung disease or Pneumocystis jiroveci infection. A lower Pa O2 =FIO 2 ratio and bilateral alveolar infiltrates suggesting acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are independent predictors of NIV failure and in such patient groups, progression to invasive mechanical ventilation should be considered at an early stage. Early Severe community-acquired pneumonia identification of a failed NIV trial is important as several trials have demonstrated poorer outcomes in patients requiring intubation after a prolonged unsuccessful NIV trial. Most patients with severe CAP will require intubation and mechanical ventilation, particularly in the presence of persistent hypoxaemia, severe acidosis, depressed consciousness, or progressive hypercapnia. These patients should be managed with a lung-protective ventilation strategy using low tidal volumes (6 ml kg −1 predicted body weight) and plateau airway pressures <30 cm H 2 O. Although high PEEP levels may improve oxygenation, there is no mortality difference in comparison with ventilation using low PEEP except in ARDS with a Pa O2 =FIO 2 ratio <200 mm Hg. 11 Advanced respiratory rescue techniques including prone ventilation, extra-corporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO 2 R), and extra-corporeal membranous oxygenation (ECMO) should be considered in cases of refractory hypoxaemia or symptomatic hypercarbia. 12",29.03104736884183,13.850419768372289

While there is an abundance of literature documenting corticosteroid related osteonecrosis, there is no consensus as to the relative risk of osteonecrosis after administration of steroids via parenteral, oral, topical, inhaled and other routes. This risk is an important prognostic indicator because identification and conservative intervention can potentially reduce morbidity associated with aggressive surgical treatment of osteonecrosis. This paper provides insight into establishing guidelines related to the risk of developing osteonecrosis as a result of corticosteroid use. Case studies, retrospective studies and prospective studies in humans on different corticosteroids and varied dosages were assessed. Most cases of osteonecrosis are secondary to systemically administered corticosteroids and/or high dose daily therapy, particularly in patients with underlying comorbidities including connective tissue diseases, hyperlipidemia, or previous trauma. Previous case reports of osteonecrosis related to inhaled or topical use of steroids are complicated by the fact that in the great majority of cases, the patients are also treated with systemic steroids prior to the development of osteonecrosis.

[344] [345] [346] The WuScope provided a good glottic view in a morbidly obese patient with adult respiratory distress syndrome and permitted insertion of a suction catheter anterior to the existing nasotracheal tube. The nasotracheal tube was withdrawn, and the replacement oral ETT was easily advanced over the suction catheter with minimal interruption of mechanical ventilation. We think that a visually direct tube exchange with a WuScope, Bullard Scope (Circon, Santa Barbara, CA), Upsher UltraScope (Mercury Medical, Clearwater, FL), or video laryngoscope is preferable to blind passage of an ETT over a flexible bronchoscope or tube exchanger. A hollow tube exchanger, however, would have permitted oxygen insufflation or jet ventilation had desaturation or difficulties with tube advancement occurred. A supraglottic view (in contrast to the infraglottic view provided by a flexible bronchoscope) of the exchange enables identification and correction of an ETT impingement or the outward migration of the exchange catheter. 347 The concept of visually direct tube exchange was assessed retrospectively in a population in whom no view of the larynx could be obtained by direct laryngoscopy. 348 Using one of three indirect laryngoscopes-the Glidescope (Verathon Medical, Bothell WA), Airtraq (Prodol Meditec, Vizcaya, Spain), or McGrath Series 5 (Aircraft Medical, Edinburgh, Scotland)-in conjunction with an AEC, 51 exchanges were performed.

(6) . The timing of steroids was modified according to our experiences in treating the second, third, and fourth patients, whose exacerbation of oxygen demand and chest radiography lesions were not prevented by early steroid use. Moreover, steroids are immunosuppressive. A previous study pointed out that the viral load of SARS Co-V in SARS patients arrived at peak levels at approximately day 10 of disease (5). Steroids were used as an adjunctive therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage that could occur in the later stage of disease (12) . Using steroids was also a risk factor for subsequent nosocomial infection (13) . For all these reasons, we delayed the use of steroids. Among the 65 patients who received steroids as the treatment protocol, 15 (23.1%) had rebound or persistence of fever after initial steroid use. This fever rebound is less frequent than in prior reports (43.3%-85.3%) (5, 6) . However, the overall death rate in our study was similar to that reported from Hong Kong (7%-20.9%) (3, 5) . Comparing the treatment results of our study and previous ones is difficult because of different case definitions, patient backgrounds, and disease severity, as well as obscure descriptions about complications in SARS patients in previous reports. All our patients had severe cases. Therefore, the best timing of starting steroid usage and the total duration of steroid usage in SARS patients to improve treatment outcome remain unclear and need further study. Hemophagocytotic syndrome was documented in our second patient by bone marrow biopsy (14) . Her initial clinical signs and symptoms included fever, severe leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Her hemophagocytotic syndrome was relieved after using IVIG. This treatment was suggested because of its immune modulating effect (15) . The other 21 patients in whom severe leukopenia or thrombocytopenia developed in the first week of disease also received IVIG therapy empirically. IVIG appeared effective for controlling leukopenia and thrombocytopenia: after infusion, the patients' leukocyte and platelet counts increased to a significantly higher level (p = 0.002). The increase of leukocyte and platelet counts might have prevented some further complications directly resulting from severe leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, such as infection and tendency to bleed.

We have confirmed prior reports that molecular tests increase sensitivity and rapidity of detection when compared with traditional methods 4, [14] [15] [16] [17] 27 . However, increased sensitivity may not always improve clinical outcomes and influence clinician behavior. A few randomized trials have studied the impact of viral testing on patient management [28] [29] [30] . Bonner et al showed no differences in management for children with respiratory viral illness, except for influenza. Another randomized trial of influenza rapid testing showed that the use of a rapid test did not influence clinician behavior 31 . Molecular testing can increase detection of Group 2 viruses like rhinovirus and enterovirus, but in the absence of available therapeutics, unless a positive test limits antibiotic usage or further diagnostic testing, the testing results may not change the course of treatment or improve patient outcomes. Recent research suggests that there may be an association between rhinovirus induced wheezing and childhood asthma [32] [33] [34] , but the role and availability of antiviral therapy in these children remains in question. Rapid detection of respiratory viruses is used to isolate contagious patients to prevent transmission of viruses between hospitalized patients. Increased detection of PCR positive but culture negative patients may have negative consequences, such as unnecessary isolation of hospitalized patients.

Paediatric circuits typically deliver a lower maximum flow of up to 25 L min -1 . The WHO advises that HFNO should be used for selected adult patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure 56 and that HFNO can reduce the need for intubation. 57 Patients using HFNO should be in a monitored area and anaesthetists should be available to intubate the patient should they clinically deteriorate, or not improve after a short trial of ~1 hour. 56 Exhaled aerosol dispersion of viral load during HFNO is of concern for the personal safety of staff caring for these patients in close proximity. A number of studies have measured air dispersion during HFNO 58, 59 , although precisely how this relates to viral droplet or aerosol particles remains unclear. Mean (SD) dispersion distances increased from 65 mm (15) to 172 mm (33) as flow increased from 10 to 60 L m -1 . This increased to 620 mm laterally if the HFNO fit was loose. 59 Consequently, current WHO recommendations suggest that HFNO should be avoided where airborne precautions and negative-pressure, airborne infection isolation rooms are not available. 60, 56 Both non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and HFNO should be considered to be aerosolising procedures. 58, 60 The use of NIV has previously been associated with the transmission of virus to healthcare workers during the previous SARS outbreak 61 , however since that outbreak in 2003 improvements in mask design may have reduced this risk. Measured air dispersion with a full-facemask continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) system has been subsequently compared to CPAP with nasal pillows. 59 Air dispersion with full-facemask CPAP was negligible at both low pressure (5 cm H 2 O) and high pressure ventilation (20 cm H 2 O). CPAP with nasal pillows performed worse with a maximum mean (SD) dispersion of 207 mm (11) at 5 cm H 2 O, up to a dispersion distance of 332 mm (34) at 20 cm H 2 O. Therefore patients on CPAP should ideally be cared for in negative pressure facilities with staff wearing PPE appropriate for airborne contamination. 62 The New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG) recommend that where necessary, patients using NIV should be isolated in side rooms with doors closed. 62 If necessary, several patients, all of whom should have confirmed COVID-19, can be cared for in a ""cohort bay"". Appropriate filters should be used in all CPAP and NIV circuits. 61 High-flow nasal oxygen has been used to prolong the apnoea phase during tracheal intubation and to reduce intubation rates in acute respiratory failure. In China it has been used in patients with COVID-19 [63] , but there are no studies looking at virus spread by aerosol droplet production and transmission with HFNO. Environmental bacterial contamination has been investigated comparing high-flow nasal therapy to face mask in critically ill patients with pneumonia [64] . This was not associated with increased air or contact surface contamination by either Gram-negative or total bacteria, and these findings were supported by systematic review [65] .

A typical ICU solution relies upon isolating contagious patients in neutral or negative pressure side rooms, possibly with neutral pressure anti-rooms. This engineering solution permits flexibility in the clinical management of ventilation for infected patients, including aerosol generating procedures such as NIV and HFNO. 61 However, the rapid mismatch in ratio of intensive care beds to patients needing critical care has led to a rapid need to develop surge capacity 41 PPE for COVID-19 has moved from a ""one size fits all"" to risk stratified approach. [27] [28] [29] Similarly ICU supportive management for COVID-19 is adopting an adaptive approach, accounting for forthcoming trials of CPAP/NIV 61 and consideration of HFNO, which the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society (ANZICS) COVID-19 guideline has recently advocated. 63 There are no randomised or propensity matched studies on early versus late intubation for COVID-19, hence data on non-invasive forms of ventilatory support remain anecdotal. Despite the infection control dilemmas, cohorting of patients into ward areas and avoiding intubation presents a viable treatment strategy that has additional advantages of optimising resource utilisation, particularly nurse to patient ratios. These benefits need to be balanced by two factors: PPE for staff and the burden of increased oxygen flow required. 64 Impact on oxygen supplies for widespread use of non-invasive ventilation is likely to be considerable. Some non-invasive ventilatory modalities are very oxygen hungry, using the high flow to provide inspiratory pressure. Once these devices are deployed over and above basal consumption plus an increase in ventilator usage, the maximum flow rate through the Vacuum Insulated Evaporators (VIE) oxygen stores can quickly be reached. This results in oxygen failure to the entire hospital starting at the sites most distal to the regulator, with the only remedy being to limit the number of devices pulling oxygen through the regulator or to use more efficient equipment.",30.24675866526892,9.917059992967898

It is diffi cult to argue against the overall benefi cial outcomes of a program encompassing several measures, all aimed to reduce ABT, improve clinical outcomes, and reduce costs. Nevertheless, although the effects of single measures are mostly known, we cannot really anticipate the effect of a complex of measures, possibly being addictive, synergistic, or even paradoxically counteracting. Studies involving a large population are needed in order to address this question, in the form of CRTs, targeting clinically relevant outcomes, or in the form of registries collecting safety and effectiveness data on patients managed in a PBM program . So far, initiatives involving local institutions have demonstrated the feasibility of implementing PBM programs, achieving extremely relevant goals such as fewer transfusion administered, reduced mortality and complications, lenght of stay (LOS), readmissions, and costs (Kotzé et al. 2012 ; Leahy et al. 2012 ) .

The need for more sensitivity has been questioned, because hc2 has already been shown to be sensitive, but not highly specific, for the development of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or overt malignancy. The presence of high-risk DNA below the detection limit of hc2 seems to be associated with a low risk for malignancy. 9 However, new information suggests that infections acquired in the early years of sexual activity may reactivate with aging. 11 If this is supported by further studies, more sensitive assays might be indicated. There is also a suggestion that unusual HPV strains may cause cervical carcinoma or precursor lesions in restricted populations. 12 Thus, the strains included in the assay may need periodic review.

Cidofovir, a mononucleotide analog of cytosine, reduces viral load and improves clinical symptoms in patients with hematopoietic stem cell transplant and invasive adenoviral disease compared with historical controls. 169 In a case series of 7 immunocompetent adults with adenovirus pneumonia who were administered cidofovir within 48 hours of diagnosis, all survived and had radiographic resolution of pneumonia by 21 days. 170 Brincidofovir, a lipid-linked derivative of cidofovir, is currently under phase III clinical trials in hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients. 171 Pooled human IVIG has high levels of neutralizing antibodies against adenoviruses and can be used as adjunctive therapy. 169 In a retrospective review, the use of corticosteroids in immunocompetent patients with adenovirus pneumonia did not show any benefit. 172 SUMMARY Respiratory viruses are a common cause of severe pneumonia and ARDS in adults. The advent of new diagnostic technologies, particularly multiplex reaction-PCR, have increased the recognition of viral respiratory infections in critically ill adults. Supportive care for adults with ARDS caused by respiratory viruses is similar to the care of patients with ARDS from other causes. Although antiviral therapy is available for some respiratory viral infections, further research is needed to determine which groups of patients would benefit. ",22.400123580115643,9.642193693256539

The effectiveness of cough is dependent on the ability to generate high flow velocities and the interaction of the flowing air with airway secretions. 173 In general, cough is more effective in clearing large airways as opposed to smaller peripheral airways. Cough efficiency is affected by the integrity of the neurophysiologic pathway of cough as well as physical aspects, such as respiratory muscle strength and mucus quality. Normal mucus acts to improve airway clearance and protect receptors from irritants, and changes in the amount or tenacity of mucus can both mechanically stimulate cough receptors and cause flow limitation. 173, 197, 198 Cough is often less effective as a clearance mechanism when airway disease is present.",24.260443044039807,9.627643640157203

Immunogenicity of biologics in context ☆,"The use of cytokines, growth factors, and monoclonal antibodies in clinical settings is often associated with the development of antibodies directed against therapeutic proteins. Therefore, diminishing the immunogenicity of therapeutic proteins without hindering their function may improve clinical outcomes [72] . Epitope mapping and evaluation of the potential for immunogenicity on an ""immunogenicity scale"" is one approach; the same tools can be used to identify clusters of epitopes for removal. As described previously, reduction in T cell epitope content has been associated with reduced immunogenicity. This can be accomplished by substitution of key amino acids in the T cell epitope sequences which abrogate binding to HLA and thereby attenuate epitope potential to trigger a T cell response. Altered T cell epitopes no longer bind to HLA. Therefore, uncovering the immunogenic regions and specific amino acid residues involved in binding to HLA can allow protein therapeutics developers to abrogate T-dependent antibody responses, reducing the immunogenicity of their candidate drug. Such epitope-modifications are easily evaluated in vitro and in vivo prior to release of the protein therapeutic for clinical development. This method of reducing immunogenicity, also known as de-immunization, is described in detail in [72] .",21.975661314996955,10.426259125387178

Unfortunately, there is currently no definitive laboratory marker of immune reconstitution that would predict infectious risk that could be used to tailor infection prophylaxis. It is likely that the degree of immune recovery measured by various assays is associated with clinical outcomes including infection rates, based on retrospective studies that included relatively small numbers of patients (Table 4 ). However, a rigorous proof of the association is lacking. Moreover, most of the published studies have focused on the association of immune assay results with outcomes that can be clearly defined and captured (eg, survival or NRM) rather than with infections. Additionally, information from the published studies is limited because of publication bias (ie, there is a tendency to publish studies that find an association rather than negative studies). Tools are now available to precisely monitor viral-specific (Epstein-Barr virus [EBV] , CMV) immune responses (HLA tetramers, interferon-g production assays), and may help in understanding this issue [75] .

In addition to resistance, it is now becoming increasingly recognized that the host's response to infection may in and of itself contribute to considerable reductions in antimicrobial exposures due to alterations in the cardiovascular, renal, hepatic and pulmonary systems [49] . A recent ICU study has highlighted the potential impact of adaptations in the renal system as more than 65% of these critically ill patients manifested augmented renal function, defined by a creatinine clearance C130 mL/min/1.73 m2, during their initial week of hospitalization. This finding is particularly concerning because the backbones of most antimicrobial regimens in the ICU such as penicillins, cephalosporins or carbapenems are predominantly cleared via the renal route [50] . To this end, Roberts and colleagues have recently reported the results of a prospective, multinational pharmacokinetic study to assess b-lactam exposures in the critically ill population [51] . In that study, the investigators noted that among 248 infected patients, 16% did not achieve adequate antimicrobial exposures and that these patients were 32% less likely to have a satisfactory infection outcome. While a personalized approach to dosing that is based on a given patient's specific pharmacokinetic profile for b-lactams is not yet the standard of practice as might be expected for the aminoglycosides and vancomycin due to lack of routinely available drug assays, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) profile of b-lactams as well as other agents may be incorporated into treatment algorithms to optimize outcomes. To this end, we developed and implemented pharmacodynamically optimized b-lactam regimens which incorporated the use of higher doses as well as prolonged or continuous infusion administration technique to enhance in vivo exposures in patients with VAP [52]. Utilization of these regimens was shown to improve the clinical, microbiologic and economic outcomes associated with this ICU based infection. Clinicians need to recognize that in the early stages of infection, alterations in metabolic pathways as well as the reduced susceptibility of target pathogens may result in inadequate antimicrobial exposures if conventional dosing regimens are utilized. Therefore, pharmacodynamically optimized dosing regimens should be given to all patients empirically and once the pathogen, susceptibility and clinical response are known, local stewardship practices may be employed to redefine an appropriate regimen for the patient [53].",23.30473360900428,9.218715349033685

We added a rating scale to the overall confidence in the KD diagnosis, which allowed us to gauge the overall clinical impression on the day of treatment for KD. There are potential benefits to standardizing documentation of the clinical presentation of KD on the day of treatment. First, the standardization of data collection allows for reassessment of the diagnostic certainty before proceeding with subsequent treatments for those who fail to respond to initial IVIG. This is important before considering additional doses of IVIG, because adverse effects can be dose dependent, such as hemolytic anemia [5] [6] [7] . Second, more precise associations of clinical outcomes with the type of KD, especially incomplete KD, can be made using this approach. Utilization of the AHA algorithm for incomplete KD has been shown to improve the diagnosis of KD in children who developed CAA [8] , but the accuracy of the diagnosis for those with incomplete KD who do not meet these criteria is less clear. Among children with incomplete KD who did not meet the AHA criteria and whose initial echocardiograms were normal in this cohort, the IVIG resistance rate remained relatively high at 11%, but none developed CAA, and they had a trend towards lower rate of periungual peeling than other groups. Finally, utilization of this approach can allow for more precise epidemiologic data for the incidence and characteristics of IVIG resistance. Intravenous immunoglobulin resistance rates may vary [9] , but these rates may be related to a lower likelihood of an accurate diagnosis of KD initially in some patients.",22.261752409292438,7.65809797410529

Priority has, therefore, been given to avoidance of IMV by use of non-invasive oxygenation or ventilation devices ( figure 6 ). However, failure of NIV 13,41,100 or HFNO 13 was associated with higher mortality, 13 and two older studies even suggested that early IMV was associated with improved survival. 101, 102 Furthermore, because respiratory disease severity or associated organ dysfunctions are usually worse in intubated patients, determining whether the excess mortality in patients on IMV is due to the IMV itself or to the greater severity of the acute illness is difficult. In other words, a focus on avoiding intubation might not be effective, because the need for IMV might identify a group of patients with high disease severity. Overall, five initial oxygenation methods are available for patients with hypoxaemic acute respiratory failure (figure 6). Guidelines from the European Respiratory Society and American Thoracic Society advocate the use of NIV. 101 This recommendation is based mainly on a 2001 single-centre trial in 52 patients, 75 in which mortality was 81% in the group assigned to standard oxygen, the highest ever reported in this setting ( 11 This trial showed neither benefits nor harms from NIV, in sharp contrast with a post-hoc analysis of the trial by Frat and colleagues, 12 which compared outcomes in 82 immunocompromised patients treated with HFNO, NIV, or standard oxygen. In this trial, the IMV and mortality rates were higher in the NIV group compared with the HFNO and standard oxygen groups. These results are consistent with studies reporting an increased risk of failure and mortality in patients receiving NIV for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. 41, 75, 79 Thus, these data raise concerns about the use of NIV in immunocompromised patients with hypoxaemic acute respiratory failure. When first introduced, HFNO seemed a promising alternative to NIV. HFNO is easy to use and delivers humidified warmed oxygen, thereby allowing high flows by improving tolerability and comfort. 104 HFNO improves oxygenation, lowers the respiratory rate, inspiratory effort, 105 HFNO also increases end-expiratory lung volume and dynamic lung compliance. 105 These physiological effects are even more pronounced when increasing flow rates are delivered. 106 However, in a randomised controlled trial in 310 unselected patients with hypoxaemic acute respiratory failure and a PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio ≤300 mm Hg, 107 the number of patients requiring intubation was not significantly reduced with HFNO compared with NIV or standard oxygen. However, the number of ventilator-free days on day 28 was significantly higher with HFNO, and the hazard ratio for day-90 mortality was lower with HFNO. Five studies evaluated the feasibility and safety of HFNO in immunocompromised patients with acute respiratory failure. In a retrospective single-centre study of 45 patients with haematological malignancies (half were bone marrow transplant recipients, 108 half had recently received systemic chemotherapy, and 42% were neutropenic), HFNO allowed recovery without intubation Figure 6 : Nine oxygenation and ventilation methods Standard oxygen can be administered through a wide array of devices. Low-flow oxygen systems comprise a nasal cannula (or nasal catheters; A) providing supplemental oxygen at flows below the total minute ventilation, leading to oxygen dilution with ambient air and lowering the inspired oxygen concentration. A standard nasal cannula delivers an inspiratory FiO 2 of 0·24-0·44 at supply flows 1-8 L/min, depending on respiratory rate and tidal volume. A humidification device is recommended for flows >4 L/min. Reservoir masks (B) can deliver FiO 2 values of 0·40-0·60 at 5-10 L/min. The reservoir system (~100-300 cm³) stores oxygen. A flow rate >5 L/min must be set to ensure the washout of exhaled gas and avoid CO 2 retention. The non-rebreathing facemask (C) may deliver up to 0·90 FiO 2 at flow settings >10 L/min. It should be used only for short periods, as humidification is difficult and there is also a risk of CO 2 retention if the mask's reservoir bag is allowed to collapse on inspiration. Lastly, the Venturi system (D) mixes oxygen with room air (humidification is not necessary) and provides an accurate and constant FiO 2 despite variations in respiratory rate and tidal volume. It is employed when concern arises about CO 2 retention or when the respiratory drive is inconsistent. High-flow oxygen therapy through nasal prongs or cannulas (high-flow nasal oxygen therapy; E) supplies an exact FiO 2 (up to 1) at a flow equal to or greater than the patient's inspiratory flow demand. Nasal oxygen is administered at a flow rate of up to 60 L/min. It is warmed to body temperature and saturated to full humidity by molecular humidification. Non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation provides ventilator support without an endotracheal tube, using an oronasal (F) or total face (G) mask or a helmet (H). The main non-invasive ventilation mode used in hypoxaemic acute respiratory failure is pressure support; continuous positive airway pressure and bi-level positive airway pressure are used less often. Finally, invasive mechanical ventilation (I) uses a tracheal tube inserted into the trachea under general anaesthesia and a neuromuscular-blocking drug. The tube is then secured to the face or neck and connected to a ventilator. In patients with hypoxaemic acute respiratory failure, intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation are used after failure of standard oxygen and, in some cases, of the aforementioned non-invasive options. FiO 2 = fraction of inspired oxygen. ",24.868207102300996,9.760316665817097

The clinical signs and tolerance of hypoxaemia are usually a function of respiratory symptom duration. For instance, an acute hypoxaemic episode can lead to respiratory distress within a few hours, whereas a subacute or non-acute lung insult of similar magnitude can result in deep hypoxaemia without signs of respiratory distress. Overall, degree of hypoxaemia reflects the extent of lung involvement. Hypoxaemia, measured directly as the PaO 2 on room air or assessed on the basis of the oxygen flow needed to achieve an peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) of 95% or the estimated or calculated ratio of partial pressure arterial oxygen and fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio), has been used for many years to risk-stratify patients and guide ICU admission decisions. Increased oxygen flow has been associated with the need for ICU admission, 10 need for IMV, 10,16 and hospital mortality. 17 Similarly, lower PaO 2 /FiO 2 has been associated with mortality in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, 40 the need for non-invasive ventilation (NIV), 41 or failure of high-flow nasal oxygen therapy (HFNO). 42 Persistent tachypnoea has also been associated with failure of standard oxygen, 42 NIV, 41 or highflow nasal cannula, requiring the imple mentation of another strategy (eg, intubation). 43 No study has evaluated the impact of hyperoxygenation in this setting. 44 Associated organ dysfunctions are best depicted by the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, which has consistently been identified as a determinant of mortality, with higher scores associated with increased mortality. 5, 13, 45 Delayed ICU admission has been associated with increased mortality in immuno comprom ised patients, 14 particularly in those with acute respiratory failure. 10,13,17 Benefits from earlier ICU admission might be the result of the careful clinical assessment, optimal oxygenation strategy, avoidance of potentially harmful investigations, and selection of the least invasive diag nostic tests in ICUs. The characteristics of the underlying immuno suppressive condition are not usually associated with hospital mortality following ICU admission, 46 although variations occur depending on ICU admission policies. A higher proportion of patients admitted to ICU with do-not-resuscitate or do-not-intubate status results in stronger associations between variables reflecting characteristics of disease status and mortality. 47, 48 Performance status and comorbidities have been associated with increased mortality. 13, 14, 49, 50 The effects of initial oxygen ation and ventilation strategy on mortality are discussed later in this Review. Furthermore, as previously mentioned, several studies have assessed the association between the cause of acute respiratory failure and mortality.

However, some authorities have suggested that a less aggressive approach may be acceptable if antibiotics and adjunctive therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) are instituted early [22] . Clindamycin is recommended as an adjunct to penicillin for the treatment of severe invasive Group A Streptococcus disease, including necrotizing infections, during the first few days of treatment-this is supported by the superior activity of clindamycin over penicillin in animal models [19] . However, penicillin should always be given unless there is a history of hypersensitivity. Although supportive data are limited, administration of 1 or 2 doses of IVIG early in the course of STSS is widely recommended. A multicenter, randomized, controlled trial revealed a trend toward a reduction in mortality among recipients, but the study was terminated early because of slow recruitment [23] . IVIG is also recommended by some as adjunctive treatment in severe invasive Group A Streptococcus infections, even in the absence of toxic shock. Management of acute rheumatic fever is primarily symptomatic. Penicillin is generally given to eradicate colonization, although acute infection has usually passed by the time symptoms of acute rheumatic fever develop. Salicylates are used to relieve fever and the pain from arthritis that is often severe. Where necessary, cardiac failure is managed with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Steroids are sometimes used in cases of severe carditis, although there is no evidence that they improve the long-term outcome in RHD.

Zhu et al. [4] most recently described an 87% (20/23 patients) 1-year mortality in patients who developed IPS within 120 days of HCT (study cohort 1997 to 2007) using similar diagnostic criteria. In the analysis by Zhu et al. [4] , median time to death following diagnosis was just 9 days (range, 3 to 92 days) compared with 43 days in our cohort. Although this may be influenced by longer follow-up in our study, we believe this provides evidence that recent improvements in supportive care along with advances in transplant practices may be responsible for improved short-term mortality. Treatment decisions were at the discretion of the provider, and assessing efficacy of novel treatment strategies was not the aim of this study. However, it should be noted that patients diagnosed with IPS typically received high-dose systemic steroids (2 to 4 mg/kg) and, in select cases of refractory disease, received the addition of etanercept, a soluble TNF-a-binding protein (0.4 mg/kg given twice weekly for a maximum of 8 doses) [38] [39] [40] . Despite improvements in short-term outcomes, 1-year mortality remains high. Firm conclusions cannot be drawn about this observation, but we speculate that profound morbidity resulting from IPS drives poor long-term recovery, and our data confirm that short-term survivors of IPS remain a high-risk group of allogeneic HCT recipients. Finally, the associations we found between the need for mechanical ventilation or other organ injury with poor IPS outcomes are consistent with results reported in larger series of HCT recipients [41, 42] . Organ injury likely reflects overall illness severity and not necessarily a distinct pathologic entity, but these observations are important and may aid physicians as they counsel patients and families regarding prognosis.",23.71240611845763,9.100483027260292

Renal outcome was worse for co-infected patients compared to patients with isolated HCVglomerular disease and similar creatinine values. A higher percentage had a more rapid progression to ESRD: 71% progressed rapidly to advanced renal failure and 50% required dialysis after a median interval of two months after biopsy. A similarly poor course in coinfected patients was reported by Stokes et al. (16) . In addition, mortality was high (57%), and median combined renal/patient survival was 5.8 months (17) . The clinical course more closely resembled that of HIVAN rather than HCV-glomerular disease (19) . Although the clinical course of isolated HCV-associated renal disease can vary dramatically, most patients do not progress rapidly to ESRD. The authors speculated that the combined influences of complex glomerular lesions, higher baseline renal insufficiency, greater viral burden, and black race may promote more rapid renal deterioration and higher mortality in HIV-infected patients with HCV-associated glomerular disease (17) .",22.622735365241297,9.287490713997022

The true clinical burden of these five viruses, their contribution to renal disease, and their impact on morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected patients have not been well defined. Given the prevalence of these viruses in the general population, the increased susceptibility to viral infections and increased likelihood of reactivation of latent viruses in HIV-infected patients, complications related to these viruses may be more common than currently appreciated. There are challenges in diagnosing these viral infections that may contribute to their under-recognition. A major issue may be lack of diagnostic suspicion, as many renal diseases affecting these patients have similar and overlapping presentations. Also, interpretation of diagnostic tests may not be straightforward, since it can be difficult to differentiate viral isolates that are responsible for disease from those that may represent silent reactivation or persistent infection. For many of the viruses, it is not known what level of viremia and viruria is considered normal, abnormal, and pathologic in HIV-infected patients. There is also underutilization of renal biopsies in this patient population, which would help to differentiate renal disease associated with these viruses from other etiologies. Large-scale studies that systematically monitor for these viruses in the blood, urine, and kidney specimens of HIV-infected patients along with CD4 cell count and HIV viral load would be beneficial to understand the relationship between markers of immune function, co-infection, disease manifestations, risk factors and outcomes.",22.937354618250037,8.54844628957763

The choice of endpoints for therapeutic studies in respiratory viral diseases will depend on the clinical setting and population studied.

In order to construct these endpoints, we need to better categorize severity of disease in those hospitalized with a respiratory virus. The National Early Warning Score (NEWS) was developed in the United Kingdom for identifying patients at risk for deterioration or escalation of care. Several studies have used or proposed using NEWS to define a population with severe influenza, but this score has not been validated for this purpose. A retrospective study was conducted at Northwestern University Hospital evaluating 315 patients hospitalized with influenza, and were categorized by NEWS (1-3, 4-6, > 6) and an ordinal scale of clinical outcomes (death, in the ICU on a mechanical ventilator, in the ICU but not on a mechanical ventilator, hospitalized on supplemental oxygen, hospitalized not on supplemental oxygen, discharge but has not resumed normal activities, and discharged with resumption of normal activities). Prior studies had demonstrated early treatment led to better clinical outcomes, and this was used as a surrogate for therapeutic benefit from antivirals in the current analysis. When analyzed using an ordinal scale endpoint, a higher baseline NEWS was associated with greater but later therapeutic benefit from neuraminidase inhibitors (NAI) based treatment. However, recruitment may be affected as there were fewer numbers of patients as the NEWS increased (Ison, 2016) .",20.66698921527067,8.43481556457241

However, many of the current clinical trials evaluating antimicrobial therapy have methodologic limitations (eg, diagnostic criteria, comparators, endpoints, outcomes measures) that preclude them from being considered as evidence. Furthermore, the trends in antimicrobial resistance have changed dramatically over the past 10 years, which has affected the applicability of evidence from older clinical trials. While a large meta-analysis 20 recently was conducted to evaluate the role of antimicrobial therapy (in general, and the role of specific agents/ classes) in ABRS, many of the individual trials were conducted prior to the widespread resistance that is currently reported in S pneumoniae and H influenzae. As a result, the findings from this meta-analysis may not be applicable to the current treatment of ABRS. 160 The methodology used in the present guidelines for evaluating antimicrobial therapy for ABRS does, however, take into account the current high levels of antibiotic-resistant organisms. In the absence of current evidence, it becomes more challenging to identify optimal therapy for ABRS. Rather than subjectively compiling a rank order of antimicrobial agents based on in vitro activity data and expert consensus, we utilized a more objective methodology to assessing treatment options. This approach involved the use of a mathematical model-the Poole therapeutic outcomes model-to predict treatment outcomes in ABRS. The therapeutic outcomes model was extrapolated from work originally conducted by Marchant et al, 161 involving the correlation between in vivo potency of various antimicrobial agents with clinical outcomes using double-tympanocentesis methodology in otitis media. In these studies, Marchant et al observed that nonbacterial factors can result in discrepancies between bacteriologic and clinical outcomes. For example, an agent with a 100% bacteriologic cure rate will not necessarily have a 100% clinical cure rate because some patients will continue to experience symptoms re- sulting from nonbacterial factors (eg, viral infection, persistent middle ear effusion). Conversely, antimicrobial agents with relatively poor bacteriologic cure rates often appear to be more effective than expected because of the high rate of spontaneous resolution of symptoms. As a result, highly efficacious agents generally have only slightly better impact on clinical outcomes (ie, symptoms) compared with less-efficacious agents, despite more dramatic differences in bacteriologic outcomes. The therapeutic outcomes model is a tool to help predict the likelihood of bacteriologic success with particular antimicrobial agents by accounting for various factors including: (1) the proportion of patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and a positive sinus aspirate; (2) the clinical resolution of disease in the culture-negative patient group; (3) the distribution of pathogens frequently encountered in ABRS; (4) the spontaneous resolution rate associated each pathogen; and (5) the in vitro susceptibility of the predominant sinusitis pathogens to antimicrobial agents at PK/PD breakpoints ( Figure 13 ). The therapeutic outcomes model also can predict overall clinical outcomes for the total patient group (ie, those with either bacterial or nonbacterial disease).",21.725759948945566,9.619431555251065

[35] [36] [37] When healing relationships are embedded into the culture and leadership of an organization, it is possible to have a healing organization. Healing organizations create an expectation that staff are knowledgeable, skilled, caring practitioners who demonstrate mutual respect, practice honest communication, refer appropriately, share a commitment to the concept of healing, work as a team, create integrated plans of patient care, and focus on treating the whole person regardless of their individual specialty training. 38 Healing organizations have the ability to implement effective and efficient integrative care teams and to provide a range of interconnected services that support patients and their families seamlessly throughout the continuum of care. This is accomplished through transformational and mindful leadership, a clear and focused mission and values statement, and formal policies embracing a healing environment and fostering healing behaviors. A healing organization adopts a philosophy of person-centered care and participatory teamwork and provides the technology, equipment, facilities, and supplies that support healing practices and regular monitoring, evaluation, and continuous improvement. 2 These types of clinical teams are shown to cut costs, improve clinical outcomes, reduce mortality, enhance staff morale, and improve patient satisfaction. 39, 40 ",23.524081435465604,9.122316931518244

With natural in vivo FCoV infection, different clinical outcomes (besides resistance to FCoV) have been described: persistent carrier, transiently infection and development of FIP [2] . It is not clear what the viral and host factors are that determine the different clinical outcomes. Since in the inoculation study the same strain (FIPV-79-1146) was used and considering the fact that in the field cats are often infected with the same strain of FCoV, it is likely that genomic variation between cats contributes to a different clinical outcome. A genetic background was also suggested during a field study with pure-bred cats, in which it was shown that susceptibility to FIP is indeed inheritable [7] . A possible explanation for the different disease progression is the possibility of the cats to develop an efficient T-cell response [3] . However, it could also be that the susceptibility of the monocytes to FIPV plays a role, considering the results presented here. It would be interesting to investigate if cats that show a different outcome to an experimental or natural infection also show different infection kinetics in vitro.

Moreover, the second infection from infected patients particularly within general hospitals frequently takes places due to improperly hospitalized and/or quarantined patients. Accordingly, it becomes a great concern to accommodate safer ventilation system in general hospital wards against such airborne transmitted viruses. It is also a recent trend that many urban general hospitals are designed and constructed as high-rises. If a virus is transmitted through uncontrolled air movement within a hospital and then infected other patients or healthy visitors, it might be impossible to control the spread of the disease. Thus research has been preceded scrutinizing stack effect on the indoor airborne virus transmission in large hospitals by conducting both the field measurement and numerical analysis according to the outdoor temperature and the releasing vertical points of the tracer gas assumed as a viral contaminant. In the field measurement of a high-rise hospital, the indoor airflow was affected by the stack effect of vertical chute of the building. The numerical simulation was verified by comparing its prediction results and the field measurement data.

The time difference suggested that the preferential decreased Th17 population in early S-OIV-infected patients may not simply be a direct result of IFN-induced attrition, an alternative explanation for the data is that the committed Th17 cells were still in peripheral blood with down-regulated synthesis of IL-17 in presence of IFN-α or these Th17 cells migrated into the lung tissue or lymph nodes.

Programs should especially consider tracking the CDI rate because it is a concretely measurable outcome and is associated with increased LOS and cost and death among children, and ASP efforts have been found to reduce the incidence of CDIs [24, 25] . Tracking CDI rates among children is not without some difficulty, however, given the various diagnostic tests available and the prevalence of C difficile colonization among young children [26] . Other potentially relevant clinical outcomes include antibiotic appropriateness and incidence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens.

The causative organism is a new coronavirus that induces symptoms of an atypical pneumonia, but some patients rapidly progress towards adult respiratory distress syndrome. This results in significant hypoxia. The infection may produce a unique set of problems if encountered with pregnancy. It may cause a miscarriage in early pregnancy, IUGR, fetal distress and intra-uterine death. Maternal oxygen saturation should be maintained above 95%, and mothers should be nursed in the upright position. Women on ventilators are best nursed in the left lateral position in order to maximize uteroplacental blood flow. Cardiotocography with ultrasound assessment of fetal growth and Doppler assessment of blood flow are recommended as fetal monitoring measures. SARS is a very contagious disease and appropriate isolation and infection control protocols are necessary in order to avoid accidental infection of the medical staff. A small group of health professionals should be allocated to look after infected patients, and they should be periodically monitored for signs of early infection. The risk of infection is particularly high at the time of vaginal or operative delivery, and additional precautions such as negative pressure air circulation are recommended. Broadspectrum antibiotics (Clarithromycin and co-amoxyclav in pregnancy) are recommended to prevent concomitant bacterial infection. Ribavarin, an antiviral agent, is tried in SARS with clinical deterioration. However, it is a known teratogen in animals, so it should be used in pregnancy with extreme caution. Termination of pregnancy should be recommended in women exposed to this agent in early pregnancy. High doses of steroids are also recommended in sick patients. Bacterial infection as a side-effect of maternal steroid therapy is known, and should be guarded against. SARS virus infection may be particularly severe in pregnancy, and pregnancy termination is an option. Early delivery will reduce the oxygen requirements, and this may be vitally important in critically ill patients. Rapid deterioration, multi-organ failure, fetal compromise and failure to maintain maternal oxygenation, even on ventilator support, along with other obstetric reasons constitute indications for early delivery.",20.52158203356247,9.515932622765236

Improved oxygenation has not been shown to correlate with improved clinical outcomes in living patients in many studies. For example, randomized trials testing inhaled NO, prone posture, recruitment maneuvers that employ high levels of PEEP, and direct measurement of transpulmonary pressures all achieved significant gas exchange improvement, but in each case failed to show mortality benefit [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] . Lung recruitment strategies utilized by some organ donor networks have included trials of increased PEEP to levels of 30-40 cm H 2 O for several minutes followed by a return to baseline PEEP levels. Such recruitment strategies have not been shown to change mortality in large randomized trials of patients with ALI/ARDS, but do improve oxygenation [35] . A major concern with such recruitment strategies is that when PEEP is reduced to baseline, alveoli will derecruit and recurrent recruitment episodes can lead to shearing stress. Cyclic stretch has been shown to upregulate alveolar epithelial TGF b-1 and interleukin-8 [38] , which in turn may worsen pre-existing lung inflammation. Ischemia-reperfusion injury that occurs during transplant may further compound lung damage. Targeting oxygen levels as the primary criteria for lung donation may be misguided. Infact, hyperoxia induced lung injury is intimately related to an inflammatory cascade activating both cellular apoptosis and necrosis [39] . The impact of specific ventilatory mode, such as volume targeted versus pressure limited strategies, deserves additional comment. Whereas a volume cycled modality that adheres to low tidal volume strategy has the largest data set accrual, alternative modes that achieve target volume have been used in acute lung injury, but do not appear to have measurable impact on outcome. This also implies that pressure targeted modes of ventilation may be acceptable alternatives to volume cycled ventilation, as long as endinspiratory volume targets are not exceeded. Recently, many organ donor centers have moved toward the use of pressure cycled modes such as airway pressure release ventilation (APRV), inverse ratio and bi-level ventilation to improve recruitment. These ventilator settings increase intrathoracic pressure, auto-PEEP and ambient oxygen tension, which may lead to reduced preload, cardiac arrhythmias and hyperoxic lung injury. All pressure targeted modes result in dependent variables of volume and peak flow, and utilization imposes a greater vigilance on the operator to be watchful for fluctuation and regional variability. Purported advantages of pressure targeted modes such as enhanced comfort, decreased dyssynchrony and variable and initial high flow rates that match patient effort are moot in the donor population without spontaneous inspiratory effort. A risk of enhanced barotrauma associated with pressure targeting is suggested by exaggerated inflammatory signs including neutrophil influx in lungs subjected to high flow [25, 28, 29, 38] . There have been no studies in either brain dead or living patients that have shown a superiority of APRV or bilevel over other ventilatory modes.",28.34238123563991,14.043893455304932

This procedure might avoid the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation because it provides high concentrations of humidified oxygen, low levels of positive endexpiratory pressure, and can facilitate the elimination of carbon dioxide. 4 WHO guidelines support the use of high-flow nasal oxygen in some patients, but they urge close monitoring for clinical deterioration that could result in the need for emergent intubations because such procedures might increase the risk of infection to health-care workers. 5 For patients with COVID-19 who require endotracheal intubation, use of low tidal volume (6 mL/kg per predicted bodyweight) with a plateau airway pressure of less than 30 cm H 2 O, and increasing the respiratory rate to 35 breaths per min as needed, is the mainstay of lungprotective ventilation. If the hypoxaemia progresses to a PaO 2 :FiO 2 ratio of less than 100-150 mm Hg, there are several therapeutic options. The level of positive endexpiratory pressure can be increased by 2-3 cm H 2 O every 15-30 min to improve oxygen saturation to 88-90%, with the goal of maintaining a plateau airway pressure of less than 30 cm H 2 O. Lower driving pressures (plateau airway pressure minus positive end-expiratory pressure) with a target of 13-15 cm H 2 O can also be used. If the patient is not responding to adjustment of the level of positive end-expiratory pressure, additional strategies might stabilise them. Recruitment manoeuvres probably have little value, 6 prone positioning should be instituted, unless there is a specific contraindication, and can be initiated along with the interventions already described. For persistent refractory hypoxaemia even with prone positioning, neuromuscular blockade, and efforts to optimise positive end-expiratory pressure therapy, there are additional options. Inhaled 5-20 ppm NO might improve oxygenation. Insertion of an oesophageal balloon to measure transpulmonary pressures to set an optimal positive end-expiratory pressure can be considered in patients with moderate-to-severe obesity, although a 2019 trial in patients with ARDS did not show the benefit of this procedure in most patients. 7 Fluid management is important to consider as a measure to reduce pulmonary oedema. 8 In the absence of shock, fluid conservative therapy is recommended to achieve a negative fluid balance of 0·5 to 1·0 L per day. In the presence of shock, fluid balance might be achieved with renal replacement therapy, especially if there is associated acute kidney injury and oliguria. Antibiotics should be considered since secondary bacterial infections have been reported in patients with COVID-19. 9 Glucocorticoids should be avoided in view of the evidence that they can be harmful in cases of viral pneumonia and ARDS from influenza. 10 Rescue therapy with high-dose vitamin C can also be considered. 11 Finally, ECMO should be considered using the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the EOLIA trial. 3 Since treatment of severe ARDS from COVID-19 is an ongoing challenge, it is important to learn from the patients who have been treated to gain an understanding of the disease's epidemiology, biological mechanisms, and the effects of new pharmacological interventions. Currently, there are some research groups working to coordinate and disseminate key information, including information on patients who have been treated with ECMO for COVID-19, although an accurate estimate of the number of such patients is not currently available. The Extracorporeal Life Support Organization is an international non-profit consortium that plans to maintain a registry of patients to facilitate an improved understanding of how ECMO is being used for patients with COVID-19.",27.160039105788073,11.592500849139014

In this case, the prosecutor's hypothesis was that each patient was infected at the hospital. Conversely, the defendant's hypothesis was that each patient became separately infected from the general population. These two proposals translate into different phylogenetic tree topologies, the likelihoods of which can be compared directly. The prosecutor's proposal is equivalent to observing a monophyletic group comprising the infected patients, which is significantly distinct from the background population, whereas the defendant's proposal corresponds to the grouping of the sequences from each infected patient with those of the background population.

VAE surveillance has a quality metric character and appears to identify potential safety opportunities to improve care and outcomes for patients. 19 Theoretically, interventions most likely to prevent VAEs are those that help patients avoid intubation, minimize the duration of MV, or prevent the conditions that most commonly trigger a VAE (pneumonia, volume overload, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and atelectasis). 20 Use of high-flow nasal oxygen for hypoxemic and noninvasive ventilation for hypercapnic respiratory failure may avoid intubation.

The natural history of ARDS is marked by exudative (acute), proliferative (subacute), and fibrotic (late) phases. Many patients die in the acute fulminant phase of ARDS, which is characterized by an extremely severe pulmonary inflammatory response accompanied by massive neutrophil accumulation, increased vascular permeability, and high production of cytokines and chemokines (i.e., IL-6, IL-1b, and IL-8)a so-called ""cytokine storm"" (4, 5) . To date, no effective drugs targeting the underlying pathophysiology have been proven to improve clinical outcomes in ARDS (1, 2) . Because of its high lethality and the threats of emerging respiratory virus infections, it is important to identify novel therapeutic targets for ARDS. Patients infected by SARS coronavirus (6) or H5N1 avian influenza (7) who developed ARDS exhibited unusually high levels of C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10), also known as IFN-g-induced protein 10 kD (IP-10), which binds the CXCR3 receptor, inducing chemotaxis, apoptosis, cell growth, and angiostasis (8, 9, 10) . Recent highly pathogenic H5N1 virus isolates appear to be even more potent inducers of CXCL10 compared with their less pathogenic earlier counterparts (11) (12) (13) , suggesting a possible impact of increased CXCL10 levels on disease severity. However, it was previously believed that higher CXCL10 levels were a sequel to virus infections with increased activation of the JAK/STAT pathway (14) , and whether CXCL10 contributed directly to the pathogenesis of severe virus-induced ARDS remained unclear. On the other hand, Mob-1 (the rat homolog of human CXCL10) is increased in nonviral experimental lung injury (e.g., IL-2-induced lung injury in rats) (15, 16) , although the precise mechanisms remained unclear.",21.568345661666132,9.460551987585573

Hence, wider outcome measures were needed to determine the value and success of safety programs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, together with several critical care societies, convened a group to address the limitations of the National Healthcare Safety Network definition of injury caused by MV, and they proposed a new approach in 2013. 5 Besides VAP, the new algorithm uses objective criteria for the diagnosis of ventilator-associated events and conditions and infection-related ventilator-associated complications. This approach thereby broadens the definition of harm suffered by ventilated patients beyond pneumonia to include pulmonary edema, atelectasis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. 6 The Comprehensive Unit-based Safety Program (CUSP) approach was developed by patient safety researchers at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland. 7 CUSP is designed to improve teamwork and safety culture and to guide organizations to learn from mistakes by using a validated and structured framework. 8 CUSP involves a repetitious process that trains a multidisciplinary team about the science of safety, asking them to identify defects, learn from them, implement improvement tools, and establish a partnership with senior leaders. 9 Key components include identifying evidence-based interventions that improve the outcomes of interest, converting these interventions into behaviors, placing value on the wisdom of frontline staff, and empowering frontline staff to be actively involved in safety improvements. The CUSP intervention has achieved great success in reducing VAP, central lineÀassociated bloodstream infections, catheter-associated urinary tract infections, surgical care complications, mortality, and associated costs. 10, 11 Our hospital's Infection Control and Intensive Care departments implemented a VAP prevention program in 2003, which led to the reduction of VAP rates from 19.1 to 0 per 1,000 ventilator days in 2015. 12 Despite our success in reducing the VAP rates, our data indicated that intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS) (9.8 vs 8.5 days) and mortality rates (36% vs 28.7%) were both higher in the post-VAP prevention bundles compared with the pre-VAP prevention intervention group, 12 implying that merely decreasing the rate of VAP was not enough. We needed to implement other strategies to optimize patient care to improve outcomes. We joined the Johns Hopkins Armstrong Institute Comprehensive Unit-Based Safety Program for Mechanically Ventilated Patients and Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (CUSP 4 MVP-VAP) project in October 2015 with the objective of improving the care delivery process and reducing the mortality of our mechanically ventilated patients.

The primary clinical presentation of bronchiectasis includes chronic cough and recurrent respiratory infections responsible for the increased inflammation, airway damage and shortness of breath with eventual lung function decline, respiratory failure and death [1] .

Endotypes represent disease presentations characterised by distinct functional or pathobiological mechanisms. Critically, a clinical phenotype can demonstrate multiple endotypes while a single endotype may be present in more than one clinical phenotype. This inherent disease heterogeneity and its geographic variability are recognised as a major barriers to success in clinical trials and questions remain over how to better stratify patients for targeted therapy to improve clinical outcomes [1, 6] .

However, at levels above 90% it takes a very large elevation in arterial partial pressure to further increase the saturation. 4 Hence a weak recommendation has been given out that clinicians may choose not to administer supplemental oxygen if the oxyhemoglobin saturation exceeds 90% in infants and children with bronchiolitis. The administration of high flow oxygen by nasal cannula is being increasingly recommended as the preferred mode of oxygen administration specifically for children with bronchiolitis of moderate to severe intensity. 15 High flow nasal cannulas (HFNC) are designed in such a way as to deliver a mixture of air and oxygen that is heated and humidified, at a flow that is higher than the patient's inspiratory flow. Studies have shown that the HFNC is useful to overcome obstructive apnea, prevent pharyngeal collapse and provide inspiratory support, besides specific usage in bronchiolitis where it could decrease the electrical activity of the diaphragm, and decrease the esophageal pressure swings, all of which reduce the work of breathing. 15 It decreases the work of breathing as has been shown by various studies. 4, 15 HFNC is feasible and well tolerated and has been shown to produce good results especially in cases of moderate intensity where there may be no room for CPAP/NIV treatment modalities. 15 A large study performed in Australia has shown a significant decline in rates of intubation in infants diagnosed as bronchiolitis, with reduction from 37% to 7% of cases. 16 A randomized trial was conducted by Campaña et al. in two urban secondary pediatric hospitalization units to estimate the extent of benefit that could be derived in patients of bronchiolitis with the use of high frequency humidified nasal cannula oxygen therapy. 17 The reports of this study did not show any beneficial value of using humidified oxygen by nasal cannula as compared to the use of hypertonic saline in terms of decreased severity or improved comfort levels. Despite this, HFNC continues to be popular therapy in infants with bronchiolitis and has been proven to be useful in reducing the requirement of intubation as well as being a well-tolerated non-invasive form of respiratory support. 17 There has been a perception since a long time that bronchiolitis required the use of bronchodilators in order to improve the oxygen saturation and decrease the respiratory distress associated with the illness. According to the current guidelines, there is a strong recommendation that bronchodilators like salbutamol must not be administered to infants with bronchiolitis. 4 This recommendation is based on the reports of several studies and reviews that did not show any benefits from the use of b-adrenergic agents in terms of improvement in disease resolution, need for hospitalization or the length of stay. Studies by Eber have also not shown any benefits, and the potential adverse effects in terms of tachypnea and the cost of these agents outweighs any possible benefit. 18 Cochrane Database Systemic Reviews of trials that evaluated the role of bronchodilators in bronchiolitis have not shown any improvement in oxygen saturation or decreased the length of hospitalization. 19 The AAP guideline provides a strong recommendation against the use of epinephrine in cases of bronchiolitis. 4 Studies have been done to compare the effectiveness of epinephrine versus salbutamol in decreasing the inpatient outcomes and the length of hospitalization. 20 There has been no improvements found in either of these parameters. A randomized controlled trial has been reported by Wainwright et al. on the role of nebulized epinephrine in acute bronchiolitis. 21 There was no reduction in the length of hospital stay or in the time till discharge in these infants. The only possible role of epinephrine could be as a rescue agent in cases of severe bronchiolitis, but in the absence of any formal study, there is no definite recommendation for its use. 4 Another strong recommendation that has been placed is that systemic corticosteroids have no role in the management of acute viral bronchiolitis. 4 This is based on the lack of beneficial effects and the possibility that the corticosteroid may increase the duration of viral shedding. Earlier studies had shown a role of steroids in accelerating the clinical recovery in children hospitalized for acute RSV bronchiolitis. 22 Several further studies have evaluated the role of corticosteroids given via the nebulized route, orally and parentarally, but did not draw any conclusive evidence regarding the utility of corticosteroids during the acute phase or in the follow up of bronchiolitis infection. 23 A large study that was rigidly designed and executed by Cade et al. failed to show any benefits from the administration of nebulized budesonide, which could have been due to poor drug deposition in the lungs that occurred due to the tachypnea, gas trapping and increased secretions that are all associated with bronchiolitis. 23 The role of nebulized hypertonic saline is slightly controversial, as the guidelines suggest a moderately strong recommendation against its use in the ER, while a weak recommendation has been given for its use in hospitalized patients. 4 A study was done by Mandelberg et al. to determine the usefulness of nebulized hypertonic saline in children admitted for viral bronchiolitis. 24 This study has reported benefits of using nebulized 3% saline in hospitalized patients, which decreased the symptoms as well as length of hospitalization. A 2 year follow up of this study was reported by Tal et al. which pooled and analyzed the 2 year data and reported that 3% hypertonic saline is an active drug in viral bronchiolitis and is an effective therapeutic modality. 25 In combination with 1.5 mg epinephrine nebulizations, these authors found good results in hospitalized as well as ambulatory patients. Cochrane database studies have favored the use of nebulized hypertonic saline as compared to normal saline in the treatment of acute bronchiolitis, with reduction of hospitalization duration as well as improved severity score. 26 There is a strong recommendation against the use of antibacterial agents in patients diagnosed to have viral bronchiolitis, unless there is evidence of a concomitant bacterial infection. 4 Chest physiotherapy is used as a modality of treatment in several chronic respiratory diseases, wherein there is increased airway hypersecretions. A randomized controlled study was performed in seven pediatric departments by Gajdos et al. which included infants ranging from 15 days to 24 months who were admitted for the first episode of wheezing that was diagnosed as acute bronchiolitis. 27 It was found that there was no difference in the recovery between the group that received physiotherapy and the control group that had only nasal suction performed. Another study by Postiaux et al. reported a new technique of performing chest physiotherapy that consists of 15 prolonged slow expirations followed by 5 provoked cough manoeuvres. 28 The results were encouraging and there was some short term benefits found to some of the respiratory symptoms. These maneuvers possibly aid the mucus drainage which assists in improvements in symptoms. Cochrane database reviews report several studies that have compared physiotherapy with no intervention. 29 The results are negative for chest physiotherapy that included vibration and percussion techniques as well as passive expiratory techniques. Another report by Bohé et al. has evaluated the outcome of conventional chest physiotherapy and not found any significant benefits in the treatment of acute bronchiolitis. 30 The current guidelines from AAP is a moderately strong one that does not recommend the use of chest physiotherapy in infants diagnosed with bronchiolitis. 4 While concentrating on symptom reduction and making the patient comfortable and disease free at the earliest, it is essential to ensure that the hydration and nutritional requirements are adequately addressed. The need for intravenous or nasogastric fluids in those unable to maintain adequate hydration is strongly recommended. According to Verma et al., the supportive care remains the cornerstone of management of infants with bronchiolitis. 31 Conventionally IV fluids are recommended for use, as the chances of aspiration are lower and there is no interference with breathing. 32 However, with prolonged usage, there may be a negative catabolic state due to calorie denial, and hence many countries prefer to use nasogastric feeds for better nutritional status. The NG feeds may be administered continuously in cases of major respiratory distress or as bolus therapy and recent randomized studies have not shown any differences in the outcomes. 32 IV fluids may be preferred when there is moderate to severe respiratory difficulty with marked tachypnea, apnea episodes or marked tiring out during feeding. 33 Another suggested indication for the use of IV fluids is if the patient vomits or is unable to accept the oral feeds, then sufficient fluids must be administered to prevent dehydration. 34 The role of palivizumab has been recommended for the first year of life for high risk infants with significant heart disease or chronic lung disease of prematurity who are below 32 weeks 0 days gestation and require >21% oxygen for the first 28 days of life. 4 It is not recommended for administration to otherwise healthy infants who are over 29 weeks 0 days gestational age.",22.432078154766693,9.166219895243094

EPIDEMIOLOGY, OUTCOME RESEARCH, HEALTH SERVICES 1 SP598 SALT RESTRICTION AND ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY IN JAPANESE HEMODIALYSIS PATIENTS FROM JSDT REGISTRY","Introduction and Aims: Although some guidelines recommend salt restriction, few studies have examined the association between salt restriction and clinical outcomes in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 88,115 adult patients enrolled in the Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy (JSDT) registry (2008) who had received HD for at least two years and were considered anuric. The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality at one year, and the secondary outcome was cardiovascular (CV) mortality. Estimated salt intake was the main predictor, and was calculated from interdialytic weight gain and pre-and postdialysis serum sodium levels according to the validated method of Kimura and Ramdeen. Nonlinear logistic regression was used to determine the association of salt intake with mortality, adjusting for age, gender, body mass index, vintage of HD, dialysis time, Kt/V, protein catabolic rate normalized to body weight, comorbid conditions, type of vascular access, serum potassium, phosphate, calcium, CRP level, and endotoxin level in dialysate. Cubic splines were plotted and the reference was median salt intake. Salt consumption was categorized by intake levels of 2 g per day and the association with mortality examined. Results: Median [25th-75th percentile] salt intake at baseline was 6.4 [4.6-8.3] g per day. At one year, all-cause mortality occurred in 1,845 (2.1%) patients, including cardiovascular mortality in 821 (0.9%). We observed an association between low salt intake and clinical outcomes (all-cause and CV mortality) (Fig.1) . We observed the highest all-cause mortality in the low salt group (<6g/day) (Fig.2) , and no association between all-cause mortality and high salt intake. Further, we observed similar associations between salt intake and CV mortality. Conclusions: Low salt intake is associated with all-cause and CV mortality. These findings do not support current clinical guidelines, which recommend restricting salt intake to less than 6g per day.",20.462966989512672,8.512978000305493

Nasal suctioning is an easy, useful adjunctive treatment that may improve respiratory status, given the significant secretions in many younger infants who are obligate nose breathers; it is recommended before feeds. 157 No evidence currently exists to support deeper airway suctioning. Oxygen should be administered for saturation less than 90% according to American Academy of Pediatrics Guidelines, 130 and is an option in those with saturations of 90% to 94% and moderate signs of respiratory distress. 157, 158 Non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation or intubation is indicated for those rare cases presenting with respiratory failure. IV hydration is necessary for those with dehydration and feeding difficulty. Attention to the risk of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is necessary.

A recent Cochrane review of more than 1912 infants showed no significant effect of bronchodilators on O 2 saturation, hospital admission rate, length of stay, and disease duration. 160 There was a small improvement in clinical scores in the outpatient studies; however, the clinical significance of this is questionable.

This figure translates into a number needed to treat of 15 for epinephrine to avoid 1 hospitalization (95% CI 10-45).

However, indiscriminant use of broad-spectrum antibiotics is associated with the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, fungal infections, and increased healthcare costs. The purpose of this study was to determine optimal empiric treatment of VAP by comparing a strategy of combination therapy to monotherapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Methods In a multicenter trial, we randomized mechanically ventilated adult patients with suspected VAP that developed after 96 hours in the ICU to receive either meropenem and ciprofloxacin or meropenem alone, as initial therapy. In addition, before starting antibiotics, diagnostic specimens were obtained using either bronchoalveolar lavage with quantitative cultures or standard endotracheal aspirates. Results We randomized 740 patients in 28 ICUs in Canada and the United States. The baseline characteristics and etiologies of VAP were similar between groups. There was no difference in 28day mortality between the combination and monotherapy groups (RR = 1.05, 95% confidence interval 0.78-1.42; P = 0.74). The duration of ICU and hospital stay, clinical and microbiological response to treatment, emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, isolation of Clostridium difficile, and fungal colonization were similar between groups. Combination therapy resulted in a higher rate of adequate empiric therapy compared with monotherapy (93.1% vs 85.3%, P = 0.01). In a subgroup of patients with infection due to pseudomonas species, acinetobacter species and multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli at enrollment (n = 56), the adequacy of initial antibiotics was 82.4% in the combination group versus 18.8% in the monotherapy group (P < 0.001); this difference was associated with an increase in the microbiological eradication of the infecting organisms (64.1% vs 29.4%, P = 0.05) but no differences in clinical outcomes.

Our data suggest that it is likely that high-flow nasal therapy does not increase the potential risk of droplet and contact infection. However, there is a possibility that the device generates smaller particles (aerosol) that may remain in the air and may cause airborne infection rather than droplet infection.

Several in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that statins reduce the levels of TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, NF-κB, and C-reactive protein. These effects inhibit the up-regulation of cytokines and potentially decrease inflammation and immune dysfunction. As a consequence, statins may decrease the severity of symptoms associated with sepsis [55] . A metaanalysis performed in 2013 included 28 studies and revealed an association between statins and the risk and mortality of CAP. However, the results constitute very low quality evidence, based on the GRADE framework, due to the observational study design, heterogeneity, and publication bias. Given the biological plausibility of these findings and the high burden and mortality of CAP, the meta-analysis results warranted additional and better-designed studies to define the utility of statins in CAP [56] .

Infants requiring positive pressure ventilation pose an additional threat to healthcare workers as leakage of gas from an uncuffed endotracheal tube can cause air turbulence around the oral cavity, splashing of nasopharyngeal secretions, and can expel droplets or aerosols into the environment. Hence, an infant requiring intermittent positive pressure ventilation or nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) support is further sheltered inside a headbox. A negative pressure is created within the headbox by connecting a large suction tube to its interior. Thus, opening the porthole of the incubator will suck in air from the environment rather than pushing air out towards the healthcare staff. A high efficiency bacterial/viral filter (Sterivent Mini, Mallinckrodt DAR, Mirandola, MO, Italy) is fitted onto the resuscitation bag for manual ventilation (fig 2) , and also incorporated into the exhalation arm of the ventilator circuit ( fig 3) . All exhaled gases from the conventional ventilator are sucked into and disposed via the wall suction outlet. The use of nitric oxide does not interfere with the new circuitary arrangement. Further, a plastic bag is wrapped around the water trap of the ventilator circuit before emptying the contents. This may avoid spilling of condensed water of the circuit into the environment. In contrast, the use of high frequency oscillatory ventilation may increase the risk of droplet spread of respiratory secretions. The viral filter cannot be incorporated into the single arm ventilator circuit (Sensor-Medics 3100A Oscillator, Yorba Linda, Calif, USA). Our practice is to avoid using this mode of ventilation in infants of probable and suspected SARS mothers. Routine endotracheal suction is perform via a closed suction circuit (Ballard Trachcare Closed Suction System for Neonates, Kimberly-Clark, Utah, USA). The secretions are collected in a suction container that is partially filled with disinfectant. A face shield, in addition to regular PPE, is recommended for performing high risk procedures such as tracheal intubation, attending delivery, and the collection of potentially contaminated specimens. The use of nebulisers, high flow oxygen masks, and CPAP are strictly prohibited outside the incubator or in the open ward.

FLUID SUPPORT Survival from hypovolemic shock is dependent on the restoration of oxygen transport, blood volume, and blood flow. It has been said that the controversy over the use of crystalloids or colloids in critically ill patients has an emotional tenor that is inversely proportional to the supporting physiologic data (Shoemaker, 1982) . All agree that the first approach to the acutely bleeding patient is to stop bleeding and restore circulating volume. Most clinicians prefer crystalloid replacement at least initially. Several studies of experimentally induced hemorrhagic shock have reported improved survival when crystalloids were compared to colloids (Collins et al., 1973; Gaisford et al., 1972) . Although smaller volumes of colloids are required they were more likely to cause pulmonary edema because of leakage into the pulmonary tissues (Vergilio et al., 1979) . In a randomized human study and an experimental primate study, colloids were associated with a lower incidence of pulmonary edema (Rackow et al., 1983; Gaisford et al., 1972) . In two additional studies, hemodynamic and oxygen transport responses were greater and more prolonged after infusion of colloids (Nees et al., 1978; Dawidson et al., 1979) .

In addition, novel pathogens including zoonotic coronaviruses like the agents causing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) are still being identified. Patients with severe RVIs requiring ICU care present typically with hypoxemic respiratory failure. Oseltamivir is the most widely used neuraminidase inhibitor for treatment of influenza; data suggest that early use is associated with reduced mortality in critically ill patients with influenza. At present, there are no antiviral therapies of proven efficacy for other severe RVIs. Several adjunctive pharmacologic interventions have been studied for their immunomodulatory effects, including macrolides, corticosteroids, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, sirolimus, statins, anti-influenza immune plasma, and vitamin C, but none is recommended at present in severe RVIs. Evidence-based supportive care is the mainstay for management of severe respiratory viral infection. Non-invasive ventilation in patients with severe RVI causing acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and pneumonia is associated with a high likelihood of transition to invasive ventilation.

Alendronate drugs can inhibit bone absorption ability of osteoclasts, accelerate osteoclast apoptosis, improve bone volume and bone strength, and facilitate bone healing, thus impeding and retarding ONFH progression, decreasing bone absorption and femoral head collapse, as well as decreasing the frequency of surgery for collapse. Hong et al showed that alendronate is one effective method for treating ONFH and can reduce bone marrow edema.13 However, due to potential side effects including jaw bone necrosis or bone fracture after long-term application of alendronate, some surgeons still prefer surgery approaches.13 Bone et al observed 10-year study on menopausal women and found no significant correlation between alendronate drugs and bone fracture.14 This study performed 12-year alendronate sodium treatment (70 mg weekly) on all post-SARS ONFH patients and found no jaw bone absorption or fracture among all patients. Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) can alleviate or treat ONFH via enhancing expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in subchondral bones of the femoral head and induction of de novo angiogenesis to improve femoral head blood supply. Vulpiani et al found that ESWT could benefit bone reconstruction and regeneration via stimulating vascular growth factor expression.15,16 Wang et al compared ESWT and surgery approach and found that ESWT had significant clinical efficacy and less probability of surgery.17 Lin et al also showed efficacy of ESWT on prednisone treatment-induced ONFH after systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) treatment.18 Ludwig et al reported that 1-year ESWT treatment significantly alleviated pain, improved hip joint function and reduced bone necrosis lesions on ONFH patients at ARCO Phase I to Phase III.19 ESWT helps to treat ONFH mainly via inducing tissue regeneration of mesenchymal and extracellular reactions and inducing femoral head angiogenesis. We performed long-term follow-up on all patients receiving ESWT and showed that ESWT could retard disease worsening and improve clinical symptoms on early phase ONFH patients. Moreover, Camporesi et al performed a 7-year follow-up and showed that 6-week continuous hyperbaric oxygen treatment could significantly improve clinical symptoms of ONFH.20 Hyperbaric oxygen environment can enhance oxygen concentration in blood, thus alleviating oxygen perfusion into bone tissues for reducing bone marrow edema, thus reducing bone pressure, venous drainage and microcirculation. Moreover, hyperbaric oxygen can also stimulate vessel angiogenesis and the function of osteoblast and osteoclast cells, thus providing necessary pre-conditions for treating ONFH. Koren et al performed an 11.1±5.1-year follow-up study and indicated that hyperbaric oxygen was 1 effective method for treating Phase I and Phase II ONFH.21 It is still debatable about the effects of single usage of hyperbaric oxygen to treat post-SARS ONFH. Wu et al22 performed a follow-up on Phase I ONFH of SARS patients and reported that hyperbaric oxygen cannot effectively impede or reverse progression of Phase I ONFH after SARS, while Qiu and Zhang3 attributed hyperbaric oxygen to be a satisfactory method for treating post-SARS ONFH. This study performed regular combined treatment consisting of alendronate drug, extracorporeal shock wave and hyperbaric oxygen. By 12-year long-term follow-up, some patients showed clinical improvement of ONFH, while most patients showed retardation of disease progression or even reversion. By statistical analysis of VAS and Harris score before and after treatment, we found significant differences (p<0.05). Therefore, we believe that long-term treatment of combined therapy including alendronate drug, extracorporeal shock wave and hyperbaric oxygen could effectively retard ONFH progression, alleviate patient’s clinical symptoms and improve hip joint function, thus decreasing the risk of surgery on post-SARS ONFH patients.",21.254841189450644,8.89983916809491

However, more rapid testing for respiratory viruses might improve the impact on clinical outcomes as results are available before any initial treatment or management is established by the treating physician. To our knowledge, this is the first review to specifically assess the clinical impact of rapid molecular tests, and not rapid antigen tests, without a restriction in the detection of influenza virus and RSV [45, 46]. The included studies, even the high-quality randomized studies [1, 20, 21, 24, 25], show heterogeneous results. The location of the rapid test, which was at the point of care in only 3 studies, may affect turnaround times and thereby clinical outcomes. Apart from other differences in design, and in analysis and power, differences in the implementation strategy might partially explain these discrepancies. First, education and training of personnel and physicians on the implemented rapid test, its diagnostic accuracy, and its potential effects on clinical outcomes may contribute to its effect on clinical outcomes [33]. Second, a combination of a rapid test and a result-based guideline on subsequent clinical management options might have more impact than a stand-alone diagnostic test, even though the 2 studies describing the implementation of a diagnostic bundle did not show any significant effects of their implementation, which might be partially explained by limited adherence to these guidelines [20, 21]. A complicating factor therein is that identification of a viral pathogen from a respiratory tract sample may not necessarily attribute causation [2]. Third, a combination of a rapid test and another diagnostic as procalcitonin [21, 30] or other biomarker-based assays [47] may increase the persuasiveness of the rapid viral test on whether there is a bacterial or viral causative pathogen. However, current evidence for the effect of the combination of respiratory viral testing and procalcitonin on clinical outcomes is disappointing [21].",23.904872779608105,9.518409825956937

In most studies reporting favourable post-LT outcomes in these severely ill patients, an “early” LT has been performed (time between placement on the waiting list and LT ranging from 3–9 days).[98], [116], [119] This very short timeframe is required because of the natural history of these patients. Indeed, around 50% of them will die in the first 10 days.116 A significant proportion of patients are not placed on the waiting list before acute deterioration of their condition. As an example, in our study, 45/73 patients transplanted with ACLF grade 3 were placed on waiting lists during the immediate pre-LT hospitalization (median time to LT: 8 days).98 Therefore, pretransplant evaluation must be performed in a timely fashion, precluding a number of clinical tests usually required in LT programmes. To our knowledge, the potential impact on post-LT outcomes of this “truncated” evaluation has yet to be studied extensively in patients with very high MELD scores.50 Such a “truncated” evaluation, involving the performance of only a few necessary screening tests, could lead to potential contraindications for LT (active neoplasia, severe alcohol dependence, or still significant coronary artery disease) being overlooked. In addition to the potential impact on outcomes, this raises some degree of unfairness with regard to less severe patients undergoing the recommended exhaustive evaluation (routinely responsible for not listing patients after the discovery of a contraindication).117 There is an urgent need to evaluate the various international LT centre practices in this setting. A prospective study validating a standardized assessment for patients with very high MELD scores, who have not yet been listed, should be put forward in order to optimize selection of candidates and decrease inequity.",11.612455679816428,5.919030739709584

These modalities aim to replace the functions of the failing liver, allowing hepatic recovery or stabilizing clinical state to enable transplantation.[55], [59] The key concepts of such therapies are to remove harmful toxins, support the liver for spontaneous regeneration and to reduce the ongoing inflammatory injury.59 Based on albumin dialysis, the molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS®) and plasma separation and absorption system (Prometheus®) are the most studied devices. MARS therapy has been reported to improve bilirubin levels, hepatic encephalopathy, haemodynamic parameters and kidney function in patients with decompensated cirrhosis[125], [126] without improving survival. In the RELIEF trial, including patients with ACLF, no improvement in transplant-free survival at 28 and 90 days was observed.127 In the Helios study, despite a well-tolerated treatment, Prometheus therapy was not reported to improve short-term survival in patients with ACLF.128 Of note, these results have to be interpreted with caution due to the heterogeneous population of patients with decompensated cirrhosis associated with different degrees of OFs and different definitions of ACLF.58 Results of a large prospective multicentre study evaluating a bioartificial device (extracorporeal cellular therapy) in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis showed that it conferred no overall survival benefit compared to standard of care. However, among other limitations, patients were not stratified according to response to medical treatment and definitive conclusions on the efficacy of this device cannot, as of this date, be drawn.129 A second study in younger patients with lower MELD scores is therefore ongoing (NCT02612428).",13.123615796037402,5.496693205469609

However, survival rate was higher in NIMV than invasive ventilation. We used full-face mask in all patients for NIMV. Noninvasive ventilation has been used an alternative therapy for patients with acute respiratory failure with hopes of obviating intubation and mechanical ventilation. The results of NIMV in hypoxemic respiratory failure have been conflicting, and the etiology of hypoxemia appears to be an important determinant of its success. Ferrer et al. 22 compared NIMV to conventional venture oxygen delivery in patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure and found that NIMV decreased the need for intubation. This benefit was observed in the subgroup of patients with pneumonia, but not in those with ARDS, in which the intubation rates were high in both groups. A meta-analysis suggests that NIMV does not decrease the need for intubation, so there is not enough evidence to support its use in ARDS 23. Of all patients, 56 (91 %) were mechanically ventilated on the first day of ICU admission; 14 (23 %) invasively and 42 (68.8 %) noninvasively. Fifteen patients (24.5%) who received noninvasive ventilation ultimately required invasive ventilation. Dominguez-Cherit et al. 24 reported that invasively ventilation was used in 82.7% of patients.

In our study, serum phosphorus levels were lower than normal in 50% of the severe/critical patients, and the level of serum phosphorus in severe / critical patients was lower than that in normal patients. This may be due to the decrease of the level of glycerol 2,3-diphosphate in erythrocytes under the condition of hypophosphatemia, which leads to the left shift of the oxygen dissociation curve, the decrease of oxygen release and the disorder of oxidative phosphorylation process, and finally leads to tissue hypoxia due to the decrease of ATP energy supply 10 . At the same time, the disturbance of lung water absorption is closely related to the metabolic disorder of phosphorus, the lack of phosphorus aggravates the inflammatory level of lung tissue, the ratio of ventilation and blood flow of edematous lung tissue is maladjusted, and the oxygenation function decreases, which can induce fatigue caused by hypoxia in intercostal muscle and diaphragm.
