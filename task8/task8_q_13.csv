These assays are currently the main tools employed for the rapid identification of avian influenza A (H7N9) virus and have played a critical role in early responses to the outbreak of H7N9 avian virus infection [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . However, because the possibility of sustained human-to-human transmission cannot be completely excluded and because new cases have continuously accumulated, appearing as a second epidemic wave in winter 2013 and spring 2014 in China [1, 16] , careful and persistent monitoring of avian influenza A (H7N9) virus is necessary for urgent and long-term responses to threats from the virus. Thus, enhanced detection capacities with sustained quality-control measures are urgently needed to allow a better response to the current outbreak of this novel influenza virus and to improve preparedness for its re-emergence or even a potential pandemic in the future. Compared with in-house assays, commercial diagnostic kits typically provide a more sustainable alternative source of accurate detection tests, as they support larger-scale production, certified manufacturing practices, wellstudied product performance and stable quality control; hence, they can be used in a broad range of clinical laboratories. Therefore, to meet the increasing need for detection, the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) has approved three commercial diagnostic products for specifically detecting avian influenza A (H7N9) virus RNA, which can be used in the laboratories that are not a part of CNISN under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) [17] .

In fact, neglected diseases disproportionally affect poor and marginalized populations, and vaccines may have low returns on investment, so commercial firms may be reluctant to commit themselves to the expensive development and licensure of vaccine candidates, which typically totals hundreds-ofmillions of US dollars [60] . To overcome this problem, several strategies may be implemented, including the creation of public and/or private partnerships, the identification of target population groups for vaccination to ensure a potential market, such as the military market, travelers and tourists, and the commitment of donor agencies and affected and/or donor countries [61] . Combination private and public consortia should address those vaccine development projects that are not considered highly profitable by industry in the absence of support from the governments of industrial countries. A recent example is the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), funded by both government entities and private foundations, and include partners from the pharmaceutical industry, which is funding late preclinical and clinical development of vaccines for infections by Lassa, Nipah, and MERS coronavirus [62] .",67.77409847722635,24.38590832428301

All highlight the importance of supporting ongoing surveillance efforts as the cornerstone of disease prevention. Early recognition of an outbreak allows control measures to be initiated in a timely way that can shift the epidemic curve, reducing its impact and possibly its geographic spread. Enhanced surveillance measures with an emphasis on innovation, transparency and incorporation of the One Health model are critical to epidemic preparedness measures in the future. It is also crucial to encourage research during outbreaks through rapid data sharing to facilitate rapid response efforts, as is promoted through organisations such as the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC) [9] . Vaccination, if it can be implemented in time, can also bend the epidemic curve. Promoting platforms for rapid vaccine development and deployment could provide a significant boost to outbreak control. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a public-private coalition that has been working to halt epidemics through the development of appropriate vaccines, is promoting both pathogenspecific and agnostic platform approaches [10] . These efforts deserve wide support and encouragement. In order for vaccines to be effectively employed, the growing threat of vaccine hesitancy worldwide must also be countered using methods grounded in the social sciences. Governments, through their public health agencies and in coordination with efforts like the Global Health Security Agenda, must adopt preparedness plans and exercise them before outbreaks become major threats [11] . Emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases will continue to present significant challenges in the coming years, and investing in novel methods for detection, prevention as well as therapeutics should remain priorities for the global public health community.",64.56317816275741,22.29154950687721

The United Nation's Ebola Emergency Response Mission's (UNMEER) announcement that it would miss its December 2014 deadline to contain the epidemic because of rising numbers of cases [2] illustrates that in the absence of a proven cure, efficacious treatment options or preventive vaccines for stemming Ebola's spread in Africa and beyond will depend on several factors, including locating, isolating, and caring for those infected with Ebola, tracing their contacts, educating affected communities on safe burial practices, and strict adherence to infection control measures [1, 3] . The prioritised, accelerated provision of the unapproved investigational drug Z-Mapp to selected infected individuals and apparent cures in some instances as a result thereof highlight that arresting Ebola's spread may, by necessity, also have to centre on the accelerated provision of experimental drugs, biological products (including vaccines and biological therapeutics), and devices (including in vitro diagnostics) to affected countries when no adequate, approved, and available alternative to the emergency use of the products in question exists. Such provision must be underpinned by a robust monitoring and evaluation component so that the provision can inform future use and policy on the issue. While this strategy has won WHO endorsement [4] , many countries bar the use of unapproved interventions on humans outside of a clinical trial context and lack appropriate regulatory regimes to facilitate the fast-tracked provision of unapproved interventions to those who need them. Also currently lacking at a global level is a coordinating rapid response framework for the employment of unapproved interventions in humanitarian emergencies. In light of this shortcoming, crucial regulatory-related developments in the aftermath of the West African Ebola epidemic are welcomed. These include the US Federal Drug Administration's (FDA) establishment of an Ebola task force with wide representation from across the FDA to coordinate its Ebola-related activities [5] and a cooperation pledge by members of an interim International Coalition of Medicines Regulatory Authorities in August 2014 [6] . Such initiatives must, however, result in comprehensive, harmonised regulatory mechanisms to ensure that a wide-range of potential Ebola-related interventions are permissible for use in clinical trial and posttrial contexts.",24.513506557689364,9.234179391117086

Substantial autochthonous circulation in Italy, Iran and South Korea has been reported by now, while there is increasing evidence that subclinical infections occur and people may be infectious before symptoms appear [8] [9] [10] . These developments indicate that the window of opportunity to contain and eradicate is rapidly narrowing. [11] . Therefore, it is needless to state that for each phase in the control and mitigation of a novel emerging pathogen, adequate laboratory preparedness and response are crucial. The readiness survey that we performed served the important purpose of mapping the initial response capacities in Europe and identifying barriers to diagnostic implementation. Therefore, we maintain that the urgent implementation and monitoring of diagnostic capacities and capabilities for SARS-CoV-2 in Europe is proportional to the containment and expected mitigation phase of the global public health response and is critical for care of local patients. The implementation of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics does not replace nor exclude diagnostic capacity for other respiratory viruses. Moreover, it explicitly does not disregard the importance of other seasonal respiratory pathogens for public and patient health. This is clearly illustrated by the authors themselves, who indicate that they have tested thousands of samples of patients suspected of respiratory viral disease not only for common respiratory pathogens but also for SARS-CoV-2. The fact that Colson et al. found a wide range of seasonal respiratory viruses indeed underlines the impact of such pathogens. Furthermore, it clearly shows that diagnosis of respiratory viruses cannot be done syndrome-based and supports the need for the availability of diagnostics for a panel of pathogens including SARS-CoV-2.",24.36589333169262,8.17570054445078

For example, NBAF, the new BSL-4 agricultural facility for large animal research and vaccine/therapeutic development that is currently under construction in the U.S., will bring opportunities for new R&D strategies.

The highest incidence of severe disease is observed in elderly and immunocompromised individuals [11] . Those at general risk for infections are health care workers and people in close contact with dromedary camels [12, 13] . These groups are therefore considered relevant target populations for prophylactic vaccination against MERS-CoV infection and prevention of MERS. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) have listed MERS as priority target for vaccine development [14] . However, so far, no candidate vaccines have proceeded beyond phase I/IIa clinical testing [15] . One of these candidate vaccines is based on Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), a safety-tested and replication-deficient vaccinia virus serving as an advanced viral vector platform for the development of new vaccines against infectious diseases and cancer (for review see [16] ). In that context, we still know relatively little about the correlates of vaccine induced protection against MERS-CoV. It is well-known that virus-neutralizing antibodies directed against the spike glycoprotein (S protein) correlate with protective immunity against coronavirus infections in general [17] [18] [19] [20] . Since the S protein is present on the cell surface, S protein is considered as the major antigen to induce virus neutralizing antibodies and as a key immunogen for the development of MERS-CoV candidate vaccines [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . However, based on current knowledge from the biology of β-coronaviruses, we hypothesize that also other viral proteins warrant consideration as immunogens and targets of virus-specific antibodies and T cells. Among those, the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) is produced at high levels in infected cells and has been proposed as useful candidate protein for clinical diagnosis [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . The coronavirus N proteins have been associated with multiple functions in the virus life cycle including the regulation of viral RNA synthesis, the packaging of the viral RNA in helical nucleocapsids, and in virion assembly through interaction with the viral M protein [31] [32] [33] [34] . Furthermore, several reports suggest that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) N protein functions as an immune evasion protein and an antagonist of the host interferon response [35] [36] [37] . Recently, the overexpression of MERS-CoV N in human A549 cells was found to be linked to an up-regulation of antiviral host gene expression including the synthesis of the inflammatory chemokine CXCL10 [38] . Despite this possible immune modulatory activity, SARS-CoV N-specific immune responses are reported to be long-lived and more broadly reactive when compared to SARS-CoV S-specific immunity [39] . Likewise, we were curious as to the suitability of the MERS-CoV N protein to serve as a vaccine antigen. The N protein is not present on the surface of MERS-CoV particles nor is it predicted to be expressed on the surface membrane of MVA infected cells. From this we hypothesized that the most relevant part of MERS-CoV N-specific immunity is based on CD8+ T cell responses relying on the processing and presentation of intracellular antigens. Currently, there is little information about MERS-CoV N-specific immune responses including the in vivo induction of N-specific cellular immunity.",24.949789296194428,6.921717945448139

The core argument was that removing wine duties would encourage more investment from international wine traders, which would in turn create more jobs and bring other economic benefits to Hong Kong. Second, in an attempt to gain public support, it was claimed that excessive alcohol duties deprived ordinary Hong Kong drinkers of the enjoyment of affordable alcoholic beverages. Newspaper interviews and other speaking opportunities were strategically used to carefully shape the public perception that a cut in alcohol taxation would vastly benefit consumers through a reduction in retail prices. The third idea advanced by the industry coalition was that Hong Kong's high alcohol tax drives consumers to lower jurisdictions to buy alcoholic beverages, thereby losing revenue for the government and reinforcing the illegal smuggling and illicit activities connected with the alcohol market. Indeed, the alcohol industry repeatedly propagated an idea that should the existing tax be maintained, the government would not achieve its intended increase in revenue as a result of alcohol smuggling and trading-down effects toward the consumption of cheaper alcohol. Fourth, moderate consumption of wine was framed as conducive to good health. Although the beneficial effects to the heart of moderate consumption of red wine are contentious, the alcohol industry communicated these benefits to the public in a very aggressive manner.",26.90236083241281,9.415826291344484

It has been listed by the WHO and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) as an important target for vaccine development. While initially the majority of MERS cases were hospital acquired, continued emergence of MERS is attributed to community acquisition, with camels likely being the direct or indirect source. However, the majority of patients do not describe camel exposure, making the route of transmission unclear. Here, using sensitive immunological assays and a cohort of camel workers (CWs) with well-documented camel exposure, we show that approximately 50% of camel workers (CWs) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and 0% of controls were previously infected. We obtained blood samples from 30 camel herders, truck drivers, and handlers with welldocumented camel exposure and from healthy donors, and measured MERS-CoVspecific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and neutralizing antibody titers, as well as T cell responses. Totals of 16/30 CWs and 0/30 healthy control donors were seropositive by MERS-CoV-specific ELISA and/or neutralizing antibody titer, and an additional four CWs were seronegative but contained virus-specific T cells in their blood. Although virus transmission from CWs has not been formally demonstrated, a possible explanation for repeated MERS outbreaks is that CWs develop mild disease and then transmit the virus to uninfected individuals. Infection of some of these individuals, such as those with comorbidities, results in severe disease and in the episodic appearance of patients with MERS.

According to GAFFI [11] , several major antifungals are not available or registered in various regions where fungal diseases are most lethal. 5-Fluorocytosine, a low-cost antimetabolite that is beneficial to a number of patients with systemic mycoses when used in combination with other antifungal drugs, is not available and/or registered in many countries, including those highly affected by systemic mycoses [11] . Given the intrinsic difficulties and high costs of drug development and the evident market and public health failures in this field, it is more realistic and impactful to make rational use of the diagnostic and antifungal tests already available to minimize the number of deaths caused by fungal diseases. In a recent study, Denning [30] proposed actions to reduce deaths from fungal diseases on the basis of currently available diagnostic tests and generic antifungals. Assuming that diagnostic tests would be properly applied and that antifungal therapy would be administered promptly and following current international guidelines, it was estimated that by 2020 annual deaths from cryptococcal meningitis could fall from 180,000 to 70,000. Deaths due to Pneumocystis pneumonia would fall from 400,000 annually to 162,500. The 80,000 annual deaths attributable to disseminated histoplasmosis could be reduced by 60%. Annual deaths due to chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (56,288) could fall by 33,500. These actions would thus result in a total of 1 million lives saved over 5 years.

The resulting target sequence variations can easily prevent recognition of assay primers and probes, leading to test failure and false negative readouts, a problem which to date can only be solved via regular (and impractical) assay updates [27, 28] . For instance, primers and probes for all eight published reverse transcription (RT) qPCR assays (qRT-PCR) for Zika virus (ZIKV) were found to have numerous mismatches with multiple ZIKV genomes sequenced from recent outbreaks [29] . Although most mismatched alleles were common among all outbreak samples and had likely appeared prior to entry of ZIKV into the Americas, new mutations were also found. Most of these were detected in fewer than 10% of samples, but one new mutation appeared in as many as 29% of the samples [29] . These data suggest that continuing viral genome evolution could lead to accumulation of mismatches with diagnostic assay oligonucleotides, which might in turn decrease amplification efficiency and assay sensitivity [30] [31] [32] .

Results: The Metropole Hotel hastened the international spread of the 2003 SARS outbreak by the index case infecting visitors from Singapore, Vietnam, Canada as well as local people via close contact with the index case and the environmental contamination. The one-week quarantine of more than 300 guests and staff at the Metropark Hotel during the 2009 H1N1 swine flu exposed gaps in the partnership with the hotel industry.

There has already been movement from the single-parameter biomarker strategy to the proteomic-based multi-parameter diagnostic approaches (Campos et al., 2012) . However, metaproteomics, also known as the proteomics of the environment or of one particular community, is still an almost unexplored frontier to conquer in animal science. Metaproteomic analysis could provide identification and relative quantification of protein and protein families recovered directly from environmental samples or from a concrete ecosystem. This methodological approach aims to move from a functional understanding of a single species proteome elucidating the proteomic complexity from a larger community. Today, the latest MS technology in combination with sequencing capabilities and bioinformatic analysis has opened up new opportunities for translating metadata analysis into assessment of a health status (Erickson et al., 2012) . There are several advantages to consider: (i) metaproteomics could offer a phenotypic profile on samples preserving the metaspecies environment; (ii) alteration in the microbial ecosystem (saliva, digestive tract, mammalian glands) in farm animals would not only provide functional information for diagnosis but also aid in evaluating stress responses; (iii) it could be of great interest to evaluate gastrointestinal function in ruminant and gastrointestinal disorders. The main disadvantage is that the developments in metaproteomics would still be linked to growth, achievements and methodological developments of metagenomics. In conclusion, this powerful new methodology would provide a deeper understanding of the farm animal microbiota in the context of functional host-microbe interactions and elucidate the molecular mechanisms linking the microbiome to host physiology.

EIDs have thus been recognized as posing a substantial threat to global health security. This has been particularly driven by the recent 2014 Ebola outbreak as well as the rising concerns regarding antimicrobial resistance. As a result, initiatives such as the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI), have emerged. CEPI is a coalition whose role is to finance and coordinate the development of new vaccines in order to prevent and or contain future infectious disease epidemics [33] .

CEPI will also support innovations and effective processes for licensing and using vaccines, outcomes that may have impact beyond the specific diseases. CEPI is an important initiative and Global Health player.

Instead of looking to ""simple disease management"" for the answer, the SDGs help to understand the interplay of multiple priority areas and thereby help to promote a more holistic approach to addressing these two disease groups.

Substantial autochthonous circulation in Italy, Iran and South Korea has been reported by now, while there is increasing evidence that subclinical infections occur and people may be infectious before symptoms appear [8] [9] [10] . These developments indicate that the window of opportunity to contain and eradicate is rapidly narrowing. [11] . Therefore, it is needless to state that for each phase in the control and mitigation of a novel emerging pathogen, adequate laboratory preparedness and response are crucial. The readiness survey that we performed served the important purpose of mapping the initial response capacities in Europe and identifying barriers to diagnostic implementation. Therefore, we maintain that the urgent implementation and monitoring of diagnostic capacities and capabilities for SARS-CoV-2 in Europe is proportional to the containment and expected mitigation phase of the global public health response and is critical for care of local patients. The implementation of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics does not replace nor exclude diagnostic capacity for other respiratory viruses. Moreover, it explicitly does not disregard the importance of other seasonal respiratory pathogens for public and patient health. This is clearly illustrated by the authors themselves, who indicate that they have tested thousands of samples of patients suspected of respiratory viral disease not only for common respiratory pathogens but also for SARS-CoV-2. The fact that Colson et al. found a wide range of seasonal respiratory viruses indeed underlines the impact of such pathogens. Furthermore, it clearly shows that diagnosis of respiratory viruses cannot be done syndrome-based and supports the need for the availability of diagnostics for a panel of pathogens including SARS-CoV-2.",25.26468342928575,8.490280778566701

In an analysis of patients presenting with acute leptospirosis in Tanzania, urinary antibacterial activity was detected by bioassay in 31 (64.6%) of 48 cases, and is likely to have contributed to the inability of PCR diagnostic tests to detect infection in either plasma or urine samples at the time of presentation [57] .",24.20507619407323,8.128601290973934

Diagnostic tests using conventional assays that appear to be negative, even when undertaken late in the disease and despite the clinical diagnosis, have a tendency, at times, to be unreliable. These tests are rarely optimal and entirely dependent on the nature and quality of the sample supplied. In the course of the past three decades, the application of molecular biology has aided in the development of tests that result in a more rapid detection of rabies virus. These tests enable viral strain identification from clinical specimens. Currently, there are a number of molecular tests that can be used to complement conventional tests in rabies diagnosis. Indeed the challenges in the 21st century for the development of rabies diagnostics are not of a technical nature; these tests are available now. The challenges in the 21st century for diagnostic test developers are two-fold: firstly, to achieve internationally accepted validation of a test that will then lead to its acceptance by organisations globally. Secondly, the areas of the world where such tests are needed are mainly in developing regions where financial and logistical barriers prevent their implementation. Although developing countries with a poor healthcare infrastructure recognise that molecularbased diagnostic assays will be unaffordable for routine use, the cost/benefit ratio should still be measured. Adoption of rapid and affordable rabies diagnostic tests for use in developing countries highlights the importance of sharing and transferring technology through laboratory twinning between the developed and the developing countries. Importantly for developing countries, the benefit of molecular methods as tools is the capability for a differential diagnosis of human diseases that present with similar clinical symptoms. Antemortem testing for human rabies is now possible using molecular techniques. These barriers are not insurmountable and it is our expectation that if such tests are accepted and implemented where they are most needed, they will provide substantial improvements for rabies diagnosis and surveillance. The advent of molecular biology and new technological initiatives that combine advances in biology with other disciplines will support the development of techniques capable of high throughput testing with a low turnaround time for rabies diagnosis.",41.92277593976295,16.23325810678912

As we progress through the 21 st century, it is possible that these techniques will replace conventional tests (Box 1). Obstacles to adoption include cost, complexity and local acceptance of their use. It is also possible that immunological tests by measuring 'indirect' markers such as cytokines and electrolytes will increase in use. These tests however, will probably remain in the realm of large reference laboratories where resources allow the development of novel assays. As far as semi-automated or automated instruments and robotics-based techniques are concerned, they are useful when large numbers of the same test are undertaken such as surveillance and companion animal testing and these tests will continue to increase in popularity and use, especially in central reference facilities. There is a clear need to simplify molecular diagnostic techniques so these tests can be applied universally in developing and developed countries. It is likely that new developments will focus on generating low volume and yet affordable diagnostic tests for rabies. More use will be made of point-of-care (POC) diagnostic testing using portable extraction techniques linked to PCR machines with the use of lyophilised reagents to overcome coldchain dependencies in tropical countries. In the 21 st century, these technologies will have a demonstrable impact on people living in developing countries, especially where rabies is still considered a 'neglected' disease. By contrast in the developed world, these new technological advances will undoubtedly be faster, more accurate and cost-effective leading to a 'Theragnostics Approach' that combines therapeutics with diagnostics for the human treatment of rabies. Interest in treating human rabies aggressively is gaining momentum, largely due to the reported success in treating a 15year-old girl, in whom clinical rabies developed one month after she was bitten by a bat, using a combination of therapeutic coma with antiviral drugs whilst allowing for the host immune system to confer immunity -The 'Milwaukee Protocol' (Box 2) [62, 63] . Bioinformatics, genomics, proteomics, and functional genomics are the molecular biology tools that are essential for the progress of molecular 'theragnostics', where both early diagnosis and monitoring of serology are critical factors for the successful treatment of a rabies patient. In addition, theragnostics could eliminate the unnecessary treatment of patients for whom rabies immunotherapy is not appropriate i.e. immunosuppressed patients, resulting in substantial drug cost savings for the healthcare system.",30.318238874781795,13.816234816290967

A preparedness plan for pandemic influenzae in Iceland was elaborated in 2006activated in response to the H1N1 epidemic in 2009and revised in 2016 [49] . During the elaboration of these plans, communication among the different levels of the healthcare system and supporting agencies, such as the DCPEM, had been clearly defined, and proved to be useful in the preparedness for Ebola. Further, as found important in preparedness activities for pandemic influenzae elsewhere [44] , honesty, transparency in communication, and sharing of information from managers to front-line health professionals, was found to be critical. It gave a feeling of being involved, and mitigated the fear that is so frequently encountered during epidemics [38] .",23.412878582222806,8.131371051714062

Nevertheless, important questions remain about the mechanism(s) by which microglia (and possibly other CNS resident macrophages) mediate these protective effects (Figure 1 ). An intriguing observationthat microglial depletion leads in some circumstances to enhanced neuroinflammation, hints at a possible regulatory function of microglia in encephalitis and is an important area for future investigation. Another priority area is the possibility that dysregulated microglial responses, whilst protective against mortality in the early stages of encephalitis, might contribute at later stages to permanent neurological sequelae. A key question is whether these various findings in mouse models translate to human systems; the recent development of methods of microglial differentiation from human pluripotent stem cells offers a potential solution to this question [reviewed in (46) ]. Collectively, these observations suggest the exciting possibility that (i) defects in the microglial response might underlie encephalitis susceptibility in patients, and (ii) that targeting this response may provide new therapeutic opportunities.",22.479598374026246,6.9922066631913475

Since the early 1990s, the official priority of the Chilean foreign policy agenda has been the promotion and expansion of the commercialization of Chilean products (e.g. copper, timber, fish, fruit and wine, among others) and expansion into global markets. The principal vehicle for achieving this goal has been the establishment of a string of free trade agreements (FTAs) with over one hundred nations and regional associations around the world. At the same time, Chile has experienced a growing involvement with its immediate neighbours and the rest of the Latin American region, with emphasis in regional health initiatives. Examples in our analysis include cross border cooperation in the North of Chile (focusing on intercultural health and security issues); Chile's active involvement in the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), the Common Market of the South (MERCOSUR), and the Andean Community of Nations (CAN), each of which has undertaken important health initiatives; and the fast-paced immigration of workers and families from neighbouring nations (including health workers).",27.956431114280665,10.174851278972184

While the use of molecular diagnostic assays for detection of influenza virus infection at hospital and associated commercial laboratories increased modestly since 2006-2007, the availability of influenza molecular diagnostics for clinical care at hospitals was still limited; only 26% of hospital laboratories reported availability of molecular diagnostic assays. Laboratory diagnostics for respiratory viruses other than influenza and RSV were uncommonly available. Also, a minority of hospitals included in our survey had policies in place to systematically test patients with acute respiratory infections (ARI) seen in the ED with influenza diagnostics during influenza season. As the number and type of commercially available laboratory diagnostics for respiratory pathogens evolve, an updated survey is warranted. We showed that in most (67%) hospitals included in FluSurv-NET, a U.S. population-based surveillance network involving 15 states, RIDT was the clinician's primary or only option for influenza diagnostic testing. RIDTs are easy to use and have rapid turnaround time for results. However, RIDTs have been shown to have suboptimal sensitivity (40-70%) compared to RT-PCR or viral culture. [10] [11] [12] [13] Several studies suggest that healthcare providers are more likely to prescribe antiviral drugs with a positive RIDTs. 13, 14 Therefore, a falsenegative result may affect clinicians' decision to provide appropriate treatment and infection control among patients with influenza. Given the suboptimal sensitivity of RIDT, patient management should not depend upon a positive RIDT result. If patient management depends upon a diagnosis (or rule out) of influenza, additional confirmatory test with a more sensitive assay is warranted and the initiation of antiviral treatment and implementation of infection control should be started empirically and not delayed while awaiting confirmation. 15 In our survey, only 31% of laboratories had protocols for confirmatory testing with a more sensitive assay following a negative rapid test result. This may reflect the limited usefulness of receiving testing results late in clinical care. Also, in our survey, the laboratories confirming RIDT test results reflects shipment of specimens to state public health laboratories as part of FluSurv-NET surveillance, in addition to clinician practice. New molecular assays may improve the accuracy of influenza diagnosis, but timeliness and cost of these new assays could affect future use.",23.068741549603374,8.975028645339886

The latter two explosive epidemics occurred in very poor countries that were ill-equipped to control the rapid spread of the disease. Thus each outbreak was associated with a reported high mortality (more than 10,000 died in Haiti and 11,000 died in the West African countries Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia). Tragically the cholera outbreak in Haiti continues seven years later. In 2015, Haiti reported more cases of cholera per population than any other country, and in the first nine months of 2016, 29,000 new cases were recorded, even before hurricane Matthew devastated Haiti's southern peninsula in October. 2 It has become clear that safe, effective and low cost vaccines must play a pivotal role in the control of future explosive outbreaks. However vaccine development takes time and often vaccines are not available until after the outbreak has subsided. 2,3 In 2015, catalyzed in large part by the Ebola crisis (more than 28,000 reported cases at an estimated cost of $8 billion) it was proposed that a global vaccine development fund be created. 4 To this end leaders from governments, foundations, industry and civil society came together at the January 2016 World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland and agreed to ""explore new ways to drive vaccine innovation for high-priority public health threats"". 5 After that meeting more than 80 organizations and 200 individuals collaborated to create the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). In concert with the 2015 proposal, the CEPI mission was ""to stimulate, finance and coordinate the development of vaccines for epidemic diseases"". At the January 2017 World Economic Forum meeting, a group of prominent donors announced they had raised almost $500 million for the CEPI partnership. These initial donors included the Gates Foundation, the governments of Japan and Norway, and Britain's Wellcome Trust. Each will donate $100-$125 million over five years. Germany, India and the European Commission are expected to announce donations in the near future. In addition, six major vaccine makers have joined the coalition as ""partners"" (rather than donors) as well as the World Health Organization and Doctors Without Borders.

Many funders have adopted a financing model intended to spur innovation through short-term pilot projects that place greater emphasis on the novelty of a technology or method than on the validation of its impact, but this approach exacerbates this separation. Pilot funding also fails to acknowledge the long timelines required to engage with health systems effectively and to measure health impact rigorously, instead promoting one-off bilateral collaborative projects that do not scale up and are not sustained after the lifetime of the project. Much more investment is needed in the validation, implementation, and scaling up of innovations in close intellectual partnership with stakeholders who are responsible for delivering them, 3 rather than continuing to fund the proliferation of solutions divorced from the problems themselves. In a recent editorial, Seye Abimbola noted that ""while the gulf between discovery and delivery exists in other fields, what makes global health peculiar is that discoveries and the decisions on whether or how to deliver them are typically made at a distance, removed from the realities of their targets or intended beneficiaries."" 4 The third challenge is methodological: epidemic forecasting is inherently uncertain. There is sometimes an underlying assumption in the big data and artificial intelligence (AI) narrative that complex simulation models and mobile phone data or statistical covariates can bypass the need for the collection of basic epidemiological information. However, for emerging outbreaks-with COVID-19 highlighting this pointwe often lack accurate data about case counts and biological processes driving an epidemic, let alone the behavioural responses of people affected, making it challenging to swiftly adapt or interpret very complex models on the spatiotemporal scales relevant for decision making. Arguably, the most useful frameworks will tend to be simple, 5,6 both because of the need for flexible models that yield rapid answers given the large uncertainty surrounding epidemiological data during an emergency, and because simple models are more easily interpreted and communicated. 2 Clear communication of both the value and limitations of model outputs is a prerequisite to their useful deployment, but is often absent. Since policy makers generally do not have indepth modelling expertise, lack of clear communication risks two negative outcomes: believe models without scepticism and decisions will be misinformed, or dismiss modelling out of hand and fail to use the evidence we have to contain outbreaks as effectively as possible.",22.57883072520427,8.387878638816835

It has only been possible to associate the use of these tests in emergencies to lower consumption of antibiotics, but only once patients return to the outpatient setting. 42 In the specific case of viral antigen detection tests for the influenza virus, they generally demonstrate a highly deficient sensitivity and a negative predictive value, owing to which their use in emergency healthcare, beyond specific high-risk cases and if the patient does not need to be admitted, has been called into question. Fig. 1 shows a proposed algorithm for the use of influenza diagnostic tests during epidemic periods.

Three key properties of this antigen are that it is highly immunogenic, it is not found in BCG or many environmental mycobacteria, and it is a key virulence factor. Its immunogenicity and specificity led to a series of studies to assess its potential as a major component of new diagnostic tests. Such tests have evolved into two major forms-a whole blood assay marketed under the name Quantiferon and an ELISPOT assay marketed under the name T-spot. New antigens have been assessed for improved test performance, most notably CFP-10. Studies of in-house versions of these assays, and more recently the commercial kits, have shown encouraging results in TB cases for the diagnosis of disease and in their close contacts for the diagnosis of M. tuberculosis infection. It is clear that these tests are not confounded by prior BCG vaccination and are probably not subject to boosting by injected tuberculin. Their quantitative readouts may also provide important information with respect to infectious load. However, some findings have caused concern: disparity in test performance between temperate non-TB endemic and tropical TB-endemic settings, evidence of relatively poor sensitivity to the presence of certain M. tuberculosis strains (eg. M. africanum) and in certain sub-groups (eg. Pulmonary TB, certain TB contacts), and rapid unexplained test reversion. It is therefore becoming clear that T cell assays may have a niche in the diagnosis of certain TB cases and in certain individuals suspected of having M. tuberculosis infection, but this niche has not yet been fully defined. More longitudinal studies, especially following TB case contacts for the development of disease, are indicated. Also more studies should be undertaken in TB endemic areas. Finally, if these tests are to have any role in TB control globally they would need to be much cheaper and more easy to use. Some advances with respect to these two issues have already taken place.",22.114597071777425,7.83607371906412

However, research of this type can be helpful in formulating and evaluating policies aiming to improve the provision of care, suggesting what factors may help or hinder the dissemination of good practice and how effectively new initiatives are introduced throughout a health system. For example, complex systems such as health services rely on large and expensive infrastructures and on the provision of trained staff that are difficult to move once they are in place, and considerable effort is often required to achieve universal changes in professional practice. Services therefore develop in a way that is 'path dependent'; the history of development of a service can influence the potential for new development in the future. Investigations of this type include studies of the diffusion of: tomography scanners in the US (Baker, 1979) ; abortion facilities in the North-eastern US (Henry, 1978) ; the administration of antipsychotic olonzapine to urban and rural children in Michigan (Penfold & Kelleher, 2007) ; alternative chiropractic and naturopathic practices in Canada (Williams, 2000) , and the international diffusion of yoga (Hoyez, 2007) .

Individual hospitals, too, are cautioned against preparing in isolation, and are encouraged to coordinate with other local health-care entities because resource and planning obligations can be met more efficiently when shared among all local healthcare institutions (health-care coalition; 19 for this article, health-care coalition refers to an organization that coordinates local health-care entities; for communities without formal coalition organizations, the reader should consider the term coalition to refer to the loosely organized local health-care system entities together with the local public health organization). Critical care providers should therefore work with both hospital and coalition partners to ensure that critical care services are considered for and integrated into planning for health-care system surge capacity. This coordination of preparedness activities will allow for uniform implementation of altered critical care processes by all hospitals, when warranted during a disaster. 4 Hospitals cannot be expected to prepare for endless quantities of critically ill patients. Critical care surge capacity benchmarks must be defined. Guidance to date has remained elusive, though. Loosely To ensure the availability of essential critical care interventions, the Working Group recommends that hospitals give priority to interventions that fulfill the following criteria: (1) interventions that have been shown or are deemed by critical care expert best professional judgment to improve survival, and without which death is likely; (2) interventions that do not require extraordinarily expensive equipment; and (3) interventions that can be implemented without consuming extensive staff or hospital resources. Hospitals should plan to be able to deliver the following during EMCC: basic mode(s) of mechanical ventilation, hemodynamic support, antibiotic or other disease-specific countermeasure therapy, and a small set of prophylactic interventions that are recognized to reduce the serious adverse consequences of critical illness. Hospitals should plan to be able to administer IV fluid resuscitation and vasopressors to large numbers of hemodynamically unstable victims, and stockpile sufficient equipment to do this without relying on external resources for at least the first 48 h of the hospital medical response. Hospitals should plan to provide at least two widely accepted prophylactic interventions that are used every day in critical care: (1) maintaining the head of a mechanically ventilated patient's bed at a 45°angle to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia, and (2) derived benchmarks for mass casualty surge capacity have been previously promulgated (eg, triage, treat, and initially stabilize 500 victims with an infectious disease per 1 million people), 20,21 but they lack enough detail to translate into critical care surge capacity goals. Scientifically rigorous derivation of the benchmarks is desirable. The Task Force spoke with a number of modeling experts to see if accurate surge capacity goals could be developed across the range of plausible mass critical care events (eg, earthquakes, epidemics, chemical exposures). Owing to the limited historical data for such events and the numerous imprecise assumptions within the models, the Task Force was informed that the uncertainties currently limit even sophisticated models from confidently predicting critical care capacity goals.",33.993186542764036,12.558981503825539

In contrast, hospital personnel should be permitted to authorize initiation of reactive EMCC because time delays for completion and dissemination of the coalition decision process may harm patients with immediate critical care needs. Still, the hospital authority to initiate reactive EMCC should rest only with the hospital incident commander. 43 This person need not be a hospital administrator because only clinicians may be present when an immediate decision is required, but the incident commander needs to be someone who is appropriately trained and assumes command after an internal disaster has been declared.

For example, the complexity of models calls for new methods of analysis. In some cases, methods of rigorous analysis (including physics-based methods such as percolation theory and pair approximations (Appendix B))-for sufficiently simple systems that permit such analysis-may provide clearer and more rigorous insights than the output of simulation models, which are often harder to fully understand. For systems that are too complicated for pen-and-paper methods, then methods for visualization of large and multidimensional datasets may prove useful. The second and third pitfalls, where physicists and other modelers, behavioral scientists and epidemiologists do not properly understand one another's fields can be mitigated through more opportunities for interaction between the fields through workshops, seminars and colloquia.

However, the current allocated resources and the existing healthcare system are not adequate for future needs. Also, the everchanging epidemiologies of infectious diseases present consistent challenges to traditional diagnostics. Rapid advances in molecular methods have led to the development of sensitive and specific nucleic acid-based diagnostic tests which strengthen our ability to diagnose, treat and control infectious diseases that cause public health problems. We have reviewed several popular and important nucleic acidbased diagnostic methods, many of which have the potential to be used in the clinic. However, there is still a long way to go until these methods can be routinely used in hospitals. It is likely that biomarkers will be found that are specific for classes of infectious agents and that will provide insights to guide clinical management, even in cases of chronic diseases. However, many hurdles still need to be cleared; for example hybridization, the bottleneck step in most procedures, is still slow and causes delays in diagnosis. We believe that some future nucleic acid technologies will break through the bottlenecks to achieving the perfect diagnostic systems. In particular, an accurate, fast, easy and cost-effective diagnostic for infectious diseases will offer advantages to both basic scientists, clinical doctors and, most importantly, patients. Ideal future diagnostics should not only be ""ASSURED,"" but should also be multiplexed.

adoption of micro fl uidics for these assays will only occur if there are compelling assay improvements,0.22120490567149811,-0.6989367604255676,0.9728094935417175,0dc76aa4-537a-403e-b410-8b6c4315357e,custom_license/Chapter 20 Applications of Micro fl uidics for Molecular Diagnostics,"Micro fl uidic-based technology is ideal for developing highly parallel diagnostic assays that would allow high-throughput screening, but there has been limited success in this area. The lack of success is not due to problems with micro fl uidic devices; for example, drug screening requires high-throughput methods to fi nd and test different drug candidates. Micro fl uidic high-throughput screening (HTS) techniques have been applied to drug discovery to perform thousands of tests in parallel with some success (162) (163) (164) . As of now these methods haven't been applied in micro fl uidic diagnostics for several reasons. Current diagnostics are typically performed in large hospitals or reference labs. In these labs, most tests are Cardiac STATus™ Not reported ( 142 ) batched and performed using robots in a highly parallel, high throughput approach. Replacing these robots by using micro fl uidics is unlikely in the short term due to the large infrastructure already developed. Essentially, a solution to this problem already exists, so adoption of micro fl uidics for these assays will only occur if there are compelling assay improvements. In addition, if an assay can be performed in a batch mode using micro fl uidics, it is likely to be able to be performed in the clinic or POC setting, and for nearly the same price. Thus, micro fl uidics is likely to be driven to the POC rather than to large reference laboratories. The reverse of high-throughput screening (multiple samples with one target) is multiplexed screening, where one sample is tested for multiple agents or biomarkers. A few examples of multiplexed screening have already been provided, especially for cardiac biomarkers, but highly multiplexed diagnostics are still being developed. Multiplexed screening is likely to have a more signi fi cant impact on diagnostics than high throughput screening, especially with the move towards personalized medicine. Micro fl uidics has been combined with microarray technology, which is used regularly in genomics and proteomics, and which will likely have diagnostic applications in the future; however, this is beyond the scope of the chapter. More relevant are micro fl uidic devices that can diagnose multiple diseases simultaneously. A recently released product that uses ""mesoscale"" fl uidics can simultaneously diagnose 15 respiratory diseases associated with viruses ( 165 ) . A challenge with getting the device to commercialization is that regulatory agencies such as the FDA require individual validation of each assay, meaning that multiplexing must clear very challenging regulatory requirements, which will likely limit substantial multiplexing in the near future. Nevertheless, micro fl uidics will probably lead to highly multiplexed assays that can perform 100s or 1,000s of diagnostic assays on one sample. About 1,200 patents related to micro fl uidics have been issued in the USA through 2010. In spite of immense academic interest in micro fl uidics and signi fi cant research investment directed towards both academic and industrial organizations, relatively few commercial products based on micro fl uidics have been introduced into the market ( 166, 167 ) ; however, the rate of introduction is increasing and many barriers are coming down. One of the reasons cited for lack of commercial success is the lack of a potential ""blockbuster"" end-user product that could generate billions of dollars in revenue. Until the industry can fi nd a product with high volume demand, the fabrication costs due to lack of ""economies of scale"" are going to remain high.

This chapter focuses on the clinical utility, advantages, and disadvantages of these tests.

NGS, biosensors, and advanced amplification techniques will persist for longer periods in their constant modified forms. Innovations will always be bringing the new applications in the diagnostics for the improved versions of techniques. New technique applications come with the cost and unbroken funding will be putting new prospective techniques into the trials. These techniques should be simplified in the innovations for their easy practices at the field itself, without looking for any skilled personnel/highly equipped laboratories.",34.18721874730313,13.21111288231396

It is always best to take measures beforehand to minimize property damage and prevent injury and death. In the case of hospitals, some preliminary research indicates that four factors affect an institution's motivation to mitigate: influence of legislation and regulation, economic considerations, the role of ""champions"" within the institution, and the impact of disasters and imminent threats on agenda-setting and policy making. It was discovered during this research that ""mitigation measures were found to be most common when proactive mitigation measures were mandated by regulatory agencies and legislation."" 55 Tax incentives, government assistance grants, and building code and insurance requirements may also serve to motivate administrators and decision makers to put the necessary time and effort into mitigation planning. 30 The Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP), designed to provide leadership and funding through grants to and cooperative agreements with states, territories, and eligible municipalities to improve surge capacity and enhance community and hospital preparedness for public health emergencies, 52 has undergone significant cuts over the past few years that threaten to undo progress made in the last decade. HPP appropriations have decreased from $426 million in FY2010 to $255 million in FY2014, including a one-third cut in the FY2014 omnibus. 56 HPP provides financial incentives to ensure that hospitals are able to coordinate, cooperate, and reduce loss of life during an emergency. The program allowed the coalition in Boston to practice two 24-hour disaster simulations involving several area hospitals before the 2013 Boston Marathon Bombing. The planning and efficiency of the hospitals after the attack were major factors in saving the lives of the 264 individuals injured in the bombings, and there were no additional deaths after the three on-site fatalities. 57 The loss of an estimated 46,000 state and local public health jobs since 2008 58 also has the potential to damage the progress made in all-hazards preparedness since 9/11. With little prospect of increased national funding in the immediate future, it is necessary for local communities to develop sustainability strategies to ensure every dollar is well spent in helping their communities prepare for disasters. 59 The CDC Capability 10: Medical Surge publication encourages the widespread collaboration and allocation of resources in community-wide surge capacity efforts and has been helpful in focusing these efforts in a realistic and operational manner. 60 ",26.551448057324105,11.241665536742055

Those forces are still at work. Table 1 is a summary of some of the economic forces, including the rise of managed care organizations and their attendant accumulation of bargaining power with reference laboratories. In the face of ever-rising health care costs, hospitals are enduring unrelenting pressure to reduce laboratory costs, resulting in the formation of consortium laboratories among hospital groups, referrals of specimens to private reference laboratories, closings of smaller hospital laboratories, and reductions in laboratory staff. Table 2 shows the forces at work for clinical laboratories, which are fighting battles on two fronts to maintain staff levels against further erosion. Management is asking for workforce reductions, while fewer qualified applicants are available for open positions. With the closing of many medical technology schools over the past two decades, graduating medical technologists, clinical laboratory scientists, and technicians number less than half of projected workforce needs. At the same time, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) has placed new demands for secure patient information handling, adding another burden on laboratory staff (1, 2) . Table 3 lists the forces at work with public health laboratories. While engaged in traditional public health activities, these laboratories are experiencing multiple new pressures, including HIPAA and CLIA regulatory compliance issues, the need to be prepared for analytic response to bioterrorism acts, loss of state funding with a parallel need to bill Medicaid for patient testing and provide testing on a fee-for-service basis. While a significant amount of funding support and technology transfer has accompanied the charge to state and local public health laboratories to develop capability for bioterrorism testing, state funding for traditional public health testing has withered (1) .",24.727564833689726,10.16205108339106

Whereas it was once considered unconscionable to use biological weapons intentionally on civilian populations, events in the United States following the airplane destruction of the World Trade Center towers clearly demonstrate that this is no longer the case [162] . Another bioterrorism attack against American citizens in the United States is inevitable in the twenty-first century. Indeed, because dissemination of biological agents is now relatively easy and inexpensive, no civilian population is immune to this type of event, given the scope of recent global terrorist activities. The threat of bioterrorism has forced many developed countries to put in place preparedness plans and to implement intensive research aimed at developing new diagnostic tests for the detection of the agents most likely to be used. Pathogen genome sequencing projects are underway for Bacillus anthracis and other microorganisms that may be used as biological weapons, because rapid diagnostics will be critical to response to an attack, as was so clearly demonstrated by the events in the United States following September 11, 2001 [163] . In October 2001, bioterrorists used the United States Postal Service to disseminate military-grade anthrax spores through the mail [54, 55, 164] . Development of a coordinated laboratory network between the diagnostic microbiology laboratory sector, the state public health laboratories, and the CDC in Atlanta, Georgia was critical to the early recognition of this bioterrorist event [119] . On October 4, 2001, when a 63-year-old man was hospitalized in Palm Beach County, Florida with inhalation anthrax, his respiratory samples were sent to Integrated Regional Laboratories (IRL), Florida [164] . Because the CDC had recently established a laboratory network for biological weapons pathogen recognition that included front-line diagnostic laboratories such as IRL in its training, officials at this laboratory rapidly recognized they were dealing with a case of pulmonary anthrax and alerted the CDC, which confirmed their identification of the isolate within 24 hours. Similar laboratory networks need to be established across national and international boundaries so that the information about critical events can be rapidly and transparently shared between the primary care and public health systems.",27.87012152290744,7.964616522647348

The use of molecular tests for Legionnaires' disease is a good example of how assay regulation has had an impact on diagnostic strategies. Despite NATs being the diagnostic test of choice for Legionnaires' disease, the shortage of FDA-approved assays has severely limited the use of these tests in the USA, resulting in the continued use of suboptimal diagnostics and underdiagnosis of this disease [27] .

In fact, simple inexpensive POC tests based on antibody detection that are close to the 'ASSURED' ideal are already available in most developing countries in a lateral-flow or dipstick format (i.e., for the diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus infection). It also needs to be highlighted that the majority of population in the developing world resides in remote rural areas, so patients often travel long distances to primary healthcare settings and thus may be unable to return for test results. Moreover, primary care infrastructures may have poor availability of trained technicians and limited electricity supply for equipment or refrigerators for the storage of reagents. Portable, extremely low-cost, very easy-to-use isothermal POC tests that provide rapid visual readouts with minimal instrumentation and reagents stable at room temperature would have wide acceptance in this scenario. In particular, it is expectable that mobile phones, which are prevalent in the developing world, will become fundamental complements of POC applications since they can contribute capabilities of battery-powered supply, readout and connectivity for transmission of results. The big size of the global health market and its urgent need for more accessible diagnostics offer attractive opportunities for manufacturers that have the ability to scale up POC applications and reduce prices. While margins may be low in the poorest countries, POC products may allow profitable commercialization in emerging middle-income countries.

Although real-time polymerase chain reaction might be used in the acute phase of the infection, retrospective diagnosis and large-scale serological studies mainly rely on serological tests. This is especially important as mild cases of MERS have been increasingly reported. 1 Notably, we found that cross-reactive antibodies against MERS-CoV might be found in convalescent SARS patients' sera by both immunofluorescent and neutralizing antibody tests, possibly related to a significant B-cell epitope overlapping the heptad repeat 2 region of the spike protein. 4 Therefore, in Southeast Asia, where the proportion of the general population with previous SARS infection might be higher than that in the Middle East and Europe, this potential diagnostic fallacy should be considered.

Despite the lower cost of developing new veterinary vaccines, high and middle income countries still pay higher prices until the fixed costs of development are paid off, there is an over-supply of vaccine, or competing products enter the market. To redress the pricing barriers in the case of human vaccines, there has been strong advocacy for new approaches to secure vaccine supply and access for developing countries where the burden of infectious diseases is greatest [202] . As part of this strategy, emerging market manufacturers provide access to low unit cost vaccines, and such manufacturers of veterinary vaccines could play a substantial role in a public health strategy for animal immunization. Indeed all of the principles being applied to human vaccines could be extended to vaccines for animals, particularly if there is both a clear rationale for public health and the ""pull"" of a potentially expanded market or of guaranteed purchase agreements. Up to now public-private financing for developing and distributing veterinary vaccines has represented a tiny fraction of support available for human developing-world vaccines, and has focused on vaccines for livestock as a means of improving animal production and protein supply rather than preventing zoonotic diseases [203] . Given the public health impact of zoonotic diseases described in the introduction to this review and the potentially lower cost of interventions targeting animals vs. humans, there should be a new emphasis on the public health improvements that could result from animal immunization. Zoonotic diseases that merit consideration because they occur at high incidence or are poorly controlled, include rabies, zoonotic leishmaniasis, brucellosis, Rift Valley fever, M. bovis, Lyme disease, and several enteric bacterial infections.",27.026506361178974,11.106924032056675

Further refi nement of bacterial and viral culture methods improved the ability to detect specifi c pathogens and identify their susceptibility testing against specifi c antimicrobials, although the time needed for culture growth (24-72 h) did not infl uence treatment decisions on admission. These diagnostic methods did not change until the late 1980s when major advances in molecular biology, immunology, genomics, and technical engineering led to many new diagnostic tests. Serological tests for detection of microbial antigen or antibody, agglutination tests, com plement fi xation tests, fl uorescent antibody tests, radio immunoassay, and ELISA have been developed for various pathogens without any great infl uence on clinical management of respiratory tract infections at points of care. 38 The most relevant development has been the use of nucleic acid amplifi cation techniques (NAAT) for respiratory tract infection diagnostics. 39 The presence of microbial nucleic acids in respiratory tract samples (sputum, nasopharyngeal swabs, tracheal aspirates, and bronchoalveolar lavage) has been exploited for amplifi cation of microbe-specifi c genetic targets. 26, 27 This was initially labour intensive and NAAT technologies have evolved to real time PCR (rtPCR), loop-mediated amplifi cation (LAMP), nucleic acid sequence-based amplifi cation, and strand displacement amplifi cation, the latter three methods avoiding thermocycling.",26.654325958677205,9.486559337681358

The burden of nosocomial influenza can be high, incurring additional costs for diagnostic tests, increased morbidity, and extended hospitalization [17, 18] . Therefore, rapid diagnostic tests are needed to identify patients with influenza at admission, in order to prevent nosocomial transmission by facilitating isolation and cohorting decisions [18] . Studies have documented substantial nosocomial transmission of hMPV in pediatric units [20] , as well as in chronic care facilities [21] , similar to what is seen with RSV. During the height of RSV season, many institutions must cohort RSV-positive children because of a lack of private rooms. However, dual infections with RSV and hMPV do occur. Limiting diagnostics to RSV alone in a cohorting scenario could put other seriously ill children at risk for acquisition of a second viral infection with hMPV. The meaning of mixed viral infections can be defined only if testing is comprehensive.

The claim that this so-called shotgun approach adds unnecessary cost to the patient is an oversimplification. Although molecular multiplex assays are often more costly in terms of reagents and patient billing compared with a single culture-or serology-based assay, when multiple diagnostic tests are ordered, the multiplex assay is often less expensive than the full battery of traditional tests. Anecdotally, physicians desire to provide the patient with a definitive diagnosis and treatment plan, which may inadvertently lead to the overuse of medical resources such as injudicious antibiotic use and additional diagnostic tests (eg, imaging) to help establish a diagnosis when the causative pathogen is not easily identified. Therefore, the ability to rapidly and accurately provide a cause for the patient's illness may improve both physician and patient satisfaction.",25.944498695015657,8.851483618321927

The nucleic acid-based tests developed over the last two decades have been remarkably successful in accelerating our ability to identify etiological agents. However, the conventional approach to assay design has limitations in the context of a changing disease environment. Most nucleic acid-based tests have been designed to detect single organisms or a small panel of organisms chosen on the basis of presumptive diagnosis. Standard target-focused PCRs or ligase chain reactions, even moderately multiplex tests, will fail when the etiological agent is not part of the panel of tests. Usually, uncommon viral infections are common in immunocompromised patients and novel sequence variants appear. The variations may be in regions of the virus targeted by probes or primers. Novel or known viruses emerge in unexpected places or under unforeseen circumstances. Moreover, in the absence of sequence information, the design of primers and/or probes for new tests to detect the new disease is time consuming. By the time a new probe has been added to the suite of target-focused tests, the disease outbreak may have run its course. Indeed, many deaths from viral encephalitis in the UK are not attributed to a specific etiologic agent [5] so there is evidently room for improvement, which presents an opportunity for broadspectrum molecular diagnostics, not narrowly focused on the basis of presumptive diagnosis. Factors in the environment that have the potential to influence the spectrum of viruses to which Homo sapiens is exposed will be summarized in the following section. The potential impact of each factor on target-focused, nucleic acid-based diagnostic tests will be discussed, before the presentation of examples of emerging technological responses.",25.01744828347936,8.813845195625982

The entrenched FSA carriers' focuses on developing hub and spoke networks while new entrants seem intent on creating low-cost, point-to-point structures. The hub and spoke system places a very high value on the feed traffic brought to the hub by the spokes, especially the business traffic therein, thereby creating a complex, marketing intense business where revenue is the key and where production costs are high. Inventory (of seats) is also kept high in order to meet the service demands of business travellers. The FSA strategy is a high cost strategy because the hub-and-spoke network structure means both reduced productivity for capital (aircraft) and labour (pilots, cabin crew, airport personnel) and increased costs due to self-induced congestion from closely spaced banks of aircraft. 13 The FSA business strategy is sustainable as long as no subgroup of passengers can defect from the coalition of all passenger groups, and recognizing this, competition between FSAs included loyalty programs designed to protect each airline's coalition of passenger groupsfrequent travellers in particular. The resulting market structure of competition between FSAs was thus a cozy oligopoly in which airlines competed on prices for some economy fares, but practiced complex price discrimination that allowed high yields on business travel. However, the vulnerability of the FSA business model was eventually revealed through the VBA strategy which (a) picked and chose only those origin-destination links that were profitable and (b) targeted price sensitive consumers. 14 The potential therefore was not for business travellers to defect from FSAs (loyalty programs helped to maintain this segment of demand) but for leisure travellers and other infrequent flyers to be lured away by lower fares (Fig. 1) .",26.997225130432444,9.609628728121713

Delta Airlines, for example, had organized its network into a hub at Atlanta with multiple spokes. Other carriers had evolved more linear networks with generally full connectivity and were reluctant to shift to hub-and-spoke for two reasons. First, regulations required permission to exit markets and such exit requests would likely lead to another carrier entering to serve 'public need'. Secondly, under regulation it was not easy to achieve the demand side benefits associated with networks because of regulatory barriers to entry. In the era of economic regulation the choice of frequency and ancillary service competition were a direct result of being constrained in fare and market entry competition.

The goal of the convening was to focus the few resources in pandemic preparedness on the crucial and persistent barriers that remain across research, clinical trials, and manufacturing before and during an epidemic. We attempt to define Pathogen X and present the challenges, opportunities, and priorities in the acceleration of diagnostic, vaccine, and small molecule development in preparation for an epidemic. Also, we present coordination guides that have been shown to be successful in planning and prioritising development activities. We hope that this content will enable funders, academia, and product developers (ie, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies) to better navigate the epidemic medical countermeasure space. The content should also support stakeholders in coordinating and engaging with developers of medical countermeasures, regulators, and government officials.

Often, these diagnostic tests are used to screen patients whom would most benefit from referral to the catheterization laboratory. Without such tests the threshold for referral may decrease, resulting in increased referrals. Conversely, when catheterization laboratory resources are scarce, many patients may be required to undergo multiple non-invasive diagnostics as an alternative in order to better establish the likelihood of disease before referral for CATH. A decrease in the number of referrals may also result because of an increased threshold for evidence pertaining to disease burden prior to referral. Ultimately, this may cause a delay in referral to CATH because the patient is waiting for such tests (which may not be reflected in wait times if referral is after the point when test results are available).",29.46417787613241,11.6006015850069

The possibility of conducting phase II/III clinical trials during an outbreak, at least as part of a ring vaccination strategy, has been demonstrated [4] [5] [6] [7] . This has highlighted that prototype vaccine trials need to be better integrated into emergency response protocols during an outbreak [8, 9] . The caveat to this is that such trials need to be very carefully managed and communities affected must be actively engaged to prevent misunderstandings about what researchers are doing [10, 11] . Also, performing research during an outbreak presents extra challenges compared to similar research conducted on endemic diseases. Partnerships between researchers and local health authorities need to be quickly and effectively established; local regulatory and ethical approval must be granted for any vaccination trial; ideally local physicians should be recruited to deliver the vaccine and monitor patients; sometimes these factors are additionally complicated by a lack of local infrastructure (power, water, internet access) hampering storage and administration of large batches of vaccine [8, 12, 13] . A fundamental problem for funding trials for vaccines to emerging epidemic diseases with outbreak potential is that such vaccines are not commercially attractive prior to an outbreak, or during inter-epidemic periods. Given the costs and extended timeframes of developing, licensing and manufacturing a new vaccine it is understandable that the commercial priority lies with endemic diseases in wealthy countries where there is a predictable market for the vaccine every year [14] . Emerging and outbreak diseases are sporadic by definition and although outbreaks can be large there can be long periods between outbreaks and therefore there is no guaranteed market for the vaccine product. In this context, the willingness of governments and inter-governmental organisations such as WHO to support commercial scale vaccine development and to invest in establishing a bank of experimental vaccines is key to preparedness for future outbreaks. It is important that the international community develops a strategic approach to avoid duplication and ensure all gaps are covered. Obviously the United States Government and other agencies have their own unique additional objectives to address vaccines for bioterror agents. Overall, WHO and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) are in a good position to promote a cooperative approach to emerging disease vaccine development.",49.96349936703607,17.20866222411809

For example, based on alignment of influenza A virus segment 3 (PA) from >1000 strains, researchers recently identified a conserved region that leads to a pause and ribosomal frame shift during translation [27 ] . This results in a fusion protein called PA-X consisting of the N-terminus of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the newly discovered peptide. This protein appears to have nuclease activity that dampens the host antiviral response. What this study illustrates is that comparative genomics of well-studied viruses can reveal exciting, novel genomic features with implications for virus replication, pathogenicity, and interactions with the hosts. In addition to these kinds of discoveries, the characterizations 482 Host-microbe interactions: viruses [49, 50] of specific viral genotypes or viral variants that associate with virulence can lead to enhanced diagnostic assays that provide information that was not previously available to clinicians. In a new generation of diagnostic tests, rapid sequencing assays could be used not only to detect viruses in patient samples but to provide information about the viral subtype and the presence of virulence genes, which could be used to predict disease severity and outcome. Sequence-based diagnostic tests could also be used to identify the presence of antiviral drug resistance alleles, which would inform the management of some viral infections, including influenza A and cytomegalovirus. Furthermore, ultra deep sequencing (resulting in >100-1000 sequences at each base position of the viral gene or genome) could be used to assess viral variation and quasispecies, which could be important for monitoring emerging pathogens or to development effective vaccines. Sequencing assays aimed at the human transcriptome also have the potential to be developed into clinical tests to measure the host response to viral infection, which may help both with diagnosis and selection of treatment. An additional advantage of diagnostic tests based on high throughput sequencing is that they may be less vulnerable than PCR-based assays to sequence variation in primerbinding or probe-binding regions.",25.237207179382565,9.131906366636645

The intention was that this would make them more cost conscious since they would be paying; that is, they would be deterred from referring patients too readily for tests and treatments, and that they would hold care providers, principally hospitals, to account for spending and quality of care for patients (Hunter 2016) . The New Labour government of 1997 broadly extended this policy, merging general practices into Primary Care Trusts which jointly commissioned services for patients. The late 1990s into the early 2000s saw the further introduction of private providers into the NHS, for example, to run day surgery, pathology and diagnostic services (DoH 1997). In 2010, the new Coalition government consolidated this by the setting up of Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) which hold approximately two-thirds of the NHS budget. CCGs currently purchase care on behalf of GPs for their patients. Moreover, under the new 'any qualified provider' provision, care could be commissioned not only from NHS providers but also from the for-profit and the not-for-profit third sector (charities and social enterprises) (DoH 2010). This overall policy remains in place at the time of writing in 2017 with recent concern focusing less visibly on structural reform and more on incapacity to meet demand-for example, in January 2017 the British Red Cross said that the NHS was facing a humanitarian crisis in the face of escalating demand and rising waiting lists for treatment.",28.56049958317919,9.072232138438078

However, estimation of VE S is resource-intensive, since it requires testing of all trial participants, either by periodically conducting assays for infection throughout the trial or by performing serological testing at the trial's conclusion if natural and vaccinederived immune responses can be distinguished. Testing of trial participants is also necessary for estimating vaccine efficacy against progression to symptoms (VE P ), another critical outcome measure (8) . As Rodriguez-Barraquer et al. (15) noted in an analysis of dengue vaccine trial results, protection against symptomatic infection may differ from protection against infection (and, in the case of dengue, VE P may be negative because of antibody-dependent enhancement) in general. It is therefore important to consider estimates of both VE S and VE P when analyzing trial results.",42.751247186254204,13.844513694024839

Will Zika virus return to Africa in epidemic form? 32 An important lesson from the EVD epidemic is that long-term planning should be based on a holistic approach for strengthening and building health systems and services, moving away from disease-specific national programmes. New ways of thinking at the national, regional, and global levels are required to strengthen healthcare systems. This is required not only to improve the ability of countries and regions to deal effectively with epidemic infectious disease threats, but also to sustain functioning health systems during outbreaks so that other disease control programmes (like those for TB, malaria, and HIV) are not compromised during the emergency measures of a severe epidemic. This will require skilled and trained staff at the national level, and such staff are scarce in most low-income countries. It has previously been argued that central or regional laboratories, able to perform rapid advanced diagnostics on samples from patients with alarming symptoms but without a clear diagnosis, are urgently needed for early outbreak detection. 32 There are important global leadership issues that need to be considered. The role of the WHO in the EVD outbreak and its capability to prevent and control epidemics in developing countries has been criticized and questioned. 36 [ 2 0 _ T D $ D I F F ] So who should take the lead in the proactive surveillance, coordination, and emergency response to future outbreaks?

The global community is much better prepared now, with many capacitybuilding initiatives including those under the WHO's International Health Regulations (2005). Indeed, the time interval from the first case description to the virus sequencing and the availability of diagnostic assays was much faster for COVID19 than for SARS, and diagnostic tests were available globally within 2 weeks of reports of cases from China. Organisations such as the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, and the Global Research Collaboration For Infectious Disease Preparedness, supported by the WHO Research Blueprint and its Global Coordinating Mechanism, were able to accelerate the outbreak response and rapidly initiate technical platforms for the development of vaccines and therapeutics. 29 Standardised data collection tools were distributed and used within a matter of weeks, and the first clinical trials for therapeutic interventions was initiated in January. 30 China has higher medical standards, a better educated healthcare workforce, and more technical and scientific expertise now than in 2003. China's current response contains much more transparency and decisive action, which was initiated much earlier in the current outbreak than in the 2003 outbreak. 31 So why have the case numbers of COVID19 already surpassed those of SARS by Jan 30, 2020? There are several explanations. First, the situation is different. Wuhan, the epicentre of COVID19, combines multiple elements that make containment challenging. As the largest city (>11 million) in central China, Wuhan is a major transport hub and centre for industry and commerce, home to the largest train station, biggest airport, and largest deepwater port in central China. 32 China's outward travel has more than doubled in the past decade, and its urban population densities possibly even tripled. The proximity of people in residential housing, during commute, and in work environments in a megacity such as Wuhan amplifies persontoperson transmission. The sheer population size is the single biggest challenge. Hospitals were initially overwhelmed by the number of patients, and many patients were not hospitalised because of a shortage of hospital beds, thereby contributing to seeding in the community. A new hospital was built within 10 days. A massive banquet with 40 000 guests took place just before the lockdown, further exacerbating community spread. Worse, in the days just before Wuhan was put under lockdown, more than 5 million people (many of whom might have been incubating the virus) had travelled out because of the Personal View upcoming Spring Festival, thus spreading COVID19 to other provinces in China. The high connectivity of Wuhan to international airports further facilitated rapid spread to cities and countries with high air passenger volumes from China, such as Singapore, Japan, and Thailand. 33, 34 A second explanation might be that the infectious period is different. Isolation was effective for SARS because peak viral shedding occurred after patients were already quite ill with respiratory symptoms and could be easily identified. Although asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients have been reported for SARS, 35 no known transmission occurred from these patients. By contrast, preliminary evidence from exported COVID19 cases suggest that transmission during the early phase of illness also seems to contribute to overall transmission; 36, 37 therefore, isolation of more severely ill patients at the time of presentation to healthcare facilities will be too late. The effectiveness of isolation and contact tracing methods depends on the proportion of transmission that occurs before symptom onset. Presymptomatic transmission will also make temperature screening less effective. 38 A third explanation could be that the trans missibility might be higher for COVID19 than for SARS. R₀ is a central concept in infectious disease epidemiology, indicating the risk of an infectious agent with respect to its epidemic potential. A recent review (published in February, 2020) found the average R₀ of COVID19 to be 3·28 and median R₀ to be 2·79, higher than that of SARS, although more accurate estimates can only be ascertained when the epidemic stablises. 39 The speed of spread of COVID19from the first documented case in early December, 2019, to 80 000 cases by the end of February, 2020, despite massive con tainment efforts-is certainly much faster than that reported for SARS between November, 2002, and March, 2003, before any forms of containment were even instituted. The high attack rates on the cruise ship Diamond Princess in Japan, with more than 700 on board infected out of approximately 3700 cruise ship passengers and crew members by Feb 28, 2020, despite public health measures, suggest a very high transmissibility. 40 A fourth explanation is that the clinical spectrum is different. China's initial case definition was focused on pneumonia, and initial case fatality rates (CFR) were reported at about 10% on the basis of this narrow case definition. 6 However, as the epidemic unfolds, it has become apparent that mild cases are common in COVID19. Patients with mild disease manifestations will be missed even if a more sensitive surveillance system were in place, and these patients might spread the disease silently, similar to influenza. On Feb 18, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention published their data of the first 72 314 patients including 44 672 patients with confirmed COVID19. 41 As many as 81% of the patients with confirmed COVID19 were reported to have a mild disease or less severe forms of pneumonia, whereas 13·8% had a severe condition and 4·7% were critically ill. The study also noted that nearly half (49%) of the critically ill patients have died. Of the patients from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which provides a captive cohort to study the virus, more than 10% were asymptomatic upon diagnosis. Estimating CFRs remains elusive, as many patients are still in the early stages of disease, and more fatalities could occur given that death seems to occur 2-4 weeks after onset of symptoms. 6, 7 The current estimate by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention is a CFR of 2·3%, with increasing CFRs for patients with advanced age or comorbidities. However, the report also shows that CFRs vary greatly between Wuhan and other provinces in China; therefore some uncertainty remains around CFRs. With already more than 3600 cases imported into or acquired in other countries (or on cruise ships), more information on the full spectrum of disease and a better estimate of the CFR should be available in the next few weeks. Of note is that even if the CFR of COVID19 (possibly <2%) is far lower than that of SARS (10%), this is not reassuring, as a highly transmissible disease with low CFR will result in many more cases, and therefore also ultimately more deaths than SARS.",22.32009138634066,6.3654553273279575

These partnerships have both economic and legal dimensions. PPPs respond to the desire of funders to exercise greater control over the use of their resources, and to bypass bureaucratic and governance barriers in the UN system. Institutions established as PPPs often have a specific mandate, with control and influence shared by the public and private partners. They exist on a continuum, in which some are more public in nature (eg, largely financed funding agencies that include private actors on their boards), whereas others are closer to private institutionseg, entities working closely with the private sector to accelerate research and development (figure 2). 105 The largest PPPs operating in global health include the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.

For the unemployed, the terms of market-orientation and privatization inflict painful memories, including their losing health insurance coverage [34, 35] . To correct the so-called ""market failures"", many researchers proposed for stronger government intervention in the health sector [36] . As a counterargument, several researchers who noted that the limited market mechanism ambiguously defined by the governments has distorted the health care system called for market-oriented reform [21, 37] .

Many of the new diagnostic technologies entering the clinical laboratory are part of an evolution from nucleic acid amplifi cation technologies for use in amplifying, identifying, and sequencing target single gene sequences towards a systems biology approach which looks at the expression of multiple genes in response to a variety of stimuli and conditions such as infectious disease, drug therapy, and cancer ( Billings and Brown, 2004 ) . Systems biology is often used as a synonym for functional genomics, a description of the genomic and epigenomic infl uences on a trait and interactions with environmental variants (see Chapter 6).",33.045293422914874,10.624413160316214

Modern medical technology is available in the world market but at costs higher than most of the region's population can aff ord. Many traditional health practices persist alongside the use of new medical technologies and pharmaceutical products, presenting regulatory problems in terms of safety and quality. With increasing educational levels, ageing populations, and growing consciousness of human rights in the recently developing democratic environment, the demand for better care is increasing. Health systems in the region face more serious adjustment problems than ever before. 51 Health services have become an important industry, with a mix of public and private non-profi t and for-profi t actors, along with the growth of trade and medical tourism. The provision, fi nancing, and regulatory functions of the public sector have to adapt accordingly to these transformations. The need to restructure healthcare delivery and fi nancing systems becomes crucial to balance new demand and supply equilibriums. 52, 53 Countries in southeast Asia and their health system reforms can thus be categorised according to the stages of development of their health-care systems. A typology of common issues, challenges, and priorities are generated for the diverse mix of health systems of southeast Asia at diff erent stages of socioeconomic development (see webappendix pp 5-8). The pressures placed on national health-care systems by the recent demographic and epidemiological transitions that we have described are amplifi ed by the growing demands of an increasingly educated and affl uent population for high quality health care and the supply of the latest medical technology. Before the east Asian fi nancial crisis in 1997-98 and the recent global economic recession, an expanding middle class in the urban populations of the larger cities pushed their demand for high quality care into a booming private sector. As a result, market forces have turned many aspects of health care into a new industry in countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand, contributing to labour-force distortions for the production and distribution of health workers both within and across countries.",26.03423900963099,10.506011527244556

It is important to remember that the first aetiology of fever in a traveller from a tropical region is malaria and that this diagnosis is far more likely than that of an emerging HID. All diagnostic tests should be carried out, if possible, in a BSL 3/4 laboratory, including routine haematology and clinical chemistry as well as blood film for malaria. The BSL 3/4 diagnostic laboratory should be located as near as possible to the HLIU, to avoid unnecessary transportation [7] . Even if the use of an auto-analyser might be safe for sample analysis, handling of a sample suspected to be highly contagious, such as Ebola virus-contaminated blood, cannot be done safely in a routine laboratory. An alternative is that routine testing is done in the HLIU at the patient's bedside. Consequently, related research and the development of bedside or point-of-care diagnostic testing models are mandatory.

Will the clinical value of the test be clearly demonstrated to thought leaders, early adopters, patient advocacy groups, and other stakeholder; required for rapid uptake of the diagnostic? The role of professional society guidelines, CMS coverage, technology review by the insurance industry, and regulators must be considered. Will reimbursement issues delay the uptake and access of the test to a large sector of the patient population? Are there patient safety issues, within specifi c treatments, that warrant rapid clinical uptake? What are the training requirements? How does the clinical lab select the appropriate technology from a pool of technical approaches to the diagnostic problem?

However, by the mid-1990s, pharmaceutical companies had a number of antiviral compounds; some specifi cally tailored to HIV, well into clinical trials and needed an accurate biomarker to analyze effectiveness of the new therapies. This convergence of therapeutics and diagnostics would lead to the birth of the theranostic , a diagnostic test linked to the application of specifi c therapies ( Warner, 2004 ) . In 1996, Roche Diagnostics began the Roche Amplicor® Access Program to provide two free baseline HIV viral load tests to anyone in the United States with HIV ( James, 1996 ) . Reference laboratories helped execute this program, which began the successful uptake of HIV viral load testing in the marketplace. As with traditional diagnostics, molecular diagnostic tests needed to demonstrate utility and performance before their adoption into practice. First, there must be an unmet clinical need, which was clearly the case with HIV. Secondly, with the development of antiviral therapies, HIV viral load testing provided information that resulted in a therapeutic action, and also provided the means to continually monitor the effi cacy of the treatment.

An advantage of such pathogen-specific molecular signatures in the host is that they may be present at various stages of infection, even when the pathogen is not detectable using standard or direct diagnostic tests. Ramilo et al. (2007) , used gene expression analysis to diagnose different pathogen fingerprints in pediatric patients with respiratory infections caused by influenza A virus and Gram-negative (E.coli) or Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) bacteria. Classifier genes, which discriminate influenza A from bacterial infections (S. pneumoniae and S. aureus) and E. coli from S. aureus infections, were identified and validated. Another example of ""-omic"" technology use in diagnosing infection is the development of a protein based signature for diagnosing trypanosomiasis or sleeping sickness, which affects half a million people yearly in sub-Saharan Africa. Trypanosomiasis, if left untreated, is a debilitating disease with a lethaloutcome; it was successfully controlled in the past, but, since the 1970s, has re-emerged as an epidemic of immense proportions causing huge, yet widely underestimated morbidity and mortality of up to 50,000 cases every year (Stich et al., 2002) . Establishing the diagnosis remains complicated, as current diagnostic tests lack the sensitivity to detect low parasite loads in peripheral blood. Papadopoulos et al. analyzed serum samples from patients and controls using SELDI -TOF mass spectrometry and identified distinct serum proteomic signatures in both groups (Papadopoulos et al., 2004) . After depleting serum samples of antibody components, the authors identified two prominent protein peaks at 23/24 and 47 kDa in patients. These proteomic signatures may provide the basis for new diagnostic tests and alternative methods to monitor the host response to treatment. Moreover, additional characterization of these differentially expressed proteins may allow the development of simpler, cheaper antibody based tests (Papadopoulos et al., 2004; Agranoff et al., 2005) .",27.14448584823657,10.458539526145628

A fractal community can create a shared repertoire and develop global principles while remaining true to local knowledge and idiosyncrasies. Moreover, if one locality has a problem or an idea, the broader community provides an extraordinary learning laboratory to test proposals in practice with motivated sites.

In clinical practice, narrowing of antibiotic therapy is, unfortunately, unusual, but the committee strongly recommends this as best medical practice. The possibility of polymicrobial CAP and the potential benefit of combination therapy for bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia have complicated the decision to narrow antibiotic therapy. Delays in starting antibiotic therapy that result from the need to obtain specimens, complications of invasive diagnostic procedures, and unneeded antibiotic changes and additional testing for false-positive tests are also important considerations. The general recommendation of the committee is to strongly encourage diagnostic testing whenever the result is likely to change individual antibiotic management. For other patients with CAP, the recommendations for diagnostic testing focus on patients in whom the diagnostic yield is thought to be greatest. These 2 priorities often overlap. Recommendations for patients in whom routine diagnostic testing is indicated for the above reasons are listed in Retrospective studies of outpatient CAP management usually show that diagnostic tests to define an etiologic pathogen are infrequently performed, yet most patients do well with empir-ical antibiotic treatment [42, 106] . Exceptions to this general rule may apply to some pathogens important for epidemiologic reasons or management decisions. The availability of rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests, specific treatment and chemoprevention, and epidemiologic importance make influenza testing the most logical. Influenza is often suspected on the basis of typical symptoms during the proper season in the presence of an epidemic. However, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can cause a similar syndrome and often occurs in the same clinical scenario [107] . Rapid diagnostic tests may be indicated when the diagnosis is uncertain and when distinguishing influenza A from influenza B is important for therapeutic decisions.",27.528068687329558,10.010997909899507

Coalitions have existed prior to the development of the HPP. Coalitions developed with the CSEPP program, Metropolitan Medical Response System (MMRS), Metropolitan Strike Teams, and now with the hospital preparedness program. Coalitions are locally or regionally based. Membership within coalitions is defined at the local level (city, county, state, or region). Coalitions have established leaders who have specific roles and responsibilities as well as an organizational framework. Individual organizational support is identified through the development of an MOU or memorandum of agreement. Such agreements articulate roles and responsibilities, identify the process for distribution of funding sources, and facilitate the integration of the preparedness community. For example, some coalitions have used HPP grant dollars to purchase equipment, creating communications networks between facilities and first responder partners. They have purchased caches of supplies and established community-based emergency preparedness exercises. Coalitions exist as a result of established day-to-day relationships within a hospital and between hospitals and public health partners. Relationships develop that include levels of trust, familiarity, and dependability. Coalitions have expanded outside the hospital/public health boundaries to include skilled nursing facilities and long term care facilities, all of which are part of the fabric of health care providers in the community. Many coalitions share training schedules, offer joint educational or preparedness conferences, and act as mentors to other health care partners as they develop emergency preparedness plans for their organizations. In times of emergency, knowing one's coalition partners and how to reach them quickly can help keep health care services intact. The ability to bounce back in the face of disaster is the hallmark of resilience. 14 As of 2016, funding levels for both the HPP and PHEP program have been cut, forcing hospitals to determine whether participation in regional coalitions, planning efforts, and exercises is still worth their financial support.",27.809856313734944,9.711250579748942

Since the late 1990s, we have been living in an era of failed health care reform where cost containment strategies have created additional nonprice barriers to care. Americans are faced with an increasingly complex health care system and the barriers to care are more pervasive and subtle than previously identified barriers because of unfavorable insurance status. While earlier legislative initiatives such as EMTALA and the prudent layperson standard provided important safeguards for managed care plan enrollees and the larger community, many emergency providers eventually came to resent the legislation as an unfunded federal mandate for universal access to health care via emergency departments [14] . The resultant combination of regulatory and fiscal pressures on hospitals resulted in increasingly stressed and crowded conditions in many EDs [3] . Regulatory extensions of EMTALA have held health systems liable for providing not only emergency care, but also any needed care. With decreases in reimbursement for the care of publicly insured patients, the ED has become a medical-legal and financial liability for many hospital systems, as the primary portal of entrance for uninsured and publicly insured patients who compete with privately insured patients for scarce inpatient beds [15] .",26.46937372743678,8.171402708797228

Over 1.25 billion outpatient ""bricks and mortar"" visits occur annually in the US, and it is estimated that one third of these visits (417 million) can be handled through telehealth. Furthermore, one third of this subgroup of consults (140 million) are related to infectious disease causes. Until recently, the provision of diagnostic testing, in conjunction with telemedicine physician consults, was difficult due to diverse geo-locations of patients, physicians and testing laboratories. For example, in the virtual world of telehealth, a patient can be located in California, with the physician licensed to practice in California located three time zones away in New York. Linkage of the physician and patient is now easily accomplished by electronic means (e.g., video conferencing, phone calls, text messaging). However, obtaining specimens from the patient and then transporting the specimen to the appropriate testing laboratory has been a challenge, such that most telemedicine consults are performed without diagnostic testing and empiric treatment is provided. This approach, especially with acute respiratory infection, could result in overuse or underuse of antibiotics. This lecture will describe new approaches to diagnostic testing for infectious diseases in the telehealth ecosystem. Included is a description of the infrastructure requirements required and/or recently developed to accommodate specimen acquisition and testing through aggregation (""uber""-ization), of both physicians and laboratory patient service centers, provision of ""round the clock"" mobile collection (in-home collection) services and self-collection and self-testing. Also, the cost-savings of these approaches, in contrast to traditional bricks and mortar approaches will be discussed. Rapid molecular, point of care testing instruments are now available for the accurate and complete (no confirmation testing required) testing for Group A Streptococcus for throat swab specimens, and Influenza and RSV for nasopharyngeal swab specimens; future testing capabilities include sexually transmitted diseases like Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis and human papilloma virus (HPV).

The $6 billion cost of the Ebola epidemic was its economic impact (in countries that can least afford it); however the impact of Ebola on families, social customs, and health infrastructure will have long term consequences. In addition, funding for epidemic diseases waxes and wanes with the passage of the epidemic, and as a consequence longer term preventive solutions, such as vaccines, have little means for progressing.

Methods: Factors that contributed to the emergence of recent outbreaks have been reviewed. Known, major outbreaks over the past two decades were reviewed. Results: We identified at least four major drivers of emergent infections: (i) increasing density of the human population; (ii) stress from farmland expansion on the environment; (iii) globalization of the food market and manufacturing; (iv) environmental contamination. The factors creating new opportunities for emerging infections include: (i) population growth; (ii) spread in health care facilities; (iii) an ageing population; (iv) international travel; (v) changing and expanding vector habitats. Conclusions: Emerging infections are unpredictable. In this review we argue that to discover new trends in infectious diseases, the clinicians have to look for the unusual and unexpected and ensure proper diagnostics and that syndromic surveillance must be supported by highly specialized laboratory services. Mathematical modeling has not been able to predict outbreaks More emphasis on the biology of evolution is needed. EID rarely stands out as unusual, and the continuous pressure on health care budgets forces clinicians and laboratories to prioritize their diagnostic work-up to common and treatable conditions. The European Society for Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, ESCMID, has established an Emerging Infections Task Force, EITaF, to strengthen the activities of the society on emerging infections and ensure that emerging infections is included in differential diagnostic considerations in everyday clinical practice.

Changes in regulatory standards can cause disruption and delays in lot release and registration. Despite the challenges, DCVMN members have been contributing significantly to increasing access to vaccines globally. In 2013, the human-vaccine market was estimated at US$25 billion and it is forecasted to reach US$38 billion by 2020 [26] . To seize the opportunities and compete successfully in this rapidly growing global market, manufacturers need to continuously innovate. M. Malhame (Gavi) raised the balance between affordability and sustainability of vaccine supply, explaining that Gavi evaluates any new vaccine that has passed phase II clinical trials for inclusion in the vaccines' portfolio financed by Gavi. This evaluation is data-driven, and includes parameters such as disease burden, feasibility and cost-effectiveness of disease prevention. However, she noted that coordination and alignment between global stakeholders need to improve and ensure development of the most needed vaccines. She also commented that the high costs of vaccine development, relative to those of drugs or diagnostics, could be overcome in part by technologies to improve manufacturing processes. K.

Large manufacturing capacity is required to satisfy both domestic and international markets and many Chinese companies have this capacity, thus the world is likely to see more vaccines from Chinese manufacturers in future. F. Lobos described Sinergium's journey into the vaccine market in South America. Sinergium was a spin-off from a veterinarian vaccine manufacturer in 2009. It established technology transfer agreements with large multinationals, primarily to satisfy the national needs for influenza, pneumococcal and HPV vaccines. Importantly, partnerships with government accelerated their progress: technical support was received from the local regulatory agency in building a world-class facility complying with international standards; also, a multi-year governmental supply contract secured stability for the company. Both local and international partners were critical for rapid success. Now, with modern facilities and equipment, the company aims to expand partnerships with DCVMs.",23.169585413766075,10.428464519442377

Intermediate options could include the manufacture and evaluation of at least one product from each major technology platform through the stages of phase I and II clinical testing, rather than for each family or subgroup of viruses. For example, the steps involved in constructing and manufacturing a product using gene-based antigen delivery by nucleic acids or a replication-defective vector might be the same for any envelope glycoprotein that functions as a trimeric class I fusion 'machine' , regardless of the specific virus. Likewise, the steps involved in scaling up the production of a VLP for viruses with icosahedral capsids might be similar. Having a precedent for the manufacture of a particular type of product before the next crisis occurs would improve response time. However, to the extent possible, and because each virus, even within taxonomic families, has unique characteristics, developing rational candidate vaccines directed against at least one prototype virus within each major phenotypic category within each family of viruses is advisable (Table 2) . New partnership models to accomplish these tasks using both public funding and private funding might be needed; such models include government-to-government collaboration, nonprofit organizations, philanthropy and public-private partnerships.

That outbreak, which caught the international community by surprise, signaled the need for stronger infectious disease surveillance and control worldwide, for improved international preparedness to provide support when similar outbreaks occur, and for accommodating the needs of the media in providing valid information. A need for more broad-based international health regulations and electronic information systems connecting WHO with its regional and country offices also became evident, as did the realization that timely and adequate outbreak detection and response would need support from a broad coalition of partners (Heymann, Barakamfitiye, Szezeniowski, et al. 1999) .",22.452898575705184,9.033749233528637

Further development of MERS-CoV and other CoV vaccines thus needs proactive collaborative efforts from researchers filling knowledge gaps, and market stakeholders providing funding for this costly process. The latter can be insufficient and/or unsustainable, therefore hindering development of even some promising candidates. In an initiative aiming at accelerating vaccine R&D process by providing sustained funding to be prepared for future epidemics, the World Economic Forum launched the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) [80] . CEPI is an international non-profit association aiming at removing barriers facing vaccine development for epidemic infections and getting ready for future epidemics, including MERS-CoV. However, we still face a number of challenges despite the fact that various promising MERS-CoV vaccine candidates are currently available. There is a lack of animal models mimicking the disease in humans in which vaccine platforms can be tested prior to human use. We need to take into account the populations to target with vaccination, with camels and camel handlers being the most relevant ones. The lack of full understanding of the pathogenesis and immune responses to the virus in humans and camels, which is crucial for vaccine development, also needs further investments. In addition, the longevity of immune responses post-vaccination has not been evaluated for vaccine candidates, which is important for the vaccination scheme development and for the choice of the best candidates for further development. Lastly, most of the vaccine candidates are developed against the highly variable spike protein and thus may not be able to provide protection against CoV strains evolving in the future. A more targeted vaccination approach aiming at conserved epitopes should be considered for the development of a more broadly-acting CoV vaccine. Given the propensity of CoVs to jump the species barrier, current efforts to develop a MERS-CoV vaccine may also be of benefit to prepare for potential novel CoVs that may emerge in the future.",40.0683750542935,14.304156044153142

Although > 80% of cases have been reported from Saudi Arabia, the South Korean outbreak had an estimated economic cost of eight billion dollars. Maria Van Kerkhove pointed out that the global risk is associated with travel from areas where MERS-CoV is circulating in dromedary camels and subsequent human-to-human transmission. Risk can be reduced with better surveillance in camel and human populations in areas where the virus is known to be circulating, with more aggressive contact tracing to identify more people with sub-clinical infection, fit enough to travel and serve as potential sources for exposure. Since E. Tramontano, et al. Antiviral Research 169 (2019) 104550 2012, the major peaks in case numbers are the result of nosocomial outbreaks, with CFRs reaching 60-70% in specific health care settings. The WHO MERS global work plan is based on improving preparedness, prevention and response to high threat respiratory pathogens like MERS. MERS is on the WHO's list of Blueprint Priority Pathogens due to its epidemic potential and the current lack of available countermeasures. There is an urgent need for research to better understand transmission of MERS-CoV in dromedaries and at the animal-human interface. Maria Van Kerkhove finished by discussing the potential therapeutics for MERS. One clinical trial is ongoing, the MIRACLE clinical trial in Saudi Arabia, which is exploring the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-β1b as the first controlled trial of a potential therapy for MERS. At the time of the meeting, 62 individuals had been enrolled in the MIRACLE trial. In addition, efforts to develop vaccines for camels and humans are being funded by several institutions, including the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). Maria Van Kerkhove also mentioned that a MERS app developed by WHO is currently available on Apple and Google Play. The application provides updated MERS-specific guidance materials and investigation tools based on the latest scientific knowledge and experience from Member States dealing with MERS.

Descriptive policy analyses are well suited to analyzing policy making concerning risks by identifying the critical factors influencing decisionmaking as well as providing insights on where decision-making breaks down and, equally important, where it works effectively (Hogwood & Gunn, 1984) . Descriptive policy analyses in health, however, have often been based on the assumption that rational decisions are made on the basis of complete information (Pal, 1992) . Given the uncertainty of scientific information on potential health risks, these information-based models may not be adequate. Alternative models to evaluate decision-making have focused on the role of value systems or institutions. However, to be truly comprehensive, approaches to policy analysis integrating the impact of information, values and institutions are needed to ensure that both the policy makers and the public understand how decisions are made concerning health risks. Paul Sabatier has compiled some of the available frameworks for conducting descriptive policy analyses (Sabatier, 1993a) . One of the criteria used for selecting frameworks is that they address the roles of conflicting values and interests, information flows, institutional arrangements and variations in socioeconomic environment on the policy process. The following frameworks were identified as useful for describing decision-making within a given political system or set of institutional arrangements: the stages heuristic, institutional rational choice, multiple-streams framework, punctuated equilibrium framework and the advocacy coalition framework. The last framework, the advocacy coalition framework (ACF), was proposed by Sabatier and suggests that decision making occurs in a policy subsystem involving individuals from a variety of public and private organizations who are actively concerned with a policy problem. Within this subsystem, individuals aggregate into advocacy coalitions based on shared ideologies and beliefs. The success of the coalitions in translating their beliefs into policy is dependent upon their resources (money, expertise, legal authority and size). Policy brokers attempt to mediate the conflict between the various advocacy coalitions. This process of conflict and mediation eventually results in policy outputs by the governing structures in the subsystem (Sabatier, 1987; Sabatier, 1993b ). The ACF model has been identified as being effective in describing decision-making in a variety of policy sectors (Jenkins-Smith & Sabatier, 1994) .",24.29365920859769,8.149656439009986

This paradigm presents challenges to national and international animal health authorities with respect to developing models for surveillance and response to emerging diseases that are not readily managed within current norms of regulatory control. As novel agents PRRS and PCV2 were not listed among transboundary diseases of concern, hence there was a vacuum of regulatory authority for managing the diseases at the national or international levels. Similarly, despite being a recognized swine pathogen for decades, as well as reports of severe clinical outbreaks in Asia, the profile of PED virus as a pathogen had not triggered proactive regulatory contingencies at any level. This led, in the face of the outbreak in the Western Hemisphere, to uncertainty and some finger pointing about what the appropriate regulatory responses should entail. In a globalized environment, one can argue that a more sensitive and proactive contingency plan will be required to detect and limit virulent emergent pathogens and thereby avoid pandemic losses on the scale that has occurred with these recent viruses. A more sensitive infrastructure will have costs and impacts that will not be equally shared, especially with respect to trade and market access. Also, it must be recognized that perhaps a majority of 'events of concern' about disease emergence will not presage a pending epidemic. However, the frequency and impact of emerging viral diseases in swine has been such that it demands active consideration of how the inevitable future event should be managed.",27.81385848942694,10.500513936225612

In addition, proper validation and standardization of such tests are still required, without which regulatory approvals for testing and commercialization are hardly obtainable. Nevertheless, the suitability of rapid diagnostic tests demonstrated by the validation processes must be complemented with additional figures of merit for implementation in routine diagnosis. Dengue virus is difficult to cultivate and propagate in laboratory, probably due to its wide geographic serotypic and genotypic variability, which has been a major obstacle towards the development and implementation of rapid diagnostic tests for dengue infections. There is still a long way to run from in-the-bench schemes and prototypes to fully developed, commercially attractive biosensing devices, whose wider utilization is still shadowed by well-established and well-performing laboratory assays. Unfortunately, the experimental prerogative for using well-defined, pure synthetic samples has often hindered detailed studies and conclusions about the effect of potentially interfering substances. Cold-chain has supported massive and adequate delivery of rapid diagnostic tests to clinical settings and end-users in remote tropical regions, but is handicapped by frequent irregular power supply in such regions and by the huge costs associated to transportation. Despite all these challenges, rapid diagnostic tests must be considered valuable alternatives rather than competitors to laboratory-based analytical devices and methodologies, even if some loss of sensitivity or selectivity must be accepted in the point-of-care testing. In fact, rapid screening of large amounts of samples may speed up proper decision making by the clinician, while conventional lab-based bioanalytical techniques can be used afterwards for confirmation and better characterization of the infecting pathogen. Reusable diagnostic tests must be avoided when dealing with infectious pathogens, thus explaining the growing interest in the development of chip-based disposable tests. It has been consensual that an efficient rapid diagnostic test for dengue disease should be a multiplexed device for detection and identification of all four dengue serotypes. Future developments and advances in fundamental and engineering sciences will certainly enrich the whole pool of knowledge about rapid diagnostic tests and will also improve micro-and nanofabrication processes for their mass production at an increasing cost-effective basis as well.",28.447589431508046,11.271843501559179

Therefore, the evaluation of diagnostic tests should ideally be carried out in such particular conditions, including multi-centre trials. Obviously, such test conditions will eventually determine the particular in-the-field situations in which the tests will be used. As an example, strong cross-reactivity may be acceptable if there is low prevalence of the disease in such place or setting [27] . The usual lack of proper validation and standardization of many rapid diagnostic tests for both in-the-field and laboratory usage is partially due to the fact that most laboratories use in-house rather than well-standardized assays and techniques, which strongly discourages compared analysis in aggregate. It is thus important that national or reference healthcare entities establish quality assurance programs that guarantee the production of reference materials and protocols for effective quality control of rapid diagnostic tests [34] . In this regard, the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) (sponsored by UNICEF, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), World Bank and WHO) and the Pediatric Dengue Vaccine Initiative (PDVI) have underpinned an extensive collaborative program aimed to evaluate the performance of commercially available diagnostic tests for dengue, especially IgM-based EIA assays and rapid diag- Table 1 Reported LODs and assay times for dengue biosensors referenced in the literature (discriminated according to the transduction mechanism and probed analyte). nostic tests [27] , mainly on the basis of comparison among them. A specific goal was the assessment of the different patterns of immunoglobulin antibody responses, especially when envisaging accurate diagnosis of acute dengue infections. To accomplish this task, the tests were assayed against a panel of well-characterized serum specimens from persons with confirmed dengue infections and from others with confounding infections and conditions. The inclusion criteria were positive identification of all four dengue serotypes, correct identification of primary/secondary infections and discrimination from other flavivirus and dengue-like diseases, high specificity towards systemic disorders and good performance for various geographical conditions. The evaluation comprised four EIA tests and the rapid tests DuoCassette (Panbio Diagnostics), SD Bioline (Standard Diagnostics) and Dengucheck (Zephyr Biomedicals, India), which are all immunochromatographic tests, and the HapalyseM (Pentax Corporation, Japan), a particle agglutinationbased test. Three of the EIA kits showed good agreement with reference standards, although, in general, have rendered falsepositive results for dengue IgG-positive, rheumatoid factor-positive and dengue IgM-negative/malaria-positive serum samples. In this last case, test usage in settings or regions where both dengue and malaria are endemic must be discarded. The HapalyseM test exhibited sensitivity comparable to the high-performing EIA tests, although the specificity was somewhat inferior to those of the remaining rapid tests. The Dengucheck test exhibited, by far, the lowest sensitivity. The specificity of the lateral flow-based rapid tests was similar to that of EIA tests. Among the tested rapid tests, the three lateral flow tests reached higher classifications than the Hapalyse M or the EIA tests concerning ease-to-use. Even so, to all the four rapid tests, difficult result interpretation (basically due to weak bands in the strip) was claimed ( Table 2) . As a whole, it can be stated that the performances (in terms of sensitivity and specificity) of the rapid tests did not agree with those of reference standard assays as much as those of EIA tests. One major limitation of these evaluation studies is the presumable underestimation of test specificity; in real situations, it is unlikely that all potential causes of false-positive results would be present simultaneously. Moreover, since the four dengue serotypes were not represented in equal proportions in the sample panel (in particular, the small number of DENV4 samples reflected its rarity in most regions), the evaluation of some kits towards primary infections caused by all four serotypes could not be completely assessed. Since most rapid diagnostic tests are targeted to be used by the patients themselves (who, obviously, lack the expertise to properly evaluate and assess the performance of such tests), the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) initiative developed a sequenced checklist to guide adequate report of the results from evaluation studies on diagnostics [68] . Similarly, and recognizing the enormous potential threat of dengue disease introduction in Europe, the European Union started, in 2006, the DENFRAME project, aiming to improve the management of dengue disease among human populations, especially in Asia and Latin-America [69] . One of its working programs involves the development, standardization and automation of novel rapid diagnostic test kits for dengue diagnosis. A complete validation program must include a multi-centre evaluation, which ensures accuracy and robustness of the test, as well as reproducibility of the results within and among different assays and lots. Taking into account the seriousness of clinical applications and implications of rapid diagnostic tests, a full evaluation program of these tests must include, apart performance evaluation (validation), the additional steps of quality control and quality assurance [11] . Quality control guarantees correct functioning of the devices with prolonged use, but traditional procedures normally employed for traditional laboratory devices are not feasible for disposable rapid tests.

A final quality assurance program, on the other hand, demonstrates the readiness of the tests to be introduced in routine clinical diagnosis.

A diagnostic test requirement would be based on the infectious disease type as well as the different levels of health care facilities such as the community/rural health facility, the district/town hospital and the urban hospital. In developing countries, rural patients can often be misdiagnosed due to lack of access to diagnostic tests such as the diagnosis of malaria instead of HIV [83] . A lateral-flow based diagnostic testing or a test strip membrane would be very beneficial as by mere visualization of the test, the presence of an infection can be determined rapidly. This would prevent spreading of the infection, false diagnosis and resistance to the medication as in the case of bacterial infections. A quantitative test may not be of much use for a community or rural health worker while it may be more informative to a doctor at a hospital or clinic. But these quantitative tests often are expensive, require specialized equipments and highly trained technicians to carry out the analysis. Researchers have used specialized equipments such as flow cytometry, SQUID, spectroscopic techniques, TEM, confocal microscopy etc., to analyze trace amount of the pathogen.

Schumpeterian unions, however, do continue to cooperate with employers on a daily basis, but the relationship is better characterized as one of 'limited trust' where cooperation is often ephemeral and lent for competitive support under specific conditions. Recent research in the Canadian auto sector has found that unions play a role in facilitating information flows among competing firms within 'clusters' suggesting that restructuring through outsourcing to non-union firms can impede such knowledge transfer (Rutherford and Holmes, 2007) . Some unions have adopted strategies which engage new labour-management partnerships as new trade-offs are made between increasing productivity and maintaining job security. 'Social partnerships' are argued to strengthen labour's position by 'trapping' capital investment in local markets through 'high road' strategies that emphasize training and increased productivity in the workplace (Kelly, 2004) .

The basic idea of CEPI is that when there is a perception that the commercial market is insufficient to justify private investment in vaccine development against an emerging pathogen, that manufacturers be reimbursed for the production of candidates that can be taken through phases 1 and 2 to provide initial evidence for safety and efficacy, followed by the production and maintenance of a stockpile for emergency use [ Table 2 ]. Inherent in this concept is that applicants must have a means of producing the candidate under Good Manufacturing Practice. In situations where a phase III trial is feasible owing to continued incidence of infection it would be done, although identification of a correlate of protection might be sufficient for confidence that the particular vaccine could be deployed in the event of an outbreak.

The mission was to define today 0 s most pressing global health problems, identify critical obstacles which challenge the develop-ment of solutions to these problems, and prospect how both may be overcome. Summit sessions focused on disease preparedness and vaccine development. Summit organizers desired to catalyze the formation and sustainment of productive and strategic interdisciplinary partnerships and collaborative research networks with a focus on the rapid development of countermeasures against our most pressing global health threats. Three keynote speakers representing the International Vaccine Institute (IVI), Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), and the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) framed four concept areas which were then discussed during two individual sessions per topic; each session was defined by a specific topic and led by a pre-selected session leader. The overall organization is presented in Box 1. The first concept discussed was, ''How do we identify and prepare for Disease X,"" referring to the next major infectious disease epidemic or pandemic. Dr. Melanie Saville, Director of Vaccine Development from CEPI, introduced the concept by discussing possible Disease X pathogens stressing they may be currently known or unknown. This may include known threats such as Ebola, known viruses with unrecognized impacts such as Zika, and unknown threats not previously identified. Current global trends indicate that a new disease emerges every four months, and more likely than not, Disease X will emerge as zoonotic in origin, as nearly 60% of all pandemics fit that model. The need to identify a burgeoning outbreak and initiate development of countermeasures was stressed.

This is not as easy as it sounds, since those stockpiles must be properly maintained over years with demonstration of stability, requiring periodic replenishment; rules must be established for the use of vaccine from the stockpile, perhaps without the vaccine having been licensed; and epidemics may require urgent expansion of production, for which arrangements must be made in advance. Regulatory issues for the use of CEPI-produced vaccines are still unsettled. All of this means that CEPI must be a real organization, with a leader, a staff, a sufficient budget, and a continuing mission that must not fade in the temporary absence of an epidemic. Memories are short, whereas funding must be regular and uninterrupted. It should be remembered that despite the disruption caused by the SARS outbreak it was insufficient to generate new mechanisms, leading to a lack of preparedness for the West African Ebola epidemic, to say nothing of MERS and Zika.

Examples of such guidelines include the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE, UK) and The Nederlands Huisartsen Genoostchap (NHG, The Netherlands) [41,42]. It is essential that POC diagnostic innovators who are thinking of developing antibiotic resistance diagnostics actually take note of these guidelines and develop tests for antimicrobial resistances that are based on the antibiotic-prescribing guidelines of the countries in which the device is to be sold. However, for the POC diagnostic innovator, developing different antibiotic resistance testing capacities for specific countries may not make financial sense unless those countries have standardized primary care guidelines available and large populations with access to primary care. Additionally, national guidelines for antibiotic prescribing are regularly revised, which means that POC diagnostic innovators must consider if the time required to develop, market and generate profit from a new antibiotic resistance test will fit within the regular cycle of national guideline revision. Of course, the revision of national guidelines does not mean to say that the actual choice of antibiotics to be used will be changed, but the POC diagnostic innovator should take this into consideration when weighing up the time from POC development to marketing. Finally, if a GP knows that a revision of antibiotic-prescribing guidelines is due in a few months, he may be less inclined to buy an antibiotic resistance diagnostic that may be ‘out of date’ within a few months.

First, governmental subsidies to public health care facilities declined dramatically after 1978. The government’s subsidies to public hospitals fell to merely 10% of their total expenditures by the 1990s,5 and 90% or more of Chinese public hospitals’ revenue continued to depend on drug sales and services in 2010.6 While Chinese public hospitals continued to have a bureaucratic and complex government-run regulation and management system,3 they also were expected to behave like for-profit entities to earn profit to survive and to continue being competitive in the health care market.7 Second, because labor-related medical services remained underpriced,8 the Chinese government set a higher margin rate for high-technology procedures and diagnostic tests, and hospitals are allowed to charge a 15% to 25% mark-up on drug sales (15% for Western medicine and 25% for Traditional Chinese Medicine).9 Such policies provided financial incentives for hospitals to begin a “medical arms race” to scale up their provision of high-technology diagnostics and interventions, as well as to overprescribe drugs.10-12 Third, most of senior physicians’ income from hospitals is still a combination of basic salary and bonus,13 with the bonus coming from hospitals’ financial profit.14 To increase their hospital’s profit, hospital management tied the physicians’ bonus to their contribution to hospital profits, which has intensified the overprescription of drugs and overuse of diagnostic tests.5,7,8,10-12,15-17 Such an extrinsic bonus incentive method may also “crowd-out” physicians’ intrinsic concerns for other important aspects of health care, for example, the health care quality and population health.18 Some scholars have commented that these financial incentives even may have directly eroded physicians’ ethics.17,19 Because of this strong alignment of financial incentives, senior physicians in effect can become more the agents for public hospitals rather than for their patients.",21.43019420996541,8.31398308359913

This is not the case in the data-driven model, where we find a nonmonotonous behavior: an increasing trend over the initial phase of the epidemic occurs followed by a marked decrease about 20 d before the epidemic peak (Fig. 2A). Such a result is in sharp contrast with the classic theory, where the epidemic growth rate is expected to slowly and monotonically decrease over time in the early epidemic phase (Fig. 2A).

Here, we have shown a rationale for serology testing as a means to facilitate interventions beyond those of mitigation and suppression. Identifying and deploying recovered individuals could represent more than just a metric of the state of the COVID-19 epidemic, e.g., to better measure prevalence and the 'denominator', but an opportunity to slow transmission by developing population-level shield immunity. Many logistical, social, and dynamical challenges remain if such an idea were to move from theory to feasibility. Accurate and rapid serological tests are needed at scale, including targeted surveys to identify essential workers and via populationlevel surveys. The potential scale of shield immunity depends on both the intrinsic epidemic dynamics, driving the number of recovered individuals able to provide shield immunity, and also on the ability to identify and deploy them (e.g., via the shielding parameter α). Yet, even if such tests were available, who should get them? Public health authorities and governmental agencies should consider how to prioritize those in critical roles, those with experience in disaster response, as well as prior individuals who have tested positive for COVID-19 (and could then return for both serology-based and viral shedding assays). Positive confirmation of immunity and cessation of viral shedding could help identify and deploy (tens of) thousands of individuals as part of a shield immunity strategy, with the greatest concentration likely co-located with areas in greatest need of intervention.

Valid sequences that are sufficiently dissimilar from all RefSeq-based models will fail because alerts designed to identify dissimilar sequences will be reported. The failures of some sequences from the test datasets that pass VAPiD and/or VIGOR can be attributed to this, as discussed in the Results section. During testing with incoming norovirus sequence submissions, three additional RefSeqs, included in the nine norovirus RefSeqs used for the tests described herein, were created to address this issue. Stimulated by some recent norovirus submissions with sequences dissimilar from the nine RefSeqs in the VADR 1.0 library and by a newly published norovirus genotyping paradigm [32] that suggested additional candidate RefSeqs more similar to the new sequences, we selected and curated 11 additional norovirus RefSeqs to reach a total of 20. Ten of the additional 11 RefSeqs are being tested on norovirus submissions since early 2020. VADR can be run on such sequences with 19 or 20 models for norovirus instead of nine models. Whichever ones of the additional 11 norovirus RefSeqs prove useful in internal testing will have their models included in a future released version of VADR and be used in automated processing of submissions.",11.46601011717269,4.635984904715242

baseline patterns of immune gene expression provide limited insight into the gene regulatory response to actual immune stimuli,1.0,-0.739252507686615,-1.0368101596832275,b1c3a5a4-2786-400b-a825-652502fba942,biorxiv_medrxiv/Social history and exposure to pathogen signals modulate social status effects on gene regulation in rhesus macaques,"These results suggest that baseline patterns of immune gene expression provide limited insight into the gene regulatory response to actual immune stimuli. Thus, while the gene expression signature of social stress may be somewhat conserved across different types of social adversity, and potentially across species, it does not appear to be highly conserved across pathogen environments. Our findings are consistent with previous reports that social status interacts with LPS and glucocorticoid exposure (18, 31) , and that genetic effects on gene expression can also be altered by local cellular conditions (i.e., gene-environment interactions, e.g., (51) (52) (53) (54) ). However, while prior work has primarily shown environment or genotype-dependent differences in the presence or magnitude of effects, here we observed a more striking pattern: directional shifts in the effects of social status, specifically for genes involved in the antiviral response. This reversal of effects suggests that social status-sensitive regulatory elements involved in the response to LPS are, at least to some degree, distinct from social status-sensitive regulatory elements involved in the response to Gard -a hypothesis that requires further experimental validation.",14.800395866938102,4.025697819637938
