In contrast to the conditions which obtain for the Master of Applied Epidemiology in Australia, field supervisors in LMIC are typically not as senior and often have direct operational responsibility for outbreaks and surveillance. Field Epidemiology Training Programs in LMIC are usually based in an operational unit in the health ministry, with little or no academic support [7, 8, 17, 20] . Students therefore work in stressed health systems with insufficient personnel. Overwork and politico-cultural notions of ""appropriate behaviour"" at particular levels in a health system can limit the capacity of the worker to form the kinds of multi-level and cross-sectoral partnerships that support rapid responses or policy change. In our experience, the partnership of a sympathetic external support worker with recognised authority (in this case, the MAE academic supervisor -but the role could also be played by a supervisor from another valued institution in the country or the region) can help support partnerships and improved communication within the public health system.

In Thailand, access to healthcare is limited by the availability of service delivery, particularly health workforce. Despite having extensive networks of healthcare providers, challenges still exist in terms of healthcare provision in remote rural areas where it is difficult to attract and retain qualified health workers. The country has a low doctor-per-population ratio Á lower than other countries with a similar economic development level-due to an extended period of limited training capacity. Whilst the ratio of nurses to doctors is high, there is still a large discrepancy in the distribution of doctors and nurses across geographical regions, which is a major challenge for the government. In Singapore, the biggest hurdles are not financial or technical but ideological. The fears of moral hazard leading to overconsumption and over-servicing, as well as eventual financial unsustainability are the main reasons why the government is unprepared to embrace UHC in the spirit of other developed countries. Furthermore, there is a sincere belief that wealth and financial success must translate into better quality of living including healthcare Á 'Work for reward, Reward for work' is a common mantra espoused by government officials (35) . In Malaysia, there are supply side constraints, with significant shortages of health professionals (36) .

This results in sicker and poorer patients using public services (36) . A barrier to achieving UHC will be to ensure that public sector service quality improves, and service capacity expands (especially in urban areas), to keep up with increased demand. Similar concerns have been voiced out about the emergence of a dual healthcare system in Thailand, where increased demand from the wealthy urban Thai population and to a lesser extent medical tourists for private health services may drive public health workers to the private sector (38) .",26.471601509083158,8.462539102693492

This lack of legal clarification may impede the formulation of an integrated response system for disaster command, control and cooperation (47) . Also, the responsibility and authority of the different levels of government, the army facilities, and the non-governmental organizations are not clearly defined within the law.

The wide-rangingand often substantial -economic impacts of epidemics are increasingly recognized far beyond the health sector. Yet few studies apply a One Health or multi-sectoral lens to consider costs and benefits of prevention versus response effort during planning exercises to ensure optimization of resources. With recent zoonotic disease prioritization exercises being conducted under the Global Health Security Agenda, countries have an opportunity to consider the focus and scope of their investments. Where possible, investments should seek to strengthen overall human, animal and environmental health systems for multi-hazard preparedness and broad societal benefits. Availability of quantitative impact data has been noted as limited for important livestock diseases, and differing methodologies result in estimates that are not comparable across and even within countries [12, 48, 50] ; the findings of our review are consistent with this and also suggest that impacts of human health emergencies from infectious disease are significant but reporting is ad hoc and likely incomplete. Public and private stakeholders at local, national and international levels must work together more systematically to ensure informed systems and risk and impact analysis, and encourage costsharing strategies for prevention and preparedness where possible and assess optimal intervention strategies when necessary.

In fact, most research and development (R&D) projects do not deliver a licensed vaccine for routine or targeted immunization-not because of methodological problems, but due to political and economic obstacles [59] . In fact, neglected diseases disproportionally affect poor and marginalized populations, and vaccines may have low returns on investment, so commercial firms may be reluctant to commit themselves to the expensive development and licensure of vaccine candidates, which typically totals hundreds-ofmillions of US dollars [60] . To overcome this problem, several strategies may be implemented, including the creation of public and/or private partnerships, the identification of target population groups for vaccination to ensure a potential market, such as the military market, travelers and tourists, and the commitment of donor agencies and affected and/or donor countries [61] . Combination private and public consortia should address those vaccine development projects that are not considered highly profitable by industry in the absence of support from the governments of industrial countries. A recent example is the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), funded by both government entities and private foundations, and include partners from the pharmaceutical industry, which is funding late preclinical and clinical development of vaccines for infections by Lassa, Nipah, and MERS coronavirus [62] .",31.59706055476293,13.180953780550844

In the future, MDM development efforts will need to be looked at for return on investment (ROI) metrics. Research in the agriculture sector has historically been government-funded, so the systems are not well set up for business-level analysis of their programs. However, public and private partnerships have always been important to the Department of Homeland Security Science & Technology Directorate (DHS S&T) and the USDA, Agricultural Research Service at Plum Island (USDA-ARS). The licensing of a new FMD vaccine in 2012 resulted from a successful public-private partnership including DHS S&T, USDA-ARS, and multiple industry partners. Other products are also in development via Cooperative Research and Development Agreements. Since we cannot vaccinate for something that we do not know is coming there is a need to develop therapies quickly (e.g., immunotherapeutic) to respond to disease 'X', as listed on the 2018 WHO Blueprint of Priority Diseases list [19] . If it is necessary to bring in private investors, then they will demand metrics so that ROI analysis is possible. Rabies is an example of a success story where the ROI was high due to the commercial demand for rabies treatments and both animal and human vaccines. The involvement of public or private investment for philanthropic reasons is one area where funding is currently increasing for diseases where the ROI may be sub-optimal. For example, the Pirbright Institute, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust all fund research initiatives in this area. Although philanthropic organizations are donating money they still require data that enable measurement of the success of specific initiatives (e.g., disease reduction, child health improvement). It is also important to keep the laboratory facilities side in mind. There is currently a 2-year wait for an Ebola vaccine efficacy study in the non-human primate (NHP) model. Large livestock animal (BSL-4-Ag) facilities may also have the capability to run NHP studies and could perhaps be used for this purpose. As illustrated with the development of the Hendra vaccine, the existing large animal BSL-4 facilities provide infrastructure and specialized comparative medicine and animal model expertise that could be effectively leveraged to develop and validate alternative animal models (e.g., ferret or swine) that could hasten development and regulatory approval for medical countermeasures against high-consequence pathogens. Operating and maintaining a BSL-4 agricultural facility with 24-7 capability to perform comparative animal and vaccine efficacy studies is expensive and requires a consistent and highly-trained workforce. Increasing the opportunities to make these facilities available to additional One Health partners could be an option to increase cost-effectiveness in operations and global utilization of this limited and highly specialized resource. A good example of this is the BSL4ZNet initiative that is designed to increase collaboration between high containment laboratory experts [20] . BSL4ZNet is funded by the Canadian Safety and Security Program and members include the international BSL-3-Ag and BSL-4 facilities listed in Figure 1 (NCFAD, AAHL, FLI, PI and PIADC). One major aim of this initiative is to enable knowledge sharing by producing a catalog of BSL-4 training opportunities, organizing a laboratory exchange program, and hosting presentations by subject matter experts.",25.369007267659022,10.905423097150315

We note that the case for such a pragmatic approach to issues of consent and ownership for secondary testing of isolates owned by commercial entities is bolstered by epidemiological considerations. Some degree of strain typing must be done routinely if this practice is to be useful for identification of transmission events [5, 16] . Therefore, legal reform may be required because any insistence on a high threshold of public health risk before pathogen WGS can be done would limit the timeliness and, consequently, the effectiveness of this type of communicable disease surveillance.

To explore this issue further, panellists were asked, in round 3, to indicate the conditions under which they believed it was appropriate to conduct a test on an isolate collected from a commercial company without prior consent.

More detailed analysis of individual responses revealed that these differences were also present within disciplinary groups and across policy networks.

Several important ethical issues are unanticipated, unacknowledged, and unplanned for. These include guidelines on allocation of scarce resources, the duties of healthcare workers, ethics-sensitive operational guidelines/protocols, and compensation programs. The NISPPI also pays scant attention to use of vaccines and antivirals, border issues and cooperation with neighboring countries, justification for delineated actions, and outbreak simulations. Feedback and communication plans are nebulous, while leadership, coordination, and budgeting are quite detailed. With respect to presentation, the NISPPI's text is organized around five thematic areas. While each area implicates ethical issues, NISPPI treatment of these areas consistently fails to address them. Conclusions: Our analysis reveals a lack of consideration of ethics by the NISPPI. We contend that, while the plan's content and fundamental assumptions provide support for implementation of the delineated public health actions, its consideration of ethical issues is poor. Deficiencies include a failure to incorporate guidelines that ensure fair distribution of scarce resources and a lack of justification for delineated procedures.

This division often results in DVOs being one step removed from livestock keepers and reliant on PAHSPs for information on any disease outbreak events. There can be significant barriers to this information flow, particularly when relationships between DVOs and PAHSPs are strained by service provision disputes (often relating to poorly applied legislative frameworks), the lack of sanitary mandates and limited recognition and support for frontline personnel by the higher public sector authorities.

Of relevance to surge planning, we were able to quantify the excess numbers of invasive mechanical ventilators relative to ICU beds, highlighting capacity that may exist beyond existing ICU beds. The ability to provide advanced oxygenation with one of three modes of support was available in a minority of hospitals. Furthermore, this expertise was unevenly distributed across provinces, and was focused at university-affiliated teaching hospitals. However, we were unable to gauge experience with specialized ventilation alongside capacity. We did not determine capacity for other techniques such as prone ventilation, which may be less dependent upon specific technology, more dependent upon generation of a local experience base, and have a greater evidence base for efficacy than either early highfrequency ventilation or use of inhaled nitric oxide [32] . This variable and uneven distribution of expertise observed in this study demands that we evolve a system in which excess capacity in one region may aid another, either through safe transportation of patients or short-term movement of equipment or personnel to existing or temporary facilities [33] .",23.642553564021703,9.422635135192078

If these outbreaks had been prevented, the avoided losses would have averaged US $6.7 billion per year [14] . The wide-rangingand often substantial -economic impacts of epidemics are increasingly recognized far beyond the health sector. Yet few studies apply a One Health or multi-sectoral lens to consider costs and benefits of prevention versus response effort during planning exercises to ensure optimization of resources. With recent zoonotic disease prioritization exercises being conducted under the Global Health Security Agenda, countries have an opportunity to consider the focus and scope of their investments. Where possible, investments should seek to strengthen overall human, animal and environmental health systems for multi-hazard preparedness and broad societal benefits. Availability of quantitative impact data has been noted as limited for important livestock diseases, and differing methodologies result in estimates that are not comparable across and even within countries [12, 48, 50] ; the findings of our review are consistent with this and also suggest that impacts of human health emergencies from infectious disease are significant but reporting is ad hoc and likely incomplete. Public and private stakeholders at local, national and international levels must work together more systematically to ensure informed systems and risk and impact analysis, and encourage costsharing strategies for prevention and preparedness where possible and assess optimal intervention strategies when necessary.

For in-depth interview, one hospital is not-for-profit and located in central Taiwan, while the other is a public hospital located in Taipei. Two of the hospitals assessed were medical centers with more than 1000 general beds and they were well known on outsourcing in medical items as well as on the non medical items. The in-depth interview were to ask the hospital's situation about outsourcing, and the feeling include what they think about the outsourcing can get benefit to them and the advantage and disadvantage of it. The interview time lasted for continuously four hours. The questionnaires were mailed to all 17 medial centers and all 71 region hospitals, while the 77 local hospitals were chosen by stratified system sampling methods from 382 local hospitals. The sample medical centers have the bed number from 800 to 2500, region hospitals' size normally between 300 beds to 800 beds, and local hospitals are from 20 to 300 beds in Taiwan. The total sample size is 165, with 37 completed questionnaires returned; The returned samples in medical centers were 6/14 = 35.3%, in regional hospitals were 21/71 = 29.5%, and in local hospitals were 10/77 = 12.9%. We prudently analyzed the returning samples and find they were evenly spread across the north, central, and south region of Taiwan; therefore, we believe it can represent the Taiwan hospital system. However, the returned local hospital samples were few, the reason could be: this level of small hospitals always own and operate by physicians and his/her families, therefore, unwilling to fill this kind of academic questionnaire due to lack of manpower.",22.476414385280428,8.44244582304805

More recently, aside from the continuation of scientific research in both countries, Canada and Australia have also been the subject of social science investigations for its national responses on xenotransplantation. Due to the anticipation of xenotransplantation clinical trials by Canadian and Australian researchers, both jurisdictions responded with initiatives to engage the public in policy decision-making. For both countries, the outcome was a mix of the local and global as well as a fusion of technical expertise and lay perspectives concerning human experimentation and the use of animal bodies for biomedical experimentation. Towards the end of 1997, Canada began to 'systematically' undertake a national public consultation on xenotransplantation to address public health risks and the associated 'socio-ethical, legal and scientific challenges' (Einsiedel and Ross 2002, 589) . Canadian scholars, Einsiedel and Ross argued that the process of public consultation substantively contributed to the Canadian debate on xenotransplantation in two ways: firstly, it facilitated the 'pluralisation of knowledge' by allowing marginalised voices to be heard; and secondly, it offered the public an opportunity to consider the risks and benefits of a technology with experts (Einsiedel and Ross 2002, 589) .

Although discrepancies are expected in any pandemic planning nationally or internationally due to the uncertainty associated with pandemics, it is important to have a consistent basis for planning, especially if it is to be applied at both local and national levels. While Malawi developed communication strategies, strengthened influenza surveillance and updated overall goals in PRPI, most response actions addressing the 2009 pandemic failed to achieve the important public health goals that the plans set out. We found that the national pandemic plan was not updated regularly and experts in influenza emergency management were rarely consulted. A number of gaps in national action were also identified, including poor coordination between national policymakers with local stakeholders, weak leadership in the influenza working committee and lack of surveillance structures such as IACs and diagnostic laboratories. There is need for coordination between the private and public sectors in order to continue providing essential services such as water, energy and safe transport. Cooperation on influenza activities would reinforce the implementation of PRPI, but this would require that responsibilities and actions are defined phase by phase. Influenza research focusing on the national and local context is important to manage challenges and problems that might be experienced during the influenza outbreak. In addition, there is need for political interventions to improve pharmaceutical logistics which in turn would improve the availability of vaccines and other drugs, enabling people to be vaccinated on time during seasonal and pandemic periods. However, there is also a need to ensure that the public is aware that influenza is a reportable disease. Most importantly, there is a need to upgrade laboratory networks and diagnostic capacity, to include active sentinel surveillance through the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) and other operational structures like FluNet. In general, PRPI operations can be strengthened through effective IEC activities such as communicating real time surveillance data or communicating the nature, spread, peak and decline of influenza (both seasonally and during pandemics) to the general public. This can be done by electronic means, phones and meetings. The regular dissemination of such information may change public attitudes and perceptions about influenza.",29.424313925786443,11.744244370067387

Traditional notification of demographic and clinical information, about individuals with selected (notifiable) infectious diseases, allows appropriate public health action and is protected by public health and privacy legislation, but is slow and insensitive. Big data-based electronic surveillance, by commercial bodies and government agencies (for profit or population control), which draws on a plethora of internet-and mobile device-based sources, has been widely accepted, if not universally welcomed. Similar anonymous digital sources also contain syndromic information, which can be analysed, using customised algorithms, to rapidly predict infectious disease outbreaks, but the data are nonspecific and predictions sometimes misleading. However, public health authorities could use these online sources, in combination with de-identified personal health data, to provide more accurate and earlier warning of infectious disease eventsincluding exotic or emerging infections-even before the cause is confirmed, and allow more timely public health intervention. Achieving optimal benefits would require access to selected data from personal electronic health and laboratory (including pathogen genomic) records and the potential to (confidentially) re-identify individuals found to be involved in outbreaks, to ensure appropriate care and infection control. Despite existing widespread digital surveillance and major potential community benefits of extending its use to communicable disease control, there is considerable public disquiet about allowing public health authorities access to personal health data.

In their view any change in work habits/protocols could affect the business, presumably because of the perception that in private veterinary practice there is a cost ceiling and any additional cost would decrease profit. Profitability of the business is a common concern of veterinarians running private practices of all types [42, 43] . The constraints of running a private business significantly influenced participants' decisions about IC, and some found it difficult to balance their de facto public health and biosecurity roles while running a private business and complying with their WHS responsibilities. The WHS legislation, for example, was viewed as open to interpretation and difficult to implement in unpredictable circumstances not easily controlled. The difficulties of using some standard biosecurity measures in the field in equine practice are common to the management of other equine infectious diseases [44] . Some participants were aware that they could legally refuse provision of services if they deemed a situation unsafe [45] . However this option was considered as a last resort as it could jeopardise the welfare of animals, translate into loss of immediate income and future income if unsatisfied clients did not return to the practice. Refusing to provide veterinary services was not an option for participants who reported having been requested to fulfil HeV management duties on behalf of the government. For some, the weight of the legal responsibilities reached breaking point when HeV started to emerge, resulting in them choosing to exit equine veterinary practice [25] . So, although fear of dying acted as a significant motivator for some participants to implement lasting IC changes, the complexity of their responsibilities to their patients, clients, colleagues, business and the community deterred them from doing so.",22.82231117392715,7.70999399509825

In doing so, we illustrate how an instrumental as opposed to a normative lens differentiates the practice of diplomacy. Health issues are still emerging and under-analyzed in the nexus between governance and diplomacy. Figure 4 shows that there have been multiple negotiations on critical global health issues in the last 10 years, which were triggered by the catalytic effect of a series of health emergencies. Therefore, global health governance is still at a formative stage and health diplomacy is very much in the transitional stage of practice in dealing, negotiating, and managing emerging health issues at different levels of governance (Lee and Smith, 2011; Novotny and Kevany, 2013) . This process is constantly demonstrating that health diplomacy is more than about public health itself. Zucker (2012) wrote, Public health negotiations are often about everything but public health. As such one much bring in the expertise from other domains including, international treaty law, finance ministries, trade delegations, foreign affairs, international security, and any other areas that are linked to the issues at hand. (pp. 273-274) The pull effect in the practice of health diplomacy increasingly appears to be strong among the NGOs, networking with state and global and local actors. As stated by Low-Beer (2012), 'a major trend since 2000 has been a shift to a wider ""partnership approach"" to delivering health aid, bringing together governments, private sector, civil society, private foundations and multilaterals, sometimes shouting and sometimes kicking' (p. 23). Nevertheless, a multitude of actors also bring divergence in preferences and uncertainty in negotiation processes. Health diplomacy thus involves a multitude of inter-dependent actors, involved in poly-lateral diplomacy, and issues that create opportunities for partnership as well as conflict of interest.",32.478279998982686,13.556005483746189

Reporting on hospital inpatients in Kenya, including on deaths, should comprise monthly reporting by service unit (eg. maternity, adult medical wards) and by cause using the 10th revision of the International Classification of Disease. In earlier work, we reported that on average 3% of hospital income is used to support information needs and that only half of health records officer positions were filled [13] . We therefore suggest it is underinvestment in information systems as illustrated in panel that is a primary barrier to better reporting of hospital workloads and mortality. errors in care can contribute to improvements in quality and safety of health systems [30, 31] . Examination of maternal deaths has been used for over 50 years in higher income countries and has profoundly influenced policy and practice at multiple levels of the health system [32] . This approach is strongly promoted in LMIC through programmes focused on maternal (and more recently perinatal) death reviews [33] . However, implementation remains patchy and impacts uncertain. In South Africa systems have been developed to examine deaths of children in hospitals and identify the nature and prevalence of factors that could be modified to reduce mortality [34] . Now operating at considerable scale reports suggest information aggregated across multiple facilities is influencing policy and resource allocation aimed at improving services equitably [34] . Case based investigation of hospital mortality that spans examination of pathways to care may thus be a form of 'system diagnostic' that is directly useful for local quality improvement and useful well beyond the hospital to support advocacy and accountability [35] .",30.873642386456993,12.817430902035268

Situational analysis aims to sort out information through a series of coding, memo-taking, and mapping. It takes collected information not as statements of reality but as parts of situated knowledge and perspective held by participants and narrators. Therefore, situational analysis does not aim to identify a single social process that accounts for a social phenomenon but to reassemble the sophisticated social phenomenon with contestations and incongruences.

In the past 10 years there have been important global incidents that emphasise the tension between countries and international organisations when commercial and political interests are perceived to have an undue eff ect on global pandemic preparedness policy. 4, 16 This eff ect is further exacerbated when inequity in access to tech nology, expertise, and the best diagnostic, prophylactic, and treatment methods are prevalent. An example is Indonesia's refusal in 2006-07 to share samples of infl uenza H5N1 isolates with WHO in direct protest to the inequitable sharing of virus samples and vaccine development technology. 43 Lack of trust in WHO's response was evident following the H1N1 pandemic in 2009 too, including from the Council of Europe which highlighted potential confl icts of interest of individual members of the emergency committee convened by WHO to respond to the pandemic-linking them to industry, and noting WHO's policy on keeping the membership of the committee secret. Substantial shortfalls and delay in distribution of vaccine supplies to low-income and middle-income countries were also emphasised by subsequent reviews of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic response. 4, 16, 45 The Indonesian Government's call for more equity and developments since the H1N1 2009 pandemic have led to several positive initiatives. 46 Within WHO's PIP Framework, discussions have evolved to improve virus sharing in the context of recognising the need for shared benefi ts. Indonesia is now one of several low-to-middle income countries that are developing or have already developed in-country vaccine manufacturing capacityothers in the WHO-supported programme of technology transfer include Brazil, China, Egypt, India, Kazakhstan, Mexico, South Korea, Romania, Serbia, South Africa, Thailand, and Vietnam. Initiatives such as the creation of a technology transfer programme at the Netherlands Vaccine Institute (RIVM) to provide training in the embryonated egg production of inactivated infl uenza vaccine are helping to achieve this aim. 47, 48 There are still barriers to eff ective international cooperation and benefi t sharing despite the number of reports emphasising the importance of this key facet of pandemic preparedness. Substantial agreement exists across the public health community about how global collaboration should work, there is greater political acceptance of the value of such collaboration, but there are still barriers arising from commercial and academic drivers. China, with its direct experience of SARS and the economic and political consequences of not being ready to respond, has shown a good example by facing the economic challenges of H7N9. 31 The experience of Saudi Arabia with MERS-CoV highlights other barriers, such as ineff ective international collaboration and partnerships. 44 Despite a declared willingness to collaborate and share, and the publication of substantial epidemiological and microbiological information about early coronavirus cases and outbreaks, there appeared to be delays at times Series in sharing information between public health authorities before it was accepted for peer-reviewed publication, and in sharing clinical and viral samples for public health use without prejudice to subsequent commercial development of products derived from that material. Confl icts of interest that are barriers to trust will probably continue as long as academic and research organisations are judged primarily by their publication record or there is an associated commercial imperative. An urgent need exists for suffi cient global public health capacity that is free from these constraints to allow free and rapid sharing of information and samples. Politicians are beginning to understand the importance of tackling these issues. The Global Health Security Action Group (GHSAG) has initiated work to develop sample sharing protocols and arrangements that build on the WHO PIP Framework but that move on from infl uenza viruses to include any organism that might lead to a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC under the IHRs). The GHSAG initiative is initially intended to focus on sample sharing between the countries in the GHSAG but it will be open to other countries to use the GHSAG-agreed protocols for sharing, and these protocols should encourage and help with sharing without compromising the commercial rights of the sending countries and without prejudicing future benefi t sharing. 49 Specifi c capacity building activity could help to increase trust and engender a true spirit of global cooperation. The positive global experience gained from the development of the Supranational Reference Laboratory (SRL) Network for the surveillance of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis under the Stop TB partnership could serve as a template for the development of a more integrated global laboratory surveillance, diagnostic, and vaccine development and manufacture network working across a series of high priority EID pathogens. 50 The eventual aim of such an initiative would be to ensure that suffi cient numbers of biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) and BSL-3 (adapted for animals) reference laboratories exist in every WHO region to serve the needs of its member countries and peoples. 51 Benefi ts of a global network would include a greater capacity of regions to respond to local and international EID threats more quickly and effi ciently, and, importantly, to retain human resources and expertise within those regions. The latter could have an additional benefi t in aiding eff orts to curtail the brain drain of scientists and technical experts from low-to-middle income countries to more developed regions of the world.",22.1966683255919,9.731954779779004

First, although scholars agreed that while some issues, such as military conflicts and resulting domestic costs and war casualties, attracted intense public attention, public opinion was, in general, considered to be important only in so far it had electoral implications (Potter and Baum 2010; Price and Zaller 1993) . The public was assumed to be more easily manipulated on issues of wars and military crises abroad than on domestic issues, which affected them directly (Domke et al. 2006 ). The need for speed and secrecy in issues of war and military confrontation were often used as justification by policy makers for denying public engagement in foreign policy decision-making. The same rationale, however, cannot be used for policy making on an issue such as infectious diseases. On the contrary, on this issue policy makers consider an active, informed, and engaged public to be important, and public cooperation is actively sought. Infectious diseases are a major source of concern to people and government alike. They are potentially transferable from one person to the other and can cause death and disability, impose high health care costs, lead to loss of productivity, and thereby cause social and economic disruption (World Health Organization 2004) . Due to the transmissibility of infectious diseases and their direct impact on people, any public health intervention, support for surveillance, or policy decisions regarding funding, prevention, and control of global infectious diseases requires the active engagement of the American public. Secondly, on issues of war and military crisis, local actors, including the executive branch of the government, members of the Congress, interest groups, media, and often academia, have traditionally dominated the elite discourse. 3 Challenges arising out of the spread of infectious diseases, however, have put the focus on actors beyond the national states. Intergovernmental organizations such as the United Nations, the World Health Organization, and the World Bank have become increasingly prominent. Many organizations that transcend national boundaries, including multinational corporations, pharmaceutical companies, epistemic communities, and civic society organizations (e.g., Health Action International), have also enriched and participated in the debate on global and national health policies (Walt et al. 2004; Loewenson 2011) . To influence public opinion and enlist support for their proposed policies these organizations emphasize different dimensions of infectious diseases (e.g., human rights and economic and biomedical issues) and frame issues in ways that strategically emphasize their political positions (Nisbet and Lewenstein 2002) . On this issue, therefore, the public is exposed to frames espoused by domestic, transnational, and international organizations.",24.489928216197825,10.665889711837528

MMT is expanding, with backing from multiple government ministries, however, NSEP have received less political support and funding. Methods: Semi-structured, serial interviews were conducted with key informants, knowledgeable about China's harm reduction policies. Concurrent content analysis allowed for revision of the interview guide throughout the data collection process. This was combined with a systematic analysis of official government policy documents on NSEP and MMT, including white papers, legal documents, and policy statements. Findings: Early consensus between public security and public health sectors regarding methadone's dual use in HIV prevention as well as method of drug control created broad institutional support for MMT programmes amongst policy makers. In contrast, NSEP were seen as satisfying only the HIV prevention goals of the public health sector, and were perceived as condoning illicit drug use. Furthermore, NSEP's roots in China, as an experimental collaboration with international groups, created suspicion regarding its role in China's drug control policy. NSEP and MMT's distinct paths to policy development are reflected in the complex and occasionally contradictory nature of China's harm reduction strategy. Conclusions: These discrepancies highlight the need for a more politically sustainable and comprehensive integration of harm reduction projects.

In the event of a disaster, local government officials should take care of most of the functions except search and rescue, which consist of evacuation of dangerous areas, emergency recovery for damaged facilities, communication with bereaved families, and funeral support. However, a lack of expertise due to job rotation, insufficient education and training, and talented officials avoiding DRM tasks because they will be punished once a disaster occurs are key obstacles against strengthening disaster response capacity of local public officials.

The first phase involved the placement of high-performance, transport-capable ventilators within hospitals and emergency medical services across the state. The decision to place the ventilators with end users accomplished the goals of having the ventilators in the field where they would be readily available and maintained and could be utilized in day-to-day emergent interfacility and intrafacility transports. The supplemental oxygen component of the program provides low-flow oxygen within the community-based alternate care facilities that are supported by state legislation during mass casualty events and public health emergencies. Critical to this effort was state support and legislation as well as the effective use of sub-state public health regions to support planning and command and control response activities. Within the regions, coalitions supporting this effort included a core group of critical partners providing medical control and subject matter expertise and multiple supportive agencies and NGOs. Space included public schools, college facilities, community centers, and NGO facilities. Staff comprised community volunteer groups, the state Metropolitan Medical Response System (MMRS) team, hospitals, private practices, and other practitioners. Supplies included a combination of state-purchased equipment and supplies, with an emphasis on high-priority coordination with state and local vendors for oxygen equipment and supplies. Sustainability, the effective utilization of regionally based and local resources, appears to be an effective strategy for this important capability after a series of HSEEP-certified workshops and exercises across the thirteen regions of the state. 54 ",28.39366518616084,11.38620561665089

Consistent with IHR (2005), Greek reform reintroduced the communitarian foundations of control strategies, mandating restrictions of individual liberties when necessary for protecting public health. Disease control is consistently treated as public health protection and crafted to avoid undue impact on individuals. Thus Greek law aligns with public health provisions in the revised IHR, and in laws of France, Sweden, and other countries. [24] [25] [26] Disease control is not treated as a national security issue that would be reminiscent of the older policing approach. 27 Thus, Greek law embodies current understanding of effective public health practice with emphasis on public education and transparent procedures, not on punitive, coercive or stigmatizing ones that may drive epidemics 'underground'. 28, 29 Along with these amendments to align Greek law conceptually with EU and international legislation, the Ministry of Health drafted a national public health plan (2008) incorporating policies for meeting EU and IHR (2005) disease control objectives. However, Greek implementation has lagged; the pressing economic situation raises questions about whether the country will fully meet its obligations by the IHR (2005) deadline in 2012. Major legislative weaknesses stem from failing to follow up core infectious disease control law with supplementary legal and administrational regulations needed to guide implementation. Inconsistent and uncoordinated law making contributed to incomplete establishment of structures and procedures. Governmental change or emergence of new diseases exposed legal and administrative inadequacies, whereas consecutive reforms remade structures, policies, and procedures. Reforms have not thoughtfully integrated preexisting legislation, nor have obsolete or conflicting provisions regularly been removed. Thus, the existing body of pertinent law consists of fragmented requirements from numerous legal texts and different eras; these vary in content, applicability, and, possibly, legal validity.",21.14075281171235,8.376085355201178

The language of human rights is increasingly part of the landscape for health law in Australia and a See, for example, Public Health Act 1991 (NSW) s 23. internationally. [43] [44] [45] Given the potential for public health laws to impact upon the freedom of individuals, and the need for public health laws to balance the interests of individuals and society, public health laws will ideally have a transparent ethical framework, articulating the principles upon which state intervention will be premised. 46 The World Health Organization has acknowledged the importance of legal and ethical considerations to pandemic preparedness, noting that public health measures such as quarantine, compulsory vaccination and off-licence use of medicines 'need a legal framework to ensure transparent assessment and justification of the measures that are being considered, and to ensure coherence with international legislation (International Health Regulations)'. 47 Consideration of ethical issues is also essential for, as the World Health Organization has noted, ethical issues 'are part of the normative framework that is needed to assess the cultural acceptability of measures such as quarantine or selective vaccination of predefined risk groups'. 48 The exercise of state powers in terms of quarantine, isolation and detention during a public health emergency is likely to be particularly controversial in Western liberal democracies such as Australia. The extent to which the state can and should exercise its powers in this area has become increasingly relevant in public health, as is clear from debates over detention of tuberculosis patients, 49, 50 and from the use of quarantine during the SARS crisis. 51 Although comparable countries to Australia in Europe, the USA and Canada all have human rights charters or equivalents, which could provide procedural protections and safeguards for citizens in relation to quarantine and detention, Australia has yet to develop a Bill of Rights at the federal level. While Australian state and territory governments have begun enacting human rights legislation, 52 there is no comprehensive inclusion of human rights safeguards in the federal Quarantine Act, which raises issues about the mechanisms for ensuring procedural safeguards in the event of a pandemic. 53 Public health measures directed at implementing social distancing, quarantine or travel restrictions will not only infringe on individual liberties that are often taken for granted in Western societies, but are also likely to have a profound economic impact. As outlined above, estimates indicate that pandemic influenza will have a significant impact on the global economy. At local level, businesses may be closed or experience a reduction in their cash flow as public health measures are introduced or people stay home voluntarily. In such an environment, the economic cost to individuals and businesses may be significant, which in turn demands consideration of development of support systems and compensation systems for those affected. 54 In the USA, a great deal of work has been done on strengthening the public health laws, both generally and specifically for public health emergencies. The Turning Point Public Health Statute Modernization National Collaborative developed the Turning Point Model State Public Health Act. 55 In 2001, the Centre for Law and the Public's Health at Georgetown and Johns Hopkins Universities prepared a Model State Emergency Health Powers Act, setting out the powers for a state of public health emergency. The provisions of the earlier Model State Emergency Health Powers Act were adapted and included in the Turning Point Model Act. 56 Article V of the Turning Point Model Act deals with the powers of public health authorities, including the powers of quarantine and isolation. The Model Act provides that the principles to be applied in relation to quarantine and isolation include that they should be by the least restrictive means necessary to prevent the spread of disease (s 5-108[b](1)). In addition, there is a provision that:",27.021240558774124,10.575015247159001

First, there is a need for an understanding of the role of law in public health at state, national and international levels, and the need for jurisdictional clarity when differing levels of law and government intersect. These legal frameworks are important, for they define the scope of government responses to public health emergencies at local, national and international level.

If we are to assess the adequacy of our legal frameworks for pandemic preparedness, we also need to assess the adequacy of our laws in terms of their suitability for meeting our international obligations. While developed countries of the world already have sophisticated public health systems, the capacity to meet their obligations under the IHR (2005), and the financial resources to develop national vaccine stockpiles, the developing countries of the world face a very different outlook. 57 As we consider the intersections of law and public health in the context of the shared global risks of an influenza pandemic, it is important to realize that pandemic preparedness must necessarily involve improved international cooperation and the sharing of expertise to assist in capacity building for public health and the regulatory frameworks surrounding it, as well as a renewed dialogue around international obligations to help the world's poorest and least healthy people. 58 Legal analysis must be a key part of our planning for pandemic influenza.

(Table 2 ). In keeping with the guiding principles agreed by partners, all missions have been to support national health authorities and were initiated at the invitation or request of the affected WHO member state(s). The primary aim has been to provide rapid support for outbreak response. However, these missions have also influenced the development of local, national and international capacities and supported more long-term initiatives and relationships. More could be done to document and develop this contribution of GOARN partners. Alerts, requests for assistance, operational updates, offers of technical support and details of deployments (in clinical management, epidemiology, infection control, laboratory support, social mobilisation, risk communications and logistics) are posted on the GOARN SharePoint website, which also provides a mechanism to assist in communications between the operational support team and GOARN partners. Partner institutions able to respond to requests for assistance nominate expert staff members for deployment, based on a number of factors including expertise in the areas specified by the health authorities in the affected country and appropriate language skills. In most instances, the period of deployment varies between one and four weeks. Terms of reference for field missions and individual deployments are negotiated and agreed in advance with the responsible health authorities in affected countries and the framework. The number of deployments of WHO and non-WHO personnel and their fields of expertise are shown in Figure 2 . In the first years of GOARN operation, field missions were largely in response to outbreaks of disease in single countries, particularly outbreaks of VHF in African countries. These missions sometimes required significant numbers of deployments before the outbreak ended, as occurred during the 2000 outbreak of Ebola in Gulu, Uganda (Lamunu et al., 2004; Okware et al., 2002) .

The result is a loosely coordinated ''mosaic of hundreds of independently operating CERTs across the world.'' 32(p92) The CERT/CC is not a government agency, in contrast to the health departments that conduct most disease surveillance. Nor can it make or enforce rules. ''From the very beginning,'' according to one founder of the CERT/CC (interview October 2015), ''DARPA stressed . that we had no authority.'' Moreover, little capacity for cybersecurity was developed inside local, municipal, or state governments. Even now, fewer than half of local law enforcement agencies have a cybercrime unit. 33 Therefore, unlike other threats to public health and safety, the only recourse that most malware victims have is through a commercial service provider, such as an antivirus vendor like Symantec or McAfee.

The current pricing policies at airports do not provide the signals necessary to evaluate the need for capacity expansion or reduction. Barrett (2000) argues that there is no reason to assume that privatized airports are more likely to under-invest in infrastructure rather that this is more likely to occur under monopolistic regulatory conditions that restrict output below competitive levels, as indicated by the level of congestion that occurred under the traditional organization of airports prior to liberalization. However, Basso (2008) argues that social welfare maximizing public airports subject to a budget constraint are strictly preferable to unregulated profit maximizing private airports because the latter would overcharge for congestion leading to excessive traffic contractions. Martin and Socorro (2009) argue that a private, congested airport does not require price regulation provided the regulator ensures an appropriate capacity investment under which private and public objectives coincide. Cost plus regulation leads to over investment in either capacity or quality which leads to an unnecessarily expensive airport due to the spiraling regulated asset base cost issue. Since governments are frequently interested in stimulating economic activity, incentives may exist that encourage over investment (Forsyth, 2007) . Whilst cost based regulation may lead to over investment, incentive based regulation may lead to under investment in which case the regulator then needs to consider an investment incentive mechanism as a counter balance. Swelbar and Belobaba (2009) argue that the lack of infrastructure capacity at airports and air navigation service provision enroute are two of the most critical issues facing international and national air services today. Odoni (2009) argues that airport access is becoming the new form of market regulation that distorts the competitive outcome so sought after by many countries around the world. One of the major issues with regulation and optimal investment in airports lies in the mismatch between regulated price caps which are normally set every five years and the lifetime of an investment which may be closer to fifty. Privatized airports will be willing to invest only if they are reasonably sure that they will cover their investment costs. Carrier-served airports in the United States are defined as not-for-profits which allows them to receive infrastructure grants through the Airport Improvement Program but as the funds are drying up, taxes on passengers, i.e. the passenger facility charge added to airfares, and bond issues cover the remaining costs. Consequently, irrespective of airport ownership, the timing of capacity expansion will always be an issue unless the pricing policies change, permitting the market to signal the need for expansion through congestion and/or slot pricing mechanisms.",23.630353407123714,9.135327624897817

This argument can similarly be made for all neo-liberal trade policies in that the tenets of economic globalization, including decentralization, may lead to disempowered national governments (Coburn, 2000; Navarro & Shi, 2001) . Finally, in the current era of globalization, an increasing number of non-state actors (e.g., NGOs, private corporations, religious organizations) may influence health governance, thereby eroding national resources for addressing health issues (Dodgson et al., 2002) . Despite the increasing influences of these non-state actors in health decisions, the WHO focuses its efforts on working with Ministries of Health of sovereign member states. Neglecting to bring NGOs and private sector actors into negotiations results in a lost opportunity for valuable input (Dodgson et al., 2002) .",23.63218704705669,8.463205744284705

This, in turn, causes the activation of local DCs (as demonstrated by increased co-stimulatory molecule expression). These cells may then migrate to the local draining lymph node. Here, DC secretion of chemokines including CCL2 and CXCL10 cause an influx of cells including NK and T cells. The interaction of the DC and NK cells in the local lymph node triggers IFN-␥ secretion by the NK cells that results in an increase in Th1 cells specific for the co-administered protein.

This information is prepared for HCUP hospitals each year (Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project 2009b) and earlier years. The rate of hospital net income for privately insured patients (24 percent over cost) was taken from national data (Medpac, 2006, p. 100) . For Medicaid and self-pay, the experience of four large states with mandated hospital accounting reports was used (Friedman et al. 2004, p. 242) . The combined assumptions for the net income or profit percentage over cost were Medicare, 0 percent; private insurance, 24 percent; Medicaid, À19 percent; and self-pay and charity, À13 percent, respectively. These rates are net, after assigning all discounts, allowances, and subsidies to the relevant payers. Overview of Simulation. For each Census region and hospital type, we first estimated a potential reduction in usable bed capacity based on staff absenteeism. Then we calculated the percentage increase in new cases (demand) for the region. Then the proportional assignment of patients to a hospital was calculated based on its share of unused bed capacity plus elective admissions. That comprised the first-round assignment of patient encounters to hospitals. During the first round, some patients may not be placed in hospitals and some hospitals may reach their usable inpatient capacity limit. All unplaced patients from the first round were then assigned in a second round to those hospitals with remaining capacity. The series of assignments then proceeded iteratively until either all patients were placed, or all hospitals were at capacity with some patients unplaced. We assumed that if there were unplaced cases at the end, they would be cared for, but at alternative sites of care outside community hospitals. For each hospital, the payer and cost of influenza cases accepted, and elective cases postponed, determined the estimated short-term profit or loss impact of H1N1 for that hospital.

Even though globally many countries are grappling with common problems, such as increased health needs and demands for healthcare, alongside the rising costs of providing it, there is not one, simple international line of convergence towards a common form of health system. The reason is that health systems are shaped significantly by their centuries-old economic and political regimes. In addi-tion, they take their form from 'national logics', that is, how a society defines and deals with issues of health and illness. Equally, cultural factors influence how populations respond to proposed changes to their health system as well as how those external to a country relate to it. Even so, without undue risk of overgeneralisation, we can point towards a worldwide drive towards the commercialisation of health systems and, where public provision exists, such as in our case example of the UK, to the rollback of state or public provision in favour of the free market principles. Thus, most health systems around the world have or are moving towards a mix of public/private provision. With this point in mind, it has been argued that health services are now as much about investor potential as access to care for patients. Tritter and colleagues maintain that Health systems are no longer important primarily because they ensure that people gain access to health services when in need and irrespective of their ability to pay, that epidemics are prevented or controlled [...] or that the social determinants of health are addressed as part of public policies. In the emerging context of the reform policies, health systems are important not only as providers of products and services for which people are willing to pay, but also as an investment opportunity within global financial markets. (Tritter et al. 2010: 36) Although they manifest in different ways across health systems, we can point to a set of three shared global influences: neoliberalism (see also the discussions on neoliberalism in Chaps. 4 and 6) as the dominant politico-economic policy framework driving system change; macroeconomic policies and structural adjustment programmes (SAPs); and international trade agreements.",26.05146732485801,10.485533735104188

Therefore, regularbudget funds need to be forthcoming to strengthen the organisation's capacity to engage more actively in trade and health issues. Similarly, WHO has inadequate technical expertise to analyse and advocate on trade and health matters, and the management of these issues is often fragmented, which sometimes results in competition between programmes. WHO needs to shift eff orts from building their knowledge base to supporting member states to eff ectively participate in the governance of trade issues. Besides building analytical capacity within member states-which requires corresponding resources-WHO has to show political leadership in resisting powerful political and economic interests.

WHO's non-communicable diseases Global Action Plan incorporates the FCTC's provisions in its recommended actions. Updated appendix 3 calls on states parties to ""strengthen the effective implementation of the WHO FCTC and its protocols"", including by establishing ""national mechanisms for coordination of the WHO FCTC implementation as part of national strategy with specific mandate, responsibilities and resources"". 160 The action plan also invites member states that are not parties to the FCTC to ""consider implementing the measures set out in the WHO FCTC and its protocols, as the foundational instrument in global tobacco control"". 160 The FCTC provides a prime example of the interrelationship between international and domestic law, providing a precedent for future global health governance. The WHA in 1995 urged member states that had already successfully implemented all or most of a comprehensive strategy for tobacco control to provide assistance to WHO. 220 This aid would allow WHO to provide advice and support to other member states seeking to improve their tobacco control strategies. The following year, the WHA voted to begin work on developing a framework convention. A decade later, the FCTC entered into force. 221 The FCTC has had a substantial effect on global tobacco control, with its norms widely implemented at national and local levels. Particularly in high-income countries, a so-called suite of national and local laws and regulations has resulted in large declines in tobacco use. A combination of legal interventions all operate to reduce smoking in youth and adults, including lowering the legal age for buying tobacco products, marketing bans or restrictions, bans on smoking in public places, high taxation, and graphic packet warnings. For example, 111 of 181 FCTC states parties require pictorial warnings on cigarette packages, as recommended under Article 11. 222 Governments are now implementing major so-called endgame strategies, such as gradually increasing the legal smoking age, and vast reductions in the nicotine levels in cigarettes, which addict virtually all smokers. 223 However, the FCTC faces substantial compliance challenges, particularly in low-income and middleincome countries. For instance, Article 14 encourages countries to put in place tobacco cessation infrastructure but does not provide the resources to allow low-income and middle-income countries to do so. As of 2013, only a minority of countries had in place the infrastructure necessary to offer cessation support to tobacco users. 224 Furthermore, compliance and enforcement challenges are only made more difficult in the presence of aggressive opposition from vested commercial interests. 225 Ongoing monitoring, and strategies to strengthen the capacity of states to comply with their FCTC obligations, are two important ways to bolster the effect of this instrument.",26.88887183210292,11.155259257747366

Therefore, while there is acknowledged need for ICT in the coordination and monitoring of treatment, surveillance, response, education, and communication in health care, in reality there are significant barriers in the application of ICT that slow progress. These barriers are in no way restricted to the developing world. The United States and other more technologically advanced nations have their own sets of challenges. Cost, misalignment of incentives, resistance, an unskilled workforce, concerns about impact on productivity, lack of standards and interoperability, and other issues contribute to a poor level of healthcare ICT adoption in the industrialized world. 16 The digital divide has resulted in large segments of low income and/or other underserved groups being excluded from online health resources. 16 Economic hardships and difficult tradeoff decisions in the US healthcare industry have further inhibited healthcare information technology growth. 17 In developing nations, the problem of ICT uptake is even further compounded. A lack of local expertise and decades of well-meaning but non-sustainable ICT projects in the developing world have left a legacy of skepticism in their wake. Systems built for Westernized health care delivery often do not match the local context, resulting in a misalignment between need and technology. Poverty and illiteracy in developing nations stand as major barriers to the adoption and sustainability of information technologies, and many believe it is difficult to make the case for ICT when basic needs for survival are barely being met. 18 The ""e-health paradox,"" a term coined by Liaw and Humphries, refers to this seeming conundrum; populations that may have the most to gain from ICT in health are those who are thwarted in their use due to barriers of untrained personnel, poor infrastructure, and lack of resources. 19 Issues such as these have fueled technological apartheid and continue to subvert the delivery of knowledge to areas of the globe that most desperately need it.",26.35369536863342,9.087505356026702

Federal public health and legal authorities may specifically respond to multiple components of a bioterrorism attack, as well as offer guidance and expertise to assist state and local governments in their responses. Thus, responses to bioterrorism require sufficient legal powers at both the federal and state levels, in addition to a wellconceived plan for coordinating these powers to maximize public benefit.",32.64028163772825,11.836415962454689

In turn, this variation should expect to create unique ethical challenges and will therefore require novel ethical consideration. For instance, microbiological or immunological variations across infectious diseases with pandemic potential have distinct implications for an infectious disease's epidemiology and how the disease can and should be addressed through clinical medicine, public health surveillance and intervention, legal provisions, and so forth. Indeed, microbiological variations between infectious diseases can mean the difference between planning for a virus or bacterium, which has significant implications for transmissibility, pathogenicity, and immunity. An obvious example is the difference between airborne, waterborne, or direct-contact pathogens, which can each have considerable implications for which restrictive public health measures can and should be used to isolate and curb the spread of disease, in addition to the measures that should be considered necessary to protect the health and safety of health care practitioners such that they are not put at undue risk. Ethical issues and considerations associated with a pandemic involving directcontact transmission, for example, will not necessarily be adequately anticipated or addressed if the range of ethical issues considered in pandemic plans are circumscribed to those associated with an airborne influenza pandemic. Indeed, different ethical issues should be expected to arise between airborne (e.g., influenza) and direct-contact (e.g., HIV) pathogens, such as the amount of responsibility one must assume as both a potential transmitter and potential subject of transmission (Battin et al. 2008 ). Failing to anticipate potential ethical issues will render ethical guidance incomplete, which could mean the neglect of other important ethical values in decision-making.",28.050265280219637,11.203418476119094

Increasing the number of public-private partnerships that include commercial drug and biotechnology companies is one way to do this. A second approach is fairer regulation of international trade. The Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) agreement is designed to protect the rights of patent holders over knowledge systems or products including, for example, drugs.

As the name suggests, all-hazards planning seeks to prepare for many different types of hazards, including infectious disease pandemics, hurricanes, bioterrorist attacks, and myriad other threats to public health and safety. This shift from hazard-specific planning reflects a recognition that public health emergency preparedness and response can, at least to some extent, be installed and implemented in a uniform, yet adaptable, manner by establishing baseline capabilities (e.g., sheltering, evacuation) that must exist to effectively prepare for and respond to a multitude of hazards (United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2013). Thus, it seems that the focus on pandemic (influenza) planning has in some respects been expanded in scope through all-hazards planning. While this is a praiseworthy innovation for public health emergency preparedness and response, the all-hazards approach may prove too broad to adequately anticipate and critically evaluate the nuanced ethical considerations that will be required for robust ethical preparedness for pandemics beyond influenza. That is, while some baseline capabilities, like the capability of communities to shelter populations from all kinds of hazards, can plausibly be established due to the isomorphic relationship between the mitigation strategy (i.e., sheltering) and the common threat posed by many different hazards (i.e., the risk of harm if not sheltered), it seems less plausible that ethical considerations will function in the same manner. For instance, ethical justifications for setting priorities for the allocation of health care resources during a surge in health care need following an earthquake could differ dramatically from a surge stemming from an infectious disease pandemic due to the imperative to curb the spread of disease that exists in the latter but not the former. This necessitates careful analysis and deliberation about the appropriate ethical values and principles, in addition to the ethical reasons, justifications, and context for permissible application that should guide different preparedness and response activities. Some have argued that 'different types of hazards-epidemic, weather related, environmental, radiologic-present special circumstances for ethical decision making and reflection, but they do not require tailor-made ethical principles or goals' (Jennings and Arras 2008, pp. 8-9) ; however, as will be demonstrated in the next section, it is precisely the neglect of special circumstances for ethical decision-making and reflection that renders current pandemic plans, and also all-hazards approaches, illequipped to anticipate and facilitate the navigation of ethical issues in non-influenza pandemics.",24.268626064902026,9.315233454402206

Some examples of attributes that contribute to the public good include, but are not limited to, environmental quality, public safety, public infrastructure availability, and cultural diversity. Therefore, these attributes and services are believed to influence both the tourists' utility functions on the demand side and the tourism agents' production functions on the supply side (Rigall-I-Torrent and Fluvià, 2007) .

Building Global Partnerships. The building of public private partnerships is proving to be one of the most effective global strategies to address the needs of disadvantaged populations living in the midst of neglected diseases [31] that are no longer considered to be a priority in industrialized nations [32] [33] [34] . If established in a balanced manner, public-private partnerships can bring together the power, resources, and experience from both the industrialized and the developing world to create synergies, define priorities, and find solutions. There are many examples of successful public private partnerships that have pooled their resources and have coordinated global strategies to increase the availability of scarce and expensive medical interventions for those that need them most. For example, the Global Alliance to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GAELF) consists of a partnership between academic and research institutions, advocacy and resource mobilization partners, country representatives, international development agencies and foundations, international organizations, nongovernmental development organizations, and private sector companies [35] . This group retains a ""light governance structure"" that provides the flexibility to focus on specific needs at regional and national levels [35] . Several attempts at regional or international partnerships in rabies prevention and control have occurred throughout the 20th century. For example, once oral vaccination of wildlife became a reality during the 1980s, the World Health Organization (WHO) held multiple consultations involving its global network of WHO Collaborating Centers for Reference and Research on Rabies for an organized approach towards red fox rabies elimination in Western Europe. The breadth and longevity of several other partnerships, such as the Rabies in the Americas Association, Latin-America National Rabies Directors Network (REDIPRA), Southern and Eastern Africa Rabies Group (SEARG), Rabies in Asia Foundation (RIA), Asia Rabies Expert Bureau (AREB), Africa Rabies Expert Bureau (AFROREB), and the recently created Middle East and Central Eastern Europe Rabies Expert Bureau (MEEREB), all demonstrate the utility of coalitions in successful information flow and regional health promotion in bringing support to local scientific and public health communities worldwide. As consistently observed by all existing rabies networks, basic education of people exposed to the risk of infection, the appropriate training of human and animal health professionals, and necessary advocacy by local health decision makers, are major milestones towards global rabies control. The North American Rabies Management Team is another recent example of professionals in Canada, Mexico, and the United States working together, sharing surveillance data, prioritizing applied research needs, and cooperating across the continent, in training and technology transfer, which allows the implementation of human and animal rabies control programs, achieving a drastic decrease of rabies cases in this region of the world.",26.271762689818843,10.109953449472254

More timely information and networking among the ""helping hands"" could become the most driving factor. Challenges are related to the increased information overload, including the amount of unauthorized information which is information not officially confirmed by health officials, which might be addressed by technology, e.g., by including sophisticated filtering algorithms to prefilter the information before showing to the user.

These two national organizations, along with local 2-1-1s, worked with legislators to propose federal funding through the Calling for 2-1-1 Act. The Act would have provided substantial federal funds to support 2-1-1s throughout the U.S. Although the act was not passed, several 2-1-1s successfully received targeted congressional appropriations. 13 United Way Worldwide and AIRS have served as networks for information sharing about the costs and benefıts of 2-1-1, typically by equipping local 2-1-1 supporters who were in contact with their state and local policymakers. AIRS and United Way Worldwide publicized documents and toolkits with information about the service's costs and benefıts through e-mail discussion groups, at national conferences, and through personal communications.

Co-investments across sectors, or at least reinforcing ones, have practical value as well. Although typically applied to for-profit contexts, we can consider the process of innovative disruption, which circumvents incumbents to effectively provide an alternative that catches an underserved market or outperforms. Shifting a portion of global health investments from reactionary approaches to preventive capacity could support development of needed renewable technologies such as solar microgrids; building local capacity for installation and maintenance could reduce cost and technological barriers for uptake and use. Capitalizing on voluntary corporate collaboration may be highly fruitful; as of 2012, 1.6% of publically traded companies held more than half of the market value globally, representing enormously powerful interests; gaining their collaboration in sustainable investments could lead to new industry standards. 67 Finally, although a survey of company managers suggested only 27% view climate change as a business risk, 68 compelling industry losses are at stake from broader ecological changes. For example, outbreaks of Marburg virus in Eastern Africa, associated with human encroachment into wildlife habitat for natural resource extraction, prompted mine closures. 69 Adding health to routine environmental and social impact assessment processes for development projects can help identify and mitigate public health risks. There are many opportunities for engagement among those organizations already conscientious of the range of effects (positive and negative) that their investments may have. Multilateral development banks and bilateral aid agencies may be best positioned to lead here given their long histories undertaking impact assessments and diverse expertise, including health. These assessments might include assessment of health inequities of disease burden or disproportionate health-related financial impact to certain populationsdinfrastructure or systems resiliency can also be assessed and improved to reduce vulnerability of investments under climate change. Risks are also highly relevant to reinsurance companies, as their clients increasingly face climate-related losses that add to volatility of risk management. Reinsurer Swiss Re has articulated that the severity of flooding events will require public-private partnerships in addition to adaptation measures to tackle upcoming challenges.",33.093196447964054,13.451188214318394

The imperfectly implemented village elections law and the elections that have been held under the law allow much bounded participation, monitor potentially explosive peasant discontent, and strengthen the capacity of the regime.

During the early to mid-1990s, access to, and the quality of, some health services were impaired as a result of government budget cutbacks. As a consequence, public confidence in the system was eroded although most Canadians remained committed to the solidarity principles underlying Medicare (Romanow, 2002) . Since the late 1990s, both federal and provincial governments have been reinvesting in public health care in an effort to improve quality and reduce waiting time. This public reinvestment in health care has triggered concerns about the fiscal sustainability of Medicare. In reality, most of the cost drivers appear to be in the mixed and private categories of health services rather than Medicare services. In particular, the growth of private and public prescription drug plans has been in excess of double the rate in growth of hospital and physician expenditures. Despite this, most media and think tank commentators continue to focus on Medicare, occasionally suggesting alternatives to the current single-payer model of administration. These arguments were given considerable political support in a recent Supreme Court of Canada judgment. In the now famous Chaoulli case, the court concluded that the Quebec government's prohibition on private insurance for Medicare services violated the province's Charter of Rights in a situation in which a patient waits an unreasonable amount of time for elective surgery. While the decision is not likely to lead to private, multipayer insurance for Medicare services, it has fueled the ongoing debate concerning the appropriate divide between the public and the private sector in financing, administration, and delivery of health care in Canada.",24.517845177827898,7.88857831901562

Indeed, many of the issues that must be addressed for influenza are relevant to responses to other potentially widespread emerging infections (eg, SARS) and bioterrorism agents (eg, smallpox virus). 32 Figure. Configuration of working groups charged with planning for and oversight of responses to (1) bioterrorism events, (2) emerging infections such as SARS, and (3) pandemic influenza will, and likely must, vary from federal to state to local areas. At federal level, alignment of expertise and resources into dedicated groups that collaborate and have some overlap in membership at key agencies is likely most effective approach at this time. Configuration of state and large urban area working groups may vary depending on their specific population size and geographic characteristics, as well as expertise available in public and private sectors. At local level, those individuals from multiple public and private agencies who will need to work together in planning for and response to each of these types of events are largely the same, and types of issues they will be facing in each scenario would be highly similar, and, in many aspects, identical.

Second, the places that support tourism are also home to Alaskans; these same places are where residents live, work, play, and harvest resources for personal and commercial purposes. Third, Alaskans travel throughout the state and use the same visitor facilities as tourists. Fourth, tourism is locationspecific; it can be difficult to encourage in some places and almost impossible to stop or slow in others. Finally, no single entity can manage and direct tourism growth. In southeast Alaska, the Forest Service manages 80% of the land, and Native corporations, National Park Service, private owners, and the state (Department of Natural Resources manages tidelands) manage the remainder. Local governments control docks, shore facilities, entry portals, and main retail sites; however, they manage only small amounts of land under their jurisdictions.

For instance, FDA collaborates with HHS and other US government partners on a variety of MCM issues, such as international requests for MCMs. Through the Global Health Security Initiative (GHSI), FDA works with such partners to strengthen operational frameworks and build regulatory capacity for responding to global infectious disease threats through the sharing of MCMs and expertise (eg, on legal/regulatory approaches) across countries. 22 FDA also works closely with US and Canadian partners through the Beyond the Border Initiative, providing MCM expertise, and collaborates with WHO to help ensure rapid availability of needed medical products by assisting with prequalification of products for deployment to needed areas. 23 To enhance internal and interagency emergency coordination, FDA's Office of Crisis Management serves as FDA's focal point for coordinating emergency and crisis response activities involving FDA-regulated products and manages FDA's EOC, which is linked to the global EOC network through the HHS EOC. 24 In addition to helping to prevent epidemics in some situations, product approvals are often important for responses to public health emergencies when they are occurring. In the area of pandemic preparedness, FDA expanded the approval for use of an antiviral to treat children as young as 2 weeks of age. 17 Other public health threat product approvals include a botulism antitoxin (the first polyclonal antibody approved under the Animal Rule), an antibiotic for treatment of plague, an inhalational anthrax therapeutic (the first monoclonal antibody approved under the Animal Rule), and a next-generation portable ventilator. 17 As mentioned, FDA has special legal and regulatory authorities to help improve access to MCMs during public health emergencies. These include the EUA, other emergency use authorities under PAHPRA (eg, emergency dispensing of approved products), and Investigational New Drug Application (IND) or Investigational Device Exemption (IDE). In direct response to the emerging threats of MERS-CoV and the novel influenza A (H7N9) virus, FDA issued EUAs to facilitate access to new diagnostics to help detect the novel threats in the US and abroad. In response to the 2009-10 H1N1 influenza pandemic, FDA issued 22 EUAs for MCMs (ie, antiviral drugs, IVDs, and personal protective equipment) to counter the novel influenza strain during the response. FDA also has mechanisms to extend the expiration dating of certain properly stored MCMs based on scientific data. When appropriate, this can enable local, state, and federal stakeholders to use their stockpiled MCMs for a period of time beyond the labeled expiration date so as to be ready to respond rapidly during an emergency. 25 While MCM legal authorities can enhance FDA's capabilities to detect, prevent, and respond to health threats domestically, they can also help to address global health threats and facilitate the international sharing of MCMs. In appropriate cases, FDA can, for example, authorize a particular MCM to be used for US government personnel in other countries or by foreign laboratories. In other cases, the EUA or other FDA authorities have helped to inform approaches and planning efforts with global partners related to the sharing of MCMs with international partners during an emergency, or could potentially provide a certain level of assurance or information during a response about an MCM that is not yet approved but is needed for the emergency.",27.009302634641507,9.806967753694199

This group of dedicated responders answers the need to improve response time for emergencies, establish stronger long-standing relationships with governments and key partners, and reduce disruption to the continuity of response activities from staff turnover in the field. GRRT surge capacity comprises >400 CDC staff members from around the agency; the goal is to support an emergency response with up to 50 staff members on short notice. Nearly 40 of the surge staff members routinely respond to humanitarian emergencies and build public health capacity as part of their regular duties in ERRB. They provide expertise in nutrition, emergency preparedness, surveillance, mental health, reproductive health, water, sanitation, and hygiene. The remaining surge staff vary widely in technical, language, and leadership skills and experience levels. They were recruited from 15 CDC centers, field personnel staff with state and local health departments, and overseas offices. International experience of the surge staff is a median of 2 years (mean 5 years), totaling 1,577 years combined. More than half have emergency response experience and ≈13% report having expertise in >1 foreign language. The most common occupations are epidemiologist, health scientist, public health advisor, and health communicator; surge staff have experience in nearly 30 different occupational areas.",23.75337125116489,9.082552334555642

Secondary and primary sources also suggest that even formal national tasking of biosecurity threats may not be being clearly articulated and communicated to sub-national security personnel (state and local police, first responders and even the private sector), which results in further lost opportunities to create better understanding of potentially nationally significant biosecurity threats if tasking and coordination processes from the national to local levels are not working well.",26.521646377630514,11.599694078182795

As noted earlier, the sheer size of the US intelligence community makes coordination of intelligence efforts difficult. Similarly, further away from the core national security intelligence agencies, the size and diversity of law enforcement and other agencies that might have a role in collection or analyzing relevant intelligence on terrorism is large-making coordination difficult. If such coordination issues still exist for a top priority issue such as terrorism, they also exist and arguably more so for biosecurity related issues, which are less of a priority. Again some efforts have been made both from the collection and analytical perspective, particularly in the US to provide better coordination of biosecurity tasking. These efforts have occurred at the ODNI-the details of which are discussed in Chapters 4 and 5. However, interviews of senior intelligence leaders suggest that there needs to be better coordination of intelligence efforts across intelligence agencies in 'Five Eyes' countries-as well as better coordination of non-national security sources of intelligence such as scientific research/expertise and epidemiology intelligence. Further evidence is required though on how best 'Five Eyes' intelligence communities can improve intelligence coordination of biosecurity intelligence. However, given the absence of any major attack since Amerithrax, political masters remain largely disinterested in bio-threats and risks including overseeing better coordination of intelligence efforts in this area. They seem content to receive periodic intelligence on potential, emerging threats that may in some cases not have been produced by the intelligence community in a coordinated manner. This can result in the delivery to the decision-maker of a less comprehensively developed picture of a particular bio-threat/risk. It is not just the coordination processes or lack thereof that can result in poor tasking results for a decision-maker. It is also true in many cases, the complexities of bio-risks and threats are difficult for many decision-makers or even their advisors to understand. This results in either no tasking or vague requests that may not reflect actual or even potentially relevant bio-threats or risks. Intelligence agencies may find themselves unnecessarily going down rabbit holes wasting limited resources due to a decision-maker not understanding what they are tasking for. Though it might be easy to apportion blame to a decision-maker for no or inadequate tasking, the intelligence community also faces another key challenge in getting the 'tasking right' and that is the lack of knowledge about how to assess both bio-risks and threats. Better tasking and coordination of bio-threats and risks also rely on how risk and threat methodologies are being applied to the biosecurity context and whether these are sufficient in guiding tasking and coordination.",26.55611248116846,11.5125640824974

From a sociological perspective, Goffman (1974) argued that individuals cannot understand the world fully and struggle to interpret their life experiences and make sense of the world. As such, frames allow journalists to identify and classify information and, in turn, package information in an efficient way to relay such information to their audience; others have posited that media frames provide audiences with schemas for interpreting events (Entman, 1993; Gitlin, 1980) .

Significant medical school debt can drive new physicians away from the ID specialty and public health. Targeted loan repayment opportunities would allow more physicians to pursue these critical career paths. In July 2018, in a move supported by IDSA, the US House of Representative's Energy and Commerce Committee passed legislation that would authorize the CDC to provide loan repayment for those who serve in the Epidemic Intelligence Services (EIS). More than 85% of EIS officers continue serving in public health roles, and this proposal would significantly help make this career path more financially feasible for physicians. Such loan forgiveness opportunities could also be broadened to support ID physicians who work in public health at the federal, state, or local level and face similar challenges around compensation and medical student debt. Establish financial compensation for ID physicians who work in public service (eg, local, state, and federal public health agencies) or who do ID work that provides broader public health benefits (infection control and antimicrobial stewardship). Physicians who perform infection control and antimicrobial stewardship work should be compensated for these activities. As part of hospital accreditation, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) mandates that every participating facility have an active infection control program [37] . States could attach an accreditation process to such mandates that would formally document ID clinicians who oversee hospital infection control and antimicrobial stewardship committees, with loan forgiveness or other financial incentives attached to this accreditation. Ensure that ID physician compensation reflects public health value added. As a cognitive specialty, many of the clinical services ID physicians provide are billed under Evaluation and Management codes, which have not been reevaluated in more than 20 years. The CMS should update these codes to reflect the increasingly complex care provided in inpatient and outpatient settings. Public and private payers, healthcare systems, and hospitals should also provide appropriate compensation and protected time for nonclinical services that are crucial to public health, including infection prevention and control, antimicrobial stewardship, and bioemergency preparedness and response.

Effective respiratory hygiene in the ED is imperative to limit the spread of dangerous respiratory pathogens, including influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome, avian influenza, and bioterrorism agents, particularly given that these agents may not be immediately identifiable. Sustaining effective respiratory control measures is especially challenging in the ED because of patient crowding, inadequate staffing and resources, and ever-increasing numbers of immunocompromised patients. Threat of contagion exists not only for ED patients but also for visitors, health care workers, and inpatient populations. Potential physical sites for respiratory disease transmission extend from out-of-hospital care, to triage, waiting room, ED treatment area, and the hospital at large. This article presents a summary of the most current information available in the literature about respiratory hygiene in the ED, including administrative, patient, and legal issues. Wherever possible, specific recommendations and references to practical information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are provided. The ""Administrative Issues"" section describes coordination with public health departments, procedures for effective facility planning, and measures for health care worker protection (education, staffing optimization, and vaccination). The patient care section addresses the potentially infected ED patient, including emergency medical services concerns, triage planning, and patient transport. ""Legal Issues"" discusses the interplay between public safety and patient privacy.

Private health plans often have insurance coverage for vaccines. However, some children enrolled in private health plans do not have coverage for vaccines and are considered underinsured for immunization. 46 Finally, some studies have shown that health care provid-ers have concerns regarding the costs of purchasing and administering vaccines and their level of reimbursement from public and private insurers. 47 Providers must order and purchase many vaccines (e.g., influenza) months before they are administered, resulting in substantial capital outlay coupled with delayed reimbursement. 47 Recently, Freed et al. 48 conducted a survey exploring physicians' perspectives on reimbursement for childhood immunizations. Approximately one-half of the study respondents reported financial reasons and low profit margins from immunizations as factors affecting their purchase and administration of vaccines. These authors concluded that physicians who provide vaccines to children and adolescents are dissatisfied with third-party reimbursement levels and the increasing financial strain on their practices from immunizations. Thus, increasing vaccine prices, a greater number of vaccine doses, and declining provider reimbursement for these products appear to be factors constraining both patient and provider demand for these products.",24.872652040803956,10.994100238292996

These challenges and the attendant lessons learned were detailed in Learning from SARS: Renewal of public health in Canada -Report of the National Advisory Committee on SARS and Public Health (1) . Key among them were the need for better coordination of response actions taken by the multiple levels of government and the need for increased or renewed recognition of the public health threat posed by emerging or re-emerging infectious disease. Although the emergence of SARS was not predicted, an influenza pandemic was and still is considered inevitable in the context of public health emergency preparedness. As such, in an effort to formally recognise and widely share Federal/Provincial/ Territorial (FPT) coordinated planning, the Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan (CPIP) was first published in 2004, incorporating lessons learned from SARS. With an updated and evergreen CPIP released in 2006, Canada was much better prepared to respond to the 2009 emergence, spread and ensuing global pandemic of novel H1N1 influenza virus that originated in Mexico (2). Canada benefited from significant capacity-building investments, such as assuring access to a domestic pandemic vaccine and stockpiles of antiviral drugs. As it turned out, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic was not as severe as some of its predecessors. Hence, during and post-H1N1, national governments and the World Health Organization (WHO) recognized that a more flexible and adaptable response to future pandemics was needed to reflect local and regional circumstances (2). The Ebola virus disease outbreak that began in West Africa in late 2013 was not only a severe disease with high morbidity and mortality, it was also an epidemic of fear. This outbreak demonstrated the fatal impact of poor communications and the importance of accounting for local cultural beliefs and local leadership in the response. It was also a poignant example of the need to strengthen public health emergency response capacity in every country and to better coordinate rapid global response capacity, including research, if we are to protect others as well as ourselves (3, 4) .",25.07959908675171,9.625061211743514

This is where the twin demons of money and power raise their heads. Already, at the turn of the 1980s, A. Bartlett GIAMATTI 86 (1938 -1989) , who was then president of Yale University in the USA, commenting on American university policies, spoke of a ""ballet of antagonisms"" between, on the one hand, commercial companies that are interested in the rapid cost-effectiveness of any new therapeutic advance and, on the other hand, non-profit university laboratories. Recently, James J. DUDERSTADT 87 (b. 1973), emeritus President of the University of the Michigan, argued that the University is a ""counter-hierarchical"" organism. In fact, its members are free to carry out the research that pleases them and to think in the ways that they wish to think, in any case within an academic norm that considers itself as being free from the constraints dictated by private interest groups. Until recently, such behavior was considered as a sort of ethic which arose out of the University conscience and dignity. The crumbling away of this ethic in the final decades of the 20 th century coincided with the rise of biotechnologies and the large-scale filing of patents relating to molecular genetics techniques that could be applied to the manipulation of living beings, by researchers in the public sector. The intrusion of the American private sector into public research laboratories, in the form of collaborations with transfer of ""sensitive"" information from the public to the private, has become such a worrying problem that drastic control measures have had to be taken. Within this context, the American federal government, in February 2005, issued a certain number of prohibitions targeting the National Institutes of Health (NIH) of Bethesda, particularly with respect to the retribution of researchers for services rendered to industry 88 . These stands call for thought concerning the place that is currently held in Universities with respect to fundamental research. Without arguing against the efficacy of major research institutes, it is nevertheless necessary to remember the part played by the University in this domain. The University is not only the place where knowledge, both as it is now, in its current state of advancement, and as it has been, it is also the place where knowledge must be created by fundamental research.",33.763516572833126,13.875847241979859

This can be viewed within the context that private airports would implement more efficient congestion pricing and would have better incentives to invest in capacity. An early paper by Vasign and Haririan (1996) concluded that if privatisation could generate a positive change in social welfare then it should take place regardless of its complexity or political consensus. Zhang and Zhang (2003) compared the cases of a profit maximising private airport, a social welfare maximising public airport and a budget constrained public airport which they considered to be a more realistic case of a public airport. In comparison to both these public airport examples, private airports were shown to have higher prices and to invest later. However this paper did not take into account any possible distorting effects of economic regulation. This was overcome by Basso (2008) who used a model of vertical relations, between airports with different objectives and airlines, to examine how airport deregulation might affect airport prices and capacities and whether in fact regulation was needed. The paper concluded that the unregulated profit-maximising airports (i.e. the private airports) would overcharge for the congestion externality and these airports would induce comparatively large allocative inefficiencies. Martin and Socorro (2009) also compared prices of profit-maximising private airports and social welfare maximising public airports and questioned the need for regulation. They used game theory which considered three key different stages, namely the regulator defining the level of capacity, the airport operator setting the charges, and the airline choosing the number of flights taking into account the airport capacity and charges. It was shown that there was a level of capacity when private and social objectives coincided when price regulation was no longer needed and so in practical terms this could be used to determine which investments yielded regulation unnecessary.",33.133297315103434,10.406975427073158

In some cases, for example with a share flotation, airports face little in the way of continuing state governance conditions other than those faced by any commercial company. By contrast with other models, for example airport concessions or leases, a significant amount of public sector influence remains as in these cases only operation and not actually ownership is transferred to the private sector. These types of privatisations are popular in developing countries where there tends to be a strong need for major expansion and modernisation but lack of government resources. Alternatively governments can choose to only partially privatise the airportsagain stopping them from relinquishing all control to the private operators. It is evident from that only a minority of privatisations have involved total ownership being handed over to the private sector. In most cases, and particularly in continental Europe, partial privatisation has been the more popular option (ACI-Europe, 2010). Meanwhile in North America, there has been a reluctance to move away from the status quo with local public ownership remaining the norm in the United States (with only a very limited experiment of an Airport Privatization Pilot Program) and with a 'not-for-profit' governance model in Canada rather than more conventional privatisation (Federal Aviation Authority, 2010; Transport Canada, 2010). However a notable feature of the US system is that there has always been considerable reliance on the capital markets and bonds as a source of funding that is not a common situation for most publicly owned airports elsewhere.",24.481620329285832,9.908126430395056

Firstly, in spite of some uncertainties related to traffic growth in recent years, long-term growth is still expected and most airports do not have the capacity to cope with this. New infrastructure needs to be financed and there seems to be ever increasing pressure on public sector funding which was the traditional main source of funding. Secondly many airports have proved over the years that they are quite capable of being operated as commercial, self-sufficient businesses, particularly in response to a more demanding, deregulated and competitive airline industry. Thus the public service paradigm that views an airport as a public utility to satisfy the needs of airlines and passengers has been replaced with a commercial paradigm that views an airport as a business enterprise. So this 'commercialisation' of airports has further weakened the case for continued government support for airports.",26.45828257003115,9.510371919468444

Core capacities include the establishment of common laboratory standards, an effective surveillance system (based on disease, syndromic, or rumor reporting), and effective response capabilities (eg, contact tracing and monitoring through field epidemiology). For example, each member state has to ensure that it has the laboratory capacity to rapidly identify outbreaks; 1,6 to do so, provisions for technical support and extra resources for less-developed countries also are written into the revised IHR (2005). 1 The core response capacity requirements apply at all public health response levels-from local to intermediate to national. 9 Strengthening national public health capacities contributes to improving national and international readiness to detect, verify, investigate, and control disease outbreaks that have the potential to spread internationally. 7 Importantly, the revised IHR specify measures to prevent disease spread at designated points of entry. 6, 9 Operational and technologic communications and trust across countries are central tenets of regional surveillance networks. Moreover, each country's particular strengths can be leveraged across regional network partner nations. MECIDS and MBDS have acted as catalysts for the introduction and spread of new communications and laboratory technologies. For example, MBDS members are working with several international funding and technical partners to increase technical capacity for surveillance and disease control through computing; high-speed Internet access recently has been enhanced by the Trans-Eurasia Information Network 2 effort in Vietnam. When Vietnam lacked such Internet capacity in 2006, Thailand facilitated Vietnam's participation in the multinational videoconference on pandemic preparedness (organized by APEC Emerging Infections Network) by hosting the Vietnamese representatives at their videoconference center. As another example, tabletop exercises in individual MBDS countries and a regional MBDS exercise suggest that each country has unique strengths that can be considered for application across the region, such as electronic surveillance reporting in China; epidemiology training in Thailand; laboratory capacity in Thailand, China, and Vietnam; community surveillance in Cambodia; and government organization for national influenza preparedness in Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR) (Dr. Moe Ko Oo, MBDS Coordinator, personal communication, 2008).",24.69148149410567,9.751257466394588

Much as they intended to work in tacit support of governments handling a crisis event, they resisted the role of publicising the government agenda, and were wary of being exploited by either government or commercial interests. In particular, the more experienced medical reporters valued their independence and capacity for generating and maintaining discussions critical of government actions. (One commented drily, 'The media is not the public relations wing of the health department.') However, we note that despite this stated commitment, in practice, in crisis situations journalists are often either too much taken up with the outlook of those whose views they report or too busy to take a critical stance. See for example a critique of the reporting of air quality issues in the lower Manhattan district after 9 ⁄ 11. 22 In keeping with their strong commitment to their role as public informants, journalists were adamant that they would continue to work in a pandemic situation despite the dangers to themselves, although journalists with dependent family were more cautious.

Indeed, in evidence to a UK Parliamentary committee, David Fidler stated that:
Increasingly, the Gates Foundation is the first place people will pick up the phone to call; not the WHO. In fact, someone told me – and I do not know if this is true – that Bill Gates is now going to fly to Indonesia to help intervene in that controversy over virus sharing. Something has changed here.87
In federal states, the legal relationship between federal and local government may constitute rights as a risk in the public health emergency field. On the one hand, a strong states' rights tradition can hamper, or be used as an excuse by, federal government in developing particular national preparedness measures. On the other hand, however, where federal government seeks aggressively to assert its power and interfere with protected human rights, a tradition of strong states' rights could be a bulwark against such abuse.88",29.57185940195789,12.531729361289585

In addition, human rights needs to reflect on the emergence, from within its ranks, of the ‘human rights risk strategist’. Likosky, discussing public–private partnership infrastructure projects in different countries, highlights how governments and other organisations may aim to ‘advance human rights interests for their own ethical or strategic reasons’, and may therefore enter into negotiations and alliances with certain NGOs.97 Human rights ‘risk consultants’, drawn from legal and other backgrounds, may also be employed by governments and organisations, to offer expertise on particular projects and human rights campaigns. Looking specifically at the public health emergency context, it can be argued that WHO's new power under the IHR to use information about disease outbreaks provided by unofficial sources gives governments an added incentive to work with NGOs and this, in turn, gives NGOs increased influence. The end result is likely to be a mixture of human rights agendas, including—and this is the key point—human rights advocates adopting instrumentalist strategies and language (for example, urging the need to avoid ‘business risk’) in order to promote human rights protection.",29.530076657244514,11.908445674258601

WHO and the Government of the Republic of Korea concluded a basic agreement for the roles and responsibilities for the development of health services in the Republic of Korea on 1 September 1951. During the 1950s, WHO provided the Government with support on policy and technical issues, as well as capacity-building necessary to establish the foundation for a national public health system. During the 1960s and 1970s, WHO played a critical role in the advancement of health care in the Republic of Korea by supporting to a wide range of health programmes covering acute communicable diseases, leprosy, tuberculosis, malaria and parasites, maternal and child health, and environmental health. In 1962, WHO established a Country Liaison Office in Seoul and supported the training of public health workers through overseas fellowships and national training courses. During this period, the Republic of Korea began to contribute to global health including the activities of Korean experts in the WHO Secretariat and other developing countries, supplying dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) to Viet Nam, and establishing WHO collaborating center in Korea. Between 1980 and 1996, the Government of Republic of Korea gradually transformed itself from aid-recipient country to an emerging donor country. WHO also shifted its focus of support in the Republic of Korea from communicable diseases and maternal and child health programmes to emerging health issues such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), cancer and environmental pollution. WHO focused on piloting the district health-care system based on primary health care, and building the capacity of public health officials with scholarships to graduate schools of public health in the Republic of Korea. The Republic of Korea also expanded its support to WHO in terms of financial contributions and technical expertise. Several Korean experts in the field of medicine and nursing were deployed as WHO advisors to other Member states such as American Samoa, Papua New Guinea, Brunei Darussalam, and Kiribati to support the development of primary health-care services. From 1997 to 2016, the Republic of Korea made a transition from recipient to donor, and the WHO Office in the Republic of Korea was finally closed in 2012. However, the Republic of Korea has established a stronger cooperative relationship with WHO, becoming a member of the International Agency for Research on Cancer and signing on to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. WHO also continued the support in the selected areas including measles elimination, the development of a new tuberculosis control policy, the control of a Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak and facilitating the Republic of Korea's support to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The Republic of Korea's development allowed it to increase its financial contributions to WHO, establish the various WHO collaborating centers, and provide Korean experts to work with WHO. A growing number of WHO staff members from the Republic of Korea have worked at various levels of WHO including head-quarters, the Regional Office for the Western Pacific, and several WHO country offices (Cambodia, Fiji, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Mongolia, and Samoa).

A further complication is how actors often possess broad overlapping mandates that do not always align.

In addition, these institutions work through different policy forums that have different powers to influence state behaviour and are attended by different actors with different priorities (e.g., ministers of agriculture versus ministers of health). Cooperation and coordination under such circumstances is naturally challenging.23

Gostin et al. [9] argued that it becomes essential to develop a set of legal and ethical recommendations, especially when scientific evidence is not enough and public health action is urgently required as in the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). During the MERS outbreak in Korea, difficult choices between public health needs and the protection of individual rights, which include privacy, liberty, and freedom of movement, had to be made. Gostin et al. [9] proposed four ethical values: the precautionary principle, the least restrictive option, fairness, and transparency in decision making. It is unclear that these values were fully considered in the public health actions that were taken during the MERS outbreak in Korea. The Korean government strictly restricted the movement of 16 752 individuals who satisfied the operational definition of “close contacts with a MERS patient” within designated hospitals or their homes for the maximum incubation period regardless of whether they displayed MERS symptoms [1]. According to the WHO, there is no evidence that MERS can be transmitted before symptom development or in early symptomatic stages. Therefore the WHO does not recommend quarantine nor isolation of asymptomatic contacts during this period [10]. The urgent social demand for controlling the MERS outbreak overwhelmed the issue of legitimacy of the public health interventions taken by the government. Economic issues have also been raised regarding this restriction of movement. In this situation, the people who undertake the costs incurred by movement restriction are not the same people who benefit. In principle, if those who benefited were to compensate those who were made worse off, the outcome could have been considered an improvement (known as a “Kaldor–Hicks improvement”) [11]. For effective and fair implementation of public health measures against MERS or other transmissible infectious diseases that compromise individual rights, a reasonable compensation scheme for the victims, including for health care providers, should be designed to benefit those individuals and society overall.",29.997354113243134,11.478903845376013

Although there still are many unknown factors Tucker and Zilinskas think it “likely that, given the difficulty of anticipating and assessing the risks associated with synthetic organisms, synthetic biology will require a new approach to regulation that differs significantly from the NIH [National Institutes of Health] Guidelines on recombinant DNA [Deoxyribonucleic acid]” (Tucker and Zilinskas 2006, p. 19). Already in 2006 the United States synthetic biology community proposed some measures that can be seen as an addendum of existing guidelines (Maurer et al. 2006):Insist That All Commercial Gene Synthesis Houses Adopt Current Best Practice Screening Procedures.Create and Endorse New Watch-Lists To Improve Industry Screening Programs.Create a Confidential Hotline For Biosafety and Biosecurity Issues.Affirm Members’ Ethical Obligation to Investigate and Report Dangerous Behavior.Create a Community-Wide Clearinghouse for Identifying and Tracking Potential Biosafety/Biosecurity Issues.Endorse Biosecurity/Biosafety Research&Development Priorities.",13.669641417122177,7.095520183096033

First, a growing number of international personal and commercial contacts may contribute to a faster and more extensive spread of viruses around the world. Local epidemics can become national or even global epidemics. There are examples of sources for diseases (such as the malaria mosquito) that are spread to new regions (e.g. because of climatic changes or as a ‘stowaway’ in a plane or ship). Globalization also promotes the international contacts between scientists and researchers. Personal exchange, appointments abroad and international conferences have grown exponentially during the past decades. The advantages of this development are obvious. Science and technology flourish because of it. More people from more countries are able to contribute to science. But there is the other side that intentional or unintentional misuse is made of scientific results. In The Netherlands the example of the Pakistani nuclear scientist Dr. Khan is well known. He was from May 1972 to December 1975 working at an engineering firm based in Amsterdam and a subcontractor to the Uranium Enrichment Corporation (URENCO) specializing in the manufacture of nuclear equipment.

Rothstein & Talbott (2007) found that to make quarantine to be the most effective measure for limiting the spread of infection, compliance with quarantine regulations should be encouraged, that is, providing job security and income replacement. Wang et al. (2012) found that In the case of short reaction time, intra-population, such as patient isolation, are more effective than inter-population such as travel restrictions. Jefferson (2008) pandemic influenza (H1N1) and found those were effective to some extent. Rashid (2015) researched the public health policy of the 2009 pandemic influenza and concluded that the school closure, whether positive or passive, seemed to be moderately effective and acceptable in reducing the spread of influenza and delaying the peak of the epidemic, but it is related to high expenses of secondary school. Voluntary isolation and quarantine at home are also effective and acceptable measures, but it takes the risk of intra-household transmission from index cases to contacts. Workplace-related interventions, such as work closure and work at home, are also moderately effective and acceptable, but it may have negatively impact on economy. Internal mobility restriction is only effective when extremely high restrictions (50% of travel) are imposed and mass gatherings which happened within 10 days before the epidemic peak is likely to increase the risk of transmission of influenzas. Rothstein (2015) compared the effectiveness of public health policies to intervene with infectious diseases, among which quarantine is one of the most aggressive and controversial measures that public health officials can take when trying to control an outbreak. Serious legal and ethical concerns have been raised because of restrictions on the movement of potentially large numbers of people (Fidler et al., 2007) . During the SARS epidemic in 2003, quarantine was widely used in several Asian countries and Canada, and it played a role in ending the epidemic. Similarly, during the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, social distancing measures, including quarantine, had become a major containment strategy. The paradox of quarantine and other social distancing measures is that they may effectively resist the outbreak of disease, but the scope of application is too wide, leading to various social hazards, including economic disruption, physical isolation and even violence. Quarantine is the first public health tool to control infectious diseases and remains a legitimate and valuable public health strategy because it has a significant impact on civil liberties, economic activity and social cohesion, so officials must be extra careful about the possibility of abusing quarantine authority (Rothstein, 2015) .",17.128554789879725,6.409957752655528

As a result, if EID vaccine candidates are to be developed, continued private-public cooperation will be imperative, and novel approaches to engage and attract capital will be needed. While bond markets are capable of providing access to substantial amounts of capital to help vaccine development efforts, the resources available to the public sector have great potential as well (43) . In 2015, the U.S. spent $9,990 per person on healthcare (44) . If we assume that there are 300 million Americans, just 1.25% of this amount of spending would yield $37.46 billion dollars, greater than the projected $35.25 billion it would take to fund the entire EID portfolio of vaccines. While achieving such an allocation of funding would hardly be as simple as this calculation suggests, this thought experiment illustrates that encouraging the development of vaccines that protect against EIDs of pandemic potential is well within the means of the global public and private sector stakeholders, if there is public support and political will.
